john connolly bad men prologue they are not towers but giants they stand in the well from the navel down and stationed round its bank they mount guard on the final pit of hell dante alighieri inferno canto moloch dreams in the darkness of a virginia prison cell he stirs like an old demon goaded by memories of its lost humanity the dream presses upon him once more the first dream for in it lies his beginning and his end in the dream he is standing on the verge of a dense forest and a smell clings to his clothing the scent of animal fat and saltwater there is a weight at his right hand a musket its rough leather strap hanging almost to the ground on his belt there is a knife and a powder horn and a bag of shot the crossing was difficult for the sea was wild and the waves broke upon them with the force of a great hand they lost a man on the journey to the island drowned when one of the bark canoes capsized and a pair of muskets and a leather bag filled with powder and shot descended with him beneath the waves they cannot afford to lose weapons they are hunted men even as they are become hunters themselves this night it is the year of our lord moloch twisting on his bunk three centuries after the time of his dream drifts between sleeping and wakefulness for an instant before he is drawn back into this world of images once again slowly submerging sinking deeper and deeper like a man drowning in recollection for the dream is not new and its coming is by now expected when he lays his head upon the pillow and at last surrenders himself to its hold his heartbeat loud in his ears blood pumping and blood flowing he is aware in the brief moment that he breaks the surface of his uneasy rest that he has killed before and will kill again a conflation of reverie and reality occurs for moloch has slain in both dream and wakefulness although now the distinction between the two realms has grown indistinct this is a dream this is not a dream this is this was there is sand beneath his feet behind him the canoes have been drawn up onto the shore and there are men around him awaiting his command to move they are twelve in total he raises a hand to them and the whites follow him into the woods the indians breaking off and sprinting ahead of them one of them glances back at him and he sees that the natives face is pitted and scarred one ear missing a consequence of mutilation at the hands of his own people wabanaki a wabanaki mercenary an outcast the indian wears his skins with the hair turned inward in accordance with the demands of the winter season tanto says the native speaking the name of the god of ill will the foul weather the drowning perhaps even the fact that he is here in this place surrounded by hated white men all are ascribable to the actions of the bad god the wabanaki is called crow by the other men they do not know his tribal name although it is said that he was once a great man among his people the son of a chief a sagamore and that he would have become chief himself had he not been exiled by them moloch does not reply and the native follows his fellow scouts into the woods without another word later when he awakes moloch will wonder once more at how he knows these things for the dream has been coming more frequently in recent months and in ever greater detail he knows that he does not trust the indians there are three of them the wabanaki and two mikmaq with a price on their heads back at fort anne vicious men who have pledged themselves to him in return for alcohol and weapons and the promise of rape they are useful for now but he feels uneasy around them they are despised by their own people and they are intelligent enough to realize that the men to whom they have attached themselves despise them too in his dream moloch decides that they will have to be killed after their work here is done from the trees ahead comes the sound of a brief scuffle and moments later the wabanaki mercenary emerges there is a boy in his arms no more than fifteen years of age he is struggling against his captors grasp his cries stifled by the natives large hand his feet kick impotently at the air one of the mikmaq follows holding the boys musket he has been apprehended before he can fire off a warning shot moloch approaches and the boy stops kicking as he recognizes the face before him he shakes his head and tries to utter words the native releases his hand from the boys mouth but keeps a knife pressed to his throat so that he does not cry out his tongue freed the boy finds that he has nothing to say for there is nothing that can be said no words can prevent what is about to occur instead his breath plumes whitely in the cold night air as if his essence were already departing his body his soul fleeing the pain of what his physical being is about to endure moloch reaches out and grips the boys face in his hands robert littlejohn he says did they tell you to keep watch for me robert littlejohn does not respond moloch can feel him trembling beneath his hand he is surprised that they have maintained even this level of vigilance for so long after all it has been many months since his enforced departure it strikes moloch that they must fear him a great deal still they must think themselves safe if they leave only a child to watch the western approaches to sanctuary he eases his grip on the boys skin and caresses it gently with his fingertips you are a brave boy robert he stands and nods at the indian and the wabanaki draws the knife across the boys throat gripping him by the hair to pull his head back so that the blade will have easier passage moloch steps back to avoid the arterial spray but continues to stare into the boys eyes as the life leaves them in his dream moloch is disappointed by the nature of the boys passing there is no fear in his eyes although the boy must surely have been terrified during his last seconds on this earth instead moloch sees only a promise unspoken and yet to be fulfilled when the boy is dead the wabanaki carries him to the rocks above the beach and casts him into the sea his body sinks from view we move on says moloch they ascend to the forest their footfalls carefully placed avoiding fallen branches that might snap loudly and alert the dogs it is bitterly cold and snow begins to fall driven into their faces by the harsh wind but moloch knows this place even without the scouts to guide him ahead of them a mikmaq raises his hand and the party halts of the other natives there is no sign silently moloch creeps up to the guides side he points straight ahead moloch can see nothing for a time until the tobacco glows briefly red as the sentry takes a long draw a shadow grows behind him and the mans body arcs against the hilt of the knife the pipe falls to the ground shedding red ash on the dirt and dying with a hiss upon the newly fallen snow suddenly the barking begins and one of the settlers beasts more wolf than hound breaks through a patch of scrub and bears down upon a figure to molochs left it leaps and then there is a gunshot and the dog bucks and twists in midair dying with a yelp and falling on a patch of stony ground now the men are emerging from the cover of the woods and there are voices calling and women shouting and children crying moloch raises his musket at a settler who appears as a silhouette in the doorway of one of the cabins the dying embers of the fire within making him an easy target it is alden stanley a fisherman like the savior he so adores moloch pulls the trigger and alden stanley is briefly lost in a cloud of sparks and smoke when it clears moloch glimpses stanleys feet twitching in the open doorway until finally they grow still he sees more knives appear and shorthandled axes are drawn as his men move in for closequarters combat but there is little fight in these people they have been caught unawares convinced of their safety in this remote place content with only a single sleepy guard and a boy on a rock and the men are upon them before they even have a chance to load their weapons the settlers outnumber their attackers by three to one but that will make no difference to the outcome already they are beaten soon his men will pick their victims from among the surviving women and young girls before they too are dispatched moloch sees one man barone already in pursuit of a little girl of five or six with pretty blond hair she is wearing a loose ivory gown its folds hang like wings from her raised arms moloch knows her name as he watches barone catches her by the hair and pulls her to him even in his dream moloch feels no urge to intervene a woman is running making for the interior and he moves off in pursuit of her she is easy to track her progress noisy until the stones and roots begin to take their toll on her bare feet tearing at her soles and heels and slowing her down he moves ahead of her and cuts into her path so that she is still looking back toward the slaughter when he emerges from his cover the pale light filtering through the branches casting his shadow across her features and when she sees him her fear increases but he recognizes the anger there too and the hatred you she says you brought them here his right hand lashes out catching her across the face and sending her sprawling on the ground there is blood on her mouth as she tries to rise then he is on top of her pushing her nightdress up over her thighs and belly she strikes at him with her fists but he throws aside his gun and holds her arms over her head with his left hand his right hand fumbles at his belt and she hears the sound of steel upon leather as the knife is unsheathed i told you id return he whispers i told you id be back then he leans in closer to her his mouth almost touching her lips know me wife in the moonlight the blade flashes and in his dream moloch begins his work so moloch sleeps believing that he dreams and far to the north on the island of his visions sylvie lauter opens her eyes it is january centuries after the events of which moloch dreams and the world is skewed it rests at an angle as if the physical reality has somehow come to resemble her own perception of it it has always appeared canted to her in a way always offkilter she has never quite fit into it at school she has found a place with the other outcasts the ones with the dyed hair and downcast eyes they give her some sense of belonging even as they reject the concept of belonging as somehow unsound none of them belongs the world will not have them but now that world is altered trees grow diagonally and a doorway has opened to reveal the night sky she reaches out to touch it but her view is obscured by a spiders web she tries to focus and sees the starburst shatter in the glass she blinks there is blood on her fingers and blood on her face and then the pain comes there is a great pressure on her legs and a terrible ache in her chest to breathe is to be constricted by nails she attempts to swallow and tastes copper on her tongue with her right hand she wipes the blood from her eyes and clears her vision the hood of the car is crumpled inward wrapped around the trunk of the oak tree in a twisted embrace her legs are lost amid the wreckage of the dashboard and the workings of the engine she remembers the moment when the car veered out of control on the slope the night rewinds for her the crash itself is a jumble of sights and noises she recalls feeling strangely calm as the car struck a great shard of sloping concrete the front lifting as the passenger side of the vehicle left the ground she remembers branches and green leaves filling the windshield the dull sound of the impact a grunt from wayne that reminded her of the sound he makes when he is puzzled which is often or when he climaxes which is often too now rewind again and she and wayne are on the edge of the manmade slope the former site of the old gun emplacements and army bunkers ready to freewheel down the incline now she is breaking into the garage and watching wayne steal the car now she is on her back upon a mattress and wayne is making love to her he makes love badly but still he is her wayne wayne she turns to her left and calls his name but no sound comes she again forms the word with her lips and manages a whisper wayne wayne is dead his eyes are half closed staring lazily at her there is blood around his mouth and the steering column is lost in his chest wayne she begins to cry when she opens her eyes there are lights before her help she thinks help is coming the lights hover around the windshield and the damaged hood the interior of the car glows with a diffused illumination as one of them passes overhead and she wonders at how they can move in that way help me she says a single light draws closer nearing the open window to her right and she can at last see the form behind it the shape is hunched and cloaked with leaves and wood and mud and darkness it smells of damp earth it lifts its head to her and in the strange halflight that filters from the lamp in its hand sylvie registers gray skin and dark eyes like oil bubbles and torn bloodless lips and knows that she is soon to join wayne that they will travel together into the world beyond this one and that at last she will find a place where she fits into the great pattern that has remained hidden from her for so long she is not yet frightened she simply wants the pain to end please she says to the dead woman at the windshield but the woman retreats and sylvie has a sense that she is afraid that there is something here that even the dead fear the other lights also begin to recede and sylvie extends an imploring hand dont go she says dont leave me alone but she is not alone a hissing sound comes from close by and a figure floats beside her at the other side of the glass it is smaller than the woman and it holds no light in its hands its hair is white in the moonlight and is so long and bedraggled that it almost entirely covers its face it moves nearer as sylvie feels a wave of tiredness wash over her she hears herself moan her mouth opens as she tries to speak and she no longer has the strength to close it again the figure at the window presses itself against the car its hands with their small gray fingers clutch the top of the glass trying to force it farther down sylvies vision is dimmed once more obscured by blood and tears but she can see that it is a little girl who is trying to enter the car to join her in her agony honey sylvie whispers sylvie tries to move and the pain surges through her with the force of a jolt of electricity it hurts her to turn her head to the right so she can see the girl only from the corner of her eye momentarily sylvies mind clears if she can feel pain then she is still alive if she is alive then there is hope all else is just the imaginings of a mind driven to the edge by trauma and distress the woman with the light was not dead the child is not floating in the air sylvie feels something brush against her cheek it hovers before her eyes and its wings make a dull clicking noise as it strikes the windows and roof of the car it is a gray moth there are others nearby she senses them on her skin and in her hair honey she says haltingly her hand striking feebly at the insects get help go get your mommy or your daddy tell them the lady needs help her eyes flutter closed sylvie is fading now she is dying she was mistaken there is no hope but the child does not leave instead she leans into the car forcing her body through the narrow gap between the window and the door head first then shoulders the hissing grows louder sylvie feels a coldness at her brow brushing across her cheeks coming at last to rest upon her lips there are more moths now the sound of them louder and louder in her ears like a scattering of applause the child is bringing them they are somehow a part of her the coldness against her mouth grows in intensity sylvie opens her eyes and the childs face is near her own her hand stroking sylvies forehead no and then fingers begin to probe at her lips pushing against her teeth and she can feel old skin crumbling like dust against her tongue sylvie thinks instinctively of the moths of how one of the insects might feel in her mouth the fingers are deep inside her touching probing gripping trying desperately to get at the warmth of her the life within she struggles against them and tries to scream but the thin hand muffles her voice the childs face is close to her own now but there is still no detail it is a blur a painting left out in the rain the shades running blending into one another only the eyes remain clear black and hungry jealous of life the hand withdraws and now the childs mouth is against her own forcing it open with her tongue and teeth and sylvie tastes earth and dead leaves and dark filthy water she tries to push the child away and feels the old bones beneath the cloak of vegetation and rough rotted clothing now it is as if her last energies are being drawn from her by the phantom child a dying girl being preyed upon by a dead girl a gray girl the child is hungry so very hungry sylvie digs her hands into the childs scalp and her nails rake across her hair and skin she tries to force her away but the child is gripping her neck holding her mouth against her own she sees other vague shapes crowding behind their lights gathering drawn by the intensity of the gray girls hunger although they do not share her appetites and are still kept back by their fear of her then suddenly the childs mouth is no longer against hers and the feel of the bones is gone the lights are departing and other lights are replacing them these harsher than before shedding true illumination a man approaches her and she thinks that she recognizes him from somewhere he speaks her name sylvie sylvie she hears sirens approaching stay she whispers she takes hold of his arm and draws him to her stay she repeats theyll come back who he says the dead ones she says the little girl she tries to spit the taste of the child from her mouth and dust and blood dribble onto her chin she begins to shake and the man tries to hold her and comfort her but she will not be comforted they were dead she says but they had lights why do the dead need light and the world turns to darkness and she is finally given the answer that she seeks the waves break on the shores of the island most of the houses are dark no cars move on island avenue the communitys main street later when morning comes the postmaster larry amerling will be at his desk waiting for the mail boat to bring the first delivery of the day sam tucker will open the casco bay market and lay out the days baking of doughnuts and croissants and pastries he will fill the coffee urns and greet by name those who drop in to fill up their travel cups before they take the ferry into portland later nancy and linda tooker will open up the dutch diner for its traditional seven hours of businessseven until two seven days a weekand those who can afford a more leisurely approach to life will wander down for breakfast and a little gossip eating scrambled eggs and bacon as they look out of the windows and onto the little landing where archie thorsons ferry arrives and departs with reasonable regularity and slightly less reasonable punctuality as midday comes jeb burris will transfer his attentions from the black duck motel to the rudder bar although in winter neither business places great demands upon his time thursday to saturday good eats the islands sole restaurant opens for dinner and dale zimmer the chef and owner will be down at the landing negotiating prices for lobster and fish trucks will leave jaffe construction the islands biggest employer with a total of twenty employees to deal with covey jaffes current slate of jobs ranging from house construction to boat repair covey being a man who prides himself on the flexibility of his workforce this being early january school is still out so dutch island elementary remains closed and the older kids will not be taking up space on the ferry to the mainland schools instead some of them will be thinking up new ways to make mischief new places in which to smoke pot and screw preferably far from the eyes of their parents or the police most will not yet know of the deaths of wayne cady and sylvie lauter and when they learn of the accident the next morning and its impact sinks in there may be fears of reprisals from the adult community in the form of parental constraints and increased police vigilance but in the first moments there will be only shock and tears boys will remember how they lusted after sylvie lauter and girls will recall with something like affection wayne cadys adolescent fumblings bottles will be raised in secret and young men and women will make their pilgrimages to the cady and lauter houses standing in embarrassed silence as their elders hug one another in open grief but for now the only light that burns on island avenue with the exception of the islands twelve count em street lamps can be found in the dutch island municipal building home to the fire department the library and the police department a man sits slumped in a chair in the small office that constitutes the home of dutch islands police force his name is sherman lockwood and he is one of the policemen from portland on permanent roster for island duty he still has sylvie lauters blood on his hands and his uniform and glass from the shattered windshield of the car is caught in the treads of his boots a cup of coffee lies cold before him he wants to cry but he will hold it inside until he returns to the mainland where he will awaken his stillsleeping wife by pressing his face to her skin and holding her tightly as the sobs shudder through him he has a daughter sylvie lauters age and his greatest nightmare is that someday he may be forced to look upon her as he looked upon sylvie this night the promise that her life held now given the lie by her death he holds out his hand and the light from the desk lamp shows up the blood still caught beneath his nails and in the wrinkles of his knuckles he could go back to the bathroom and try to remove the last traces of her but the porcelain sink is speckled with red and he thinks that if he looks upon those marks he will lose control of himself and so sherman balls his hands into fists eases them into the pockets of his jacket and tries to stop his body from trembling through the window sherman can see a great shape silhouetted against the stars it is the figure of a man a man perhaps eighteen inches taller than he is a man immeasurably stronger and immeasurably sadder than sherman sherman is not a native of dutch island he was born and raised in biddeford a little south of portland and he and his wife still live there along with their two children the loss of sylvie lauter and her boyfriend wayne is terrible and painful to him but he has not watched them grow as the man beyond the window has sherman is not a part of this tightly knit community he is an outsider and it will always be this way and yet the giant too is an outsider his great bulk his awkwardness the memories of too many taunts delivered too many whispers endured have made him one he was born here and he will die here without ever truly believing that he belongs sherman decides that he will join the giant in a moment not just yet though not just yet the giants head is slightly raised as if he can still hear the sound of the portland fire department boat departing taking the bodies of sylvie and wayne back to the mainland for autopsy in a couple of days time the islanders will gather at the main cemetery to watch the coffins as they are lowered silently into the ground sylvie and wayne will be buried close by each other after a joint service out of the islands little baptist church much of the entire winter population will gather along with media and relatives and friends from the mainland five hundred people will walk from the church to the cemetery and afterward there will be coffee and sandwiches at the american legion post with maybe something a little stronger for those who need it most and the giant will be among the mourners and he will grieve with them and he will wonder for he has been told the girls last words and he feels unaccountably afraid the dead ones they were dead but they had lights why do the dead need light but for now the island is quiet once again it is dutch island on the maps a tiny oval oneandahalfhours ferry ride from portland far out in casco bay on the margin of the outer ring of islands it is dutch island to those who have only recently come here to live for the island has attracted its share of new residents who no longer wish to stay or can no longer afford to stay on the mainland it is dutch island to the reporters who will cover the funeral dutch island to the legislators who will determine its future dutch island to the real estate salesmen driving up property prices and dutch island to the summer visitors who come to its shores each year for a day a week a month without ever really understanding its true nature but others still speak of it by its old name the name the first settlers the people of molochs dream gave to it before they were slaughtered they called it sanctuary and the island is still sanctuary to larry amerling and sam tucker and old thorson and a handful of others but usually only when they speak of it among themselves and they say its name with a kind of reverence and perhaps just a hint of fear it is sanctuary to the giant too for his father told him of its history just as his father told it to him and similarly back and back again far into the lost generations of the giants family few outsiders know this but the giant owns whole sections of the island bought by his family when nobody wanted to own this land when even the state was turning down the opportunity to buy islands in casco bay their stewardship of the land is one of the reasons the island remains unspoiled and why its heritage is so diligently protected its memories so carefully stored the giant knows that the island is special and so he calls it sanctuary like all those who recognize their duty toward this place and perhaps it is still sanctuary also to the young boy who stands amid the breaking waves at pine cove staring out to sea he does not appear to heed the cold and the force of the waves does not make him rock back on his heels when they break nor threaten to suck his feet from their anchorage beneath the surface his clothes are rough cotton apart from the heavy cowhide jacket that his mother made for him handstitching it by the fire while he watched patiently day after day the boys face is very pale and his eyes are dark and empty he feels as though he has awakened from a long sleep he brushes his fingers gently against the bruises on his face where the grip of the man left its imprint upon him then touches the memory of the wound on his throat left by the passage of the knife his fingertips are heavily grooved as if by time spent in the water for the boy as for the island there is no past there is only the eternal present he looks behind him and sees movement in the forest the shapes drifting among the trees their wait is almost over just as his unspoken promise is about to be fulfilled he turns back to the sea and resumes his unblinking watch upon the waiting world beyond the first day they asked again what was my name they asked again what was my name and two were dead before they could move two were dead before they could move i said thats my name thats my name if you please outlaw song traditional chapter one the giant knelt down and watched the gulls beak open and close the birds neck was twisted at an unnatural angle and in its single visible eye he saw himself reflected and distorted his brow shrunken his nose huge and bulging his mouth tiny and lost in the folds of his chin he hung suspended in the blackness of the birds pupil a pale moon pendent in a dark starless sky and his pain and that of the gull were one a dry beech leaf fell from a branch above and performed joyful cartwheels across the grass tumbling tip over stem as the wind carried it away almost touching the gulls feathers as it passed the bird lost in its agony paid it no heed above its head the giants hand hovered the promise of mortality and mercy in its grasp whats wrong with it said the boy he had just turned six and had been living on the island for almost a year in all that time he had yet to see a dying animal until now its neck is broken said the giant the wind rolling in off the atlantic tousled his hair and flattened his jacket against his back within sight of where he squatted the eastern shore of the island began its steep descent to the ocean there were rocks down there but no beach the old painter giacomelli kept a boat in the shelter of a glade close by the shore although he used it only occasionally in the summer when the sea was calmer he could sometimes be seen out on the water a line trailing from the boat the giant wasnt sure if giacomelli or jack as most islanders called him ever caught anything but then he guessed that catching things wasnt the point for jack the painter rarely even bothered to bait the hooks and if a fish was foolish enough to impale itself on a barb jack would usually unhook it and cast it back into the sea assuming he even noticed the tug on the line fishing was merely his alibi an excuse to take the boat out on the waves the old man was always making sketches while the line dangled unthreateningly his hand working quickly with charcoals as he added another perspective to his seemingly endless series of representations of the landscape there werent too many people living over on this side of the island it was too exposed for some sheep sorrel horseweed and highbush blackberry colonized patches of waste or open ground but mostly it was just trees the islands forest petering out as it drew closer to the cliffs in fact this was maybe the closest thing to a concentration of houses over on the eastern shore the boy and his mother in one jack in another bonnie claeson just over the rise to the north and a sprinkling of others within reasonable walking distance the view was good though as long as one didnt mind looking at empty sea the boys voice called him back can you help it can you make it better no said the giant he wondered how the bird had ended up here lying in the middle of a patch of lawn with its neck broken he thought he saw its open beak move feebly and its tiny tongue flick at the grass it might have been attacked by an animal or another bird although there were no marks upon it the giant looked around but could see no other signs of life no gulls glided there were no starlings no chickadees there was only this single dying gull alone of its kind the boy knelt down and stretched out a finger to prod the bird but the giants hand caught it before it could make contact engulfing it in his palm dont do that he said the boy looked at him there was no pity in his face thought the giant there was only curiosity but if there was not pity then neither was there understanding the boy was just too young to understand and that was why the giant loved him why said the boy why cant i touch it because it is in pain and you will only increase that pain by touching it the boy considered this can you make the pain go away yes said the giant then do it the giant reached down with both hands placing his left hand like a shell above the body of the gull and the thumb and forefinger of his right hand at either side of its neck i think maybe you should look away he told the boy the boy shook his head instead his eyes were focused on the giants hands and the soft warm body of the bird enclosed within their ambit i have to do this said the giant his thumb and forefinger moved in unison gripping the birds neck and simultaneously pulling and twisting the gulls head was wrenched one hundred and eighty degrees and its pain was brought to an end instantly the boy began to cry what did you do he wailed what did you do the giant rose and made as if to grip the boys shoulder but the boy backed away from him fearful now of the power in those great hands i put it out of its misery said the giant he was already realizing his mistake in euthanizing the bird while the boy was watching but he had no experience in dealing with one so young it was the only thing that i could do no you killed it you killed it the giants hand retreated yes he said i did it was in pain and it could not be saved sometimes all that you can do is take away the pain but the boy was already running back to the house back to his mother and the wind carried his cries to the giant as he stood on their neatly trimmed lawn gently he cupped the dead gull in his right hand and carried it away to the treeline where he dug a small hole with the edge of a stone and covered the little thing in earth and leaves placing the stone at last upon the mound when he rose again the boys mother was walking toward him across the lawn the boy clinging to her shielded by her body i didnt know you were out here she said she was trying to smile both embarrassed and alarmed by her sons distress i was passing said the giant i thought id drop in see how you were then i saw danny crouching on the grass and went over to see what was the matter there was a gull a dying gull i the boy interrupted what did you do with it his cheeks were streaked with the marks of his tears and his grubbyfingered efforts to wipe them away the giant looked down upon him i buried it he said over there i marked the place with a stone the boy released his hold upon his mother and walked toward the trees his eyes grave with suspicion as if he were convinced that the giant had somehow spirited the bird away for his own dark ends when his eyes found the stone he stood before the gulls resting place his hands hanging loosely by his sides with the tip of his right foot he tested the earth half hoping to reveal a small swath of feathers darkened with dirt now like a discarded wedding gown but the giant had buried the bird deep and no trace of it was made visible to him it couldnt be saved asked his mother no said the giant its neck was broken she spotted the boy and saw what he was doing danny come away from there he walked back to her still refusing to look the giant in the eye until he was once again by his mothers side her arm gripped the shoulder of the boy and she pulled him closer to her there was nothing anybody could do danny the bird was sick joe did the right thing then in a whisper to the giant she added i wish he hadnt seen you kill it you maybe should have waited until he was gone the giant reddened at the chastisement im sorry he said the woman smiled to herself as she tried to comfort both boy and man simultaneously he is so big so strong she thought and yet he is made awkward and small by the sorrow of a little boy and his feelings for the boys mother this is a strange position in which to find myself circling this huge man as he circles me almostbut not quitetouching it took him so long so long hes still young she said reassuringly hell learn in time yes said the giant i guess he will he grinned ruefully briefly exposing the gaps between his teeth then suddenly conscious that he was revealing them he allowed the smile to die he squatted down so that his face was level with that of the boy goodbye danny he said the boy was still looking toward the grave of the gull and did not respond the giant turned to the woman goodbye marianne are we still okay for dinner sure she said bonnies going to look after danny for the evening he almost smiled again say goodbye to officer dupree danny said the woman as the giant prepared to leave say goodbye to joe but the boy only turned his face away burying himself in the folds of her skirt i dont want you to go with him he said and i dont want to stay with bonnie hush was all his mother could say and the giant named joe dupree strode toward his explorer dirt beneath his nails and the warmth of the bird still palpable on the palm of his hand had there been any strangers around to see his face the sadness upon it would have given them pause but to the natives on the island the look upon the huge policemans face would have seemed as familiar as the sound of breaking waves or the sight of dead fish upon the shore after all he was not called melancholy joe for nothing he was born huge his mother would often joke that had joe dupree been a girl he could almost have given birth to her they had been forced to cut him out of her and well that was that as far as eloise dupree having more children was concerned she was almost forty by the time her son was born and both she and her husband were content to remain a onechild family the boy grew and grew for a time they feared that he was suffering from acromegaly the ailment of giants and that their beloved son would be taken from them at an early age his life span halved or even quartered by the disease old doc bruder who was then not so old sent them to a specialist who conducted tests before reassuring them that their boy was not acromegalous true there were risks associated with his size later in life cardiovascular disease arthritis respiratory problems some form of chemical intervention could be considered at a later stage but he advised them to wait and see joe dupree continued to grow he towered over his classmates in elementary school and in high school desks were too small chairs too uncomfortable he stood out from his peers like the seed of a great tree dropped in the wrong part of the forest forced to survive amid alder and holly its strangeness apparent to even the most casual of glances older boys baited him treating him like a handicapped oddity when he tried to strike back at them they overwhelmed him with numbers and guile even the sporting arena offered him no comfort he had bulk to go with his size but it was without grace or skill his was not an immensity and strength that could be put to use in any competition he lacked the instincts necessary as much as the abilities his great body was a burden on the football field and a liability in the wrestling circle he seemed destined to spend his life either falling over or getting up again by the time he was eighteen joe dupree had topped out at over seven feet two inches and weighed over pounds his mass was a millstone in every way he was intelligent yet it was assumed by his peers that he was stupid because of how he looked instead of proving them wrong he became what they perceived he was the freak the freak from the island for it was his upbringing on the island that doomed him as much as anything else already he was an outsider to the kids from portland who thought little of the islanders to begin with even those of normal size he retreated into himself and after high school took a job on the island driving for covey jaffe it was only when the time of his fathers retirement drew near that dupree joined the portland pd his size almost an impediment to his acceptance until his familys history in the department was taken into account when his father at last retired it seemed natural that joe dupree should take over his role as the islands resident policeman assisted by the existing roster of cops from the mainland duprees father had died three years earlier six months after eloise had passed away his father had simply proved unable to live without her there was no other possible reason for the sudden decline in his health despite the opinions of doctors and specialists they had been together for fortyseven years living in a modest house on this most remote of the inhabited islands a profoundly enamored couple secure in the center of a close community dupree missed them both deeply his father in particular for he was forced to travel the same paths to drive the same roads to greet the same people to wear the same uniform as his old man once had there was a link between the two generations that could not be sundered and he strengthened it with every day that he worked in his darkest moments dupree would recall his childhood and his old man telling him tales from legend and from the bible of goliath who stood over six cubits of king og of bashans bed which was nine cubits long of the giants of greek myth the sons of heaven and earth who were slain by the olympians and buried under the earth their remains creating the mountains of the world of the titans parents of the gods of agrius the untamable born fully mature and clad in the armor of battle who waged war on the gods of olympus after the titans defeat and of aurgelmir of norse myth who was the first being the father of the giants who followed and whose body was used to make the very earth itself neither deities nor lesser spirits the giants were beings out of time and gods and men decreed that they should be destroyed dupree understood his fathers purpose to make him feel special part of some great heritage a gift from the gods maybe even from god himself he told his son stories of pecos bill of paul bunyan of the army of giants raised by frederick the great it was all part of his great effort to give his son some comfort it had not worked for the bible contained no stories of laughing girls and mocking boys and the giants of myth were felled by weapons and wars not words and enforced isolationyet he loved his father for trying dupree looked back at marianne elliots house danny had already gone inside but his mother was standing on the doorstep watching the dark sea and the white plumes upon it like shards of sunlight glimpsed through stormy skies he tried to recall how often he had encountered her in this fashion at first he had thought her hypnotized by the sea as those who came to the island from away sometimes became unfamiliar as they were with its rhythms but once or twice he had caught her unawares and had been struck by the absence of peace in her face instead her expression was one of concern even fear he wondered if she had lost someone to the sea yet still found herself somehow bound to it like the widows of drowned fishermen unwilling to leave the side of the great grave that refuses to relinquish their loved ones to them then she seemed to realize that he was watching her for she turned to him raised her hand in farewell and followed her son indoors dupree started the explorers engine and drove toward the coast road heading east along it the road did not make a full circuit of the island there were areas to the northwest at stepping stone hill and southwest down by hunger cove that were virtually inaccessible by car but since nobody lived in those areas the absence of roads was no great burden still each spring dupree would lead a group of volunteers over to stepping stone and hunger and they would cut back the trees and brush that had begun to colonize the dirt trails leading down to the sea just in case access was ever needed from the main road it was a tiresome job but far less irksome than having to build a new trail in a few years time or being forced to hack a way through in the event of an emergency about seven hundred people lived on the island yearround a figure that tripled at least during the summer months the island was large five miles long and almost two miles wide one of over islands islets and exposed ridges scattered throughout the twohundredsquaremile vastness of casco bay it was bigger and more populous than its nearest rival great chebeague but its size meant that most people still lived in relative seclusion apart from the community that had built up around the main ferry landing known only as the cove the population increased during the summer but not to the same extent as on the other casco bay islands nearer the mainland like peaks or chebeague or long island for dutch lay much farther to the east and was more exposed than the rest in winter only the old families remained their history was entwined with that of the island and their names had echoed around its woods for hundreds of years amerling and tooker houghton and hall doughty and dupree the heat was turned up high in the explorer for it was fiercely cold even for january there was talk of storms coming and thorson the ferry captain had posted a warning of possible suspension of the ferry services over the coming week already dupree had been forced to break up some heated arguments that had arisen at the ferry landing over accusations of excessive timidity on thorsons part it was hard for occasional visitors to the island to understand the importance of the ferry link to yearround residents casco bay ferries which ran regular services to a number of the islands did not do so to dutch island due to the distances involved and the relative paucity of passengers although its mail boat did make daily stops thorsons family had been providers of the islands ferry service for over seventy years taking kids over to high school students to college grandparents to visit grandchildren workers to their offices patients to the hospital boyfriends to their girlfriends children to aged parents who had been consigned to homesthe list was endless if you needed to buy a new tv you parked down in the lot by the ferry climbed onboard with a hand trolley headed over to circuit city then used a bus or a cab to get your new tv back to the dock in time for thorson to help you bring it home again that also counted for stoves machine parts new tires medicines ammunition new clothes for the kids toys for christmas and just about any other item that you cared to mention apart from the general foodstuffs available in the casco bay market thorsons ferry was mainly a people carrier for larger purchases like a new car or a piece of serious farm equipment covey jaffe had a construction ferry that could be hired out but without thorsons ferry to take care of all the little daytoday things life on the island would go from occasionally difficult to damn near impossible whether or not to run the ferry in the face of a storm warning was thorsons call but dupree figured hed talk to the old man over the next day or two and maybe remind him that where the ferry was concerned being overcautious was nearly as bad as being reckless dupree made some casual calls along the way checking on older residents following up on complaints handing out gentle warnings to errant teenagers and examining the summer residences of the wealthy to make sure that the doors and windows remained intact and that nobody had taken it into his mind to redistribute some of their wealth to more deserving causes it was the usual island routine and he loved it despite the rotation scheduletwentyfour hours on twentyfour hours off twentyfour hours on followed by five days offdupree worked almost as much unpaid overtime as he did scheduled hours it was unavoidable when he lived on the island and could be approached after church or in the store or even while he was tending his garden or fixing his roof it was the way things ran on the island formalities were for funerals on his way back to town dupree paused by an old lookout tower one of a chain of towers built during world war ii across the islands of casco bay the utility companies had taken to using some of them as storage facilities or as sites for their equipment but not this one now the door to the tower was open the chain that held it closed lying in a coil on its topmost step the towers attracted the local kids like sugar drawing flies since they offered sheltered and relatively remote sites in which to experiment with booze drugs and frequently one another dupree was convinced that the origins of a number of local unwanted pregnancies could be traced to the shady corners of these towers he parked the explorer and took his big maglite from beneath the seat then headed through the short grass toward the steps to the tower it was one of the smaller constructs built close to the shore barely three stories high and its usefulness as a lookout post was virtually negated by the growth of the surrounding trees still joe was curious to see that some of those trees had been crudely cut back their branches broken at the ends the policeman paused at the base of the steps and listened no noise came from within but he felt uneasy it was he thought becoming his natural state over these last few weeks he had become increasingly uncomfortable as he conducted his patrols of the island that had been his home for almost forty years it seemed to him that it was different but when he had tried to explain it to lockwood the older cop had simply laughed it off you been spending too long out here joe you need to take a trip back to civilization once in a while youre getting spooked lockwood might have been right in advising joe to spend more time away from the island but he was wrong about the nature of his partners unease others like larry amerling the postmaster had expressed to joe a sense that all was not well on dutch island lately although when they spoke about such things they used the old name they called it sanctuary there had beenincidents repeated breakins at the central lookout tower involving the destruction of even the strongest lock and chain dupree could find and the surge in plant growth on the pathways leading to the site and in winter mind when all that usually grew was darkness and icicles nobody visited the old massacre location during the winter anyway but if the paths became overgrown then it would be a hell of a job revealing them again when spring came and then there was the accident one week before the one that had killed wayne cady instantly and sylvie lauter a little more slowly the accident bothered dupree more than anything else he had been behind lockwood as the girl spoke her last words about lights and the dead and dupree recalled words once spoken by his own father sometimes theres no grave deep enough to bury a bad death he looked to the south and thought that he could distinguish gaps in the trees the circle of marsh and bog that marked the approach to the site he had not visited it in many months perhaps it was now time to return from inside the tower came a low scraping noise dupree undid the clasp on his holster and laid his hand on the butt of his smith amp wesson he stood to one side of the doorway and called out a warning police you want to come out of there right now yhear the sound came again there were footsteps and a voice low and nasal said its okay joe dupree its okay joe dupree its me joe dupree me richie joe stepped back as richie claeson appeared at the base of the towers main staircase sunlight shining through the single filthy window on that level casting a soft glow over his features richie come on out now said joe he felt the tension release from his shoulders what was i afraid of why did i have my hand on my gun richie appeared in the doorway grinning twentyfive and with a mental age of maybe eight he liked to roam the island driving his mother to distraction but nothing had ever happened to him and joe suspected nothing ever would richie probably knew the island better than almost anybody and it held no terrors for him during the warm summer months he even occasionally slept out beneath the stars nobody bothered him much except maybe the local smartasses when theyd had a drink or two and were trying to impress their girls hello joe dupree said richie how are you im good thanks richie i told you before about keeping out of these towers the grin on the face of the boyman never faded i know joe dupree stay out of the towers i know yeah well if you know then what were you doing in there it was open joe dupree the tower was open i went in to take a look i like looking dupree knelt down and examined the chain the padlock was open but when he tested the lock by trying to close it it wouldnt catch instead sliding in and out of the hole with a soft click and you didnt do this no joe dupree it was open i went in to take a look he would have to come back out here with a new lock dupree figured the kids would probably just break it again but he had to make the effort he closed the tower door then wrapped the chain around the handle to give the impression that it was locked it would have to do for now come on richie ill give you a ride home he handed the maglite to the handicapped man and watched with a smile as he shined the light upon the trees and the top of the tower light said ritchie im making lights like the others dupree stopped what others ritchie richie looked at him and grinned the others in the woods danny grabbed a can of soda from the refrigerator and wandered down to his mothers bedroom pieces of paper lay spread out on the bed before her as she kneeled on the carpet and tried to sort through them she had that expression on her face the one she got when they went over to portland on the ferry and she had to go into the bank or the car place you okay honey she asked when she noticed him standing beside her he nodded she sat back on her heels and looked at him seriously joe had to do what he did you know it was the kindest thing for that gull danny didnt respond but his face darkened slightly im heading over to jacks house he said he saw the scowl start to form and his face grew darker still what he said that old man she began but he cut her off hes my friend danny i know that but he she trailed off as she tried to find the right words he drinks she finished lamely you know too much sometimes not around me they had argued about this before ever since jack had fallen down and cut his head on the edge of the table and danny had come running for her the old mans blood on his hands and shirt his mother had thought that he had injured himself and her relief when she discovered the truth quickly transformed into anger at the old man for putting her through such a shock however briefly joe had come along and administered a little first aid then spent a long time talking to jack out on the old mans porch and since then jack had been a lot more careful if he drank now he drank in the evenings he was also turning out paintings with a vengeance though marianne didnt think much of his art he just paints the same view over and over she said to her son shortly after she and danny had visited the old man for the first time paying a neighborly call with cookies its not the same view the boy protested its different every time but she had merely glanced at the small watercolor that the old man had presented to the boy on their departure the rocks on either side of the inlet a bluish gray the sea a dark threatening green it was an ugly picture she thought all of the old mans pictures were ugly it was as if he were unable to perceive anything but the most mundane dreary aspects of the landscape before him there were no people hell he couldnt even paint birds or clouds or if he could he sure never bothered to place them in his pictures grays and greens and washedout blues that seemed to be the sum total of shades on his palette but the boy had placed the painting above his bed and was prouder of it than any of the dozens of other posters and cards and notes that obscured the walls even prouder of it than he was of his own work which his mother thought was far better than anything the old drunk was ever likely to produce marianne was never going to say that to jacks face though the old painter might have his flaws but an absence of generosity was not one of them the house in which they now lived was rented from him and even by island standards he had asked little for it she had that much for which to be grateful to him please mom said danny if she did not relent there would a tantrum and she would be distracted from the task at hand and she could not afford to be distracted from it she gave up and dismissed him with a wave go go but if you think that theres even the slightest thing wrong with jack you come straight back home you hear me he nodded solemnly then broke for the door his mother stood and walked to the window her bedroom looking down on the path that wound between their property and jacks house in the beginning she had led him along the way herself either holding his hand or watching anxiously as he bounded ahead after a while she had started to let him make the short walk between the two houses alone it wasnt far and she could follow his progress every step of the way she felt that it was important to allow him a little independence a little room in which to grow she wanted him to be tougher while simultaneously fearing the consequences of releasing him from her protection it was the dilemma of every parent she knew but a mother without a man to share the raising of a male child felt it more acutely sometimes she sensed that she was being forced to make choices that were against her nature in order to compensate for someone who wasnt there the boy trailed his way down the soda can still clutched in his hand like a small bright fragment of canvas set adrift from the whole his red windbreaker startlingly bright against the trees her eyes remained upon him until he reached the old mans door she saw him knock and wait patiently and then the door opened and he was gone vincent jack giacomelli had come to dutch island in the spring of after he had lost his job teaching at some fancy college on the east coast he was a walking history of art even if his knowledge and appreciation had never enabled him to paint with even one iota of the talent and imagination of those of whom he spoke to others things had started to turn black in the summer of when his wife left him for a professor of physics who drove the kind of fancy sports car that physicists who were in jacks experience so boring they made even mathematicians seem kind of entertaining were not supposed to know existed after she went away jacks life began to fall apart or maybe it had been falling apart anyway and that was why she left jack was never too sure and most of that period of his life remained a blur truth be told the blur extended up to a couple of months back when he had fallen and bumped his head and joe dupree had sat him down on the chair and spoken to him in that way of his that quiet way that told you that if you didnt shape up and take his advice then you might as well pack your bags lock your doors and head for the mainland because joe dupree wasnt going to have any nonsense on his island what jack couldnt figure out was why he didnt feel any resentment toward the policeman after all people had been telling him to shape up for the best part of forty years and he hadnt given a red cent for their advice but joe dupree was different there was no other way to put it when joe dupree looked at you in that strange sad way of his it was like being an onion beneath a knife held by a skilled hand as layer after layer was exposed and discarded until only the very core remained or until nothing at all remained depending on how far he went or the sort of onion you were jack had been kind of worried that if joe dupree kept peeling he would find out some terrible truth about jack that the old man himself had never even suspected existed or that he had somehow refused to face it was the fear that he had nothing left to offer nothing but bad art and broken promises and that joe dupree was capable of revealing that truth once exposed it could never again be hidden after that talk jack went on the wagon for a while it didnt last of course it never had before and even joe dupree wasnt likely to have that much of an impact on a hardened booze hound like jack but the old man was more careful now drinking only in the evenings and never ever taking a bottle to bed with him as he used to do in the good old days instead he began to paint at a faster pace than ever before hed been dabbling with painting for a long time of course jack made some money selling bad oil paintings and worse watercolors to tourists sometimes from a little stand that he set up down by the waterfront in portland on sunny weekends laying on the oldsalt act as thickly as he could inventing the kind of family history that a lot of folks around here could claim for real but that in jacks case was as false as the bottom of a magicians hat but he earned enough to keep himself in reasonable comfort in a house long since paid for which was now his to pass on to whomever he chosea couple of cousins a handful of nieces and nephews or his sister kate who if jacks will was anything to go by was likely to be one disappointed lady once he was cold in the ground the doorbell rang he wandered down the hallway his old sneakers making a slapping sound on the bare boards through the frosted glass of the door he could make out the shape of the boy disintegrating into black and red shards like watercolors dropped on oil he opened the door and stepped back in mock surprise hey its the danmonster the boy stomped past him not even waiting to be invited in he walked quickly to the door of jacks studio and then looked back at the old man for the first time is it okay sure sure you go right ahead ill follow you in soon as i get my coffee outside daylight was already beginning to fade igniting lights in the windows of distant houses jack retrieved his coffee cup from the kitchen adding a little hot water to it to heat it up then followed the boy into his studio it was a small space formerly a spare room but jack had transformed it by replacing one wall with sliding glass doors so that the floor became grass that rolled slowly down until it eventually reached the trees that bordered the low cliff edge the water beyond a dark threatening blue the boy was standing before the easel looking at jacks latest work in progress it was another oil and another attempt to capture the view over the water another unsuccessful attempt jack thought it was the uncertainty principle in action the damn thing kept on changing developing and the instant he attempted to capture it he became complicit in a lie still there was something calming about the exercise even as it drew closer and closer to failure with every movement of his hand every stroke of his brush this isnt like the others said the boy hmm said jack momentarily distracted by his own failings what did you say i said this isnt like the others its different different how jack joined the boy then frowned and leaned closer to the canvas there were marks upon it like black streaks on the waves he looked up at the ceiling and tried to determine if dirty water had somehow leaked down through a previously undiscovered crack but there was nothing the ceiling was white and unblemished carefully he reached out with a finger and touched the canvas then drew his hand back slowly the marks looked like paint yet he couldnt feel the texture of the brush strokes beneath his touch he looked closer and saw that the black marks were under some of his own strokes the horizontals that he sometimes used in an effort to capture the movement of the sea somehow it seemed that he had managed to paint over the blemishes without noticing but that was impossible there was no way that he could have failed to notice the flaws in the canvas he took a couple of steps back and tried to understand what the marks represented tilting his head as he went then pausing as he reached the threshold of the hallway before him the shapes became distinguishable as forms and he knew what they represented he knew also that there was no way that jack giacomelli had been responsible for the marks on the canvas for jack giacomelli never added anything to the natural landscape that was his sole inspiration theyre people said the boy youve put people in your painting the boy was right there were two bodies floating in the oiled waters of his painting the bodies of men the island had been quiet for so very long its past slumbered gently beneath the surface its exhalations causing the trees to sway the waters to ripple the dead leaves to chase one another across the grass like small brown birds in flight it slept the way one who has endured great pain might sleep its rest both escape and recuperation the memory of those who had suffered and died upon it in years gone by drifted through its consciousness so bound up with the land and the trees and the sea that it was impossible to tell if they had ever truly existed as separate entities but there were places on the island that were a testament to those who had once lived in its gift and the manner of their passing had ingrained itself upon the very stones themselves at the heart of the island barely a mile distant from the cove was a small huddle of stones surrounding patches of sunken earth seen from the ground their pattern was indistinct the placement of the stones seemingly but not quite random viewed from above the true nature of the clearing became apparent here were corners and fireplaces and chimneys here were yards and outhouses and pens here once were people their end when it came scarred the island and the foundations of the dwellings ran far deeper than those who had built them had ever intended or imagined stone fusing with stone until the divisions were no longer apparent the constructions of man and nature becoming one only the patterns visible from above and the halfburied monuments surrounding a single raised cross marked this place for what it was this was the site for a timefifty years in the memory of men but barely a second in the life of the islandthere had been no more killing here and the island had remained uninhabited once again but then more men had come men who were fleeing the consequences of their actions for places with a history of pain and violence will sometimes draw further pain and violence to themselves and the island tolerated their presence for a time until at last it could take it no longer the soil being incapable of soaking up any more blood the stones resisting the blackening of fires set in anger the men who came to the island brought with them a woman taken from scarborough against her will soldiers were searching for them on the mainland so they took to the sea hoping to find a place in which they would be safe for a time they came at last to the island there were four men they were armed and battle hardened they had fought the indians the british the french they feared no one it was fishermen blown off course by a storm and seeking shelter in the coves of the island who eventually found the woman she had built herself a little shelter in the ruins of the old village feeding on wild fruit and birds and fish to keep herself alive and had lit a fire in the hope of drawing help she had been there for two weeks and was almost insane when they found her of the men there was no sign they brought her back to the mainland and she was questioned about all that had occurred she could tell them little on the first day they had taken turns with her on the second day the mens boat had disappeared although they had drawn it up on the shore and lashed it to a fallen tree on the third day the whispering had started it sounded at first like the wind in the trees yet there was no wind blowing the voices seemed to come from all around and the men grew uneasy indistinct shapes flitted through the margins of the forest knowing that she could not flee they left her tied to a tree and headed into the woods on the morning of the fourth day after a little time had gone by she heard gunshots the men did not return soldiers scoured the island for these were vicious dangerous individuals but only one of them was ever found the officer who discovered him thought at first that he was looking at the carcass of a small animal until he touched it with his rifle and felt the skull beneath the hair they began to dig uncovering first his scalp then his face until finally his arms were revealed outstretched in a crucifixion pose and they were able with difficulty to pull him from the earth his name was gabriel moser and he had been buried alive except perhaps buried was not the right word for there had been no signs of disturbance at his resting place and already there was grass growing around the crown of his head gabe moser had not been buried it seemed gabe moser had been pulled down beneath the earth and had suffocated in the darkness the man named joe dupree knew all these things he knew the history of the island just as his father and grandfather before him had known it and they had bequeathed that knowledge to him the first one who came was named thomas lunt and he brought with him his wife katie and their children erik and johann that was in the spring of with them came the leggits robert and marie marie was pregnant at the time and would later give birth to a boy william others joined them in the weeks that followed these are their names you must remember them its important that you remember at the time joe dupree had not understood for he was very young later as he grew older he learned more and more about the island about what had taken place there he understood the importance of maintaining peace on the island and of allowing nothing to disturb its calm inevitably people sometimes did foolish things for where there are people there will be faults but there had been no wrongful deaths on the island for many years dupree drove to liberty avenue and killed the explorers engine liberty ran southwest to northeast across the island in what was almost a perfect diagonal except where it took a dip to avoid the site it had been renamed liberty avenue instead of the rather more mundane central avenue in the aftermath of pearl harbor when casco bay had become the northern base of the atlantic fleet a big fueling depot was established on long island and every kind of ship imaginable from little cruisers to aircraft carriers threaded a way through the channels of the bay to take on fuel a cable capable of detecting the passage of metal objects was stretched across the ocean floor from bailey island to two lights and two ships stood vigil over the submarine nets at hussey sound waiting to open the nets in order to allow passage to military shipping the two largest coastal defense batteries were situated on peaks island guarding the main approach to portland and dutch island the largest of the outlying islands both were similarly equipped the dutch island battery had two sixteeninch guns as big as any along the atlantic coast cast and fabricated at the watervliet arsenal in albany each was sixty feet long weighed fifty tons and had to be transported to the island on a specially constructed barge they were fired only once during target practice and promptly shattered every window on the island they were never fired again and when the war came to an end they were removed and destroyed but the emplacements built to house them remained great manmade mountains along the islands southeastern shore and gradually they were reclaimed by grass and bushes and shrubs a network of tunnels ran beneath them their great iron doors now hanging from broken hinges but even the bravest of the youths stayed away from the tunnels doors that stood open one day would be inexplicably locked by the next there were echoes where there should not have been echoes and lights where there should have been only darkness the islands teenagers were content to use the remains of the emplacements for biking or if they were of a more adventurous cast for driving cars diagonally down at the maximum possible speed their occupants wrenching the wheel to the right or left at the last possible moment and coming to rest facing the road sweat streaming down their faces still shrieking in exhilaration that was how sylvie lauter and wayne cady had come to be out here they had boosted an old dodge from the garage of one of the summer houses since even if the car was damaged during their activities it would be many months before the damage was discovered assuming of course that they did not harm it so extensively that it had to be abandoned at the emplacement as had happened on more than one occasion the couple had been drinking for there were cans found strewn across the back seat of the car judging by the number of fresh tracks along the emplacement they had managed two or three runs before cady lost control of the car sending it careening at top speed into the oak tree there were still heavy tire treads marking the cars final path and fragments of glass and metal lay strewn around the tree its bark now heavily pitted and speckled with the sap that had bled from within it flowers had been placed around its base along with a couple of beer cans and a pack of marlboros with two unsmoked cigarettes left inside joe dupree ran his fingers along the great gouge in the tree then rubbed them together crushing grains of bark beneath his fingers wayne cady had hit the steering column with so much force that it entered his chest killing him within seconds his girlfriend struck the windshield hard but her death was caused by the crushing of her lower body old buck tennier whose house lay about a quarter of a mile from the emplacement had heard the sound of the crash and called the cops by the time dupree and lockwood reached the scene buck was kneeling by the car talking to sylvie it was then that she had spoken her last the two cops cut sylvie and wayne from the car using the jaws of life after doc bruder who was still registered as an assistant me declared them dead at the scene the bodies were driven to the station house in the back of the islands sole ambulance prior to being transported to the mainland dupree had taken on the task of telling sylvies father and mother and wayne cadys layabout dad they had all cried in front of him even ben cady although ben had been pretty liquored up when dupree got to his door the huge policeman shivered he kicked at the glass with the toe of his boot and stared into the darkness of the forest as richie claesons words returned to him the others in the woods the island had been quiet for so very long now something was awake chapter two harry rylance spread the map over the hood of the rental mazda and watched as a bead of sweat engulfed galveston he had a vague recollection that galveston had once been pretty much washed away and subsequently rebuilt harry had been to galveston and why they had bothered to rebuild the place was beyond him maybe he was just bitter hed once been ripped off by a galveston hooker who stole his wallet while he was taking a postcoital leak and ever since then he had been unable even to hear the word galveston spoken without tensing inside thankfully the opportunities to hear anyone talking about galveston were comparatively few which suited harry just fine now here he was looking at a dark patch of sweat slowly seeping into the map around that selfsame thievinghooker hole in the ground it could be a sign he thought maybe if he hung his head over the map and let another bead of sweat drop it might just hit the page and tell him where he was because unless it did harry rylance was likely to remain absofuckinglutely lost that would have been okay with harry if he had been alone on this godforsaken stretch of dirt road well not okay exactly but at least he would have been able to figure out where he was in relative silence instead do you know where were at yet said veronica and there was that bored whining tone to her voice that just seemed to burrow into harrys skull from somewhere right above the bridge of his nose and then keep going until it hit the center of his brain and began picking idly at whatever it found there well there it was harry wasnt alone he had veronica berg with him and while veronica was pretty much all that a man could wish for in the sack and a whole lot more harry was not an unimaginative man but the things that veronica was prepared to do once her back hit the sheets came close to frightening him at times she could be a righteous pain in the ass outside the bedroom she sat in the passenger seat her shades on an elbow propped up on the open window a cigarette dangling from her fingers sending hopeless smoke signals up into the winter sky and that was another thing it was unseasonably warm hell it was january and january had no business being hot harry rylance was from burlington vermont and in burlington vermont january meant skiing and freezing your ass off and shoveling out the driveway if you were sweating in january in vermont then you were indoors and the heat was up too high the south was no place for a man to be in january or any other time if you asked harry harry didnt do dixie he gave up looking at the blueveined map of the united states in his rand mcnally road atlas resigned to the fact that his attempt to exchange the trees for the forest had left him no wiser than before and returned his attention to the local map harry wasnt a great reader of maps a fact that he tended to keep to himself a man who admitted publicly that he couldnt read a map might as well start riding sidesaddle and listening to show tunes harry wondered if it was some kind of condition he had like dyslexia he just couldnt connect the map with its tracery of blues and reds and its smears of green to the landscape that he saw around him it was like showing him the interior of a body all veins and arteries and bloody meat and asking him if he could tell who it was yet i said veronica began again harry felt the pressure building in the center of his forehead her voice was drilling away nicely now if she kept this up his head would cave in i heard you if i knew where we were wed be someplace else the hell is that supposed to mean it means that if youd give me a damn minutes peace then maybe i could figure out where we are and get us where were meant to be instead you should have stayed on the highway i came off the highway because you said you were bored you wanted to see some scenery there is no scenery well welcome to the south the civil war was the best thing that ever happened to this place at least it brought in some visitors you shouldnt have listened to me you didnt give me much choice dont take that tone with me hey i already got a wife back home i dont need another one fuck you harry and he could hear the hurt in her voice and knew that hed have to worm his way back into her affections if he had any hope of expanding his sexual horizons in the company of veronica berg the annual convention of the insurance providers of america wasnt likely to be so riveting that harry would want to spend the entire weekend sitting in the middle of a bunch of seersuckers nursing a hardon he reached in through the car window and touched her moist skin lightly with the palm of his hand she pulled her face away from him sending him a clear signal if she wasnt going to let him touch her face with his hand then there was a pretty good chance that the rest of her skin would remain a covered mystery to him as well unless he started making up some lost ground baby im sorry i didnt mean that she dabbed at a makebelieve tear with the tip of a finger yeah well you ought to be more careful about what you say you can be very hurtful sometimes harry rylance sorry he repeated he leaned over and kissed her on the mouth trying to ignore the taste of nicotine on her breath that was another thing her damn smoking if there was one thing harry theres someone coming he looked up and sure enough there was a cloud of dust and fumes heading their way he skipped away from veronica took the map in his hand and waved it at the oncoming vehicle as it drew closer and the dust cleared some harry could see that it was a blue ford truck twenty years old at least behind the wheel was a young man with blond hair parted on the right and hanging down over one eye he stopped and brushed the hair back onto his head with his fingers as he looked at the older man behind him he heard veronica purr in approval the kid was good looking harry noticed maybe a little on the pretty side because of that blond hair but still a finelooking young man harry wondered if he was turning queer then decided that the mere fact that he was worried about turning queer probably meant that he wasnt still thought harry that kid better not do anything that might offend the law because if he went to jail his cell mate would never have to buy cigarettes again you lost asked the kid his voice was a little high almost eerily so harry walked over to him and realized that the young man was older than he had first appeared early twenties at most but he had the voice of a thirteenyearold boy waiting for something to happen below his navel fucking backwoods freak thought harry took a wrong turn somewhere back down the road said harry which wasnt actually an admission that he was lost but wasnt saying that he knew where he was either it was a man thing where you bound what the fuck where you bound who talked like that were headed for augusta youre a long ways from augusta thats a whole nother state away i know that we were planning on taking our time you on vacation business what dyou do i sell insurance why why what why do you sell insurance harrys brow furrowed this was all he needed the kid was obviously some kind of redneck retard driving a clappedout old ford up and down back roads looking for folks to bother they hadnt been off the plane more than two hours and already the weekend was turning to shit people need insurance why well suppose something happens to them suppose you crashed your truck what would you do it aint my truck jesus okay well suppose you crashed it anyway and the guy whose truck it is wanted something done about it id fix it suppose it was so badly damaged that it couldnt be fixed there aint nothing i cant fix harry wiped his hand across his face in frustration you get hurricanes down here right sure what if your house blew away the young man considered this then nodded if i had a house he said then started the truck up again follow me he told harry ill take you where you need to go harry smiled in relief and trotted back to the car were going to follow him he told veronica okay with me she said and put your tongue back in your mouth said harry youre getting drool on your chin they followed the truck for five miles before harry started to worry the hell is he taking us he said he probably knows a shortcut a shortcut to where louisiana harry its his country he knows it better than we do calm down i think the kids retarded he was asking me about insurance you sell insurance people ask you about it all the time yeah but not like that the kid acted like he didnt know what insurance was maybe he had a bad experience once like what like trying to make a claim on your firm very funny and its our firm i just answer the phones i dont sell bum policies theyre not bum policies jesus you talk like that to other people about what we do if theyre not bum policies how come they dont pay out like they should its complicated explain it to me you wouldnt understand fuck you harry now where is he going ahead of them the ford had made a right and was pulling up in front of an old farmhouse the kid got out of the car and walked up the steps to the door then opened it and disappeared inside i dont believe this said harry he followed the driveway until he reached the old ford the place looked as if it had seen better days and could now hardly remember them trees bordered the yard but it wasnt clear why they were needed because harry couldnt see another house anywhere nearby once this might have been a working farm there was a barn off to the right and harry saw a rusting john deere standing in the open door but its tires were flat and its exhaust was severed he glimpsed overgrown fields through the trees but nothing had been harvested from them in a very long time the only thing being farmed here was dirt and weeds it was quiet too no dogs no people hell not even a couple of scrawny chickens trying to survive on dust and stray seeds a porch ran along the front of the house great teardrops of white paint flaking from it paint was falling too from the facade and from the window frames and the door the whole house seemed to be weeping harry opened the car door and called after their guide hey kid whats the deal there was no reply and suddenly harry who considered himself a calm man all things considered lost it fuck he shouted fuck fuck fuck he climbed out of the car and stomped up to the house behind him he heard veronica telling him to wait up he ignored her all he wanted to do now was get back on the highway find a hotel and hit the bar hell maybe they might just drive into the night until they got to augusta and screw the idea of taking their time and kicking back along the way veronica could just kiss his ass he reached the door and peered into the house the entrance led straight into a living room all the drapes were drawn and the room was shrouded in darkness he could see the shapes of chairs and a tv in the corner facing him was a kitchen and beside that a bedroom that had been converted to storage to his left a flight of stairs led up to the second story despite the heat all of the windows were closed there was no sign of the pretty boy harry stepped inside and his nose wrinkled something smelled bad in here he thought he heard flies buzzing whats happening said veronica and there was that whining tone to her voice again except this time harry barely noticed it stay there he called back and lock the car doors what for christs sake just do it she was quiet then but he heard a snapping sound as the doors locked beyond him the darkness remained untroubled by sound or movement but for the noise of the insects still invisible to him harry stepped into the house many miles to the north two police officers sat at a table in the sebago brewing company in portlands old port it was shortly after four oclock and already growing dark there were few tourists around at this time of year and the streets like the bar were quiet there was talk of a storm brewing and the coming of snow i like it better without the tourists said the first cop she was small and dark with short hair that barely troubled the nape of her neck her limbs were slim and she appeared almost delicate out of uniform but sharon macy was strong and fast cute too thought eric barron in fact very cute shed joined up only six months before and in that time it was all that barron could do to stop himself hitting on her barron was smart and hed watched as the other cops had made moves on her in bars and clubs hiding wedding bands in some cases as if macy would be dumb enough to fall for that but barron had held back and now he believed that he was one of the few cops who could safely suggest to macy that they head out for a beer or two after a tour yknow to unwind he could feel her starting to trust him to relax in his presence and she didnt seem to mind any when he patted her arm or let his leg rest against hers baby steps barron was a great believer in baby steps it might actually have made him a decent cop if he had cared to be not flashy or glory seeking but conscientious and careful unfortunately barron wasnt a decent cop he had a lot of people fooled maybe but even the ones who considered him adequate at worst wouldnt have used the word decent of barron he gave off a bad vibe nobody was ever going to ask barron to babysit a kid or pick up a daughter after cheerleading practice it wasnt anything that could be put into words exactly but if you were a parent then barron was the kind of guy who put you on your guard local kids even the real troublemakers knew better than to mess with him barron liked to pretend that it was because they respected him but secretly he knew better he could see it in their faces those of the boys in particular barron didnt usually go for women like macyhell he didnt usually care much for grown women periodbut macy was thin with kind of a boyish ass and barron was all for experimentation plus hed been out of the loop for a time keeping his head down hed let his appetites get the better of him a little while back and had almost brought a ton of trouble down on his head he needed an outlet for his frustrations itll be cold out there on the island he said he rubbed his hands over hers as if trying to increase the circulation to frozen limbs she smiled at him then drew her hands away and hid them beneath the table damn thought barron not a good sign i dont mind she said im kind of looking forward to it ive never been out there before barron took a long pull on his beer theres nothing out there he said just a bunch of yokels living some damn island fantasy inbreds mostly banjo players she shook her head you know thats not true you havent seen it believe me just twentyfour hours of island life and this place will seem like new york and vegas combined barron had that tone when he spoke the knowitall one that really grated on macy then again macy was just a probationary patrol officer while barron was her field training officer shed put in her eighteen weeks of basic training and now was at the end of her six weeks under an fto she had almost another two years of probation to go with transfers to new duties every six months but she didnt mind that so much she would just be happy to get away from barron he creeped her out and his attitude toward her wasnt simply that of a senior patrolman to one fifteen years his junior barron was just plain bad news the force was already under federal review and morale was suffering a lot of good cops were simply working toward their twentyfive so they could retire and open a bar somewhere cops like barron only made things worse still hed offered to buy her a beer to celebrate the end of their time together and she hadnt been able to refuse there were one or two other cops in the sebago although it wasnt a regular haunt barron didnt go to the cop bars macy figured that she wasnt the only one who felt uneasy around him macy sipped her beer and watched the cars pass on middle street she was still getting used to portland but it reminded her a little of providence where her parents lived there were a lot of young people although portlands university wasnt quite as grand as the one back home and it still had kind of a smalltown feel she liked the fact that there were good bars and decent places to eat in the center of the city she didnt miss providence too much and was happy to leave the bulk of her bad memories there if things had worked out there then macy would have been married by now might even have been talking about having a child things hadnt worked out of course which was why she was sitting in a bar miles away with tired legs and an aching back it was strange but one of the things that she had liked about max was the feeling he gave her that even half a century down the line she would still be discovering new things about him in the end it had taken barely eighteen months for her to discover a new thing about max that blew any hopes of marriage out of the water max couldnt remain faithful max would screw a keyhole if there wasnt already a key in it when he couldnt pick up a desperate student on thayer street or a bored secretary during the fivetoeight happy hour which was how macy a bored secretary in a law office had met him come to think of it hed screw hookers he even seemed to prefer hookers she discovered when he was released on bail and theyd met for that last time after she had packed her bags and returned in humiliation to her parents he confessed everything spewing poison and bile out onto the table of the diner so that it seemed that the formica would corrode beneath it he would tell the hookers that he was single and would get a kick when they asked how a goodlooking guy like him could be single even as he spoke about it his career in tatters around him associating with hookers was the least of his professional problems for he had been under surveillance for some time a consequence of the investigation into the mayors operation in providence and was now facing charges of graft and corruption she sensed that he still found it flattering max was sick but the sickness was moral as much as psychological she was just grateful that she had found out the truth before the wedding and not after it that was two years ago and macy had begun toying with the idea of becoming a cop shortly after she had been helping out at a center for women who were victims of domestic abuse and had heard horror stories from some of them about their dealings with the police there were good stories too hopeful stories but it was the bad ones that stayed with macy she wanted to make a difference it was as simple as that she had visited portland in the aftermath of the breakup while she was still trying to come to terms with what had happened and had decided that it suited her it was close enough to her parents to enable her to drive home when she chose yet far enough away that she would be in no danger of meeting any of maxs old associates or god forbid max himself the cost of living was reasonable and the force was recruiting her modicum of legal knowledge and her experience in the battered womens shelter had made her a shooin as a recruit she had no regrets although working with barron had been her most trying ordeal yet she noticed that barron had gone quiet she saw him looking across the bar and the expression on his face was so hostile that she immediately wanted to leave him there to get as far away from him as possible even though his eyes were not on her instead he was watching a man of slightly more than medium height talking to the bartender he was kind of cute thought macy in a brooding way he flashed some form of id asked a couple of questions then prepared to move on he barely paused when he spotted barron but it was enough he held the cops eyes until barron looked away then left the bar macy watched him climb into an old mustang and drive toward the franklin arterial who was that she asked nobody a fuckup he excused himself to go to the john and told the bartender to rack up two more beers macy was barely halfway through her first and she wasnt planning on having another she looked around the bar and saw odell from property he stepped up beside her and touched his glass to hers end of your six he said congratulations she shrugged and smiled hey you know who that guy was the one who was talking to the bartender a couple of minutes ago drives a mustang odell nodded charlie parker the pi as an investigator she knew parker had managed to track down some bad guys he had quite a reputation even if it was a mixed one she had heard talk that parker was nosing about in the department she was curious to know why the very same i got the impression that barron doesnt like him there arent a whole lot of people eric barron does like and parker isnt the kind of guy to top that list they had a runin a couple of years back parker was looking into the death of a woman rita ferris shed been hooking a little to make ends meet after the case was closed barron saw parker at old port billiards and made some comments about the woman and barron went to the mens room couple of minutes later parker followed him in only parker came out barron never spoke about what happened in there but hes got a scar at the right side of his mouthodell pointed with his finger to his own mouththat maybe i wouldnt mention to him you see what i mean people who mess with cops dont usually walk away from it so easily you see anyone rushing to defend barrons honor i guess not i hear parkers been asking about cops cops rentacops private security hes pissing off all the wrong people you know why case a couple of months back someone tried to pull a boy from the street over in gorham kid was huffing lighter fuel and was pretty much off his head to begin with so he couldnt recall much but he claimed the guy was wearing a uniform under his jacket and he thought he could see a gun his parents have money and theyve hired parker to ask some questions theyre afraid the guy might make a play again either on their kid or someone elses barron returned from the mens room and nodded a curt greeting to odell see you round i guess odell said to macy he nodded at barronericthen went back to his buddies what did he want asked barron nothing just wanted to congratulate me on finishing my six she could sense barron simmering beside her he had a short fuse and it seemed a good idea to try to stamp it out before the powder keg ignited tell me more about the island she said barron told her that dutch island or sanctuary as it was sometimes known was within the jurisdiction of the portland police department despite its status as the most remote of the inhabited islands on casco bay dutch wasnt the only island that required a police presence of this kind but it was the least hospitable most portland cops never had to spend time there it had one resident policeman and a couple of others who traveled out on a rotation system on the other island policed by the portland pd peaks island two officers headed out on a boat every day but when the boat left for dutch there was often only one cop on board why has it got two names to make it sound interesting said barron but believe me it isnt what more do you want to know whats he like asked macy who you know dupree barron clicked his tongue in disgust melancholy joe hes a freak they say hes a giant i mean a real giant like in the circus or like that wrestler guy the one who died andre the giant no joe aint as big as andre still a big son of a bitch though strong too nobody fucks with melancholy joe why do they call him that because hes a miserable bastard thats why doesnt say much keeps to himself you better take some books out to dutch island because you sure aint going to be kept up nights talking to joe you spend time out there just once when flu took out half of the regular guys didnt care much for it didnt care much for joe dupree either i bet it was mutual thought macy i suppose nothing much happens out there not a whole lot bored kids stealing cars breaking into summer houses the occasional dui its community policing mainly but not always what do you know asked barron someone said who just someone he said joe dupree once killed a man out on the island barron made that clicking sound again yeah he killed one of the lubey brothers ronnie lubey if hed been a little faster then maybe his partner might not have taken a load of buckshot in the leg lubey was drunk dupree and snowman arrived snowman yeah dumb fucking name for a dumb guy if hed taken the buckshot in the head it probably would have done him less damage anyway dupree and him arrive snowman gets shot and dupree kills ronnie lubey he was taken off duty for a while but the investigation cleared him thats it nobody shed too many tears for old ronnie he was a bad one his brother still lives out on dutch he hates joe dupree like wood hates fire barron paused he felt dumb saying what he was about to say as if macy was going to laugh at him or call him a liar but when hed joined the force his first partner tom huyler had sat him down over a beer and told him pretty much what he was about to tell macy and old huyler wasnt the type to joke around he was dutch protestant and when those people cracked a smile it was like watching arctic ice break but huyler knew his history after all they were some of his people that went out there in the beginning his people who were slaughtered because sure dutch island was quiet most of the time there was the odd domestic dispute the occasional drunk that tried to drive up a tree but he recalled huyler telling him the story of the first settlers on the island how theyd retreated out there after skirmishes with the local indians in the late s then according to the history books there was some internal dispute among the islanders and somebody had been banished hed come back though and he brought others with him the entire populationten twelve families all with childrenhad been slaughtered it was only in the last hundred hundred and fifty years that people had started returning to dutch in numbers and now the community was large enough to need fulltime cops out there and sometimes people went missing they were the bad ones mostly that was the odd thing about it they were the ones that were no use to anybody not even to their own families they were the fighters the abusers the wife beaters true not all of them went that way and dutch still had its share of bad sorts but they tended to be pretty careful about where they walked and what they did they didnt stray too far from their homes and they stayed away from the woods at the center of the island and far away from what was known as the site the burial place of the original settlers huyler was dead now died of a heart attack two years before but barron could still see him sitting there a glass of beer in his hand talking in those soft tones of his the occasional strange intonation creeping into his speech a relic of his familys heritage barron had never doubted a word that he had said not even when hed told him about his final tour on dutch island and the death of george sherrin because george sherrin was the reason dutchs less salubrious residents didnt go walking in the woods at night anymore nobody wanted to go the way old george had no sir there had always been talk about the sherrins their kids were rebellious and educationally subnormal real difficult types old frank dupree melancholy joes father had been forced on more than one occasion to haul one or the other of the sherrin kids back to his old man and tell him how the kid had been caught breaking windows or tormenting some poor dumb animal and the kid would be quiet as he was led back to the house and frank would always feel a tug at his belly as the kid was led inside by george and the door closed silently behind them frank suspected that there was something going on there something vile and rotten but he could never convince sherrins mousy wife enid to talk and any social workers who ever went near the sherrins risked getting a gun waved at them or had to run to escape the dogs barking at their heels and then one day george sherrin went missing he didnt come home from a trip out into the woods his truck loaded up with a saw and chains so he could do a little illegal cutting and collect some cheap fuel for the winter it was two days before his wife bothered to report it and frank dupree figured that if she hadnt killed him herself then maybe she was just relieved to have two days without his presence in the house because if george sherrin was doing bad things to his children frank didnt doubt that his wife knew about it and that maybe she tried to get him to do bad things to her instead on occasion just to give the kids a break so frank dupree and tom huyler had made their way into the woods and after a few hours theyd found george sherrins truck and beside it georges saw there was a gash in a big pine tree nearby where george had just started cutting but then something seemed to have interrupted him because he never got to finish his task they had a good look around for george but there was no trace of him later they came back with twenty islanders and they formed a line through the forest and scoured the bushes and the trees but george was gone after a few days they stopped looking after a few weeks they stopped caring georges kids started getting on better in school and a social worker began calling at the house and then a couple of times a month enid sherrin and the kids took the little ferry over to the mainland and got to talk things through with a doctor who had crayolas in her drawer and a box of kleenex on her desk one year later a bad storm hit the coast and dutch being right out there took the brunt of it there was thunder and two trees were felled by lightning bolts and under one of those trees they found george sherrin the pine had been torn partway out of the ground but its fall was arrested by the surrounding trees so that its broad root structure gaped like a toothed mouth in the hollow that it left in the ground george sherrins remains were discovered and a murder investigation was initiated there was no visible damage to his bonesno breaks no fractures no entry woundsbut somebody must have put george sherrin under that tree because he sure hadnt dug himself a hole beneath it and then covered himself up they took enid sherrin in and quizzed her some but she had her kids to back her up and they all told the same story their momma had been with them the whole time after their daddy disappeared who else was going to look after them there were more puzzles for the investigators to mull over when the tree and the bones were analyzed the results made no sense the way the experts figured it george sherrin would have to have been buried under there for thirty years for the roots to grow through his bones the way they had for they had curled around and through him as if holding him in place but george sherrin had been missing for only one year and there was just no way to account for that degree of growth no there had to be some other explanation for the nature of the root spread except nobody had ever come up with one thats the story said barron macy looked at him closely to see if he was joking he wasnt you say other people have disappeared i dont say the only one ive heard about is george sherrin i think the others are just attempts to add to the legend you know people leave the island for their own reasons and dont come back and suddenly theres another name in the pot but what i just told you about george sherrin well thats real you can put that in the bank and watch it draw interest he knocked back his beer and raised his hand for another round instead macy pushed her untouched second beer in front of him take mine im all done youre going hey dont go stay a little longer his hand reached for hers but she went for her jacket instead narrowly avoiding contact she put it on and saw barrons eyes following the zipper as she pulled it up over her breasts no i got to go i have things to do what things he said and she could hear something in his tone something that made her real glad that there were other people around them in the bar that they werent sitting alone in a car somewhere or worse back at barrons place hed asked her back there that afternoon suggesting they watch a movie on cable maybe get some thai food shed declined and theyd ended up here instead suddenly it seemed to her like the wisest decision shed made in a very long time just things she said thanks for the beer and yknow looking out for me during training but barron had left her and was now standing at the bar he lifted her untouched beer leaned over the counter and poured it into the sink she shook her head picked up her knapsack and walked out macy thought about all that she had been told as she drove home about dupree and the island and george sherrin she thought too about barron and shuddered instinctively at the memory of his touch the weeks of training under barron had been difficult at first it hadnt been so bad barron had kept his distance and played everything by the book but gradually she became increasingly uneasy around him conscious always of how close he would stand to her of the relish with which he told selfglorifying stories of inflicting violence on smartmouths and punks and of the looks some of the street kids would shoot him when he approached them like dogs that had been kicked once too often it was only in the final weeks that barron had started to put some tentative moves on her he was careful aware of the potential for harassment complaints or of action by his superiors if they found out that he was even attempting to form a relationship with a probation cop in his charge but the desire was there macy had felt it like a bad rash macy knew that she was pretty and that she possessed superficially at least a kind of vulnerability that drew a certain type of man to her scratch that it drew a whole lot of different types to her and she had learned to sidestep their attentions with a grace that would have befit a ballerina barron was subtler than most but it was perhaps that subtlety that was most offputting while most men made a frontal assault barron was the kind who crept up like a sneak thief they were the worst types and had to be watched most closely she thought too of an incident that had occurred the night before one that still troubled her macy and barron had been heading down congress doing their standard loop when they saw him the lights picked out a figure in a black alpha industries aviators jacket the hood of his gray jogging top hanging over the back of the jacket a watch cap on his head he took one look at the cruiser and started to walk briskly in the opposite direction will you look at this joker said barron he depressed the accelerator slightly causing the patrol car to increase its speed to match the guy watch cap looked over his shoulder then ran i mean seriously barron continued he could have been talking about the return of flared pants or the revival of progressive rock for all the concern in his voice heres conclusive evidence that a whole lot of criminals are just plain dumb if this guy could just have kept his head for ten secondshe swung the wheel to the right as the suspect made a turn onto pinethen he would have been free and clear instead he decides to outrun miss crown vic here and im telling you now i dont think this is a healthy man look at the vapor trail hes leaving its like chasing a crop duster okay screw this lets light him barron hit the gumballs and the siren and put his foot down hard to the floor already the guy was visibly wilting when they swung into the parking lot behind him he seemed almost grateful to be forced to stop barron stepped out from behind the wheel seconds later and the two cops came at him in a narrowing v the runner had his hands raised and was breathing as if he were about to bust a gut barron seemed to do a double take when he got close enough to identify the man it was hardly noticeable but it was there hey said barron terry scarfe look macy its terry scarfe how you doin terry they let you out the fuck were they thinking maybe they took a vote said macy scarfes name had been on a circulated list of new parolees according to the other cops he was a wellknown local lowlife he was just over five feet tall and desperately thin his face was heavily lined despite his comparative youth as though it still bore the imprint of the last foot that had stepped on it yeah like a straw poll you terry are the weakest link now get the fuck out of our nice prison you carrying terry scarfe shook his head you sure now because i better not frisk you and find something that draws blood i gotta say that if you think the airlines are kind of strict then wait until you get a load of me i find even a sharp fingernail clipping and im going to have you charged with carrying an offensive weapon and thats in addition to you just being offensive period so let me ask you again terry anything in there we should know about sharps needles scarfe found his voice i told you i got nothing on the ground said barron aw come on its cold im telling you barron came at him hard and shoved him to the ground scarfe landed on his knees and seemed about to protest until barron pushed him down fully and his chin hit the ground you didnt have to do that scarfe whined while barron patted him down get up barron said when he was done scarfe got to his feet and rubbed the dirt from his hands why did you run away from us asked barron i wasnt running away from you i was running to someplace someplace where someplace else you want us to take you in how long you been out on parole since monday monday said barron loudly you mean you been out just a couple of days and already weve got you for fleeing and for failing to cooperate with your local friendly police department i told you i wasnt fleeing im a busy man i got shit to do is it the kind of shit you can do in jail scarfe looked at him in puzzlement no well you seem in kind of a hurry to get back there i just figured that maybe it was kind of nonspecific shit you know independent of geography scarfe kept his mouth shut youre an asshole terry said barron and his tone was more serious now youre an asshole and youre going to get in some serious trouble again if you dont watch your step now get out of here macy looked at barron incredulously youre letting him walk what are we going to arrest him on dressing too young for his age he ran yeah buthey are you still here scarfe had stopped seemingly uncertain of what to do now that the two cops were arguing about him i told you to go so go before i change my mind scarfe took one final look at macy shrugged then walked briskly from the parking lot and faded into the night the two cops faced each other come on macy said barron dont do that shit what shit criticizing me in front of a cockroach like terry scarfe he wasnt running for nothing hes got something going on so what were we supposed to do haul his ass in then watch him sit on his hands for twelve hours until we get him to court maybe we get the right judge and his parole is revoked and then what so he serves another six months big fucking deal terrys more use to us out on the street now he hears things and maybe we can lean on him in the future he owes us now we got him over a barrel macy said nothing they got in the car and made their way back onto congress come on macy barron repeated let it go but macy remained uneasy for the rest of the shift and she spoke little to barron until they were on the steps of the headquarters building there barron had reached out a hand and grasped her arm are we okay he asked and macy looked into his eyes and knew better than to disagree sure i just dont have a good feeling about scarfe we should have brought him in hes dumb if he is up to something well spot it soon enough at least if he goes down again it will be for something more than time remaining he gave macy his best shiteating grin then headed toward the lockers macy watched him go and wondered if shed seen what she thought shed seen barron frisking scarfe then palming the small bags of white powder that hed found in the mans pocket she said nothing about it to anybody she didnt figure barron for a user and maybe he was holding on to the bags for future use possibly as payment to snitch junkies but that didnt sound right either it simply wasnt worth the risk for barron to carry drugs no matter what the excuse which left the possibility that barron wanted to protect scarfe once again as she headed for home macy was glad that her time with barron was now over and despite his stories she was curious about her upcoming island detail macy was not a credulous person and while police work tended to encourage a certain amount of superstitionlucky shoes lucky routes lucky bulletsshe was still a little surprised by what barron had said and more particularly by the sincerity with which he had said it barron really believed everything he had told her about george sherrin and dutch island or at least had fewer doubts about it than he might otherwise have been expected to entertain still he had pricked her curiosity although that would be as close as barron ever came to pricking anything of sharon macys she was curious too about the policeman the one barron and the others called melancholy joe his story was pretty well known in portland his father and grandfather had both served as police officers doing the bulk of their time out on dutch island it was a peculiar arrangement but it suited the department they knew the island and its ways and when police officers from outside the community had been tried on the island in the absence of a member of the dupree family the experiment had foundered crimemundane crime but crime nonethelesshad increased and the nerves of the cops on temporary duty had become steadily more frayed in the end given that nobody particularly wanted to spend time out on dutch anyway the dupree family had become the de facto first family of police work as far as dutch island was concerned but old frank duprees marriage had produced only one son and that son was big enough to have even other cops label him a freak she heard that the cost of altering a police vehicle to suit his size had been met by the department he carried the standardissue portland pd sidearm the smith amp wesson but he had adjusted the trigger guard in his own workshop so that one of his huge fingers could pass through it more easily occasionally one of the local papers would do a story on the giant of dutch island and during the summer tourists would sometimes travel out there to catch a glimpse of him or to have their photographs taken alongside him joe didnt seem to mind or if he did it made no difference to his permanent expression of worried bafflement melancholy joe macy smiled and said the name aloud melancholy joe her headlights caught the sign for the interstate the wipers striking out at the first drops of rain and she took the north ramp sanctuary she said testing out the name she decided she liked that name better than dutch well its better than being on traffic duty moloch lay in silence on his bunk from a nearby television came the sound of a news bulletin but moloch tuned out the background noise he had more pressing matters to consider his lawyer hadnt been able to tell him much about the grandjury hearing when theyd met ten days before across a bare steel table in the prisons visiting area all i know is that they have a guy named verso molochs mouth twitched but otherwise he gave no sign of his irritation is verso the target of this grand jury i dont know moloch leaned in closer to the little man mr braden why am i paying you if you know nothing braden didnt back off he knew moloch was merely venting steam you finished he asked moloch leaned back then nodded im guessing that verso has spoken to them and offered them something in return for immunity from prosecution versos a nasty piece of work and youre already locked up for the foreseeable future so it could be that the county prosecutor might like to see what you can offer them to put verso away what do i get in return if i testify a cell with a view youll be due for parole in eight to ten testifying will help your case i dont plan to spend another decade in jail mr braden braden shrugged and leaned back your call ill be in the hallway during the proceedings you can ask for time out as soon as you discover where their questions are leading if in doubt take the fifth moloch looked down at the table before he spoke again they have something he said they dont want verso they want me im the target you dont know that for sure said braden yes said moloch i do he placed his hands together palm against palm i pay you well mr braden you were engaged because you were smart but dont believe for one moment that youre smarter than i am i know where you live i know your familys movements i know the name of the boy your daughter you better stop your daughter fucks in your basement while youre watching the west wing i know these things mr braden and you in turn know me i suspect that the commonwealth of virginia has no intention of ever seeing me released in fact i believe that the commonwealth of virginia has high hopes of executing me and freeing up my cell for someone else they want capital charges this grandjury hearing is a trap nothing more i have no evidence i dont care about evidence tell me your instincts your gut instincts tell me im wrong but braden said nothing so theres been talk rumors suspicions braden said nothing more that verso is not the target that verso is not the target braden echoed have you spoken to the prosecutor he wouldnt agree to a meeting if verso was the target he would have met with you you could have negotiated immunity from prosecution for me you better believe that any true bill that comes out of this will have my name on it braden spread his hands im doing what i can moloch wondered if braden might be secretly happy were he to be found guilty of capital crimes he shouldnt have threatened the lawyer the man was frightened enough of him already moloch leaned in closer to his counsel listen to me mr braden i want you to remember a telephone number dont write it down just remember it carefully and clearly moloch whispered the seven digits to the younger man when the details of the hearing are confirmed i want you to call that number and pass them on do not call from your office do not call from your home do not use your cell phone if youre wise youll take a day trip maybe into maryland and you will make the call from there am i clear yes you do this right and youll be free of me braden rose and knocked on the door of the meeting room guard he called were all done here he left without looking back at his client now the preparations were in place moloch had received a message passed in code during an apparently innocuous telephone conversation they were moving progress was being made all would be ready when the time came he closed his eyes and thought of vengeance the grayhaired man sat in the rue de la course on north peter sipping coffee and reading the local throwaway groups of young men passed by the windows of the coffeehouse heading for the depths of the french quarter he could hear a thumping bass beat coming from the coyote ugly bar close by battling the light jazz being played on the sound system behind his head he liked the rue de la course preferring it to the café du monde where earlier he had eaten beignets and listened to the street musicians trying to hustle a buck at the café du monde coffee came either black or au lait and the grayhaired man didnt care much for it either way he liked it black but with a little cold milk on the side the asian waitress at the café du monde wasnt prepared to accommodate him so he had been forced to take his business elsewhere the rue de la course had been a fortuitous discovery in a way it had been recommended to him by somebody else the rue de la course had ceiling fans and walls of what looked like beaten tin and the tables were lit by greenshaded bankers lamps he was surprised that it was still a coffeehouse what with the money that could be made by turning it into a bar maybe it had been a bar once as white lettering on the door still indicated that it sold beer and wine although the blackboard behind the counter only listed about forty different types of coffee and tea all iced this and mocha that the grayhaired man whose name was shepherd preferred his coffee the old way with the minimum of milk and fuss it didnt bother him that he couldnt get a drink here shepherd wasnt much of a drinker he hated the way that it made fools out of people in fact shepherd had few if any vices he didnt smoke didnt use drugs and his sex drive was virtually nil he wasnt interested in women or men although hed tried both just to be sure that he wasnt missing something like his aversion to alcohol it helped to keep his mind clear and so he sat sipping coffee from a mug decorated with the image of a man in a raincoat reading a newspaper at a table which was very apt for shepherd too was wearing a raincoat and sitting at a table reading a newspaper circles within circles two tables away from him a young woman wearing green hospital scrubs sat taking notes from a textbook she seemed to feel his eyes on her for she looked up he smiled casually at her then went back to the newspaper shepherd didnt like new orleans it was a thirdworld city in a firstworld country so in thrall to graft that it had come to regard corruption as the norm rather than as an aberration when he walked its streets all he saw was ugliness the baseness of the human condition unashamedly revealed earlier he had watched a hardfaced man stand at the doorway of a glorified titty bar a huge woman with an even harder face standing behind him rolls of fat dripping over dirty white lingerie why would anyone go into such a place shepherd wondered to be ripped off maybe to be threatened to smell the cheap scent on a woman one step above whoredom such corruption of the spirit and of the soul repelled him but at least it was obvious unhidden there were other forms of corruption that were far more insidious the woman in the green scrubs stood placed her textbook and notebook in a satchel and left the coffeehouse after a minute or two had passed shepherd also left he stayed some way behind her shadowing her from across the street as she headed up decatur he did not panic when he lost sight of her among the crowds for he knew where she was going to his left starlings moved in great shrieking circles hovering above an old chimney stack on chartes above them the january sky was gray and cheerless tourists watched the birds in momentary curiosity then moved on somehow unnerved by the sight slowly the birds numbers were depleted as they found their roosts inside the chimney black shapes descending into a deeper darkness by the time he reached the top of decatur the woman was nowhere to be seen he waited ten minutes then walked to the security gates of a renovated condo and pressed the number nine followed by the pound key there was a click and then a female voice said who is it my name is jeff i called earlier to make an appointment hed found her ad offering a sensual massage the day before and had called to arrange a visit come on up she said the gate buzzed and he entered the yard following the interior lights to a stairway he climbed three flights and stopped before the door to number nine he was about to knock when the door opened she had changed out of her scrubs and now wore a satin robe the ends of her hair were still wet from the shower she looked a little puzzled as she struggled to remember his face you were in she began then found shepherds gloved hand pressed firmly over her mouth as she was forced into the apartment shepherd closed the door silently behind him he pushed her against the wall and removed his right hand from the pocket of his raincoat so that she could see the knife if you scream i will hurt you he said i dont want to hurt you if you answer my questions i promise you that you will not be hurt do you understand me she nodded and he released his grip sit down he followed her into her living room the drapes were drawn and a single lamp overhung with a red scarf was the sole illumination in the room a door to his right stood open inside he could see a massage table covered with a clean white towel im sorry to have misled you said shepherd he stood slightly to one side of her his left leg slightly forward to protect his groin he had encountered trouble with women before she seemed on the verge of tears he could hear them in her voice as she asked what do you want shepherd nodded in satisfaction good i dont want to take up any more of your time than i have to id like to know where your boyfriend is she didnt reply your boyfriend he repeated verso or have you forgotten him already i havent heard from him shepherd sighed his hand moved in a blur of flesh and metal drawing a red line from her left shoulder to the top of her right breast she started to yelp and he again covered her mouth with his hand i told you he said i dont want to hurt you but i will if you make me i will ask you again where is he the police have him the police where in virginia where in virginia i dont know shepherd raised the blade again and she said louder this time i dont know they keep moving him hes not my boyfriend anymore i havent seen him since he turned himself in all i know is that hes going to be in norfolk soon theres a grandjury hearing hes going to testify when was the last time he called she was silent for a time theres a limit to my patience he warned her this morning she said at last before or after i called after i was just on my way out the door when the phone rang the phone lay on a table to shepherds left there was an answering machine hooked up to it but it was turned off why is your machine off i was going to go out tonight catch a movie you were my only appointment stand up said shepherd she did as she was told he walked her to the phone table then told her to kneel facing away from him please she said just kneel i want to star sixtynine your phone and i dont want you doing anything stupid while i dial reluctantly she knelt shepherd pressed the buttons then listened chesapeake inn and suites said a male voice shepherd hung up asshole he thought he stepped back from the kneeling woman she didnt turn around please she said dont hurt me anymore i wont said shepherd he was a man of his word she didnt feel a thing harry rylance had never thought of himself as the nervous type nobody ever made a good living out of the insurance business by being nervous nervousness was for the suckers who bought the policies the whole business was predicated on fear without it the insurance industry would sink like a stone and harry would sink along with it but harry had to admit that he was feeling pretty damn nervous now the creepy retard kid had disappeared and harrys instinct was to get the hell out of the house and hope that he and veronica could find their own route back to the highway except the house smelled of dead meat and there were flies buzzing and curiosity was a terrible thing harry padded softly across the floor of the living room wincing every time a board creaked in the kitchen he found a pile of takeout chicken buckets littered with the stripped bones of those midget chickens the fastfood companies raised on some irradiated pacific atoll no other way thought harry that you got legs and wings that small a frying pan stood on the range pieces of burnt fat adhering to its base and bugs floated on the surface of the foulsmelling stew that sat in a pot beside it there was an ancient refrigerator beside the stove humming and rattling like a crazy old man in a tin cage harry reached out to open it then paused he could see himself reflected in the metal his features distorted something white was behind him harry spun around and lashed out at the drapes that in the still air hung unmoving over the window a plate fell from the drain board and shattered on the floor sending ants scurrying in confusion somewhere a cockroach clicked shit said harry and opened the fridge door apart from a carton of weekold milk it was empty in the freezer compartment harry found meat packed in bags there was a lot of it he closed the fridge doors then went back into the living room no sounds came from upstairs hello called harry kid you okay up there he began to climb and for the first time he heard it two words of a song repeated over and over the needle caught in the groove of the record dont care dont care dont care elvis thought harry the king dont care he reached the top of the steps there was a bedroom before him but it was empty the sheets on the bed thrown back where its occupant had departed leaving it unmade beside it was a bathroom judging by the tiles on the floor but it stank so bad that harrys eyes began to water the door was almost closed harry nudged it with his foot and it opened slowly there was a man sitting on the toilet his pants were around his ankles and a newspaper dangled from his hand instinctively harry started to apologize shit sorr harry stepped back and covered his mouth with his hand but it was too late he felt the fluid on his fingers then bent down to finish puking the guy on the john had been shot where he sat a bloody cloud behind what remained of his head there wasnt much of his face left either but harry figured from his stringy legs his gray hair and sagging flesh that the guy was well into his seventies his white tshirt was sweatstained yellow in places and blood had soaked into the shoulders leaving marks like epaulettes his skin was split by gas blisters harry wanted to run but there was still the sound of elvis coming from what was probably a bedroom at the end of the hall he walked slowly to the door and looked inside the couple in the bedroom were younger than the old man in the can much younger harry figured them for their late twenties at most the man had been shot on the floor and lay naked by an open drawer its contents littering the floor a box of ammunition had fallen and scattered around him but there was no gun there was a bullet hole in his back barely recognizable amid the damage that had been done to his body harry retched but he had nothing left inside and so he just belched acidic gas the woman had dark hair and sat slumped sideways against the pillows and the headboard she too was naked the sheets had been pulled away from her body and shed been cut up pretty bad as well despite himself harry stepped closer and something registered in his head this wasnt a frenzy thought harry no there was purpose to these wounds there was jesus whispered harry she had chunks of flesh missing from her thighs and buttocks where someone had hacked them out there was flesh missing from the man as well less flesh admittedly but then he was scrawny and muscular a little like the old man in the john a mental image flashed in harrys mind the refrigerator empty but for a carton of sour milk and meat fresh meat harry ran he hit the stairs at speed taking the steps two at a time the front door was still open and he could see veronica sitting behind the wheel her fingers tapping an impatient cadence on the dashboard her eyes widened as she saw him emerge open the door shouted harry quickly she reached for the drivers door still staring at him while her fingers fumbled for the handle then she was no longer looking at him but beyond and behind him harry heard her scream his name before the world spun around in a circle and harry found himself looking first at the car from a sideways angle then at the ground then the sky and the house and the grass all tumbling in a crazy mixture of images that seemed to go on forever but in fact lasted barely seconds and harry couldnt understand why even as he died and his severed head bounced to a halt by the porch steps and out on dutch island the man known to some as melancholy joe dupree lay on his bed and watched the rain fall harder and harder until at last his view through the window was entirely obscured his bones his teeth his joints they all ached as if the effort of supporting his great bulk were slowly becoming too much for them joe moaned and buried his face in his pillow tears forcing themselves from the corners of his eyes make it stop he begged please make it stop a face appeared in the darkness beyond his window a boys face the skin bluegray the eyes dark the boy reached out as if to touch the glass but made no contact instead he watched the man in uniform curl in upon himself on the huge bed until at last the pain began to ease and joe dupree fell into a troubled sleep tormented by the sound of whispering of gray figures and tunnels beneath the earth and a boy with tainted skin who gazed upon him as he slept the second day not a shred in the papers becoming all too clear not a one cares that she got away now the fear of being found a little less profound on a face thats never been fit to laugh pinetop seven the fear of being found chapter three know me wife the dream ended and now molochs features fell before him like rain it was as though a great many photographs had been taken and shredded the figures caught in the different frames intermingled smiling familiarly while glancing against strangers from other pictures yet in this downpour of images this torrent of memories he was ever the same there he sat beside parents unknown amid siblings now lost and gone he ran as a boy across sand and through sea he held a fish on the end of a hook he cried beside an open fire this was his history his past yet it seemed to encompass not one life but many lives some images were sharper than others some recollections more acute but they were all linked to him all part of the great chain of his existence he was color and he was sepia he was black and he was white he was of this time and he was of no time he was moloch and he was no one moloch awoke aware that he was being watched his ear felt raw where it had been touching the cheap material the pillow once again drenched with his sweat he thought that he could smell the woman against his face could touch her skin could feel the blade tearing through her flesh he stirred on his bunk but did not rise instead he tried to identify the man watching him through his smell his breathing the soft jangle of the equipment on his belt images from the dream still ran through his mind and he was suddenly aware of how aroused he had become but he forced himself to concentrate on the figure at the other side of the bars it was good practice his incarceration had taken the edge off his abilities in so many ways that he welcomed any opportunity to hone them once more that was the worst of his imprisonment the monotony the terrible similarity of each day to the next so that every man became a seer a fortuneteller capable of predicting the wheres and whens of each hour to come his precise location at any given time the irrevocable nature of it all threatened only by the occasional outbreaks of sickness and violence every day the wakeup call came at six am heralded by horns and coughing and the flushing of toilets two hours later the doors opened and each man stepped outside onto the cold concrete to await the first count of the day no words were permitted to be exchanged during any of the days six counts the shower followed for moloch took every opportunity offered to clean himself viewing any lapse in hygiene as the precursor to a greater collapse and then breakfast always taken seated at the same plastic chair the food seemingly designed solely to provide energy without nutrition then moloch would head to the laundry for his days work socializing little with the other men the noon count came next then lunch then more work followed by an hour in the yard then dinner another count and a retreat to his cell to read to think eight count then lights out at ten in the first weeks moloch would wake for the late counts at midnight and four but no longer he had received no visitors apart from his lawyer for over three years he made few phone calls and fewer friends a waiting game was under way and he was prepared to play his part now the game was coming to an end moloch shifted on his mattress his body once again under his control eyes closed he concentrated on smell and hearing aftershave hints of sandalwood a small rattle in the throat as the man breathed out congestion digestive noises coffee on an empty stomach reid wake up now reids voice said its your big day moloch lifted his head and saw the thin man standing at the bars the brim of his hat perfectly level against his forehead the creases on his uniform like blades set beneath the cloth reid looked away and called for to be opened moloch remained where he was for a moment or two more breathing deeply then rose from his bunk and ran his hands through his hair moloch knew the date some inmates lost track of the days while in jail many did so deliberately for there was nothing guaranteed to faster break the spirit of a man facing twenty years than an urge to count the days until his release days in prison passed slowly they were beads on a long thread an endless rosary of unanswered prayers moloch was different he counted the days kept track of hours minutes even seconds when the urge took him every moment spent inside was an injury inflicted upon him and when the time came to return those insults to his person he wanted to be sure that he did not miss a single one his count had reached days hours andhe glanced at his watch minutes spent in the dismal creek state penitentiary virginia his only regret was that the one on whom he desired to revenge himself would not live long enough to enable him to vent his rage to its ultimate degree stand straight arms out he did as he was told two guards entered chains dangling from the arms of one they secured his arms and his feet the restraints attached in turn to a chain around his chest the arrangement was known in the system as a threepiece suit dont i even get to brush my teeth he asked the guards face was expressionless why you aint going on no date you dont know that i might get lucky reid seemed almost amused i dont think so you aint got lucky by now you aint never gonna get lucky mans luck can always change i never took you for no optimist you dont know me i know enough about you to say that youre gonna die wearing them prison weeds are you my judge and jury no but come the time ill be your executioner he stood aside as the guards brought moloch out be seeing you mr reid the older man nodded thats right fact is i aim to be the last thing you see there was a black toyota land cruiser waiting for him in the prison yard standing beside it were two armed investigators from the district attorneys office moloch nodded a good morning to them but they didnt respond instead they watched as he was chained to the d ring on the floor of the suv then tested the chains and the restraints until they were satisfied that he was fully secured a wiremesh screen separated the backseat passenger from those in the front there were no handles on the inside of the rear doors and a second wire screen ran from the roof of the cruiser to the floor of the trunk behind moloch the door slammed shut noisily you take good care of him now said one of the guards wouldnt want him getting bruised or nothing well look after him said one of the investigators a tall black man named misters his partner torres closed the door on moloch then climbed into the drivers seat settle back he said to moloch you got a long ride ahead of you but moloch was silent now content it seemed to enjoy a brief taste of life outside the prison walls dupree was sipping coffee in the station house it was technically his day off but he was passing and well that was just an excuse he couldnt stay away from the place most of the other cops knew that and they didnt mind doug newton he said he was sipping coffee from the market and eating one of the doughnuts that he had bought for the two cops on duty across from him ron berman was tapping a pencil on the desk alternating each tap between the tip and the eraser end dupree found it mildly annoying but decided to say nothing he liked berman and given that some of the other cops had far more irritating habits than tapping a pencil on the desk for example dupree wondered if phil tuttle bermans partner on this tour had ever washed his hands after taking a leak he was happy enough to let berman and his pencil be for the present doug newton echoed berman i took the call and put it in the log but frankly we both had other things to do and its not like its the first time hes made that kind of claim dupree reached over and took the log from berman there it was in bermans neat hand at am almost as soon as berman and tuttle had settled in and while it was still dark on the streets doug newton had called in a report of a little girl in a gray dress tormenting his dying mother again you went out there last time right asked berman yeah i went out we organized a search i even checked with portland and with the state police to see if theyd had any reports of missing girls matching the description newton gave me there was nothing the first time tuttle had answered the call from the newton place and having kind of a short fuse had warned doug about wasting police time now just this morning doug newton had called in a third report except this one was different this time hed claimed the little girl had tried to climb through the window of his mothers bedroom doug had heard the old womans screams and had come running just in time to see the little girl disappearing into the trees or so hed said you think hes going crazy asked berman he lives with his mother and has never married replied dupree maybe he just needs to get laid i never took you for a therapist im multiskilled you think you could multiskill that pencil back into your drawer its like listening to a drummer with the shakes sorry said berman he put the pencil into the drawer then closed it just in case the temptation to retrieve it proved too great i guess dougs maybe a little odd but ive never taken him for crazy said dupree he doesnt have the imagination to make up stuff hes only ever been to two states in his life and i reckon hes not sure the other fortyeight exist seeing as how hes never visited them himself so either hes going crazy or a little girl in a gray dress really did try to get into his mothers bedroom last night berman thought about this so hes crazy then dupree tossed the log back at him apparently hes mad as a coot ill go have a talk with him today last thing we need is doug taking potshots at girl scouts selling cookies anything else on your mind berman looked troubled i think nancy tooker down at the diner may have a thing for me she gave me extra bacon yesterday for free theres a shortage of eligible men on the island shes a desperate woman shes a big woman im sure shed be gentle with you at the start dont say that that woman could break me in two shes also kind of old for you shes seriously old you think it would make a difference if i told her i was married youre not married i know but i could get married it would be worth it to keep her away my advice is dont take anything else from her for free tell her its against department policy otherwise youre going to end up paying for that bacon in kind berman looked as if he was about to upchuck his breakfast stop dont even say things like that it struck him that dupree was in surprisingly good humor this morning berman guessed that it might not be unconnected to duprees slow courtship of the elliot woman but he decided not to comment upon it partly out of sensitivity for the big cops feelings and partly out of concern for his own personal safety i think youd make a nice couple said dupree i can just see the two of you together well i could see nancy anyway youd be kind of lost somewhere underneath berman unclipped his holster dont make me shoot you he said save the last bullet for yourself said dupree as he headed out it may be your only hope of escape far to the south close to the town of great bridge virginia a man named braun walked back to his car carrying two cups of coffee on a cardboard tray packets of sugar poking out of his breast pocket he crossed the street slipped into the passenger seat and handed one of the coffee cups to his companion whose name was dexter dexter was black and kind of ugly braun was redheaded but handsome despite it he had heard all the redhead jokes in fact hed heard most of them from dexter careful he said its hot dexter looked at the plain white cup in distaste you couldnt find a starbucks they dont have a starbucks here youre kidding me theres a starbucks everywhere not here shit dexter sipped the coffee its not bad but its no starbucks its better than starbucks you ask me least it tastes like coffee yeah but thats the thing about starbucks its coffee but it doesnt taste like coffee its not supposed to taste like coffee its supposed to taste like starbucks but not coffee no not coffee coffee you can get anywhere starbucks you can get only in starbucks brauns cell phone buzzed he picked it up and hit the green button yeah he said he listened for a time said okay then hung up were all set he told dexter but dexter wasnt paying attention to him look at that said dexter indicating with his chin braun followed the direction of the other mans gaze on a corner a small black kid who might have been in his early teens but looked younger had just exchanged a dime spot with an older kid he looks young said braun you get up close to him see his eyes he wont seem so young streets already worn him down its eating him up from the inside braun nodded but said nothing that could have been me said dexter maybe you sell that shit something like it howd you get out dexter shook his head his eyes losing their glare just momentarily he saw himself in his brandnew levislevis then not those saggyass norep jeans that the younger kids wore now all straps and white stitchingwalking across the basketball court glass crunching beneath the soles of his sneakers ex was sitting on a bench alone his feet on the seat his back against the wire of the court a newspaper in his hands hey little man ex short for exorcist because he loved that movie twentyone and so secure in himself that he could sit alone on a fall day reading a newspaper as if he didnt have a care in the world what you want he was smiling pretending that he was dexters best buddy that he hadnt crippled a twelveyearold the week before for coming up short the kid wailing and crying as ex knelt on his chest and put the gun barrel against the kids ankle that same smile on his face as he pulled the trigger the kids street name was blade on account of his father being called gillette it was a good name dexter liked it liked blade too they used to look out for each other now there was nobody to look out for dexter but he would continue to look out for blade as best he could exs smile was still in place but any residual warmth it might once have contained had begun to die from the eyes down i said hey little man you got nothing to say back to me dexter thirteen years old looked up at ex and removed his gloved hands from the pockets of his lakers jacket he was unused to the weight of the gun and he needed both hands to raise it ex stared down the stubby barrel of the bryco he opened his mouth to say something but it was lost in the roar of the gun ex toppled backward his head striking the wire fence of the court as he fell and landed in a heap on the ground his legs splayed against the back of the bench dexter looked down at him the bullet had hit ex in the chest and he was bleeding from the mouth hey he whispered he looked hurt as if the young boy had just called him a bad name hey little man dexter fired the final shot then walked away dexter you okay braun nudged dexters arm with an elbow yeah im here im here man we got to go yeah we got to go he took one last look at the kid on the cornerhey little manthen started the car and pulled away by coincidence some twenty miles to the north two men with a similar racial profile were also drinking coffee except they had found a starbucks and were drinking grande americanos from big starbucks mugs one of them was shepherd the grayhaired man of few vices his companion was named tell he was small and wiry and he wore his hair in cornrows like the basketball player allen iverson used to wear his and probably for the same reason because it made white folks uneasy tell was reading a newspaper tell was very conscientious about reading the newspaper every day unfortunately that days newspaper happened to be a supermarket tabloid and in shepherds opinion tell could have been reading the back of a cornflakes box and been better informed the gossip sheets werent big on analysis and shepherd liked to think of himself as an analytical kind of guy two seats down from them in the otherwise deserted coffee shop an arab was talking loudly on his cell phone tapping his finger on the table before him to emphasize his points in fact he was talking so loudly that shepherd wasnt even certain that his phone was turned on the guy behaved like he was trying to shout his message all the way to the middle east and was holding the cell phone only out of habit hed been talking like this for the better part of ten minutes and shepherd could see that tell was getting pissed hed watched him start the same story about some hasbeen pop stars facelift three times already which was once more than tell usually needed to take in what he was reading truth be told shepherd was kind of unhappy about it himself he didnt like cell phones people were rude enough as it was without having another excuse to be badmannered tell looked up hey man he said to the arab can you keep it down the arab ignored him this led shepherd to suspect that the arab was either very arrogant or very dumb because tell didnt look even remotely like the kind of person you ignored tell looked like the kind of person who would remove your spine if you ignored him tells face wore a puzzled expression as he leaned in closer to the arab i said can you talk a little quieter please im trying to read my newspaper shepherd thought tell was being very polite it made him nervous go fuck yourself said the arab tell blinked then folded his newspaper shepherd reached an arm across holding his friend back dont he said over at the counter a barista was watching them with interest you hear what that raghead motherfucker said i heard forget it the arab continued talking even after hed finished his coffee with a slurp tell stood and shepherd followed blocking his partners access to the arab tell bobbed on the balls of his feet for a second or two then turned and walked out shows over said shepherd to the barista i guess he sounded a little disappointed tell was already waiting in the van across the street his fingers tapping a rhythm on the steering wheel shepherd got in beside him we going you know we got a schedule to keep no we aint going yet fine they waited ten minutes later the arab emerged he was still talking on his phone he climbed into a black suv did a uturn and headed north i hate suvs said tell theyre a topheavy cab on a pickups chassis they drive like shit theyre dangerous and theyre ecologically unsound shepherd just sighed tell started the van and began following the suv they stayed with the arab until he turned into an alleyway at the side of a trendy middle eastern restaurant tell parked then opened the drivers door and headed toward the alleyway shepherd followed hey you prick the arab turned to see tell bearing down on him he tried to hit the alarm button on his car keys but tell wrenched them from his hands before he got the chance he hurled the keys to the ground tore the arabs cell phone from his left hand and threw it after the keys finally he dragged the arab around the back of the building so that they were hidden from the pedestrians on the sidewalk you remember me he said he pushed the arab against the wall im mr gofuckmyself the fuck do you get off talking to me like that i was polite to you you fuck i asked you nice and what do you do you disrespect me you suvdriving motherfucker he slapped the arab hard across the face the arabs face contorted with fear he was fat with chubby fingers overloaded with gold rings he was no match for tell im sorry no you aint sorry said tell youre scared and that aint the same thing i didnt come down here after you you wouldnt have given me a second thought and next time you was in starbucks youd have shouted your damn head off all over again disturbing people and giving them a pain in the ass he punched the arab in the nose and felt it break beneath his fist the arab curled up cupping his damaged nose in his hands so dont tell me youre sorry look at you my people came over here in chains i bet you flew your ass over here business class he hit the arab hard across the head with the palm of his hand dont ever let me see you talking on that phone again motherfucker you get one warning and this is it he began to walk away behind him the arab leaned against the wall examined the blood on his fingers then bent down to retrieve his possessions his car keys first then his cell phone the cell phone made a scraping noise against the concrete as he gathered it up tell stopped he looked back at the arab you dumb fuck he said he walked back drawing his gun from beneath his jacket the arabs eyes widened tell kicked him hard in the belly and he fell to the ground while shepherd watched he placed the gun against the arabs head and pulled the trigger the arab spasmed and then his fingers slowly released their grip on the phone i warned you said tell i did warn you he put the gun back in his belt and rejoined shepherd shepherd cast a last glance back at the dead arab then fell into step beside tell he looked at his partner in puzzlement i thought your people were from albany he said leonie and powell sat in silence outside the courthouse watching as moloch was led in by the two investigators from the das office leonie wore her hair in an afro and looked to powell a little like one of those kickass niggers from the seventies cleopatra jones and foxy brown not that powell would ever have called leonie a nigger to her face or even a dyke although as far as powell was concerned she was both he didnt doubt for one moment that leonie would kill him if he uttered either of those words in her presence and if by some miracle he did manage to avoid being killed and the only way that he could see that happening was if he managed to kill her first then dexter would come after him and finish the job dexter and leonie were like brother and sister braun seemed to get on okay with her too powell wasnt going to screw around with dexter and braun didnt matter how many funny stories braun told or how much highfiving and smiling dexter fit into a day powell leaned back in his seat and ran his fingers through his long hair losing them in the curls at the back powell was the type of guy who would say nice mullet and mean it his hairstyle was trailer trash crossed with eighties glam metal and he loved it his face was unnaturally tan and his teeth were bleached so white that they glowed at night powell had bmoviestar looks the artificial kind that oozed insincerity he had even gotten some professional shots taken five or six years back a couple of newspapers had used them during coverage of his trial powell had been secretly pleased although no offers of acting work had followed his eventual release its hot said powell leonie said nothing he looked over at her but her eyes were fixed on the courthouse he knew leonie hated his guts but that was kind of why he was with her he was with leonie and tell was with shepherd because he and tell were the new guys and they had to be watched closely it was good practice nothing more and powell didnt resent it powell would rather have been with shepherd but tell was such a prickly motherfucker that there was no way of knowing what he might have said to leonie if he was stuck with her for a day shit theyd be cleaning what was left of him off the inside of the van for the next month compared to tell powell was a regular diplomat so powell kept his mouth closed and waited amusing himself by imagining leonie in a variety of poses with white girls chinese latinos and powell himself slap bang in the middle man he thought if she only knew what i was thinking sharon macy spent the morning doing laundry collecting her dry cleaning and generally catching up on all of the stuff she had let pile up while she was working she then drove out to golds gym over at the maine mall and did her regular cardiovascular workout spending so long on the stairmaster that her legs felt like marshmallow when she stepped off and the machine itself was drenched with her sweat afterward she headed over to the big sky bread company and was tempted to undo all her good work with a danish but instead settled for the soupandsandwich deal she ate in one of the booths while looking over the southern edition of the forecaster the free newspaper that dealt with local news in south portland scarborough and cape elizabeth a cop in the cape elizabeth pd was seeking donations of mannequin heads to display his collection of hats from police departments around the world the south portland red riots golf team had donated a new bus to the school system and a pair of mens gloves had been found on mountain road falmouth macy was still amazed by the fact that someone would take the time to place an ad in the forecaster in order to return a pair of lost gloves they were strange people up here they kept to themselves preferring to mind their own business and let other folks mind theirs in return but they were capable of acts of touching generosity when the circumstances called for it she recalled last years first snowstorm a blizzard that had swept up the coast from just above boston and blanketed the state as far north as calais she had heard sounds in the early morning coming from the parking lot of her apartment and had looked out to see two complete strangers digging out her car not just her car either but every car in the lot they had then shouldered their spades and identities still unrevealed had moved on to the car in the next driveway there was something hugely admirable about such anonymous kindness to strangers she skipped to the police beat page scanning the names in the list of arrests and summonses the usual duis thefts by unauthorized taking or transfer a couple of marijuana collars she recognized one or two of the names but there was nothing worth noting if there had been she figured that they would have heard about it on the grapevine by now her meal finished she drove downtown and parked in the public markets parking garage she bought some fresh produce from one of the stalls in order to get her parking validated for two hours then headed up congress to the center for maine history she walked down the little pathway by the side of the wadsworthlongfellow house and entered the reading room ignoring the sign that invited her to register her name and the reason for her visit in the librarys logbook the librarian behind the desk was in his late seventies she figured but judging from the gleam in his eye as he smiled at her he was a long way from dead hi id like to see whatever you have on dutch island she said sure said the librarian may i ask what your interest is in dutch im a police officer im heading out there soon im just curious to find out a little about it youll be working with joe dupree then yes so i understand hes a good man i knew his father and he was a good man too he disappeared among the stacks behind the counter and returned with a manila file it looked disappointingly thin the librarian registered her expression i know but there hasnt been too much written on dutch fact is we need a good history of the islands of casco bay period all we got here are cuttings and this he removed a thin sheaf of typescript pages from the folder stapled crudely along the spine this was written maybe ten years ago by larry amerling hes the postmaster out on the island its about the most detailed thing we have although like as not youll find something too in caldwells islands of maine and millers kayaking the maine coast he retrieved the books in question for her then settled back in his chair as macy found a space at one of the study tables there were one or two other people doing research in the library although macy was the youngest person in the room by almost half a century she opened the folder took out amerlings a short history of dutch island and began to read torres and misters led moloch back to the land cruiser deliberately keeping up a fast pace the restraints on molochs legs causing the prisoner to stumble slightly on the final steps you asshole moloch said torres moloch tried to maintain his concentration the grandjury hearing had been a bore for him so they had found the body of a woman and versosmall foolish versowas prepared to testify that he had helped willard and moloch dispose of her in the woods after moloch had killed her sfw so fucking what as soon as the direction of the prosecutors questions had become apparent moloch had begun to speak like a handicapped man talking through his nose the words barely intelligible is there something wrong with him the judge had asked but it had been moloch who provided the answer sorry your honor hed said modifying his speech sufficiently for his words to be understood but i was kissing your wife good night and the bitch closed her legs that had been the end of the proceedings you hear me repeated torres youre an asshole why am i an asshole said moloch he didnt look at the men at either side of him neither did he look at the chains on his hands or his feet so used was he to the shuffling gait their presence necessitated he would not fall the investigators would not allow him to fall not with people watching but still they kept him moving quickly depriving him of even the small dignity of walking like a man you know why maybe i just felt the urge to jerk that old judges chain some you sure jerked it said torres you surely did and dont you think it wont come back on you because it will you mark my words theyll take your books away leave you nothing to do but shit sleep and jerk off then ill be thinking of you except maybe not when i sleep you fucking asshole youre a dead man youll get the juice for this doesnt matter how much you mouth off to the judge sticks and stones mr torres sticks and stones they reached the car moloch smiling at last for the cameras then he was put in back and his chains locked once again to the d ring its been fun spending time with you both moloch said i appreciated the company well said torres i cant say im looking forward to the pleasure again and you mr misters said moloch but misters didnt respond mr misters repeated moloch savoring the words on his tongue extending the s sounds into long washes of sibilance like water evaporating from the surface of a hot stove wasnt that kind of the name of some suckass whitebread band in the eighties broken wings that was them right misters remained silent your partner doesnt say very much does he said moloch to torres hes kind of fussy about who he talks to well maybe hell find it in him to say a few words before the journeys end you think so im certain i can be a very interesting conversationalist i doubt that well see said moloch well see and for the next five miles he hummed the chorus of broken wings over and over and over until torres broke down and threatened to gag him only then when the young investigator was sufficiently rattled did moloch stop the surroundings of the library had faded around macy she was no longer conscious of the old librarian the other researchers or the occasional rattle as the main door opened the cold air accompanying it instead she was lost in the history of dutch island the history of sanctuary the native americans had fought hard to maintain their hold on the islands of casco bay like modernday tourists they summered on the islands fishing and hunting porpoises and seals even the occasional whale chebeague was their main base but they used others too and were resentful of the gradual encroachments of white settlers the islands were the centers of population in the new colonies they were easy to defend safer than the mainland and offered an abundant source of food from the ocean macy noticed that a lot of them like dutch island had multiple names great chebeague was once merry island then recompense peaks island was formerly munjoys miltons and michaels the name changing as the owners changed despite their relative safety the islands were still frequently attacked in the late seventeenth century settlers who were fleeing the atrocities on harpswell neck and other islands nearer the coast built a fort on jewell on the outer ring in september a bloody year with attacks on whites at casco neck and back cove the families on jewell were attacked by eight canoes of warriors and were so disturbed by the experience that they retreated to richmond island for the remainder of the year the natives rampaged along the coast annihilating every settlement between the piscataqua and kennebec rivers the settlers dug in although some gave up and found safer places to live inland in the natives raided peaks island the most accessible island from the mainland and slaughtered many of its inhabitants one year later they returned and forced the remaining settlers from the island dutch island named for a dutch sailor named chris herschdorfer who was briefly shipwrecked there toward the end of the seventeenth century was a different matter it was farther from the mainland and the distance made the crossing difficult for the indians who had only birchbark canoes in which to travel furthermore they regarded the island with suspicion and seemed content to leave it unexplored shortly after the indian raid on peaks major benjamin church whose soldiers had been present on peaks during the course of the main attack led an expedition to the island and found it to be heavily forested with only a handful of suitable landings for boats yet it was to dutch that a man named thomas lunt led a group of settlers in weary of the running battles he was forced to fight with the natives in total thirty settlers joined him in the first two weeks on the island that he renamed sanctuary among them survivors of the attacks on jewell and peaks and their numbers continued to increase over the following months they opted to settle away from the shore hoping that the higher ground might make them less vulnerable to a surprise attack at this point amerlings history of the island became less detailed and more speculative but it seemed that the behavior of one of the settlers a man named buer grew increasingly unpredictable he became estranged from his family spending more and more time alone in the thick forest at the center of the island he was accused of attempted rape by the wife of one of his fellow settlers and when her husband and three other men attempted to hunt him down as he tried to flee he killed one of them with a musket shot and then sought shelter with his wife begging her to hide him claiming that he had done nothing wrong but she fearful for her own life for she was as disturbed as anyone by the change in her husband betrayed him to his accusers he was chained to a post in a barn but somehow he escaped from the island stealing a boat and disappearing to the mainland he returned some months later in the winter of at the head of a party of armed men and renegade indians and led the slaughter of the settlers on sanctuary including his own wife one of the settlers a woman survived her wounds long enough to tell of what had occurred even now three hundred years later macy found herself wincing at the details there was rape and torture many of the women were assaulted then bound and thrown alive into a patch of bog where they drowned no distinction was made between adults and children the search for the killers was led by three hunters from the island who had traveled to the mainland to trade on behalf of the settlement and were therefore absent when the massacre occurred it was said that they tracked down a number of those involved in the attack and dispensed swift justice upon them years later the son of one of those hunters would be among those who resettled sanctuary his name was jerome dupree crow had stolen away from the group almost as soon as the canoes touched land grateful only that he had survived the voyage he had positioned himself behind the white leader in the second canoe his hand upon his knife throughout the journey hidden beneath a rough woven cloak if they tried to take him he would place his knife upon the throat of the white leader and hold him hostage until they reached the mainland he suspected that the white leader knew what he was planning for he could see the knowledge in his eyes and his lieutenant the man named barone remained seated in the bow of the boat with his back to the coast a musket on his lap as he watched crow from the safety of the woods crow saw the white leader kill the mikmaqs in their sleep in truth crow had been planning to kill them himself there had long been tension between his people and their own and it was only the hand of the white leader and the protection offered by his guns that had kept him from slitting their throats before now crow would like to have killed the white leader and considered remaining close to the camp in the hope of disposing of him but english soldiers had come alerted to the presence of the men whom they sought and a skirmish had commenced crow escaped from the woods in the confusion and when he returned three of the white leaders killers were dead and one was a captive the indians plan was to make for the area around the chandiere river it was inhospitable territory but there he believed he would be safe for a time from his own people and from the english who had placed a price upon his head crow longed to regain his place among his tribe which now dwelt by stcastins settlement on the bagaduce river there the frenchman who had reestablished french control over southwestern acadia after its occupation by the english had built a habitation that broke with the traditional model typically adopted by the europeans there were no defensive walls around the main dwelling and the storehouse instead protection came from the thirtytwo wigwams surrounding the settlement housing wabanaki whom the french termed etchemin stcastin had even married into the tribe taking for his bride pidiwamiska the daughter of the sachem madockawando and sister to crow it was his objection to the union and subsequent revolt against his fathers rule that had led to crows banishment crow despised the europeans he knew that more would come and stcastins marriage to his sister represented the beginning of the dilution of the old ways already there was less game to hunt and great numbers of his people were dying in strange unfamiliar ways taken by invisible ailments that had never existed before the coming of the whites gluskap the great creator of the maine natives had fled when he sensed the coming of the europeans abandoning them to their fate crow believed that gluskap would never return as long as wabanaki dwelt with the europeans giving to them their women and protecting them from their enemies through the white leader crow was able to strike back at the hated french and english but by the time of the raid on sanctuary he knew that the uneasy alliance was drawing to an end and that the hour would come when the white leaders musket would be used upon his guide so crow turned his back to the sea and headed for the wilderness to the west not knowing that three new names had been added to the list of those who hunted him the three hunters the last living remnants of the settlement on sanctuary searched for their prey without rest and once found disposed of them without mercy it took them four years the names and descriptions of the men whom they sought had been obtained from the english in portland who had tortured their captive a man named mundy until he informed on his companions they were aided in their aims by the reluctance of the perpetrators to leave for long the northeastern territories familiar to them and in which they had families and allies who might give them succor the first they killed in wells as he tried to make his way south to establish contact with his brother who lived near fort william amp mary two died at winter harbor fleeing the indian raid on the settlement and falling instead to the knives of the hunters as queen annes war raged around them they hanged one at norridgewock taken as he and two fellow cutthroats shadowed the hilton expedition in the hope of stealing supplies they tracked another north through acadia eventually confronting him by the shores of the northumberland strait and as he pleaded for mercy they drowned him in the icy waters of barone and the man the natives termed the white leader they found no trace at the end of their long hunt they were weary of bloodshed and revenge and had made the decision to travel back to the islands when they encountered a small french patrol escorting parties of natives to the saint lawrence river where they hoped to find shelter from the english under french protection aiding the french was a guide his tribal tattoos defaced with hot irons a man who always stayed apart from the families he was guiding it was the wabanaki killer known as crow the hunters tracked the party beyond the dead river where the natives were handed over to the care of more soldiers after resting for three days the french soldiers ten of them in total prepared to make the journey east once more in order to winter in acadia with crow as their guide by now the hunters were more accomplished killers than the soldiers and they had no love for the french one day into their journey when the soldiers stopped to make camp for the night they were attacked as they sat around their campfire tired and unprepared for fighting the first five died in the glow of the flames three more were taken in the woods and two escaped to tell of what had occurred the hunters trapped crow by the banks of the river he held a knife in one hand and an ax in the other his musket its shot wasted in the confusion of the initial attack lay at his feet he watched silently as the three men emerged from the trees their faces hooded their bodies draped in furs they stopped when they were some twenty feet from him and their leader raised his hands and dropped the hood that hid his features do you know who i am he said crow merely shook his head my name is dupree you killed my wife when said crow four years ago on an island called sanctuary for a moment crow did not move it seemed almost as though the tension in his body dissipated as he realized that the hunt was now over and that the time to join his ancestors had come at last then his hands tightened on his weapons and he opened his mouth wide as he ran toward his pursuers his last great scream echoing through the night as the first snows of winter fell upon him the muskets roared and crow fell backward into the water the river carried him away and his name was never spoken again according to amerlings history buer the one crow knew as the white leader and his lieutenant barone evaded capture there were those who said that buer was not his real name and that a man fitting his description but with the name of seera was wanted in massachusetts in connection with the deaths of two women there in any event he disappeared after the events on sanctuary and was never seen again barone also vanished amerling went on to cover the abduction of a woman in the disappearance of the men who had taken her to dutch and the subsequent discovery of one of them buried in the forest the dupree name cropped up again and again and it was one of joe duprees ancestors who had made the stone cross that still stood amid the sunken remains of the old settlement and the graves of those who had died there there was no mention of george sherrin who was found entangled in tree roots it was amerlings final paragraph that most intrigued macy it read to those looking in upon the island from outside its history may appear bloody and strange yet those of us who have lived here for many years and whose fathers and grandfathers and greatgrandfathers lie buried in the islands cemetery have grown used to the strangeness of dutch island here paths through the forest disappear in the space of a single week and new paths take their place so that a man may one day walk a trail familiar to him yet find himself directed toward new surroundings by the end of it we are used to the silences and we are used to the sounds that are native only to this small patch of land we live in the shadow of its history and walk by the gift of those who have gone before us macy closed the slim volume and returned to the desk the names encountered in amerlings history still rattling around in her head church lunt buer barone barone barron it was probably just a coincidence she thought although it would explain why barron was such a creep if his unpleasantness was part of a proud family tradition you find what you were looking for asked the librarian no said macy i was hoping for answers maybe youll have better luck on the island maybe she said out on sanctuary joe dupree was also finding himself short on answers he had taken a ride out to doug newtons house as he had promised berman newton and his mother lived near seal cove close to the southernmost tip of the island their house was one of the oldest on sanctuary and one of the most carefully maintained doug had given it a fresh coat of paint the previous spring so that it seemed to shine amid the trees that surrounded it the old woman wasnt long for this earth dupree could see it in her face could smell it in her room when she died the doctors would find some complicated way to explain her demise but for joe and doug and perhaps for the old woman herself there was nothing complicated about it she was just old she was in her late eighties and her body was losing its final struggle to keep her alive her breathing was shallow and rasping and the skin on her face and hands was almost translucent in its pallor she was in no pain and there was nothing that a hospital could do for her now so her son had taken her home to die debra legere who had some nursing experience dropped by for four or five hours each day sometimes a little longer if doug had some work to do although he was pretty much retired by now dupree figured that there was an arrangement between debra who was a widow and doug who had never married but he wasnt about to pry into it in any case they were both strict baptists so there appeared to be a limit to the amount of arranging that they could do dupree stood at the window of the old womans room and looked down to the yard below it was a sheer drop this side of the house was flat there was a kitchen below but since doug had never found the need to extend it farther it remained flush with the main wall the way dupree saw it there was just no way that a little girl could reach the topmost window in the house did she have a stepladder doug he asked softly dougs mother had awakened briefly when they entered the room but had now slipped back into her troubled sleep doug seemed to think about bristling then decided that it wasnt worth the trouble i know what youre thinking he said its nothing that i havent asked myself how did she get up here the answer is that i dont know im just telling you what i saw the window was locked dupree tested the sash with his hand it seemed solid enough as far as i remember it could be that i didnt close it properly and the wind might have blown it open except that there was no wind that night and anyway who ever heard of a wind that could blow a heavy sash window upward dupree stared into the forest the window faced northeast he could see the islands central watchtower from where he stood and part of the border of sunken trees that marked the boundary of the site you think im crazy asked doug dupree shook his head he didnt know what to think except that it still seemed unlikely that a little girl could magic her way twenty feet off the ground in order to attack an old woman in her bedroom you always seemed pretty levelheaded to me he said at last what can i say keep the windows locked the doors too you got a gun doug nodded more than one well for crying out loud dont use any of them the last thing i want to do is to have to haul you in for shooting someone doug said that he would bear it in mind it wasnt exactly a promise that he wouldnt shoot anybody but it was better than nothing dupree was about to leave the room when a piece of paper seemingly caught by a draft rose from a corner by the drapes and then settled again the policeman leaned down to examine it more closely and found himself looking at a moth it was ugly and gray with yellow markings along its body its wings fluttered feebly doug can you get me an empty mayo jar or something with a lid on it the older man found a jelly jar dupree scooped the moth from the floor then refitted the lid carefully he used his pocketknife to bore a hole in the top in order to allow the insect some air although he guessed that it didnt have long to live holding the jar up to the light from the window he examined the moth turning the bottle slowly to look at its wings and its markings doug newton squinted at it then shook his head ive never seen a moth like that before he said beside him dupree felt an uncomfortable ache spreading across his belly suddenly doug newtons tale of a levitating girl didnt seem so farfetched he swallowed hard i have he said they were four miles from the prison following the banks of the river when they saw the body the dismal creek state penitentiary lay at the end of an isolated road with little traffic apart from prison vehicles anyone who found himself in trouble on that road was likely to be waiting a long time for help hell is that asked misters looks like a woman said torres pull over the woman lay by the side of the road her legs splayed her shoulders and head hidden in the long grass that grew by the hard shoulder her legs and buttocks were exposed where her skirt had ridden up over them they pulled up a few feet from her and torres got out misters about to follow until torres told him to stay back keep an eye on him said torres hes going nowhere said misters but he still remained close to the car and aware of moloch who was watching the proceedings with interest the woman was not moving and torres could see blood on her back he leaned down and spread the grass that obscured her head oh sweet he saw the red exposed flesh where her head should have been then turned his face away in time to catch the slug on the bridge of his nose he crumpled to the ground as misters went for his own weapon but a shadow fell across him and he looked up to see one of his own a brother holding a shotgun on him from the grass at the other side of the road another man emerged this one younger with blond hair and a pretty almost feminine face behind him was a muscular man with short red hair wearing tight faded jeans and a tshirt decorated with the stars and stripes the redheaded man took misterss gun then used plastic restraints to tie the investigators hands behind his back meanwhile the blond kid knelt by torres and removed the keys from his belt and the gun from his holster then he walked over to the land cruiser opened the door and released moloch from his chains moloch stretched as he emerged from the car then took torress gun from the kid and walked over to where misters squatted he raised the gun and pointed at the investigators head now mr misters do you have anything to say to me misters didnt open his mouth he looked up at moloch with mingled fear and disgust i could shoot you said moloch shoot you like the boorish dog that you are he aimed the gun bang he said he tipped the muzzle to his mouth and blew a stream of imaginary smoke from the barrel but im not going to shoot you he said we taking him with us asked dexter no if we leave him hell identify us really asked moloch he stared hard at misters oh that my eyes might see and my tongue might speak he said of what wonders might i tell he turned to the young white boy blind him then cut his tongue out he never had much use for it anyway they worked quickly pushing the suv into the river the body of torres and the woman inside it misters they left bleeding and in shock by the riverbank the whole operation had taken less than three minutes braun made a call on his cell phone and seconds later they were joined by powell and leonie who had been driving the lookout vans positioned two hundred yards at either side of the ambush area their sides decorated with the removable logo of a nonexistent forestry company so that if any other car had taken that road before their work was done they could be held back with a story about a fallen tree in the event no other vehicle had troubled them then the little convoy five men and one woman in two vans headed at speed toward the highway and the north dexter leonie and moloch drove in silence for a time dexter glancing occasionally in his side mirror three cars behind were braun powell and the boy and that suited dexter just fine the boy willard gave him the creeps the beauty and seeming innocence of him all the more unsettling for what lay beneath still moloch liked him and he had proved useful in the end he had found the woman trawling the side roads the bars and cheap motels for almost a week before hed come across a suitable candidate as hed described her then he had killed her and brought her remains to the meeting place on time dexter was a clever guy maybe not as clever as he thought he was but still pretty smart all things considered hed done some reading and liked books on psychology dexter figured that if you were going to be dealing with people then you should try to find out as much as possible about the general principles behind them he particularly liked the abnormal stuff because in his line of work abnormal was what he dealt with on a daytoday basis he knew all about sociopaths and psychopaths and assorted other deviants and had begun to categorize the freaks he had met according to his diagnosis of their particular abnormality but willard dexter hadnt found a book that dealt with anything quite like willard before willard was off the scale in fact dexter wasnt even sure that willard was entirely human although that wasnt the kind of thing that he was about to say out loud in the company of moloch or anybody else but sometimes he found willard staring at him and when he looked into the kids eyes it was like falling into a void dexter figured that dying in space might feel something like seeing oneself reflected in willards eyes there was only nothingness masquerading as blackness it wasnt even hostile it was just blank what are you thinking about asked moloch stuff dont you go giving too much away now like i said just stuff beside him leonie just stared silently at the passing cars willard stuff said moloch howd you know that i was watching you i saw you look in the mirror your face changed i can read you like a book dex i dont like him ive never been anything but straight with you and im telling you the truth of it now hes out there hes been useful yeah and loyal to you thats all that matters with respect man you been in jail these past three years difficult to work with someone who dont answer to anyone but a man in a prison suit but you managed it i got a lot of patience and the verso thing was a piece of luck yes said moloch i take it something is being done about him as we speak you should have gotten willard to do it he never liked verso i never liked him either but i didnt dislike the man enough to sic willard on him you see what he did to the woman he cut on her pretty bad before or after i didnt ask then im not planning on asking either me i figure before is this conversation leading somewhere dexter take a look at the newspaper its somewhere back there moloch seated in the semidarkness at the back of the van checked among the boxes and drapes until he found the newspaper its frontpage story detailed the discovery of four bodies in a house south of broughton four bodiesthree male one femaleand two headsone male one femalein the refrigerator one female body minus a head remained unaccounted for its all over the tv too way i figure it willard was probably holed up there for a time you can bet your last nickel that somebody saw him around there and pretty soon his face is going to be plastered right up there beside yours hes getting worse in the darkness of the van dexter heard moloch sigh regretfully youre saying hes a liability damn straight then i must be a liability too dexter glanced back at him youre the reason were here willard aint it was some minutes before moloch spoke again from behind dexter keep a close eye on him but do nothing for now man thought dexter i been keeping a close eye on him since the first time i met him powell was dozing and there was no conversation between braun and willard in the van behind that suited braun just fine unlike dexter the redheaded man didnt have too much against willard he just figured him for another one of molochs crazies but that didnt mean he wanted to talk to him more than was absolutely necessary of the five people who now accompanied moloch north braun was probably the closest to being a regular guy although a killer he like shepherd did not favor unnecessary violence and had willingly acceded to their request to watch the road while they disposed of the investigators braun was in it for the money he was a good wheel man a reliable operator he stayed calm even in the worst situations every group needed its braun braun just wanted his share of the cash he figured that some people were going to get hurt in the process but that was nothing to do with him that was down to moloch braun would quite happily have walked away without hurting anyone as long as the money was in his hand but leonie and dexter and willard and the others needed more than that they liked a little action he looked over at willard but the boys attention was elsewhere his gaze fixed on the road braun didnt mind the silence just as he didnt mind willard still he patted the hilt of the knife that lay along the edge of his thigh and felt a small surge of reassurance braun didnt mind willard but he sure as hell didnt trust him either braun was smarter than any of them willard stared at the blacktop passing beneath them and thought of the woman it had taken her a long time to stop screaming after the man had died she had tried to start the car and had almost succeeded before willard got to the window and broke it with the blade of the machete when he took the car keys in his fingers and yanked them from the ignition something faded in the womans eyes it was the death of hope and though she started pleading then she knew it was all over willard had shushed her i aint going to hurt you he had told her i promise just you calm down now i aint going to hurt you at all the woman was crying snot and tears dribbling down her chin she was begging him the words almost indistinguishable willard had shown her the machete then had allowed her to see him tossing it away come on now he said see you got nothing to be scared about and she had wanted to believe him she had wanted to believe him so badly that she allowed herself to do so and she had permitted him to take her hand and help her from the car he had turned her away from the remains of the manyou dont have to see thatas he led her toward the house but something about that gaping doorway and the blackness within had set her off again she tried to run and willard had to tackle her and take her down by holding on to her legs he let her scream as he hauled her toward the house by the legs her nails breaking as she tried to get a grip on the dirt there was nobody to hear her willard cast a longing glance over at the machete lying in the grass it was his favorite he could always go back and get it later he thought and he had lots of other toys inside shepherd saw the pizzadelivery car first the saturn had a big plastic slice strapped to the roof like a shark fin shepherd hoped the guy was making a lot in tips because the job didnt come with a whole heap of dignity he started the van and pulled in alongside the kid as he retrieved the pizza boxes from the insulated bag on the backseat he heard the back of the van open and pulled his ski mask down over his head seconds later tell his face also concealed by a mask forced the kid into the van at gunpoint there were no other people in the parking lot of the motel look man said the kid i dont carry more than ten bucks in change take off your jacket said tell the kid did as he was told handing it over to tell shepherd leaned across the bench seats at the front of the van and tapped the kid on the shoulder with his gun you stay there and you keep quiet my friend is going to deliver your pizza for you after that were gonna drive away from here well drop you off along the way its up to you if you walk out or we dump whats left of you understand the kid nodded you go to college asked shepherd the kid nodded again figures youre smart the van door closed leaving them alone together tell now wearing the kids red pizza heaven jacket climbed the stairs to the second floor of the motel and knocked on the door he pulled the ski mask from his face and waited who is it said a voice pizza said tell he saw a face at the window as the curtain moved then the door opened there was a guy in a white shirt and red tie standing before him behind him was a tall white man with receding hair and a beer gut what do we owe you said the das investigator as tell reached a hand into the insulated bag for mr verso said tell its on the house the bottom of the bag exploded and the investigator staggered backward tells second shot sent him sprawling across the bed verso tried to run for the bathroom but tell shot him in the back before he got to the door then stood over him and fired two shots into the back of his head he fired one more into the man on the bed then walked swiftly back down to the van shepherd started it as soon as tell reached the door your mask he said shit tell pulled it back down before he climbed in behind him the pizzadelivery guy sat with his knees drawn up to his chin you okay asked tell yeah said the kid you did good said tell you got nothing to worry about put this on your head he handed the insulated bag to the kid who did as he was told they drove back onto the highway then pulled over at a deserted rest stop tell opened the back door and helped the kid over to one of the wooden picnic benches theres a phone to your right i was you i wouldnt use it for about another twenty minutes okay okay you breathing okay under that thing im fine good mister said the kid yeah please dont kill me as shepherd had noted the kid was smart tell raised the silenced pistol and pointed it at the insulated bag i wont he said as he pulled the trigger they bought hamburgers at a fastfood joint off exit and ate them seated in the back of the van while they waited for shepherd and tell to join them they were avoiding toll booths and were sticking to the speed limits in the back of the van moloch had clipped his hair shaved his beard and now wore a pair of blackrimmed glasses his drivers license claimed that he was john r oster of lancaster ohio how much longer moloch asked hour maybe said dexter we can rest up then moloch shook his head we move on theyre already looking for me and pretty soon my picture will be on every tv station from here to canada we need to find her and find her fast despite what he said he wasnt too concerned yet he had sometimes spoken of mexico as his preferred final destination in the event of an escape from custody because mexico following a decision by the mexican supreme court that life sentences breached a constitutional article that stated all men were capable of being rehabilitated would not extradite americans facing life sentences moloch didnt believe that for one moment but he figured that there would be those in the prison population who would recall his comments and who would pass them on it would not be enough to prevent checks to the north and west as well as to the south but he hoped that it might force the police to concentrate their efforts on monitoring the southern routes he sat back in the van and closed his eyes he was strong and he had a purpose he allowed himself to drift into sleep and dreamed of a woman a woman dying chapter four danny was pleading mom just ten more minutes five more minutes please marianne peered at him from over the rim of her glasses danny was in his pajamas which was something but it had taken her an hour to convince him to do even that he seemed to have grown up so much in the last year and she was beginning to find him more and more difficult to handle he was always questioning always doubting testing the limits of her authority in every little thing but that incident with the bird had thrown him exposing his vulnerability and drawing him back to her for a time his head pressed against her breasts as he cried over over what over the fact that joe dupree had been forced to kill the dying bird with his bare hands to put it out of its misery or because danny hadnt been allowed to touch it to play with it first danny sometimes hurt creatures she had watched him do it had caught him burning ants with a piece of broken bottle or tormenting cats by flinging stones at them she supposed that a lot of boys behaved that way not fully understanding the pain that they were causing in that maybe danny was just being a typical sixyearold she hoped so she didnt like to think that it might be something deeper something that he had picked up from his father some faulty gene transmitted from generation to generation that would manifest itself in increasingly vicious ways as he grew older she did not like to think of her dannybecause he was her danny make no mistake about thatbecoming such a man and he was asking questions now questions about him and it bothered her that the lies she was forced to tell danny caused him pain danny seemed to have vague memories of his father and he cried when she told him that he was dead not the first time curiously but rather on the second occasion as if it had taken him the intervening days to absorb the information and to come to terms with what it meant to him and for him how did he die a car accident where in florida why was he in florida he was working there what did he work at he sold things what things misery pain fear he sold cars is he buried like the people in the graveyard yes hes buried can we visit him someday someday just as someday she would be forced to tell him the truth but not now there would be time enough for anger and hurt and blame in the years to come for now he was her danny and she would protect him from the past and from the mistakes that his mother had made she reached out to him and ruffled his hair but he seemed to take her gesture for one of acquiescence and bounced back to his perch on the couch no danny no more you go to bed mom no you go to bed now danny elliot dont make me get up from this seat danny gave her his most poisonous look then stomped away she could hear him all the way up the stairs and then his bedroom door slammed and his bed protested as he threw the full weight of his tantrum upon it she let out a deep breath and removed her glasses her hands were trembling perhaps it was surprising that danny was as well adjusted as he was given the lifestyle that he had been forced to lead for the first two and a half years they had stayed on the road never remaining long in any place crisscrossing the country in an effort to stay ahead of any pursuers those years had been hellish they seemed to coalesce into a constant blur of small towns and unfamiliar cities like a movie screened slightly out of focus the early months were the hardest she would wake to every floorboard squeak every rustle of trash on the street every tapping of branches upon the window even the sound of the ac clicking on in cheap motel rooms would cause her to wake in a panic but the worst times came when car headlights swept across the room in the dead of night and she heard the sound of male voices sometimes they would laugh and she would relax a little it was the quiet ones she feared because she knew that when they came for her they would do so silently giving her no time to react no time to flee finally she and danny had arrived here settling in the last place that they would look for she had spoken so often about the west coast about a place with yearround sunshine and beaches for danny she had meant it too it had long been her dream that they would settle at last out there but it was not to be she feared the ones who were looking for her for they were surely looking even after all this time so much that the entire west coast was not big enough to hide her instead she had retreated to cold and to winter darkness and to a community that would act as an earlywarning system for her if they came she looked to the refrigerator where she still had a bottle of unopened wine in case one of her new friends called and offered to curl up in front of the tv for an evening of comedies and talk shows she so wanted to open it now to take a single glass but she needed to keep her head clear on the kitchen table before her were spread the household accounts abandoned since the previous night in the hope that a little sleep might make them less forbidding she wasnt earning enough from her job at the casco bay market to cover her expenses and sam tucker had already asked her to stay home for the rest of the week promising to make up the hours within the month that meant that she would either have to look for another job possibly in portlandand that was assuming that she could find a job and someone to babysit danny after school or in the eveningsor she could dip back into the special fund that would necessitate a trip to the mainland and the mainland always made her nervous even the larger banks were a risk she had already dispersed the funds into accounts in five different banks over three countiesno more than in each accountbut she was always worried about the irs or some strange bank inspector of whom nobody had ever heard spotting the connections then she would be in real trouble and there was the fact that she didnt like using the money it was tainted wherever possible she tried to get by on what she earned increasingly that was becoming harder and harder to do true there was the knapsack itself hidden among boxes and spare suitcases in the attic but she had vowed not to touch that there was always the chance of succumbing to temptation of taking out too much and giving danny and herself some treats thereby drawing attention to herself this was a small community and even though mainers didnt go interfering in each others business that didnt mean that they werent curious about that business to begin with it was the downside of living in such a comparatively isolated community but a sacrifice worth making there was also the fact that the money was their escape fund should she and danny ever need to move on again quickly if she began dipping into it for little things there was the danger that she would come to take its contents for granted and the little dips would become big dips and pretty soon the fund would be gone and yet there was so much money in it so much nearly how bad could it hurt to take a little to buy a decent television some new clothes maybe even the game console that danny wanted such small things from so much she forced the temptation away no a bank trip was the only option she folded her glasses and put them back in their case then began to gather the papers together she was almost done when the knock came on the door it had been decided that leonie would knock anyone looking out would see an attractive black woman smiling brightly she could pose no threat leonie heard footsteps coming toward the door and a curtain moved aside in the semidarkness she smiled in an embarrassed way and raised the map that she held in her hands hey im lost and its a cold night help me out here tell me where i went wrong huh she didnt even glance to her left where dexter stood holding a gun by his thigh braun behind him or to her right where the boyman willard waited unblinking his left hand shielding the blade of the knife in case a porch light caught it and drew attention to them moloch had remained apart for the time being with shepherd powell and tell seconds passed followed by the sound of a chain being undone and a lock being turned the door opened joe dupree stood on mariannes doorstep out of uniform she had to look up slightly to see his face his eyes shining brightly amid the shadows that congregated around them joe is there some problem but dupree merely shook his head i was just passing i brought this for danny from behind his back he produced a small wooden gull and handed it to her she took it carefully in her hands and held it up to the light it seemed almost crudely carved in places but it was clear that it was not from lack of craft or care rather the primitivism of the carving was designed to capture something of the bird a reflection of its nature he had taken great pains with the head in particular depicting the beak as slightly open she could even see a tiny carved tongue in its mouth the paint was newly dry its beautiful she said and she marveled at how the big mans hands had created something so small and wondrous for she had difficulty imagining him even holding the knife in his fist it must have taken him hours to do it she thought he killed the bird then spent hours recreating it in wood would you like to come in i dont want to disturb you ive finished what i was doing i was about to open a bottle of wine she lied he hesitated and she pressed home her advantage youre not on duty right he didnt need much persuasion just a little she recalled again all those months that he had spent circling her like a small male spider working toward a female unsure of the safety of approaching in fear of his life in this case the physical proportions were reversed but she still had the power she had wondered why it was taking him so long to approach her for she had seen the way hed looked at her when shed begun working in the market the bashfulness with which he spoke in response to her polite remarks she had the answer almost as soon as she asked herself the question she knew it was because of how he looked his consciousness of his own difference and so it was she who had broken the ice between them taking the opportunities when they arose to talk with him walking with him along island avenue when their paths crossed attracting nudges and smiles from the locals she wasnt sure even then that she was interested in the man himself instead it was his timidity that drew her the fragility of his selfesteem strangely enticing in such a huge figure she stepped aside to let him enter and caught the scent of him as he brushed by her he smelled of wood and sap and saltwater she breathed it in as discreetly as she could and felt something tug inside her he was not a conventionally handsome man his teeth were gapped in places seemingly too small to create a single wall of enamel in his great mouth his face was long but widened at the cheeks and chin she could see wrinkles around his eyes and mouth and knew at once that they were the consequence of some pain perhaps physical perhaps psychological and that this man was frequently in distress she was a little surprised when she began to find him attractive and guessed that it was at least in part a combination of his power and size along with the capacity for gentleness and subtlety that had enabled him to carve the bird out of a piece of driftwood to deal sensitively with jack the painter and his problems in fact to interact with most of the islanders in such a way that they both liked and respected him even when he was forced to come down on them for some minor infraction marianne elliot had spent so long among the kind of men who used their power to hurt and intimidate that joe duprees graciousness and humanity naturally appealed to her she wondered what it might be like to make love to him and was surprised and embarrassed by the surge of warmth that the fantasy brought she had not considered her own desires for so long subsuming them all in order to concentrate on danny and his wants and on their combined need for constant vigilance now as she watched the big policeman gingerly sit down at the kitchen table the chair too low for him so that his own legs remained at an acute angle she was conscious of the muscularity of his shoulders the shape of his chest beneath his shirt the width of his arms his hands twice as large as hers hovered in the air before him he cupped them and placed them on the table then unclasped them and moved them to his thighs finally he folded his arms jolting the table as he did so and causing a china bowl to tremble gently he seemed even larger in the confines of the little kitchen making it appear cluttered even though it was not she had not seen the inside of his house but was certain that it contained the minimum of furniture with the barest sprinkling of personal possessions anything fragile or valuable would be stored safely away she felt a great tenderness for the big man and almost reached out to touch him before she stopped herself and turned instead to the business of the wine there was a bottle of two roads chardonnay in the fridge a treat for herself bought in boston she had been saving it for a special occasion until she realized that she had no special occasions worth celebrating marianne was about to open the bottle by now instinctively used to doing everything for herself when he asked her if she would like him to take care of it she handed over the bottle and the corkscrew the wine looked like a beer bottle in his hand he read the label flagstone i dont know it its south african robert frost he said sorry the wine its named after a robert frost poem you know the one about the two roads diverging in a forest she hadnt noticed and felt vaguely embarrassed by her failure to make the connection its hard to forget a poem like that on an island covered by trees he said inserting the corkscrew at least you cant get too lost if you take the wrong road she replied you just keep going until your feet get wet the plastic cork popped from the bottle she hadnt even seen him tense as he drew it out she placed two glasses on the table and watched him pour people still get lost here he said have you been out to the site jack took danny and me out there shortly after we arrived i didnt like it it feltsad the memory of what happened still lingers there i think a couple of times each summer we get tourists in to the station house complaining that the trails out to it should be more clearly marked because they went astray and had trouble finding the road again theyre usually the worst ones the loudmouths in expensive shirts maybe they deserve to get lost then so why dont you signpost it better it was decided a long time ago that the people who needed to find it knew how to get to it its not a place for those who dont respect the dead its not a place for anyone who doesnt find it sad he handed her a glass and touched it gently with his own happiness he said happiness she said and he saw hope and sadness in her eyes if marianne was curious about the giant then he was no less interested in her he knew little about the woman except for her name and the fact that she had brought with her enough money to rent her small but comfortable house yet he had recognized an attraction toward her and thought however unlikely it might at first appear that she might feel something for him too it had taken all of his courage to propose a dinner date after months of gentle probing and it had taken a moment or two after she replied for him to realize that she had accepted yet something about her troubled him no that wasnt true it was not about her precisely but to do with some undisclosed element of her life joe dupree had learned to read people well his father had taught him the importance of doing so and life on the island with its exposure to the same faces the same problems day after day had enabled him to hone his skills weighing his first perceptions against the reality of individuals as their characters were inevitably revealed to him he glanced at the womans fingers as she put the cork back in the bottle and replaced it in the fridge she sat down opposite him and smiled a little nervously her right hand toyed with her ring finger yet there was no ring upon it it was something that he had seen her do a lot usually when a stranger came into the store or a loud noise startled her instinctively she would touch her ring finger its the husband thought joe the husband is the element bill gaddis was not a happy man there were a lot of reasons why bill was unhappy even at the best of times but now he had a specific reason he was leaving a fine woman in the sack to answer an insistent knocking at his door and that made him very unhappy indeed he might even have been tempted to ignore the knocking under other circumstances but around here people had a habit of being good neighbors and the good neighbor at the door might take it into his or her head that what with the lights being on and no reply coming from the gaddis house maybe somebody had had an accident taken a tumble down some steps or slipped on some water in the kitchen and nobody wanted to be the one who had to say hell i was out there just last night knocking and knocking if only id checked through the windows or tried the back door theyd still be alive today and bill didnt want old art bassett or rene watterson coming in the back way hollering and nosing about expecting to see someone lying on the floor with blood pooling only to find bill with his ass in the air and his mind on other things he wondered now why they had even decided to settle here it was pennsylvania goddamnit pennsylvania as far as bill was concerned the only people who settled here willingly were religious zealots who regarded buttons as sinful and folks who regarded buttons as sinful were likely to cast a harsh eye on bill gaddiss activities compared to those people billy gaddis was virtually the antichrist camp hill pennsylvania didnt even figure on most maps but bill knew that was why they were here precisely because you had to look hard to find it it had its good points though his wife had picked up a job at the holiday inn in new cumberland just off the turnpike working the desk a couple of evenings each week on weekends she worked a few hours at the zany brainy over at the camp hill mall saturdays as though spending time in a childrens store could make up for the fact that she was never going to have any of her own two sundays a month she worked in the waldenbooks at the capital city mall the manager there a guy named jim munchel gave her books to take home and read and she seemed to get along with the other folks who worked in the store she told bill that they were good people bill got the feeling that they knew just enough about him to not like him so he stayed out of their way a little independence of spirit on his wifes part was a small price to pay for keeping her out of his hair bill got himself a job driving trucks for a paper company and they saw just enough of each other to remind themselves why they preferred to see only that much in the first weeks bill would drive over to the holiday inn and take a seat in the elephant amp castle the english pub attached to the hotel when she finished her shift he and his wife would eat there largely in silence then return home and sleep at the two farthest extremes of their bed eventually she got herself her own little car but bill kept going back to the elephant amp castle hed met a woman there named jenna a little older than he was but still good looking and pretty soon bill had even more reason to be grateful for the time his wife spent working and the regularity of her hours now someone was knocking on the door depriving him of some muchneeded r ampr bill shrugged on a robe rearranging it to conceal his dying hardon and shuffled to the door swearing as he went he left the lights out in the hallway and pulled back the curtain at the side window he didnt recognize the woman on the step but she looked fine maybe even finer than the woman hed just left and that was saying something she had a map in her hands bill swore louder how hard could it be to get lost with a mall slap bang in front of you christ if bill stood on his lawn he could see the mall clear at the top of yale avenue he took his time looking the woman over lingering at her breasts bill swore once again this time under his breath and more in admiration than in anger then opened the door he barely had time to register the gun in the womans hand before she jammed it into the soft flesh under his chin and forced him against the wall behind her came a redheaded man and after him two others a real pretty boy and a richardroundtreeafterabeating motherfucker with a big stache who brushed past bill and headed straight into the house the f shut up said the woman she ran her left hand over bills body stopping briefly at his groin we disturb something from the bedroom bill heard a scream followed by the sound of jenna being dragged from the bed just the two of you asked the black woman bill nodded hard then stopped suddenly as he considered the possibility that the action might get his head blown off the pretty boy stayed by the halfopen door while bill was forced back into the living room jenna was already there a sheet wrapped around her she was sobbing bill made as if to go to her but the woman stopped him and gestured toward the wall bill could only shoot jenna a look of utter helplessness and then he heard the front door closing and footsteps coming along the hallway two people thought bill the pretty boy and moloch entered the living room billy boy said moloch his eyes flicked toward the woman then back again i see you havent changed a bit aw jesus no said bill not you moloch moved closer to him reached up to bills face and grasped his hollow cheeks in the fingers of his right hand now billy boy said moloch is that any way to greet your brotherinlaw dupree nodded approvingly the house looks good said joe youve done a lot with it in the last year he was holding the glass as delicately as he could while she showed him around her home to marianne the glass still looked lost in his grip with barely enough capacity to offer the policeman a single mouthful they had paused briefly at her bedroom door and she had felt the tension it wasnt a bad feeling after looking in on danny who was fast asleep they went back downstairs i wanted to put our own stamp on it and jack didnt object he helped us out some when he could hes a good man theres been no more trouble has there like before you mean drinking no none that ive seen danny likes him a lot and you hes okay i guess lousy painter though joe laughed he has a distinctive style ill give him that but he was friendly right from the start and im grateful to him it was kind of hard when we got here people seem a littlesuspicious of strangers i guess its an island community people here tend to stick pretty close together you cant force your way in you have to wait for them to loosen up get to know you plus the islands changed some recently its not quite a suburb of portland but its getting there with people commuting to the mainland for work then you have rich folks coming in buying waterfront properties forcing up prices so that families that have lived here for generations cant afford to help their kids set up homes the assessments for waterfront properties out here are based on one sale made last year and the assessor in that case only went back three months to make his valuation lot prices increased one hundred percent because of it almost overnight it was all legal but that didnt make it right island communities are dying you know a hundred years ago there were three hundred island communities in maine now there are sixteen including this one islanders feel under siege and that makes them draw closer together in order to survive so outsiders find it harder to gain a foothold each group is wary of the other and never the twain shall meet he drew a breath sorry im ranting now the island matters to me the people here matter to me all of them he added she felt the tension again and luxuriated in it for a moment but working in the store thats a good way to start he continued folks get to know you to trust you after that its just plain sailing marianne wasnt sure about that some of those who came into the store still limited their conversations with her to please and thank you and sometimes not even that the older ones were the worst they seemed to regard her very presence in their store as a kind of trespass the younger ones were better they were happy to see some new blood arriving on the island and already shed been hit on a couple of times she hadnt responded though she didnt want to be seen as a threat by any of the younger women she had thought that she could do without the company of a man for a time to be honest shed had her fill of men and then some but joe dupree was different joe wasnt like her husband not by a long shot moloch sat in one of the overstuffed armchairs and sipped a beer fooling around billy boy he said out with the old in with the new bill had stopped weeping hed had to moloch had threatened to shoot him if he didnt bill didnt reply where is she asked moloch bill still said nothing moloch swallowed then winced as if he had just swallowed a tack queer beer he said i havent had a beer in more than three years and this stuff still tastes like shit ill ask you one more time bill where is your wife i dont know said bill moloch looked at dexter and nodded dexter grinned then grabbed jennas arm she was a big woman verging on plump with naturally red hair that she had dyed a couple of shades darker the mascara on her face had run drawing black smears down her cheeks as she struggled in dexters grasp her sheet fell away and she tried to pick it up again even as dexter pulled her back toward the bedroom she hung back using her fingers to try to release his grip on her nooo she said please dont she looked to bill for help but the only help bill could offer was to sell out his own wife she works late tonight the words came out in a rush down at the mall he finished speaking and appeared about ready to retch at what he had just done moloch nodded what time does she finish bill looked at the clock on the mantel about another hour moloch looked at dexter who had paused by the doorway of the bedroom well moloch said what are you waiting for you have an hour dexters grin widened he drew jenna into the bedroom and closed the door softly behind him bill tried to move away from the wall but the black womans gun was instantly buried in his cheek i told you said bill i told you where she was and i appreciate that billy boy said moloch now you just sit tight please said bill dont let him do anything to her moloch looked puzzled why he asked its not as if shes your wife joe helped her put the glasses away i have to ask you something he said she dried her hands sure its just he stopped seemingly struggling to find the right words i have to know about the folks who come to the island like i said its a small closeknit community anything happens then i need to know why its happening you understand not really do you mean you want to know something about me yes such as dannys father dannys father is dead we split up when danny was little then his daddy died down in florida someplace what was his name she had prepared for this very moment his name was server lee server you were married no when did he die fall of ninetynine there was a car accident outside tampa that was true a man named lee server had been killed when his pickup was hit by a delivery truck on the interstate the newspaper reports had said that he had no surviving relatives server had been drinking and the reports indicated that he had a string of previous duis there werent too many people fighting for space by lee servers graveside when they laid him down i had to ask said joe did you he didnt reply but the lines around his eyes and mouth appeared to deepen look if you want to back out of tomorrow night ill understand she reached out and touched his arm just tell me were you asking with your cops hat on or your prospective dates hat on he blushed a little of both i guess well now you know i still want to see you tomorrow ive even taken my best dress out of mothballs he smiled and she watched him walk to his car before she closed the door behind him she let out a sigh and leaned back against the door dead her husband was dead maybe if she said it often enough it might come true bill had curled himself into a ball against the wall his hands over his ears to block out the noises coming from the bedroom his eyes were squeezed tightly closed only the feel of the gun muzzle against his forehead forced him to open them again slowly he took his hands away from his ears there was now silence it was a small mercy youre a pitiful man said moloch you let another man take your woman and you dont even put up a fight how can you live with yourself bill spoke his voice was cracked and he had to cough before he could complete a coherent sentence youd have killed me id have respected you i might even have let you live he dangled the prospect of life before bill like a bad dog being taunted with the treat destined to be denied it how did you find me if youre going to run away bill then you keep your head down and try not to fall into your old ways but once a bad gambler always a bad gambler you took some hits bill and then you found that you couldnt pay back what you owed that kind of mistake gets around bills eyes closed again briefly what are you going to do with me he asked us corrected moloch you know bill im starting to think that you dont really care about your wife or that woman in the bedroom what is her name by the way jenna said bill moloch seemed puzzled she doesnt look like a jenna shes kind of dirty for a jenna still if you say so bill im not about to doubt your word on it now that weve rephrased the question to include your lady friend and your wife we can proceed i think you know what i want you give it to me and maybe we can work something out you and i i dont know where your wife is where they are said moloch jesus bill you only think in the singular its a very irritating habit that you may not live long enough to break she has my son and my money she hasnt been in touch willard said moloch willards bleak lazy eyes floated toward the older man break one of his fingers and willard did joe dupree checked in briefly with the station house all was quiet according to tuttle as soon as berman returned hed turn in for an hour or two he said try to get some sleep dupree drove down unmarked roads for most of the streets on the island were still without names it took the cops who came over from the mainland a few years to really get to know the island which was why those who took on island duty tended to stick with it for some time you had to learn to always get a phone number when anyone called because people still referred to houses by reference to their neighborseven if those neighbors no longer lived there or had died you figured out landmarks turnings forks in the road and used them as guides dupree returned again to thoughts of marianne and her past he had seen something in her eyes as she spoke of dannys father she wasnt telling him the truth at least not the full truth she had told him that she had not been married to dannys father but he had watched as her hand seemed to drift unconsciously toward her ring finger she had caught herself in time and tugged at one of her earrings instead and dupree had given no indication that he had noticed the gesture so she didnt want to talk about her husband with a policeman even one with whom she had a date the following evening big deal after all she hardly knew him and he had sensed her fear fear both of her husband and of the implications of any disclosure that she might make about him he was tempted to run a check on this server guy but decided against it he wanted their date tomorrow to be untainted by his professional instincts perhaps if they made this thing between them work she would tell him everything in her own time dexter came out of the room just as bill stopped screaming im glad you did that now and not earlier he told moloch you might have put me off my game bill was crying again his face was pale with shock you okay bill asked moloch he sounded genuinely concerned nod if youre okay because when youve recovered willard can move on to the next finger unless of course you think you might have something more to tell us bill was trembling he looked up and saw the clock on the mantel over molochs left shoulder aw shit he said his eyes flicked toward the halfopen bedroom door he could see jennas shadow moving against the wall as she tried to dress herself moloch watched him with amusement you worried about her coming back maybe finding out about your little piece on the side answer me bill i want to hear your voice its impolite to nod you nod at me again or make me wait longer than two seconds for an answer and ill have willard here break something you have only one of yes croaked bill im worried about her finding out a more selfaware man might have realized by now that he had bigger problems to face than his wife discovering his affair you are a remarkable man bill in your capacity to blind yourself to the obvious now where is my family i told you she hasnt been in touch not with me ah now were making progress if she hasnt been talking to youand ive got to be honest here bill id prefer not to be talking to you either so i can understand her point of viewthen she has been talking to her sister right yes but youre such a piece of shit bill that even your own wife wont tell you where her sister is she doesnt tell me anything but you must know how they communicate phone i guess where are your phone records in the cabinet by the tv theres a file but she never uses the house phone ive looked does she receive mail yes where does she keep it in a locked box in the bottom drawer of her nightstand moloch nodded at willard and the boy went into the bedroom to search for the box as he left the room car headlights brightened the hallway briefly illuminating their faces and casting fleeting shadows across the room leonie pressed the gun against bills teeth forcing him to open his mouth then shoved the barrel inside suck it she whispered i see your lips move from it and ill pull the trigger from the bedroom came the sound of sudden movement jenna was trying to make for the window to raise the alarm moloch guessed willard was too quick for her and the movement ceased moloch heard the car door closing footsteps on the path the placing of the key in the lock the door opening then shutting again the approach of the woman she stepped into the living room she was older than he remembered her as being but then it had been more than five years since they had last met in the interim moloch had been betrayed and they had run scattering themselves to the four winds inventing new lives for themselves even with moloch behind bars they remained fearful of reprisals patricia had long lush hair like her younger sisters but there was more gray in it she wasnt as pretty either and had always looked kind of worn down but that was probably a consequence of being married to an asshole like bill moloch who didnt care much either way still wondered why she had stayed with him maybe after all the fear she needed someone even semireliable to stand beside her patricia took in her husband huddled on the floor the womans gun in his mouth dexter his shirt still untucked braun an open magazine on his lap and moloch smiling at her from an armchair hi honey he said im home all was quiet even bill had stopped sobbing and now simply cradled his damaged hand as he watched his wife she stood before moloch her head cast down her left cheek was red from the first slap and her upper lip was split look at me he said she did not move and he struck her again it was a light slap but the humiliation of it was greater than if he had propelled her across the room with the force of the blow she felt the tears roll down her cheeks and hated herself for showing weakness before him ill let you live said moloch if you help me ill let you and bill live someone will stay here with you just to make sure you dont do anything stupid but you will be allowed to live i wont kill her i just want my money i dont even want the boy do you understand her mouth turned down at the edges as she tried to keep herself from sobbing aloud she found herself looking at her husband she wanted him to stand by her to be strong for her stronger than he had ever been she wanted him to defy moloch to defy the woman with the gun to follow her even unto death yet he had never shown that strength before he had always failed her and she believed that even now when she needed him most he would fail her again moloch knew that too he was watching what passed between them taking it in there might be something there he could use if only willard came out of the bedroom there was blood on his hands and shirt a spray of red had drawn a line across his features bisecting his face life was gradually seeping back into his eyes he was like a man waking from a dream a dream in which he had torn apart a woman whose name he had barely registered and whose face he could no longer remember bill screamed the name of the dead woman in the bedroom and his wife knew at last that all she had suspected and feared was true no bill was all that she said and something happened then they looked at each other and there was a moment of deep understanding between them this betrayed woman and her pathetic husband whose weaknesses had led these men to their door im sorry he said im sorry for it all tell him nothing bill smiled and although there was a touch of madness to it it was in its way an extraordinary thing like a bloom in a wasteland and in the midst of her hurt and fear she found it in her to smile back at him with more love and warmth than she thought she would ever again feel for him everything was about to be taken from them or what little they had left but for these final moments they would stand together at last she turned and stared moloch in the eye how could i live if i sold out my sister and my nephew to you she whispered molochs shoulders sagged dexter he said make her tell us what she knows dexters face brightened he started to walk across the room and for an instant leonie glanced at him it was bills opportunity and he took it he struck out with his uninjured hand and caught leonie on the right cheekbone close to the eye she stumbled back and he reached for the gun striking her again with his elbow the gun came free across the room braun was already reaching for his weapon willard still looked dazed but was trying to remove his own gun from his belt the gun in bills hand panned across the room making for moloch moloch grabbed patricia and pulled her in front of him using her as a shield from the corner of his eye bill registered the guns in the hands of the two men willard frozen in place leonie rising to her knees still swaying from the impact of the blows the voices shouting at him he looked to his wife and there came that smile again and bill loved her he fired the gun and a red wound opened at his wifes breast for an instant all was noise then silence they said nothing bill lay dead against the wall shepherd and tell were at the door drawn by the commotion patricia gaddis was still alive moloch leaned over her where she lay tell me he said tell me he touched his finger to the wound in her breast and she jerked like a fish on a line tell me and ill make it stop she spit blood at him and started to tremble he gripped her shoulders as she began to die ill find her he promised ill find them both but she was already gone moloch stood walked over to willard and punched him hard in the face willard stumbled back and moloch hit him again driving him to his knees dont you ever do that again said moloch dont you ever lay a hand on anyone unless i give you permission to do so first i will tell you what i want from you and you will do it from now on you breathe because i allow you to breathe willard mumbled something what did you say willard took his hands away from his ruined nose i found it said willard i found the box the letters were postmarked portland maine patricia should not have held on to themher sister had warned her against itbut it was all that she had of her and she treasured every word sometimes she would sit alone in the bedroom and try to catch a hint of her little sister some trace of her perfume even when the scent of her had faded entirely patricia believed that she could still detect some faint remnant for the memory of her sister would never leave her its not a big city but she still wont be easy to find said dexter they were already leaving the scene departing camp hill initially moloch wasnt sure if the gunshots had been registered by the neighbors for nobody was on a step or in a yard when they left the house but minutes later they heard sirens they had ditched the van that had been parked at the back of the house as a precaution but the risk had been worth it and she wont be using her own name dexter continued moloch raised a hand to silence him she wont be using her own name if she was using an alias she would need identification and she could not have assembled that material for herself she must have approached someone someone who she believed would not betray her moloch went through the names in his head exploring all of the possibilities until at last he came to the one he sought meyer karen meyer she would have asked a woman they headed for philly where they took rooms at a pair of motels off the interstate dexter and braun ate at a dennys then brought back food for the others both willard and leonie had injuries that might have attracted attention and moloch could not risk having his face seen shepherd and tell watched tv in their room a reporter was talking about the rebuilding of afghanistan man we bombed those bastards back to the stone age said tell from what shepherd could see of their houses these people werent far from the stone age to begin with all things considered it was a short but eventful trip for most of them still shepherd figured that theyd asked for it eye for an eye said tell its the way of the world shepherd agreed as usual dexter and braun shared a room braun read a book while dexter watched a dvd on his portable player what are you watching asked braun the wild bunch uhhuh what else you got butch cassidy and the sundance kid the thing the shootist braun put his book down for a moment you always watch movies where the leading men are doomed to die at the end dexter looked over at braun they seemedappropriate braun held his gaze yeah he said whatever he returned to his book he was reading thucydidess history of the peloponnesian war braun believed in knowing about the past particularly the past as it pertained to the military having been an army man himself at one point the athenians were about to send out their great fleet loaded with archers slingers and cavalry to take sicily against the advice of the more prudent voices among them braun didnt know the intricacies of what was to occur which was why he had taken up the book to begin with but he remembered enough of his military history to know that the athenian empire was sailing toward its ruin moloch lay on the bed in his room and channelsurfed until he came to a news bulletin and saw the land cruiser being pulled from the river and the shrouded bodies being carried to the waiting ambulance a picture of misters appeared on the screen he still had his eyes and his tongue when the photograph was taken the cops were looking for eyewitnesses to the incident they were also making casts of the tire tracks from the vans it would not take them long to make the connection between the killings in philadelphia and the escape moloch calculated that they had twentyfour maybe fortyeight hours to do what needed to be done before the net began to spread farther north it would be enough chapter five strange now or so it seemed but marianne had once liked his name he called himself edward not ted or ed or eddie edward it had a kind of patrician ring to it it was formal no nonsense but she had never liked his second name and had not understood its provenance until it was too late it was only when she learned more about his ways and began to pick away at his facade that she came to realize the nature of the man with whom she was involved she had once read a newspaper article about a sculptress who worked with stone and who claimed that the piece she was creating was already present within the medium so that her task was simply to remove the excess material that was obscuring what lay beneath later marianne would liken herself to that sculptress gradually coming to see that what lay concealed under her husbands exterior was something infinitely more complex and more frightening than she had ever imagined and so it was that she began to fear his name when at last she commenced her search for clues about the man she had married and the secret things that he did it had so many forms so many derivations moloch malik melech molech it could be found in ammonite traditions in canaanite and semite moloch the ancient sun god the bringer of plagues the god of wealth to the canaanites moloch the prince of the land of tears miltons molech besmeared with the blood of human sacrifice the israelites surrendered their firstborn to him burning them in fire solomon was reputed to have built a temple to him near the entrance to gehenna the gates of hell moloch what kind of man was called by such a name and yet in the beginning he had been sweet to her when you lived in biloxi mississippi where the permanently moored casinos drew the worst kinds the ones who couldnt afford to go to florida or vegas or who didnt care what their surroundings looked like as long as there was a table a card shoe and maybe a cocktail waitress who might be persuaded to offer comfort for a fiftydollar chip then any man who didnt try to grab your ass was practically an ambassador for his sex and moloch was different she was working on the biloxi black beauty an imitation showboat painteddespite its nameso many shades of pink that it made ones teeth hurt just to look at it the cocktail waitresses were forced to wear white corsets like nineteenthcentury hookers cleaning up after a john and bunched skirts that one hundred years before would have revealed no more than a flash of shin but were now so high that the lower curves of their buttocks were on permanent display the ruffles of the skirts like stage curtains that had been raised to reveal the main act in theory the men werent supposed to touch them anywhere other than on the back or the arm in reality the tips were better if you didnt stick too closely to the letter of the law and allowed them to indulge themselves just a little if they got too frisky it was enough to nod at the security guards who dotted the casino in their green blazers as omnipresent as the artificial potted palms although the palms were probably more likely to develop as individuals than the beautys deputy dawgs they would lean over one at either side of the drunk because they were always drunks the ones who behaved in that way scooping up his chips and his drink even as he was quickly hustled away from the table talking to him all the while calm and quiet but keeping him moving for being a drunk he would find it hard to argue walk and keep an eye on his remaining chips all at the same time then he would be gone his departure ignored by the dealer and eventually someone else would move to take his place at the table it didnt pay to complain too often though there were a lot of girls ready and willing to take your place if you got a reputation as a troublemaker or as a woman who couldnt handle a little attention from the men happily throwing away their savings for a couple of complimentary watereddown bourbons marianne had been born into a family in the town of tunica in the cotton country of northwestern mississippi close to the arkansas border she was raised almost within sight of sugar ditch where slave descendants had lived beside open sewers a couple of blocks from main street her father ran a little diner on magnolia street but tunica was so poor it could barely support this meager enterprise the bank took over the diner and covered its windows with wooden boards her father fell apart and his family fell apart along with him he grew depressed then violent on the day after he struck marianne so hard across the head that she was deaf in one ear for a week her mother packed up their things and moved her two daughters to biloxi where her own sister lived they existed close to penury but mariannes mother could squeeze a nickel until the buffalo shat and her daughters received schooling and eventually found places of their own later she and her husband were reconciled and he came to live with his wife and her sister for the last three years of his life a pathetic man destroyed by bad luck poor judgment and an inability to stop drinking before the bottle ran dry he was buried back in tunica and two years later his wife was buried alongside him but by then tunica had changed casinos had brought wealth to what had once been merely a staging post on the way to better things there was now a carillon clock that played hymns on the hour in a little park downtown free garbage pickup even street signs for in mariannes youth tunica could not afford to extend to visitors the luxury of a formal indicator of their whereabouts a situation of which the late harry rylance would undoubtedly have disapproved marianne had been considering moving back there to escape biloxi for there would be work in tunicas casinos and the quality of life was considerably better there than on mariannes stretch of the gulf coast until she met edward moloch the nature of her fathers disintegration and the sights that greeted her each evening in the casinos had made her wary and intolerant of those who drank even moderately but moloch didnt drink liquor she asked him for an order as soon as he sat down and placed his chips carefully upon the table but he refused the offer of a cocktail and instead tipped her a ten for every soda she brought him he played sevencard highlow stud quietly declaring high and low more frequently than any other player and at least tying each way three times out of five his clean white shirt was open at the neck beneath a black linen jacket without a single crease he was a big man for his height with broad shoulders tapering to a slim waist and strong thighs his hair was dark with no trace of gray and his face was very thin with vertical creases running down from each cheekbone and ending on the same level as his mouth like old wounds that had healed his eyes were bluegreen with long dark lashes marianne wouldnt have called him handsome exactly but he had a charisma about him he smelled good too he wore the kind of aftershave that made women pause as they passed him so that it slipped in under their defenses and he came out ahead not so far as to draw attention to himself but sufficiently above the average for the house to breathe a light sigh of relief when he surrendered his chair due in no small part to his generosity marianne finished her shift that night with in bills tucked into her purse it almost made up for the drunks and the maulers when her shift finished she decided to walk home in order to stretch her legs and allow for a little time to herself marianne was an attractive woman and had learned to play it up on the casino floor but to tone it down for the streets so she drew few glances as she headed toward lameuse boulevard and old biloxi the guy came at her from an alleyway beside a boardedup diner even in the brief time that she had to see his face before his left hand closed around her mouth and his right around her throat she knew him hed been thrown out earlier for slipping his hand between her legs working at her painfully with his fingers and she hadnt been able to get away from him so firm was his grip even the dumbass security guys had seen how shaken she was with her mouth pressed so tightly closed that her lips were almost white she was asked by the pit boss if she wanted to press charges but she shook her head that would be the end of her time at the biloxi black beauty and she would have trouble getting work anywhere else too once it came out that shed asked for the cops to be called and the casinos name appeared in the police blotter maybe in the local rags too no there would be no charges when she returned to the tables the man in the black linen jacket with the soda in front of him said nothing to her but she was certain that he had witnessed all that had occurred now here was the mauler again some bruising to his cheek where maybe his mouth had gotten him into a little more trouble than hed anticipated with casino security his blond hair matted with sweat his tan suit wrinkled and torn at the left shoulder he shifted his grip pulling her backward into the darkness whispering in her ear as he did huh bitch huh remember me you fucking bitch over and over bitch bitch bitch the alley was lshaped an alcove to the right hidden entirely from the street ahead he spun her around almost gracefully when they reached it and sent her sprawling over a pile of black garbage sacks something sharp bit into her thigh she opened her mouth to scream and he showed her the knife scream bitch and ill cut you bad ill cut you so fucking bad take them jeans down now yhear he was fumbling at his own trousers as he spoke trying to release himself from his pants he moved forward and made a pass at her with the knife the blade whistling by the tip of her nose you hear me bitch he leaned toward her and she could see the spittle on his chin you take them off now she was crying and she hated herself for crying even as she worked at the button on her jeans hating the way it parted from the hole so easily hating that this thing was going to happen to her at the hands of this man hating hating hating there was a click and the guy stopped moving his eyes moved slowly to his right his head remaining still as though he hoped that his eyeballs would continue their passage rotating through his hair so that he could see the man behind him the man with a gun now pressed into the back of his head the man in the white shirt and the creaseless linen jacket drop the knife he said the knife fell to the ground bouncing once on the tip of its blade before coming to rest in the trash walk to the wall her attacker did as he was told she caught the sharp whiff of ammonia as he passed close to her and knew that he had wet himself with fear and she was pleased kneel said the man with the gun the guy didnt move so the gunman stepped back and raked the barrel of the gun across the back of his head her attacker stumbled forward then fell to his knees keep your hands pressed against the wall the man with the gun turned to her you okay he asked she nodded she could feel something sour bubbling at the back of her throat she swallowed it down he helped her to rise to her feet go to the end of the alley wait for me there she went without question the wouldbe rapist remained facing the wall but she could hear him sobbing at the end of the alleyway she bent over against the wall put her palms on her knees and leaned down she sucked great breaths of stale air into her lungs tasting polluted water and grease her whole body was shaking and her legs felt weak without the wall to support her she felt certain that she would have collapsed passersby glanced at her but no one expressed any concern this was a fun town and people didnt want their fun spoiled by a sick woman her rescuerfor that was how she already thought of himfollowed her a minute or two later in the interim she heard sounds like a wet towel slapping against a hard surface as he walked toward her he was adjusting the leg of his pants come on what did you do to him hit him some we should call the police why he seemed genuinely curious he may try to do it again he wont do it again you call the cops you do it only because you need to because it makes you feel happier believe me he wont try anything like that again now you want to call them he paused beside her she thought of the interview she would have to endure the questions asked at the casino the face of her boss as he told her that she wouldnt have to come in monday wouldnt have to come back ever sorry you know how it is no she said lets go he walked with her for a block or two then hailed a cab he dropped her off at the door of her apartment but declined her invitation to come up maybe ill see you again he said she wrote her number on the back of a store receipt and handed it to him sure id like that i didnt get your name my name is edward thank you edward once she was safely inside the cab pulled away from the curb she closed the door leaned against it and at last allowed herself to cry the guys name was otis barger moloch read it out loud from his drivers license otis was from anniston alabama youre a long way from home otis barger didnt answer he couldnt answer his hands and feet were bound with wire taken from the trunk of molochs car and there was tape over his mouth one eye was swollen shut and there was blood on his cheek his right foot was curled inward at an unnatural angle broken by the heel of molochs boot to ensure that he didnt try to crawl away while moloch took the woman back to her apartment he was lying on the garbage bags where only twenty minutes earlier marianne had lain as he prepared to rape her moloch drew a photograph from bargers wallet it showed a darkhaired womannot pretty not uglyand a smiling darkhaired boy your wife and child barger nodded you still together again barger nodded she deserves better ive never met her but that woman would have to be hells own whore to deserve you you think shell miss you when youre gone this time barger didnt nod but his eyes grew wide moloch kicked at the wounded ankle and barger screamed behind his gag i asked you a question you think shell miss you barger nodded for the third time moloch raised the leg of his pants and drew the pistol from the ankle holster he looked around kicking at the garbage until he found a discarded chair cushion he walked to where barger lay then squatted down beside him i dont believe you he said what was it you called that lady you tried to rape bitch that was what you called her wasnt it he slapped barger hard across the head wasnt it barger nodded for the fourth and final time well said moloch shes my bitch now then he placed the cushion against bargers head pushed the muzzle of the gun into the fabric and pulled the trigger marianne knew nothing of this although as the years went by she thought often of that night and wondered what had become of the man in the alley moloch would say only that he had beaten him and told him to get out of town since he was never seen in biloxi again she assumed that was the truth except except that during their years together most of them spent in a little house in danville virginia she had grown increasingly fearful of this man of his mood swings of his intelligence of his capacity for cruelty to her he knew where to hit her so that it hurt most and bruised least he knew places on her body where the mere pressure of his fingers was enough to make her scream there was money for he always had money but he gave her only enough to feed their little family of three for a son had been born to them during that terrible second year she was required to produce receipts for everything and every penny had to be accounted for just as every moment of her day had to be described and justified it had begun almost as soon as they were married it seemed to her that the marriage license was all that he wanted he had wooed her made promises to her provided them with a house to live in she had given up the job in biloxi two weeks before the wedding and he had told her not to take on anything else for a time that they would travel try to see a little of this great country they had a short honeymoon in mexico blighted by bad weather and molochs moods but the proposed road trip never materialized she quickly learned not to mention it for at best he would mutter and tell her that he was too busy while at other times he would hold her face beginning with a caress but gradually increasing his grip until his thumb and forefinger forced her mouth open and just when the pain began to bring tears to her eyes he would kiss her and release her another time he would say another time and she did not know if he was referring to the trip or to some promised treat for himself the first time he hurt her badly was when he came home from a business meeting in tennessee less than a year into their marriage she told him that she had found a job for herself in a bookstore it was only two afternoons each week and all day saturday but it would get her out of the house you see i dont want you working he said but i need to work she replied im kind of bored with me the lines in his face deepened so that she almost expected to glimpse his teeth working through the holes in his cheeks no not with you thats not what i meant so what did you mean you say youre bored a mans going to take that to mean something i dont do it for you anymore you want somebody else maybe youve found somebody else already is why you want a job so youll have an excuse to leave the house no its not that its not that at all he was talking as if he was jealous but there was no real hurt in his words he was playing a role and even in her fear she could see that but it made it harder for her to argue with him when she didnt understand why he was so annoyed she reached for him and said come on honey its not like that youre being she didnt even see him move one moment they were talking and she was extending her hand toward him the next her face was pressed against the wall and her arm was being wrenched behind her back she felt his breath close to her ear im being what tell me you think you know me you dont maybe i should teach you a little about me his left hand and the weight of his body held her in place while his right hand slipped beneath her sweater and found her skin his fingers began moving on her exploring and then the pain began in her stomach in her kidneys in her groin her mouth opened in a silent cry the agony increasing turning from yellow to red to black and the last words she heard were are you learning now she regained consciousness with him moving on top of her as she lay on the kitchen floor one month later she found out she was pregnant even now years later it still hurt her to think that danny her wonderful beautiful danny could have resulted from that night perhaps it was the price she had to pay to be given him if so then she had continued to pay the price for a long time after and sometimes when their infant son cried just a little too much she would see the light appear in molochs eyes and she would run to the boy and quiet him nearly suffocating him against her the child had been a mistake moloch wanted no children and had talked of an abortion but in the end he had relented she felt that he did so because he believed it would tie her more closely to him even as he told her that they were now a family and would always be a family he did not hate her he loved her he would tell her that even as he was hurting her i love you but if you ever try to leave me ill kill you his mistake was to underestimate her men had always underestimated her her father her uncle drunk at thanksgiving stealing kisses from his niece in the quiet of the kitchen his mouth open his hands reaching and touching while she maneuvered herself away trying to placate him without offending him so that she would not put her familys tenuous status in his house at risk the men for whom she worked or with whom she slept it suited her where she grew up men feared and hated women whom they suspected were smarter or stronger than they were it was better to keep your head down to smile dumbly it gave you more room to move when you needed it and so she began listening to snatches of telephone conversations and using her little car with its small allowance of gas to track her husband she picked up receipts for nonexistent purchases just a few here and there for moloch had become distracted and no longer checked every item in the kitchen and bathroom she looked for threefortwo offers for buyone getonefrees then squirreled away the freebies for use later it took her the better part of a year but slowly she began to accumulate a little money there were places that were out of bounds to herthe shed the atticbut now she began to take chances even in those places in a fit of daring that left her sleepless for days she called in a locksmith explaining to him that shed lost the keys to the garden shed and the attic and that her husband would be furious when he found out then she began to explore first she marked the location of everything in the shed on a piece of paper and made sure always to return each item to its spot on the plan the attic was more difficult seemingly littered with trash and old clothes but still she made a drawing there too in the shed she found nothing at first but a gun wrapped in oilcloth and hidden in a box of nails and screws it took her two more searchesincluding one during the course of which moloch had returned home and she had been forced to keep her hands thrust firmly in her pockets for fear that he would see the dirt and rust upon themto find the hole in one of the boards on the floor it looked like a flaw in the wood an absent knot but when she lifted it she discovered the bag she did not have time to count all of the money that it contained but she reckoned it was close to all in twenties and fifties she put the board back then returned to the shed twice more to check that she had left no sign of her presence in the attic there were items of jewelry some old others quite new she found a small stack of bearer bonds worth maybe in total she discovered bank account details in the names of unknown men and women and credit card records carefully noted even down to the threedigit security number to be found on the backs of the cards and she came across a womans drivers license in the name of carolanne brenner a name that caused a buried memory to resonate softly the next day while shopping she stopped at the internet café at the mall and entered the name carolanne brenner on a search engine she came up with a doctor an athlete a candidate for beatification and a murder victim carolanne brenner a widow fiftythree killed in her home in pensacola alabama three months earlier the motive according to the police was robbery they were searching for a man in connection with the crime there was a photofit picture with the report it showed a young man with blond hair very pretty rather than handsome she thought police believed that carolanne brenner might have been having an affair with the young man and that he had wheedled his way into her affections in order to rob her they had no name for him brenners accounts had been emptied in the days prior to the discovery of her body and all of her jewelry was missing the next day during her attic search she found more items of jewelry and purses empty and photographs of women sometimes alone sometimes with their families she also found four drivers licenses and two passports each with her husbands photograph upon it but each in a different name the drivers licenses were tied together with an elastic band while the passports were in a separate brown envelope there was a telephone number written on the outside flap marianne remembered the envelope being delivered a woman had brought it a woman with short dark hair and a vaguely mannish stride she had looked at marianne with pity and perhaps a little interest the envelope had been sealed then and moloch had been furious at the fact that marianne had been entrusted with it until he confirmed that the seal was intact marianne had memorized the number two days later she called it the womans name was karen meyer and she met marianne at the mall danny sleeping beside them in his stroller marianne didnt know why she was trusting her but she had felt something that day when the woman called with the envelope and for what she needed marianne had nowhere else to turn why did you call me asked meyer i need your help i cant help you please meyer looked around checking faces i mean it i cant your husband will hurt me hell hurt all of us you of all people must know what hes like i know i mean i dont know i dont know what he is anymore karen shrugged well i know what he is thats why i cant help you marianne felt the tears begin to roll down her cheeks she was desperate i have money not enough karen got up to leave no please marianne stretched out her hand to restrain her it locked on her wrist karen stopped and looked down at the younger womans hand marianne swallowed but kept her eyes on karens face she released her grip then slipped her hand into the other womans palm tentatively she touched her gently with her fingers for a moment she thought that she felt karens hand tremble until it was suddenly pulled away dont call me again said karen you do and i swear ill tell him marianne didnt watch her leave instead fearful and humiliated she hid her face in her hands until karen was gone karen came to the house three days later marianne answered the door to find her there ten minutes after moloch had left for the day you said you had money yes i can pay you what do you need new identities for danny and me and maybe for my sister and her husband as well itll cost you fifty thousand dollars and im nailing you to the wall at that price marianne smiled despite herself and after a seconds pause karen smiled back yeah well she said im being up front about it youre being charged above the going rate but i need to cover myself if he finds out im going to have to run you understand that marianne nodded ill want half now half later marianne shook her head i cant do that what do you mean you said you had money i do but i cant touch it until just before i leave karen stared at her its his money isnt it marianne nodded shit theres more than enough to cover what you ask i promise you youll have it as soon as im ready to leave i need something now i dont have half or anything close to it what can you give me two hundred two hundred karen slumped against the wall and said nothing for at least a minute give it to me she said at last marianne went upstairs and retrieved the roll of bills from the only safe place she could find in which to keep it the very center of a carton of tampons it was a peculiarity of molochs he would not even sleep beside her when she had her period she handed the roll of ones and fives to karen do you want to count it karen weighed the roll of bills in her hand i figure this is everything that youve hidden away right marianne nodded then said well i kept fifty back thats all then thatll be enough for now she moved to go how long will it take theyll be ready in two weeks you can pick them up when youre leaving and ill take the rest of my money then okay marianne opened the door as she did so the older woman reached out and brushed her cheek marianne didnt flinch youd have done it too wouldnt you said karen softly yes karen smiled you need to work on your seduction technique she said ive never had to use it before under those circumstances i guess your heart just wasnt in it i guess not karen shook her head sadly walked to her car and drove away marianne never understood why moloch had kept the licenses the purses the little personal items from the women she suspected that they were souvenirs or a means of recalling the women from whom they had come a kind of aidemémoire or perhaps it was simply vanity moloch had never told her what he did for a living exactly he was when she asked in those first days a businessman an independent consultant a salesman a facilitator marianne believed that the women and what had happened to them were only part of what he was now when she read of raids on stores or banks and saw her husbands cash reserve increase when she heard of a businessman being killed in his car for his briefcase the contents later revealed to be in underthecounter earnings and an amount just under that was briefly added to the bag in the shed when a young woman disappeared in altoona the daughter of a moderately wealthy businessman and her body was found in a ditch after the ransom was paid she thought of moloch she thought of moloch as she fingered the money she thought of moloch as she smelled the burnt powder in the gun among the nails and she thought of moloch as she spied the hardened dirt in the treads of his boots carefully picking it away and placing it in a ziploc bag that she bound tightly and squeezed into a tampon inserter in those last days she became aware of an increase in the pitch of his activities there were more calls to the home phone the phone that she was not allowed to answer there were more frequent and longer absences the mileage on his car climbed steadily in increments of two hundred miles he grew yet more distracted now barely glancing at the receipts from the market and failing even to check the total spent against her allowance for the week there were three things that marianne had learned about molochs final operation through careful listening and the maps and notes that he had locked away in the attic the first was that it would take place in cumberland far to the north of the state and close to the borders of both maryland and pennsylvania the second was that it would involve a bank the third was that it would take place on the last thursday of the month she made her plans carefully she called karen from a pay phone and told her the exact time at which she would arrive to pick up the material she contacted her sister who lived only a few miles away yet from whom she had become virtually estranged because of molochs paranoia and told her of her plan and of the possibility that she and her sorryass husband might have to leave the state at some point in the future but with money in their pockets surprisingly patricia seemed unconcerned by the prospect of uprooting herself bill had recently been let go from a plant job and she saw it as a chance for them both to start over again marianne prepared three changes of clothing for danny and herself using what little cash she had left to buy them each a new set of clothes cheaply at marshalls noname jeans plain tshirts cotton sweaters from beneath the yellow black and red reduced sign these she placed at the bottom of their respective piles of clothing although she need not have worried moloch becoming ever more withdrawn as the day of the operation approached this was to be his big score she sensed what she could not have known was that molochs recent actions were merely one of a number of scams and crimes that he had put into operation over the years and that there were other men involved committing insurance frauds drug ripoffs minor bank raids in small dusty towns murders and these were only the enterprises that produced a profit for moloch had his hobbies too he had more in common with the wouldbe rapist otis barger than might once have seemed possible except he picked his targets more carefully from the ranks of whores and addicts and lost souls and there was never a risk of them talking because when he was finished with them he disposed of their remains in forests and mountain bogs molochs peculiarityone if the truth be known of manywas his disinclination to have vaginal sex with his victims after all he did not wish to be unfaithful to his wife yet even if she had known all of this at the time had recognized the unsuspected depths of her husbands degeneracy marianne would still have acted as she did independently and without making a formal approach to the authorities she would still have contacted karen she would still have set in motion her escape she would still have told the police of the details of the bank job she called them shortly after she had retrieved the cash from the hollow beneath the shed floor and placed it in the trunk of her car alongside the two small bags that represented all of the possessions she was prepared to take with her she planned to drive to the rendezvous point meet karen then head on to the bus station and abandon her car there from there she would pay cash for two tickets to three different destinations each bought at a separate window she would travel on to only one of them new york and there she would buy three more tickets to three different cities and again head to only one of them it seemed like a good plan she strapped her son into the baby seat then drove to the mall and parked by the pay phone she lifted the boy out and carried him still sleeping to the phone from there she dialed the dispatcher at the cumberland pd and asked to be put through to detective cesar aponte she had read his name in a newspaper one week earlier when he was quoted during an investigation into a domestic assault case that had left a woman fighting for her life if he was not on duty she had three other names all taken from the newspapers there was a pause then a mans voice came on the line detective aponte speaking she took a breath and began there will be a bank robbery today at four pm at a first united in cumberland the man leading the robbery is named edward moloch he lives at using racal the call was traced back to the pay phone at the mall by the time the local cruiser arrived marianne was gone and nobody could recall what the woman who had made the call looked like the only thing that the old woman behind the counter at the beanie baby boutique could remember was that she had an infant boy asleep on her shoulder stuck behind the pay phone was an envelope just as marianne had told them there would be it contained molochs various false ids and some but not all of the material from the attic relating to what she believed were his past crimes most of it remained in the house by then marianne had arrived at the meeting place a disused gas station half a mile outside town she was five minutes late there was no sign of karens car and for a moment she panicked fearing that she had been abandoned then karen appeared from the back of the lot waving her around she drove and parked beside a beatup oldsmobile she got out of the car and saw that karen had a manila envelope in her hand youve got it youve got it all youve got my money marianne popped the trunk the black knapsack she had taken was zippered closed when she opened it dead presidents blinked in the bright sunlight ten of the sealed bundles had been opened then rebound marianne handed them to karen fifty thousand i counted it this morning i trust you she handed over the envelope marianne slit it with her thumbnail dont you trust me if i didnt trust you do you think id be opening the trunk in front of you i guess not she examined the passport the drivers license the card bearing her social security number she was now marianne elliot instead of marian moloch her sons name according to his new birth certificate was daniel where his fathers name should have been the word unknown had been written youve left me with my own first name almost youve never done this before the first thing that will give you away is your failure to answer to your new name it will arouse suspicion and attract attention to you marianne is close enough to your given name for you to avoid that problem and dannys father she had asked karen to give her son the name daniel it was the name that she had always wanted for him but moloch had given him his own name edward now he was daniel in her mind he had always been daniel you get asked his name was lee server and hes dead in there is an obituary for server it will tell you all you need to know about him marianne nodded she found a set of documents and ids for both patricia and bill the photos a little old because they were the only ones she had at hand when karen had agreed to help her once again they had been left with their own first names i should ask you for more money said karen i had to pay off some people the paper trail goes right back even down to death certificates for your father and mother theres a typewritten sheet of paper in that envelope memorize the details on it then burn it its your new family except youll never get to know them now youre an only child your parents are dead its all very sad marianne stuffed the material back into the envelope thank you how the hell did you ever get involved with this guy asked karen suddenly a man tried to rape me she replied he saved me there was a pause did he karen asked sadly i trusted him he wasstrong she started back toward her car i gave him those names the ones on the papers that you found in the attic said karen marianne stopped what do you mean i created them all but one he came to me and i did it who is he who is he really i dont know the only name that i didnt give him is the one he used with you moloch was how i knew him right from the beginning i guess he likes that name a lot she tossed a set of car keys to marianne this is your car now registration is in the glove compartment its clean ill give you more money didnt cost me much id kept it hidden away in case i ever had to run i guess your needs greater than mine right now karen helped her move the bags into the trunk of the new car then shifted the baby seat to the oldsmobile while marianne carried danny he was awake now and had begun to cry youd better get going said karen marianne strapped the stillhowling child in then stood at the drivers door i i know then without even knowing why marianne walked quickly up to the older woman and kissed her tenderly on the mouth then hugged her after a moment karen responded hugging her tightly in return good luck she whispered and to you then marianne got in the car and drove away there were three first uniteds in cumberland and each was monitored after mariannes warning it was not her fault that the information she had given was wrong cumberland was merely the base the bank itself was in fort ashby ten miles south it was taken just as the doors were being locked for the day nobody was killed although the security guard was pistolwhipped and would never fully recover from his injuries the silent alarm was not set off until the robbersfive of themhad left the bank by the time the police could react the thieves were gone moloch got back to his house shortly before daybreak the street was quiet he made one full circuit of the block then parked at the end of the driveway and entered the house he walked straight to the back door passed through the garden in darkness and unlocked the shed door he saw the space where the board should have been and the empty hollow where his money once lay and then there were flashlight beams and shouted orders and dogs barking and as he emerged blinking into the phalanx of armed men he thought bitch ill kill you for this the third day widowd wife and wedded maid betrothed betrayer and betrayd sir walter scott the betrothed chapter six it was close to dawn when they neared their destination already there was a faint glow visible in the east as of a fire distantly glimpsed they had agreed on a rotation for sleeping and driving as moloch was reluctant to pause for any reason he had the scent of her now of that he was certain it had proved easier than expected for elements outside his control had fallen into place for him foolish verso who had hoped to trade molochs life for his own his idiot brotherinlaw risking his anonymity in order to gamble on meaningless outcomes and dexters casual remark that his wife would not be using her own name causing tumblers to fall in molochs mind for most of the journey he remained silent and awake watching the red lights of the cars on the road streaming toward the void fading into the distance until they were swallowed up by the blackness moloch had been incarcerated for so long that he found himself fascinated by the small details of the lives being lived around him although there was a remoteness perhaps even a coldness to his interest it was the curiosity of a small boy marveling at the industry of termites or ants in the moment before he annihilates their mound or torches their nest he watched the cars go by their occupants only occasionally visible in the brief flare of a match or the comforting illumination of the dashboard lights and wondered how so many could be on the roads and highways at this time for what mission could be so urgent what destination so compelling that it caused them to give themselves up to a journey through the night forsaking sleep moloch suspected that for some there was no destination there was no home waiting no husband drowsing no wife sleeping or children dreaming there was only the illusion of progress and momentum offered by the cocoon of the automobile in the surrounding night these people were not traveling they were fleeing taunted by a false belief that if they ran fast and hard enough they might somehow escape their past or their present that they might even somehow escape themselves moloch recalled those who had crossed his path and faded from the view of the world as a consequence for some he thought it might almost have been a relief he closed his eyes and waited for the coming of the dream braun weary now of willards unsmiling company had joined dexter and moloch in the lead van while leonie had taken the wheel of the second farther back along the road tell and powell were engaged in a lengthy discussion of their various sexual conquests both real and imagined while shepherd sat in silent judgment upon them as the trip had worn on shepherd had begun to draw away a little not only from the younger men in the car but from the group as a whole there had been no opportunity for him to talk with dexter and braun since molochs escape and the need to do so was now pressing they knew one another well these three men for they had worked together before under molochs aegis leonie too shared a history with dexter although she largely kept her own counsel choosing to reveal her thoughts only with dexter and trusting him to relay them if necessary to the rest of the group shepherd was concerned about recent developments including the killing of the investigator down at dismal creek and the mutilation of his companion and the deaths of molochs sisterinlaw and her husband he also had real worries about the sanity of at least one of their group of powell he knew little and in truth cared to know even less he had come highly recommended and had state time behind him in maryland and tennessee shepherd found him boorish and ignorant and the snatches of conversation that were coming from shepherds right did nothing to alter that perception tell he liked but while he understood the possible justification for taking the life of the young pizzadelivery man he was smart argued tell after the fact and might have noticed more than he pretended he was not convinced that it was necessary and tells inability to make that distinction troubled him the incident with the cell phone also indicated that tells temper was somewhere between short and nonexistent shepherd as previously noted wasnt a big fan of cell phones he believed they were contributing to the creation of a ruder less caring society there was a time and it wasnt so very long ago when people kept their voices down in public not only because they wished to enjoy a little privacy in their conversations but also because talking too loudly disturbed the people around them now all that was going out the window along with leaving your car unlocked or your front door open the fact that people now locked their doors and secured their houses to protect them from criminals like shepherd was beside the point still shepherd had never really considered solving the cell phone problem by killing anyone who used one in a discourteous manner it was a pity that nobody would ever know that excessive conversational volume was the reason behind the arabs murder otherwise he might have made a nice example to others convincing them to change their ways shepherd figured that tell would be okay if he could just calm down some maybe take a deep breath once in a while instead of pulling a trigger shepherd would work on him but the principal source of shepherds unease was willard and he knew that dexter shared that disquiet shepherd was a man who believed himself to be in control of his own appetites he also knew from past experience that discipline and restraint in any operation increased the odds of its success and that once those qualities began to dissipate a breakdown of some kind inevitably followed willard quite clearly was incapable of exercising selfcontrol making tell look like a buddhist by comparison he was an immature man defined by his appetites shepherd did not know what ties bound willard to moloch or what made the older man show such indulgence toward the younger sometimes moloch seemed to demonstrate toward willard the tenderness of a lover at other times he appeared almost paternal protecting the younger man while reluctantly disciplining him whatever molochs feelings about him willard was becoming more and more unpredictable as a consequence they were leaving a trail for others to follow and there would be a reckoning because of it shepherd had no intention of sitting on death row waiting to see if the chair or natural causes would take him first his share of the money would buy him a comfortable life if he was careful and he had every intention of living long enough to spend it he needed to talk with dexter and braun for something had to be done about willard if leonie felt unease at the prospect of spending time in willards company she did not show it when braun asked her to switch vehicles braun for one suspected that leonie felt little of anything at all and that under the skin she and willard might well be blood relatives dexter had used her for jobs a couple of times with molochs agreement but braun still knew nothing about her other than a story dexter had once told him leonie was heading out of some dyke bar in south carolinabraun was less surprised to hear that leonie ate at home than that shed managed to find a pickup joint in south carolinawhen a pair of guys jumped her in the parking lot braun knew their kind had grown up alongside them they hated women particularly independent women and there was nothing more independent than a woman who didnt need a man for sex they bundled her into the trunk of their car and drove her to a shack out in the woods braun didnt need to know anything more about what had happened to leonie after that and dexter didnt tell him much anyway but he could guess afterward when they saw that she hadnt buckled they beat on her some then dumped her out in back of the dyke bar her clothes torn and bloody she didnt go back inside though instead she walked to her car where her gun lay taped beneath the dashboardshe hadnt bothered to carry it into the bar a mistake that she would never again repeatand returned to her apartment where she washed and douched and treated her cuts then took a couple of sleeping pills and went to bed the next morning she called dexter she told him all that had occurred and he drove down to be with her it was dexter who pulled the two guys from the street and brought them back to the shack where leonie was waiting then he sat outside in his truck smoking and listening to r l burnside while he watched the road he heard that hunters found the two men a couple of days later one of them was still alive although he died as soon as the medics tried to move him dexter figured that leonie would be kind of unhappy to hear that only one of them had survived for so long usually she was precise about these things but then shed been pretty upset by what had been done to her so it might have clouded her judgment some it wasnt that part of the story that had stuck with braun though the guys had gotten what they deserved make no mistake about that and braun wasnt about to shed any tears for them no what gave braun an insight into leonie was what those guys saw before they died one had been married while the other was dating a woman who worked nights providing technical support for her local isp leonie had visited them both while she was waiting for dexter to pick up the two men and just as theyd had fun with her well shed had fun with their women shed even taken some pictures before she left dexter said theyd come out pretty good considering the amount of red in them no willard wouldnt be screwing with leonie not if he had any sense in that prettyboy head of his tell and shepherd meanwhile appeared to have bonded shepherd had told braun that he was reasonably impressed with how tell had handled the verso thing like shepherd braun wasnt so sure that tell had really needed to kill the pizza guy but there was no way of knowing how much he had taken in so tell had probably erred on the side of caution whatever occurred at least there was dexter braun had known dexter longer than almost any other human being they were like brothers bound by blood they shared cars rooms even women although if braun ever met a woman that he liked as much as dexter then he planned to marry her and not share her with anyone not even dexter this did not strike braun as at all odd you ever wonder about names asked dexter from out of nowhere wonder how said braun about how only some colors become names and not others like like black you know mr black or mr white you got mr green too and your mr brown but thats about it you ever meet anybody called blue or yellow or red doesnt happen except in movies you think thats strange you know it never struck me before you think its interesting no you got too much time on your hands is what i think you need to be doing something useful to keep your mind off shit like that just drive there was a time said dexter when you thought i had a lot of interesting shit to say i thought you were deep then i got to know you you saying im not deep if you were a pool little kids could paddle in you if you were a pool little kids would piss in you just drive will you the sooner we get to where were going the sooner i can get away from your shallow black ass but both men were smiling as dexter tapped the gas moloch momentarily forgotten in the darkness behind them shoot the women first it was an axiom of antiterrorist units quite literally a maxim to live by the women were more fanatical they had more to prove and when they made a decision they were less likely than their male peers to experience doubts or second thoughts about it women attempted suicide less frequently than men but they were far more likely to follow the attempt through to its fatal conclusion similarly when a woman picked up a gun and put her finger on the trigger there was a good chance that someones body was about to be endowed with an extra hole if willard was the most unpredictable of the little band of killers slowly making its way north and tell the most volatile then leonie was the most lethal braun was right to suspect as much and moloch had he been asked would have confirmed that his faith in her resolve was based entirely on the evidence of his own eyes leonie enjoyed power specifically she enjoyed wielding the power of life and death and had always done so as a child spiders and insects had briefly provoked her interest they were simple to catch and had enough easily detachable limbs to keep her amused in the clean little bedroom of the clean little unit that she shared with her mother in one of philadelphias more desirable lowincome housing projects the young leonie quickly tired of bugs though for there was no challenge to them similarly unlike some of the boys who shared her environment she did not enjoy tormenting cats and dogs instead leonie retreated into her own world growing slowly quieter a stillness creeping over her as she sat at her window and waited for the time when fantasy and reality might coalesce it was from that window that she watched as the slim black boy walked across the basketball court toward the one who called himself ex ex had touched her once while she was coming back from the store with an armful of groceries she had been unable to move fearful that she might drop the bag in her arms it was the middle of the month when money was always short for her momma and so she had endured exs touch and the sour taste of his breath when he placed his mouth upon her own ex had grown bored when she did not respond and called her some names that she did not understand secretly her stillness had disturbed the young dealer who found it unnerving the way her eyes had never left his not even blinking while he fondled her since then he had not approached her again even as she matured into the finelooking woman she would eventually become now the boy was facing ex and ex was saying something to him leonie felt her mouth grow dry she pressed her fingers and face against the glass a smear of breath pulsing then fading upon it she knew what the boy was about to do she felt it from him could see it in his stance kill him she thought kill him now and he did by the time exs body hit the ground the girl was running to the door of her apartment she intercepted the boy on a patch of waste ground that led to the river already she could hear sirens the boy could hear them too he looked scared give me the gun said leonie the boy didnt move instead he just stared at the pretty girl with the thick black hair who stood before him she was a year or two younger than he was he guessed but everything about her spoke of a maturity beyond his own give it to me she repeated they wont search me to their right a patrol car made an arc into the project spraying dirt and water from the rutted concrete a second car came in from the left effectively cutting off his exit he couldnt understand how theyd gotten there so fast suddenly the girl moved toward him her hands slipping beneath his jacket as she hugged herself to him she buried her face in his chest then pulled back and kissed him on the cheek gotta run she said ill see you later baby and as the cops approached she skipped away across the dirt the gun tucked into the waistband of her skirt her shirt hiding the butt he watched one of the cops glance at her and saw her reward him with a little smile then she was gone and dexter never saw the gun again but he saw the girl and although that kiss was the only one she would ever give him dexter loved her and he knew that she loved him too in her way still he had never crossed her and he never would if it came down to it he believed that she would kill him she loved him more than she loved anyone else in the world yet she would take his life if he failed her dexter figured that where leonie was concerned the rest of humanity didnt stand a chance it was the absence of lights that alerted karen meyer she heard the van pulling up outside her house but no headlights matched its progress her first thought was that it was the cops coming and she ran through a mental checklist as she climbed out of bed and pulled on a pair of jeans over her panties the dummy passports and driving licenses were hidden in a panel behind her gas stove accessible only by taking apart the oven from the inside and she deliberately kept it thick with grease and food waste to discourage any possible search even if it meant that the oven was rendered practically unusable as a result her inks pens and dyes were all in her studio and were indistinguishable from the materials she used in her regular design work her cameras were an expensive nikon a cheaper minolta and a canon digital again she could argue that these were an essential part of her job since she often had to take photos as part of her initial preparations the last batch of material had gone out a few days before and there was nothing on the slate she figured that she was clean she had moved up to norwich connecticut to be close to her mother her mother had suffered a bad stroke that left her with impaired mobility and karen as the only daughter in the family had felt responsible for her karens brothers lived over on the west coast one in san diego the other in tacoma but they each sent money to boost the coverage offered by their moms insurance and to help karen out although unofficially karen didnt need their help because her sidelines were quite lucrative still she wasnt one to turn down free money and the cash had helped her to rent the pretty house on perry avenue in which she now lived much as she loved her mom she couldnt live with the old woman and her mom wanted to retain some degree of independence anyway she had a panic button and a day nurse and karen was three minutes away from her it was the perfect arrangement for all of them she looked out of the window and saw the van it was black and comparatively cleannot so beat up that it might attract attention and not so clean as to stand out there was no other vehicle in sight not cops she thought her doorbell rang not cops she went to her dresser and removed the gun from the drawer it was a smith amp wesson ladysmith auto its grip designed for a smaller womans hand she had never fired it anywhere except on the range but its presence in the house reassured her although meyer made a point of no longer dealing with violent criminals there was no telling what some people might do if they were desperate enough barefoot she padded down the stairs the gun held close to her thigh she did not turn on any of the house lights the street lamps cast the shadow of a woman against her door who is it she said she glanced to her right where the display panel for the alarm system was mounted and began checking the sensors in each zone front door ok karen said a womans voice karen meyer i said who is it living room ok my name is leonie im in trouble i was told you could help me who told you dining room ok his name is edward garage ok edward what kitchen disarmed her stomach lurched she felt metal at the nape of her neck a hand closed over her gun you should know my name said a voice after all its the only one that you didnt give me dupree awoke to pain his joints and muscles even his gums still ached although hed taken some painkillers the night before he felt too weak to lift his own weight from his bed so he lay still watching shadows on the ceiling rise and fade like smoke he wondered sometimes if the symptoms he felt were phantoms too shadows cast by the knowledge of his impending mortality the pain had been coming more frequently in recent months he had been warned by old doc bruder that his size and build left him open to a variety of ailments and the pain he was experiencing could be the onset of any one of those youre not frail by any means the retired physician had said while joe sat on a couch in the old mans den gary cooper striding down a dusty street on the tv screen forsaken by his darling but youre not as strong as you look or as people seem to think you are your job puts stresses on you youre complaining to me of pains in your chest aches in your joints im telling you that you need to get yourself checked out but dupree had not taken bruders advice just as bruder had known that he would not dupree was afraid if he was told that he could no longer do his job then that job would be taken away from him his work on the island was more important to him than anything else without it he would be lost he would die dupree was thirtyeight now and would be thirtynine in may he recalled a picture he had once seen of robert pershing wadlow the socalled alton giant the largest man on record wadlow towering over the two men at either side of him their heads barely reaching his elbows at eight feet eleven inches tall he was taller than the enormous bookcase behind him his hands were buried in the pockets of his dark suit and he appeared to be teetering to his left as if on the verge of toppling over his thin frame buffeted by an unseen wind dupree guessed that wadlow was twenty when the photograph was taken two years later he was dead felled by the great curse that was his condition lying on his bed in the house in which he had grown up dupree remembered his fathers stories his tales of old giants told to reassure a boy who felt himself alienated from his peers by his size his father had lied to him they were lies of omission but lies nonetheless for his father had tailored his stories to the boys problems cutting distorting softening for his stories were not truly about giants they were about the death of giants outside it was still dark ordinarily he would have been on his way to the station house by now but he had juggled the rotation so that he could spend the evening with marianne he lay back on his bed and tried to rest sharon macy sat in the tiny kitchen of her apartment sipping a mug of hot milk she had a lot on her mind her father was due to enter the hospital the following week for a series of tests after he had complained of pains in his back and chest he was laughing off the concerns of his wife and daughter but there was a history of cancer in the family and macy knew that the fear of it was with each of them under other circumstances she might have returned home immediately but the department was already buckling under the combined weight of illness and leavewhich was why macy although still on probation had found herself on the island rotationand she suspected that only a real emergency would enable her to absent herself from duty anyway her father had told her in no uncertain terms that he did not want her hanging around the house fussing over him her tour on sanctuary would leave her with five days off at the end of it she would drive down to providence as soon as she was back on the mainland and would examine her options in the light of what if anything her fathers tests revealed macy thought too of barron and the drugs that she had seen him take from terry scarfe maybe she was mistaken in what she believed had occurred but she didnt think so she wished that she had someone with whom she could talk about these things and for the first time since the break up of their relationship she felt herself missing max or at least missing what he had once represented for her to hell with him she thought to hell with all of them she placed the empty mug in the sink returned to bed and at last fell asleep to the sound of a ship in the bay its horn rising like the cry of a sea creature lost in the darkness seeking only to return to the safety of its kind the call woke terry scarfe from a deep alcoholinduced sleep and so it took him a couple of seconds to recognize the voice and the distinctive eastern european accent we have a job for you someone has purchased your expertise even in his dazed state terry knew that whatever expertise he might have was worth next to nothing unless you were dealing in pesetas and were happy just to count the zeros sure he said terry wasnt going to argue he needed some cash even if he hadnt needed it these people werent the kind you refused they owned terry scarfe and he knew it youll get a call usual place fifteen minutes the man said then hung up terry rose swayed a little and pulled a pair of sweatpants and an old tshirt over his scrawny body he found his heaviest overcoat then walked two blocks to the pay phone along the way picking up a coffee at the dunkin donuts to warm his body and his hands life had not been particularly kind to terry scarfe most of the time it seemed to treat him like he had screwed its sister other times it went after him like he had screwed its mother as well he had one failed marriage behind him a failure that was due terry felt to a combination of factors including excessive alcohol intake on the night that he had proposed his arrest and incarceration shortly after the wedding itself and the unforgiving and in fact downright unpleasant nature of the woman to whom he had attached himself his wife had divorced him while he was in jail on burglary charges then married someone else while terry was locked up for possession of a controlled substance her significant life events terry concluded seemed to coincide with his government vacations maybe if he stayed out of jail for a while her life wouldnt be quite so good while the quality of his own existence would improve considerably a smarter man than terry might have concluded that his criminal ambitions for himself far exceeded the talents available to him to achieve them but like most criminals terry wasnt particularly smart unfortunately his career options were now even more limited than they had been to begin with and few of them were likely to meet with the approval of the forces of law and order which was why he was standing beside a telephone in the darkness waiting to talk to someone he had never met and who was unlikely to offer terry a job tasting beer or testing feather beds for softness just as terry was starting to notice that he could no longer feel his feet the call came through terry scarfe my name is dexter terry thought the guy sounded black it didnt bother him except that black people tended to stand out some in portland and if the guy was planning on coming up it could present problems what can i do for you theres an island somewhere off the coast there its called dutch island yeah dutch sanctuary what some folks still call it sanctuary thats all but dutch yeah dutch is good he heard the black guy sigh you done yeah sorry we need you to find out as much as you can about it like cop stuff ferries points of access ill need to bring in someone else i know a guy lives out there hes got no love for the big cop on the island big cop yeah fuckin giant youre shitting me nope for real well find out all you can and get your friend to track down a woman shes using the name marianne elliot shell have a little boy with her about six years old i want to know where she lives who shes friendly with boyfriends shit like that when do you need this by tonight ill do my best terry thought that he heard in the background a soft pop terry knew that sound somebody had just taken a bullet no said dexter youll do better than that dexter stared down at the body of karen meyer she had never been a pretty woman but leonie and willard had removed what little superficial attractiveness she might have had they worked well together it was kind of worrying dexter would have to talk to her he didnt want her getting too close to willard he and shepherd had talked and the way things were going willard wasnt going to be around much longer meyer had been easy to find shed transferred her business north but had left word with the kind of people who might need her services in the future it had taken dexter just one phone call to find out where she was hed always thought meyer was smart and relatively unsentimental it was all money with her and he guessed that the woman had given her a big share of molochs stash in return for her help it must have been a lot to make her risk crossing moloch he hoped that shed had a good time with it because in those final minutes in her basement she had paid in spades for what shed done did you find someone asked moloch yeah hell cost us five gs to our friends boston plus a straight ten percent of whatever is on the island and some favors in the future hed better be worth it they threw in a bonus as a sign of goodwill moloch waited and dexter smiled they gave us a cop the changeover went smoothly lockwood and barker came out on the first ferry and started the weekly test of the medical and fire equipment at the station house at eleven am dupree checked in with them then drove down main street to the post office parking the explorer in the lot on the righthand side of the white clapboard building he had called larry amerling that morning to tell him that there was something he wanted to talk to him about it struck him that amerling might have been expecting the call amerling knew more about the island than anyone else maybe even more than dupree himself his home was filled with books and papers on the history of casco bay including copies of his own pamphlet printed privately and sold at the market and at the bookstores over in portland amerling was a widower and had been for ten years his children lived on the mainland but they visited regularly little trains of grandchildren in tow dupree usually spent thanksgiving with amerling as it was his familys tradition to return to the island and celebrate the feast together they were good people even if it was larry amerling who had first christened the policeman melancholy joe only a handful of people used that name and few of them used it to his face although among the cops assigned to the island the name had stuck dupree thought that amerling would be alone when he called as the old man usually took a halfhours timeout at eleven am to get some paperwork done and drink his green tea but the postmaster had company that morning the painter giacomelli was standing against the wall drinking takeout coffee from the market he looked troubled so did amerling dupree nodded a greeting to them both i interrupt something he asked no said amerling weve been waiting for you you want some tea dupree poured some of the green tea into one of amerlings delicate little chinese cups he held the cup gently in the palm of his hand the three men exchanged pleasantries and island gossip for a time before lapsing into an uneasy silence dupree had spent the morning trying to put his concerns into words to explain them in a way that did not make him sound like a superstitious fool in the end amerling saved his blushes jacks here for the same reason youre here i think amerling began which would be theres something wrong on the island dupree didnt respond it was jack who spoke next i thought it was just me but it isnt the woods feel different and go on said amerling jack looked at the policeman i havent been drinking if thats what youre thinking least of all not enough for this i didnt think that at all said dupree there was no way to tell if he was lying or not well you may reconsider when you hear this my paintings are changing dupree waited a heartbeat you mean theyre getting better there was a burst of laughter that eased the tension a little and seemed to relax the painter slightly no smartass theyre as good as theyre gonna get there are marks appearing on the canvases they look like men but i didnt put them there theyre in the sea paintings and now theyre in some of the landscapes as well you think someone is sneaking into your house and painting in figures on your work he tried to keep the disbelief from his voice he almost succeeded but jack spotted it i know it sounds weird the thing of it is these figures arent painted on he reached down to the floor and lifted up a board wrapped in an old cloth he removed the cloth revealing one of his seascapes dupree stepped closer and saw what looked like two men in the shallows they were little more than stick figures but they were there he reached out a finger can i touch it sure dupree ran his finger over the board feeling the traces of the brush strokes against his skin when he came to the figures he paused then raised the tips of his fingers to his nose and sniffed thats right said jack theyve been burned into the board he picked up a second painting and handed it to dupree you know what this is dupree felt uncomfortable even looking at the painting it was certainly one of jacks better efforts he sucked at sea and hills but he did good trees they were mostly bare and in the background of the picture almost hidden by mist dupree could make out a stone cross it was definitely a departure for the painter its the approach to the site he said i have to tell you jack youre never going to sell this painting just looking at it gives me the creeps its not for sale i do some of these for well i guess out of my own curiosity tell me what you see dupree held the painting at arms length and tried to concentrate on it i see trees grass marsh i see the cross i see he stopped and peered more closely at the detail on the canvas what is that something gray hung in the dark place between two trees close by the cross he almost touched it with his finger then thought better of it i dont know said jack i didnt paint it there are others if you look hard enough and there were the closer he looked the more apparent they became some were barely blurs the kind of smears that appeared on photographs when someone moved and the shutter speed was kind of slow others were clearer dupree thought he could distinguish faces among them dark sockets black mouths are these painted on jack shrugged his shoulders they look painted to you no they look like photographs you still afraid i might be drinking too much dupree shook his head id say youre not drinking enough amerling spoke you going to tell me you came here because youre worried about raccoons or have you felt something too dupree sighed nothing specific just an unease i cant describe it except to say that its a sensation in the air like the prelude to an electrical storm thats about as good a description as ive heard other people have felt it too the older folk mostly this isnt the first time something like this has occurred it happened before in your daddys time when just before george sherrin disappeared but it wasnt quite like this that buildup came quickly maybe over a day or two then was gone again just as quickly this one is different its been going on for longer how long months id say but its been so gradual most people havent even noticed it until now if theyve noticed it at all but you did ive been feeling it for a while it was the accident that confirmed it the accident and what the lauter girl said before she died she was in pain she didnt know what she was saying i dont believe that i dont think you do either she was talking about the dead i know dupree walked to the window of the little office and looked out on island avenue it was quiet but it wasnt peaceful instead it was like a community awaiting the outbreak of some longanticipated conflict or perhaps that was just a tormented policeman a drunk and an old romantic trying to impose their own interpretation on an innocent world people have died on the island before now some of them pretty violently dupree said weve had car crashes fires even a homicide or two you think they all saw ghosts before they died maybe amerling paused but id guess not so why the lauter girl and why now your father he told you about the island once again dupree glanced at jack he remembered taking the old man out on his porch after danny elliot had found him with blood pumping from a deep scalp wound he had been furious with the painter maybe because he saw in him some of his own flaws but mostly because he had scared the boy now he was about to reveal a part of himself that he had kept hidden from everyone jack however long he might have been on the island was still an outsider amerling guessed his thoughts if youre worried about jack then id lay those worries to rest hes more sensitive to this place than some who have grandparents buried in the cemetery i think you can speak safely in front of him dupree raised his hands helplessly before the painter i understand said jack no hard feelings he told me began dupree he went through the histories of the families right from day one he made me memorize them all he told me about the slaughter and the new settlement that followed later he told me about george sherrin and why he thought sherrin had been taken he told me all of it i never fully understood i dont think i even believed some of it but he tried to explain it to you yes he told me what he himself believed he believed that this place was always different the natives didnt come out here and they used most of these islands before the whites arrived but for some reason they wouldnt come out to this one amerling interrupted they had pretty good reasons for not coming here this island is kind of an anomaly its big but its way out on the outer ring they only had bark canoes to get them out here i think it was just too far away for them to worry about it well anyhow then the settlers came continued dupree and they were killed my father thought like his father what happened to them tainted the island and some remnant some memory of those events clung to this place the violence of the past never went away something of it stayed here like a mark in stone now theres a balance on the island and anything that endangers that balance has to be dealt with if it isnt he swallowed the last of the tea if it isnt dealt with then something else on the island will deal with it in its own way my father thought that it had found a way to purge itself of anything that might threaten it the way a persons system will flush out toxins thats what happened to sherrin he was toxic and the island dealt with him thats what my father believed he finished and stared at the leaves in the bottom of his cup it sounded absurd but he remembered the look on his fathers face as he told him the history of the island his father was not a superstitious man in fact he was the most realistic nobullshit man that dupree had ever met frank dupree was the kind of man who would carry his own ladder around with him just so he could walk under it to show up more credulous folks amerling poured himself some more tea then offered the pot to dupree the policeman declined why do you drink this stuff anyway it keeps me calm said amerling after a pause dupree reconsidered and extended his cup any port in a storm he said your father knew that this place was different said amerling we talked about it some and we both came to more or less the same conclusion sometimes bad things happen in a place and it never truly recovers the memory of it lingers some people are sensitive to it some arent i read once that tommy lee jones you know that actor fella he lived in the cottage where marilyn monroe committed suicide or was murdered or whatever you believe took her from this earth didnt bother tommy lee jones none hes not that kind of fella from what ive read but me i dont think i could have lived in a place like that knowing what happened there i believe and i may be a fool that something of its past must remain there like damp trapped in its walls what happened on sanctuary was so much worse than a single murder like you say it tainted this island marked it forever then a bunch of rapists took a woman here a long time after and they disappeared flash forward to george sherrin and he winds up under the roots of a tree i was there when they dug him up and i saw what the roots had done to him amerling leaned forward grasping the teacup in both hands he was an evil son of a bitch there were stories about him after he died he tormented and abused his own children and they say he might have hurt children on the mainland i heard that too said dupree my father believed it was so well if your daddy believed it then it was true i got no doubt in my mind now the island or whatever dwells here wouldnt tolerate him and it got rid of him theres no better way of putting it than that but where does that leave the lauter girl and wayne cady youre saying they deserved what happened to them no i dont think the island played any part in that they died because theyd been drinking and decided to boost a car but i think something was drawn to that place as they died because theres an awareness now this tension that weve all felt its there for a purpose i think when the crash happened the nature of the tragedysudden frighteningdrew something it came to see what was happening something something like what i dont know have you been out to the site lately not for a while its almost impossible to get to the paths become overgrown there are fallen trees briers even the marshes seem to be getting bigger you said almost impossible does that mean youve been out there amerling paused yesterday jack went with me we didnt stay too long why its stronger out there its like getting too close to the bars of the lions cage you can feel the threat and there are no birds said jack not out there not anywhere said amerling havent you noticed to tell the truth dupree hadnt but now that he thought about it there was a silence to the island that he had never experienced before the only bird that he had seen was the dying gull on mariannes lawn thats where your daddy and i differed about the island he believed it was something unconscious like a force of nature a tree doesnt think about repairing breaches in its bark it just does it he thought the island operated on that level but you dont no and the lauter girls last words just confirm what i believe whatever is out there is conscious it thinks and reasons its curious and its getting stronger jesus thought dupree i cant believe im having this conversation if anyone from the department heard me theyd have me jacketed and locked up in a padded room but the brass dont come out here so they dont know what its like they dont understand it most of them dont understand much about any of the islands but this one in particular is beyond them all i can do is hope that nothing happens that would force me to try to explain it to them well chief i guess you could say that the island is haunted and i think some dead people came to take a look at sylvie lauter oh they had lights did i mention that they must go through a hell of a lot of batteries so thats our main lead were scouring the island for batteries so why now why should it be so strong now a convergence of circumstances maybe a new factor on the island that we dont recognize or havent noticed youre thinking its dangerous maybe do you think its dupree paused uncertain that he wanted to use the word that came to mind then relented do you think its evil evil thats a moral concept a human concept said amerling it could be that whatever is on this island has got no concept of morality and no need for it it just wants what it wants which is i dont know that if i knew it we wouldnt be having this conversation im not sure i even want to be having this conversation as it is the postmaster grinned anyone else apart from us three was here theyd say we were two foolish old men and a giant driven simple by what was ailing him larry amerling was never one to sugarcoat his words but dupree felt as if the older man had been reading his thoughts jack interrupted i heard from her father that there was some question about the lauter girls death he said yeah i heard that too said amerling although i heard it from you he cocked an eyebrow at the painter i just thought you might like to know said jack hell you know just about everything else i figure a gap in your knowledge would bug you more than most folks dupree didnt answer immediately he wasnt sure that he should but then both men already seemed to know as much as he did or more they found insect matter in her mouth and beneath her fingernails he said it came from a moth a tomato hornworm theyre big and ugly and theyre all dead by september and im not sure that ive ever even seen one on this island until recently i saw one on a tree in the cemetery when they were laying sylvie lauter down said jack i took it home looked it up in a book then pinned it to a board thought i might paint it sometime paint it badly said amerling youd have to stick a note on it so folks would know what it was im not that bad said jack yes you are you came to my exhibition at the lions club there was free food i hope it poisoned you nope it was pretty good unlike what was on the walls dupree interrupted them gentlemen youre like two old dogs fighting its embarrassing he picked up his cap and flicked at some dust i was out at doug newtons place there was a moth there too same type i saw it on the curtains in his mothers bedroom but he wasnt talking to the two older men as much as to himself he ran his hands through his hair then placed his cap carefully on his head moths why moths moths were attracted to flames to light was that what it was some form of attraction toward sylvie lauter and the old newton woman what did they have in common the answer came to him immediately dying that was what they had in common how long have we got asked dupree not long said amerling i go outside its like i can hear the island humming the birds were the last sign its bad news when even the birds fear to fly so what do we do asked dupree we wait i guess we lock our doors we dont go wandering near the site at night its coming soon whatever it is then well know for good or bad then well know for sure chapter seven moloch allowed them to rest for the remainder of the day choosing to travel north under cover of darkness later that morning powell and shepherd headed down to maries home cooking and bought enough takeout for the day on the way back to perry avenue they stopped off at big garys liquor store and picked up two bottles of wild turkey to keep out the cold dexter and braun took an opportunity to rest once they had finished conversing softly with shepherd in karen meyers kitchen moloch had learned enough about meyer from their past dealings to know that she was the kind of woman who would have few visitors her house was the last on the street sheltered by trees and not overlooked by any of her neighbors he didnt know if she had a lover but there were no photographs on the refrigerator no little tokens of love on the shelf by the cookbooks he went through her studio heedless of the fingerprints that he left behind if they found him they already had more than enough evidence to justify the taking of his life it mattered little to him if they added karen meyers name to the final tally the studio was neat and her computer was password protected moloch guessed that anyone trying to gain access to it without the password would probably have just two or three chances before the computer automatically commenced erasing its memory he searched her bedroom and found a shoe box on the top shelf of her closet it contained a collection of letters from a woman named jessica most of them expressions of love except for the most recent dated october which detailed her reasons for ending the relationship jessica had met someone else apparently moloch found it curious that karen meyer had retained the breakup letter it seemed to suggest to him an element of emotional masochism in the forgers personality perhaps some part of her might even have enjoyed what willard and leonie had done to her in the basement although he somehow doubted it her body still lay on the basement floor she had resisted for longer than he expected which surprised him he had always thought of meyer as a pragmatist she must have known that she would have to tell him what she knew eventually but something had made her hold out for so long that he feared she would die before she revealed the location of his wife and son she had feelings for them moloch wondered if meyer and his wife had been lovers the possibility angered and aroused him marianne elliot she had kept her first name almost intact simply expanding it from the original marian it was a smart move typical of meyer moloch knew that those who assumed new identities sometimes gave themselves away in the first few months by failing to hear their new name when they were addressed by it or by signing checks rental agreements or bank documents with their old name the easiest way to avoid it was to give them a new name that began with the same letter preferably even the same two letters as their old name so james became jason linda became lindsay marian became marianne his son was now named danny not edward as they had agreed well perhaps agreed wasnt the right word his wife had wanted something simple and boyish but moloch liked formal names trust the bitch to give his son a name like danny as soon as she was out of his sight moloch didnt much care what happened to the boy he might take him with him when he left the island or he might leave him he might kill him or he might corrupt him he hadnt decided yet all he knew was that he felt no paternal instincts whatsoever toward him but his wife would understand before she died that it was within his power to do whatever he chose with his son he overturned the shoe box and watched as a jumble of photographs fell on karen meyers unmade bed he went through them with his fingertips turning over those that had landed facedown until he found the one that he had suspectedeven hopedmight be among them she was a little different now her hair was darker and she seemed to be downplaying her natural good looks when he had met her first in biloxi she had used makeup with a delicacy that had impressed him his experience of casino waitresses having led him to expect all of them to resemble the brides of mary kay now her face was completely unadorned her hair lank her face was very pale and the photograph taken in a photo booth suggested that she had not slept well in a very long time a perceptive man might look twice at her and begin to see something of the beauty that she was trying to disguise and a very unusual man might suspect something of the history of pain and abuse that had led her to take such steps the boy was on her lap his finger raised to the camera a birthday crown upon his head he had underestimated her and that was what troubled him more than anything else even more than the betrayal itself he had thought that he knew her knew her as intimately as only one who had explored both pleasure and pain through her could know her he believed that he had broken her for what was she but a thing to be used part of a front to fool those who might come after him the loving family man with the neat house the pretty wife the little boy who must surely have represented the first step on the road to a home filled with children and grandchildren molochs was not the routine abuse of drunks and petty sadists the kind that might at last force the object of their hatred to turn on them with a gun or a knife out of an instinctive desire for survival no molochs capacity to hurtemotionally physically psychologicallywas more refined than that the pain the stress could never be allowed to become unbearable and needed to be interspersed at times with moments of kindness even tenderness reminders of love need dependence yet somehow despite it all she had managed to keep something hidden from him some vital part of herself that he was unable to touch and it was that which had enabled her to escape him he was impressed by what she had achieved perhaps they were closer in spirit than he had ever imagined he placed the photograph in his jacket pocket then went back downstairs and turned on the television already the tv news bulletins were describing how the search for the escaped man was expanding extending the net to take in not only those states along the border but also the southern states as far north as maryland worse they had trawled for possible accomplices and now in addition to willard he had to worry about dexter and shepherd their pictures had appeared on every news show along with all known aliases their continued involvement was a risk but a calculated one once they got to maine they could complete their work in a matter of hours then head for canada most of the routes across the border were unpatrolled and those who chose to make the journey could easily slip across dexter would make sure of it dexter was clever that was why he had been entrusted with so much of the organization once it became apparent that moloch would be forced to face the grand jury where dexter went braun and leonie would follow as for shepherd he was a curious beast he seemed to drift through his existence never allowing himself to experience the extremes of pleasure or hatred he appeared to take little from life apart occasionally from the lives of others there was no sentimentality to him and while he was loyal it was the loyalty of one who has signed a contract and proposes to remain strictly within its bounds any breach of its clauses by another would render the contract null and void and shepherd would do whatever was necessary to extricate himself from its requirements as for the redneck powell and the belligerent tell with his cornrows knitted tightly against his skull tight as his pentup rage at the world moloch knew little of them except that dexter vouched for them they were men who would work for the promise of money and that was enough moloch was not sure how much of his cash the bitch had spent but there would be enough he felt certain to divide the best part of between them maybe even the hardest partsthe escape the associated killings and the pinpointing of her locationwere already behind them with luck their work would be done quickly and they would be scattered within two days if there was less money than they had expected then powell and tell were expendable the others could take whatever was left moloch needed only enough to get him out of the country after that he would find ways to make some more perhaps he would ask dexter to join him once the time was right except there was now a fatalism to dexter that moloch had not noticed before although moloch had often seen it develop in men like him after years of violence the odds in favor of meeting a violent end increased with every passing week they had stayed too long in the life to imagine that they could enjoy an easy escape at this late stage dexter had not become reckless as some of his kind did and neither did he appear to have become overly cautious instead that fatalism that resignation was written across his face he looked like a man who wanted to sleep to sleep and forget moloch had seen him talking with braun and shepherd he had not intervened he knew the subject of their conversation willard who now lay sleeping in the room across the hall moloch loved willard and knew that the love was reciprocated there was a purity to willard that was almost as beautiful as the boy himself and unlike shepherd he would be loyal unto death moloch could only guess at what went on inside willards head and sometimes wondered what it would be like to probe the younger mans mind he feared that it would be similar to briefly inhabiting the consciousness of a vaguely selfaware spider there would be blackness patience and a ceaseless driving appetite that could never be sated but there would also be inquisitiveness and rage and sensuality moloch had no idea where willard had come from he had not sought willard out rather willard had found him and attached himself to him he had approached moloch for the first time in a bar on the outskirts of saranac lake but the older man had been aware of him for some time for willard had been hovering at the periphery of his vision for a number of days moloch had made no move against him although he took to sleeping with his gun close at hand and the locks in his hotel rooms carefully secured the boy interested him without moloch really knowing why then exactly three days after moloch had first sighted him the boy had entered the bar and taken a seat in the booth across from him moloch had seen him coming and in the time it had taken the boy to walk from the door to the booth moloch had unholstered his pistol secured it with a silencer beneath the table and wrapped the gun in a pair of napkins it now lay between his legs molochs right index finger resting lightly upon the trigger the boy sat down carefully and placed his hands flat upon the table my name is willard he said hello willard ive been watching you i know i was beginning to wonder why that might be i have something for you im straight said moloch i dont want what you have to sell the boy showed no offense at the deliberate insult instead his brow simply furrowed slightly as though he didnt fully understand the import of molochs remark i think youll like it he continued its not far from here im eating ill wait until youre done you want something ive eaten moloch finished his plate of chicken and rice eating with his left hand his right remaining beneath the table when he was finished he laid down a ten and two ones to cover the food and his beer then told willard to lead the way he picked up his coat wrapped it around the gun then stayed behind the boy until they left the bar and found themselves in the parking lot it was a midweek night and only a handful of cars remained willard began walking toward a black pontiac but moloch called him back well take mine he said he tossed willard the keys and you can drive as the boy caught the keys moloch struck him hard with the butt of his gun and forced him against the pontiac he pushed the gun into the boys head then frisked him he found nothing not even coins when he stepped back there was blood on willards face from the wound in his scalp his face was completely calm you can trust me said willard we get to where were going ill help you clean up that cut i been cut before said willard it heals they got in the car and willard drove unspeaking for about ten miles until they were close to high falls gorge he turned left off up a secluded driveway then pulled up outside a twostory summer house its in here he said he opened the door and moved toward the front of the house moloch stayed about five feet back from him anything happens anything at all and ill kill you said moloch i told you you can trust me willard knelt down and took a key from the flowerpot by the door then entered the house he hit the hall lights so moloch could see that they were alone despite his assurances moloch searched the house using the boy as a shield as they entered each room the house was empty who owns this place willard shrugged i dont know their names where are they they left on sunday they come up here for weekends sometimes you want to see what i have for you its in the basement they reached the basement door willard opened it and turned on the light there was a flight of stairs leading down willard led moloch following near the back wall was a chair and in the chair was a girl she was seventeen or eighteen her mouth was gagged and her arms and legs had been secured her hair was very dark and her face was very pale she wore a black tshirt and a short black skirt her fishnet stockings were torn even in the poor basement light moloch could see track marks on her arms no one will miss her said willard no one the girl began to cry willard looked at her one last time then said ill leave you two alone ill be upstairs if you need anything and seconds later moloch heard the basement door close now years later moloch thought back to that first night and to the bound girl willard knew him understood his appetites his desires for they existed in a similar though deeper form within himself the girl was a courtship gift to him and he had accepted it gladly moloch loved willard but willard was no longer in control of his hunger if he had ever truly been able to rein it in the death of the woman jenna and the damage inflicted on the bait for the escape indicated that willard was spiraling down into some dark place from which he would not be able to return moloch loved willard and willard loved moloch and love brought with it its own duties but then as moloch knew only too well and as his wife was about to find out each man kills the thing he loves danny was kicking up a fuss as he always did when his mother tried to leave him for an evening it came from not having a father around she believed it had made him dependent maybe even a little soft and that worried her she wanted him to be strong because at some point he was going to have to learn about the world they had left behind and the man who had contributed to his creation but she also wanted him to be strong for her own selfish reasons she was tired tired of the constant fear tired of looking over her shoulder tired of having nobody on whom she could depend she wanted danny to grow up to be big and tough to protect her as she had protected him but that day it seemed was a long way off where are you going he asked again in that whining voice he adopted when he felt that the world was being unfair to him i told you already im going out to dinner with joe yes i dont like joe dont say that danny you know its not true it is true i hate him he killed a bird we went through this before danny he had to kill it it was hurt it was in so much pain that the kindest thing joe could have done was to put it out of that pain she had given him the gull carved for him by dupree he had looked at it for a moment then had cast it aside later when she went to retrieve it from the floor it was gone but she had glimpsed it on the shelf in dannys room before they left the house her son was a complex little boy the car jogged as it hit a dip in the road the headlights skewing crazily across the trees for a moment she wondered if she should bring up what had been troubling her since earlier in the evening or if she should just let it rest until the morning she had gone outside to put some water in the car and her attention had been drawn to the little grave that joe had created for the dead gull the stone that marked the spot had been moved aside and the earth was scattered around what was now a shallow hole the bird was gone but she had found blood and some feathers nearby it could have been an animal that had dug up the bird she supposed except that danny had dirt beneath his nails when hed eaten earlier that evening and when shed questioned him about it hed simply clammed up it was only later when she examined the grave that she had begun to suspect what had happened she decided to leave matters as they were she hoped to enjoy the night and didnt want to leave her son after an argument will richie be at bonnies im sure he will said marianne richies mental age wasnt much more than dannys but he seemed to care a lot about danny and danny liked the fact that richie deferred to him that didnt happen a lot for danny who had found it hard to make friends and to settle on the island she hung a left into bonnies driveway and killed the engine danny undid his seat belt and waited for her to come around and open the door light shone upon them as bonnie appeared on the steps her hair loose around her shoulders a cigarette dangling from the fingers that cupped her elbow bonnie claeson had endured a hard life a husband who beat her then ran off with a linedance teacher a son who would always be dependent on her and a succession of men who were at best unsuitable and at worst unstable sometimes marianne thought bonnie claeson appeared to live her life as if she were being paid by the tear then there was the accident the one in which her nephew wayne cady had been killed marianne had attended the funeral along with much of the islands population watching as the coffin was lowered into the ground at the small cemetery beside the islands baptist church bonnies sister so distraught with grief that when the time came to drop dirt on the coffin she had fallen to her knees and buried her face in the damp earth as if by doing so she might somehow burrow beneath the ground and join the dead boy bonnie had been strong for her sister that day but then she was strong in so many ways it wasnt easy for her raising a disabled son alone and the states overburdened mental health system had been of little help to her during her sons life much of the funding had traditionally gone to placing mentally ill children in psychiatric hospitals or residential programs but bonnie had resisted that from the start for a time the state had provided athome help to her after her husband left but cuts in funding and the prohibitive cost of sending someone out to the island on a regular basis meant that the service was withdrawn after less than a year marianne was suddenly terribly grateful that danny would never be so reliant on her and that at some time in the future she might be able to lean on him for support bonnie had been good to her from the beginning and she had returned that goodwill as much as she could taking richie for a night to give bonnie a break or bringing him on movie trips with danny on weekends she had never discussed her past with bonnie but marianne knew that the older woman suspected more than she ever said bonnie had been a victim of enough bad men to recognize a fellow sufferer when she met her thanks for doing this marianne said as she approached the step her hand on dannys shoulder its no problem hon how you doing danny okay mumbled danny just okay well well see if we can change that theres popcorn and soda inside and richie has got some new computer game that im sure hes just dying to show you how does that sound okay repeated danny in that same monotone marianne raised her eyes to heaven and bonnie gave her an i know shrug in return if im not late ill drop by to pick him up otherwise ill be by first thing in the morning dont sweat it hon you just have a good time marianne kissed danny on the cheek hugged him and told him to be good then went back to her car she waved goodbye as she drove but danny was already heading inside and his thoughts of her and his anger with her would soon be forgotten with the promise of new games to play she picked up speed once she was back on the main road which became island avenue she parked across the street from good eats the sound of bluegrass music coming to her from inside and checked her makeup in the mirror she touched up her lipstick tugged at her hair then sighed she was thirtytwo years old and she was going on her first date in years with a giant joe dupree was waiting for her a beer in front of him he was seated at a table in the back of the restaurant turned slightly sideways so that his legs didnt hit the underside once again she was struck by how out of place he must often feel nothing ever sits right for him things are always too small too tight too narrow he lives his life in a constant state of displacement even the island itself doesnt seem big enough to hold him he should be out in open spaces somewhere like montana where he would be dwarfed by the scale of the natural world he rose as he saw her approach and the table shuddered as he struck it with his thigh he reached down to save a water glass from falling liquid splashing the table and the single red rose in the vase at its center shedding a leaf as his hand made the clumsy catch the restaurant was half full mainly with local people although she saw a young couple stealing curious glances at the big man visitors funny how even after only a year here she resented the presence of outsiders hi he said i was starting to worry danny was kicking up some he still doesnt like it when i head out without him if he had his way hed be sitting here now demanding french fries and soda nothing wrong with that she raised a quizzical eyebrow you want me to go back and get him he lifted his hands in surrender no youre just fine he reddened thought briefly about trying to explain what he meant then decided that it would only get him into further trouble in truth it had been a long time since joe dupree had found himself in a social situation with a woman and he figured that his skills in that area limited as they were to begin with were probably pretty rusty by now women occasionally came on to him or they used to when joe dupree would take time out from the island to frequent the bars of the old port the islands little diesel ferry taking him over on its last scheduled run he would drink in the citys bars until one or two in the morning then call thorson and have him come pick him up the old ferry captain didnt usually mind he didnt sleep much anyway on those rare occasions when thorson couldnt make it dupree would either hire a water taxi or take a small single room at a cheap hotel where he would remove the mattress from the bed and place it on the floor using cushions to support his legs where they overhung the end and in those bars particularly the ones off the tourist trail he would sometimes attract the attentions of women he would hear them two or three of them laughing in that way that women with alcohol on their breath and sex on their minds will sometimes laugh a hoarse unlovely thing from deep inside them their eyelids heavy their eyes narrowing their lips slightly pursed their comments would crawl across the dusty floor i wonder if hes big all over the hands and the feet you always look at the hands and the feet or seep like smoke between the tables i could make room for him hon theyd have to take something out of you to make room for what hes got until at last they reached him and he would acknowledge them with a thin smile and they would giggle some more and look away or perhaps hold his gaze for a time with a look that spoke of tainted promises sometimes he had taken them up on the offer made and had usually regretted it the last time it happened he had accompanied the woman back to her little house in saco so neat and feminine that he instantly felt even more out of place than usual afraid to move for fear that he might dislodge a china doll from the congregation of pale faces that seemed to gaze at him from every shelf every ledge she undressed in her bathroom and entered the bedroom wearing only a tootight bra and black panties a little fat spilling out over the straps at her back and the elastic at her waist she was holding a cigarette and she placed it in her mouth as she pulled back the sheets on the bed undid the clasp of the bra and slid it down her arms before hooking her thumbs into the waistband of her underwear and stepping out of them without once glancing at him she climbed into the bed drew the sheets up to her waist then smoked her cigarette as he removed his own clothing his face burning with shame and selfloathing he saw in her eyes not lust or need not even curiosity but merely the prospect of the temporary alleviation of her boredom with herself and her own desires she took a last drag on the cigarette before she stubbed it out in the ashtray on the nightstand and pulled back the sheet inviting him to join her as he climbed into bed beside her he heard the springs creaking beneath his weight smelled the stale odor of smoke upon the pillows felt her nails already raking five white trails along his thigh as her hand moved toward his sex he left her snoring the china dolls watching him impassively as he slipped through the house his shoes in his hands he tugged them on as he sat on her porch steps then called a cab from a pay phone and returned to the old port on a bench by the casco bay ferry terminal he waited until light dawned then walked down to beckys diner on commercial and ate breakfast with the fishermen working his way methodically through a plate of eggs and bacon keeping his head down so that he would not catch the eye of any other diner and when thorsons ferry drew toward the dock carrying those who had jobs in the city joe dupree was waiting for it barely nodding at those who disembarked until at last the boat was empty he took a seat at the back of the ferry and when no further passengers appeared thorson started the engine and carried joe dupree away from portland the wind wiping the smell of perfume and booze and cigarettes from his clothes and hair cleansing him of the proof of his sins since then he had not returned to the bars of the old port and now drank little he could see the surprise in the faces of the wait staff and in the smile of dale zimmer when he rose to greet the woman who now sat across from him he didnt care it had taken him the best part of a year to work up the courage to ask her out he liked her son he liked her now she was saying something but he was so lost in himself that he had to ask her to repeat it i said its hard to do anything in secret here seems like everyone knows your business before you do he smiled i remember dave mahoneyhe was heading on for seventy years of age the old goatgot himself all worked up over a widow woman named annie jabar who lived about half a mile down the road from him nothing had happened between them nothing more than glances over the bingo table at the american legion i guess or hands almost touching across the shelves at the market but she was coming on to him without a doubt so one day dave takes it into his head to do something about it he puts on his best jacket and pants under his slicker and heads out in the rain to walk down to annie jabars house when he got there she was waiting for him he shook his head in amusement who asked marianne the widow woman nope daves wife dont know how she did it but she got there before he did i figure she must have sprinted through the woods so that shed be waiting for him and she wasnt much younger than dave she had a gun too daves varmint rifle dave took one look at her turned around on his heel and headed straight back home never again looked at the widow woman or any other woman except his wife she died a couple of years ago and i heard tell that annie jabar might have hoped that she and dave could get together now that his wife was gone but far as i know hes never gone next to near her since that day his wife confronted him and made him look down the barrel of his own rifle he loved her then loved her and was scared half to death of her maybe he figures she might still find a way to get back at him from the next world if he steps out of line or maybe he just misses her more than he ever thought he would i talk to him sometimes and i think hes just waiting to join her i think he realized how much she loved him when he saw that she was prepared to shoot him rather than let another woman take him even at seventy years of age sometimes maybe you have to love someone an awful lot to be prepared to kill them his attention was distracted momentarily by movement close to the door so dupree did not see the look that passed across mariannes face had he done so their evening together might have come to an abrupt end for he would have felt compelled to question her about it instead he was watching a bulky man in a redchecked shirt accompanied by his equally bulky wife approaching the exit as they left the man gave dupree a nod that was part acknowledgment part dismissal marianne glanced over her shoulder grateful for the distraction and the man smiled at her before his wife gave him a sharp nudge in the ribs with her elbow that nearly propelled him through the door tom jaffe said dupree his father runs the construction business right thats right hes near sixtyfive himself now but still wont hand over the running of the business to tom doesnt trust him tom still believes hes the great white hope he was valedictorian the year i graduated from high school liked to think of himself as an orator how was his speech terrible it was basically an extended screw you to everybody hed ever known somebody tried to run him over in the parking lot afterward maybe it was just a misunderstanding nope i went around for a second try after i missed him he could run ill give him that she laughed then and for the first time dupree began to relax the little restaurant filled up as the evening progressed but there was never anybody left standing waiting for a table they talked about music and movies and each spoke a little of the past but not too much in joes case his reticence was a result of embarrassment shyness and a feeling that his life on the island would seem somehow parochial and isolated to this woman with a soft southern accent a young son and a firsthand knowledge of places far from this one but the woman well her reason for silence was different she spoke little of her past because all that she could give him in return was lies they were on dessert when the restaurant door opened and sally owen entered she was one of the bartenders at the rudder and had been for as long as dupree could remember rumor was that when she was younger she once dragged a guy across the bar for not saying please after hed ordered his drink she was older now and a little calmer and contented herself with shooting dark looks at the ruder customers now she walked quickly up to their table and spoke to joe joe im real sorry to be disturbing you but lockwood is dealing with a possible burglary over on kemps road and barker is out with one of the fire trucks tending to a car fire dupree couldnt hide his displeasure hed asked the cops on duty to try to give him a little space tonight even if they were snowed under which seemed unlikely at the start of the day still it wasnt their fault that cars were burning and houses were being burgled although if they found the people responsible for either event joe dupree was going to have some harsh words to say to the culprits what is it sally terry scarfe is in the rudder and hes not alone hes got carl lubey in there with him and theyre thick as thieves just thought you should know marianne watched duprees expression darken there was sorrow there too she thought a reminder of events that he had tried to forget she knew the story of carl lubeys brother everybody on the island knew it ronnie lubey had been a minorleague criminal with convictions for possession with intent and aggravated burglary on the night that hed died he had a cocktail of uppers and alcohol in his belly and was spoiling for a fight hed started shooting out the windows of his neighbors house yelling about tree trunks and boundaries and by the time joe and daniel snowman who had since retired arrived out at the house ronnie was slumped against a tree trunk mumbling to himself puke on his shirt and pants and shoes when the two policemen pulled up ronnie looked at them raised the shotgun and shot wildly from the hip snowman went down his left leg peppered with shot and after an unheeded warning dupree opened fire he aimed low hitting ronnie in the thigh but the shot busted ronnies femoral artery dupree had done his best for him but his priority had been his partner snowman survived ronnie lubey died and his little brother carl who also lived on the island had never forgiven the big policeman marianne didnt know who terry scarfe was but if he was keeping company with carl lubey then he wasnt anyone she wanted to know during her first month on the island carl had tried to come on to her as she sat with bonnie at the bar of the rudder when shed turned down his offer of a drink carl called her every name he could think of then tried to reach for her breast in the hope of copping a consolatory feel she had pushed him away and then jeb burris had climbed over the bar and hauled carl outside the young policeman berman had been on duty that night marianne remembered that he had been kind to her and had warned carl to stay away from her since then she had endured only occasional contact with him when he came into the market when she passed him on the street or saw him on the ferry he contented himself with looking at her his eyes fixed on her breasts or her crotch id better go take a look dupree said as sally nodded a goodbye and returned to the bar you excuse me for a couple of minutes ill be back as soon as i can he rose and laid his hand gently on her shoulder as he passed by her she brushed his fingers with her hand and felt his grip linger for a moment before he left her dupree walked down island avenue and made a right straight downhill on the left was the islands ferry terminal and across from it was the rudder bar it had an open deck at its rear which filled up with tourists during the summer but was empty now that winter had come inside he could see lights and a half dozen people drinking and playing pool he entered the bar and saw scarfe and lubey immediately they were sitting at the bar leaning into each other lubey raised his glass as sally came out from the small kitchen behind the bar hey sal you got any shots that taste like pussy i wouldnt know what pussy tastes like said sally glancing at dupree as he drew closer lubey lifted a finger and extended it to her then lick here he said and the two men collapsed into laughter how you doing boys said dupree the two men turned in unison to look at him were not your boys said lubey his eyes were dull he swayed slightly as he tried to keep dupree in focus its the jolly green giant said scarfe whats wrong mr giant you dont look so jolly no more we dont usually see you over here terry last i heard you were doing three to five i got paroled good behavior i dont think your behavior is so good tonight whats your problem offfissur said lubey im having a drink with my buddy we aint bothering nobody i think youve had enough what are you going to do asked lubey shoot me dupree looked at him lubey held the gaze for as long as he could then glanced away a dumb smile playing on his lips dupree returned his attention to scarfe i want you off the island terry thorson has a crossing in ten minutes you be on that ferry scarfe looked at lubey shrugged then slid from his stool and picked up his jacket the green giant wants me off the island carl so i got to go ill be seeing you yeah be seeing you terry fight the power dupree stepped back and watched as scarfe headed unsteadily for the door then turned back to lubey you drive here he asked lubey didnt reply i asked you a question carl yeah i drove said lubey at last give me your keys the other man dug into his pockets and found his car keys as dupree reached out for them lubey dropped them to the floor whoops he said pick them up he climbed from the stool bent down gingerly then toppled over dupree helped him to his feet picking up the keys as he did so once he was upright again lubey shrugged off the policemans hand get your hands off me you want me to put you in cuffs i will we can get a boat over here and you can spend the night in a cell lubey reached for his coat im going he said you can pick up your keys from the station house in the morning lubey waved a hand in dismissal and headed for the door behind the bar jeb burris took off his apron and said ill give him a ride back dupree nodded and gave him lubeys car keys yeah do that back outside he watched as terry scarfe and two other people tourists whod been eating at the restaurant climbed onboard thorsons ferry and headed back to portland scarfe kept looking back at the island and dupree until the ferry faded from view marianne had enjoyed a couple of glasses of wine at dinner dupree a single beer he offered to drive her back to her house and said he would arrange to have her car dropped at her door before eight the next morning she sat in the passenger seat of duprees own jeep and stared in silence through the side window dupree wanted to believe that it was a comfortable silence but he sensed her sadness as he drove you okay she nodded but her mouth wrinkled and he could see that she was near tears its been a long time you know he didnt and he felt foolish for not knowing since what since i had a nice evening with a man id kind of forgotten what it was like he coughed to hide his embarrassment and his secret pleasure you always cry at the end of a nice evening she smiled and wiped at the tears with the tips of her fingers hell i must have snail trails running down my face no you look good liar he hung a right into the driveway of her small house and pulled up outside her door she looked at him would you like to come in i can make you coffee sure coffee would be good he followed her inside and sat on the edge of the livingroom couch as she went to the bathroom to fix her makeup when she came out she went straight to the kitchen and put the kettle on the stove then swore im sorry she called out ive only got instant itll be just like home she peered around the corner of the doorway unsure if he was being sarcastic he caught the look no honest it will be just like home all i ever make is instant well if you say so put on some music if you like he rose and walked to the pile of cds that lay stacked against the wall a jvc system stood on the third shelf of the home depot bookcase he tried squatting and looking sideways at the cds then kneeling finally he lay flat on the floor and ran his finger down the spines i dont recognize any of this stuff he said as she came into the room carrying two mugs of coffee on a tray youre out of touch she said radio reception sucks this far out and i dont go over to the mainland as much as i used to hey are the doobie brothers still together i hear michael mcdonald left she said things arent looking so good for simon and garfunkel either he smelled her perfume as she knelt down beside him and her arm brushed his hair gently as she reached across and carefully removed a disc from the pile he placed his hand against the discs beneath steadying them so that they would not fall she put a bright blue cd into the player then skipped through the tracks until she got to number six slow funk emerged from the speakers sounds like prince he said she cocked an eyebrow at him maybe youre not so out of touch after all youre close its maxwell this tracks called til the cops come knockin i thought you might appreciate the humor its good he said the song i mean the humor im not so sure about she swiped at him playfully then rose and sipped her coffee her body swaying slightly to the music dupree watched her from the floor then turned awkwardly and stood from the knees up he lifted his coffee mug instinctively grasping it in his hand instead of trying unsuccessfully to fit his finger through the handle little things he thought its the little things you have to remember marianne walked to the window and looked out on the dark woods beyond her body grew still he waited for her to speak the bird she began and he felt his back stiffen in response had she also noticed their absence instantly his conversation with amerling and jack returned to him and the pleasure of the evening began to dissipate like smoke the gull that you put out of its misery he felt relieved for a moment until he thought about danny and the look on his face after he had killed the bird like i said im sorry about that he interrupted i should have made him walk away no its not that i think danny dug it up after youd left i think he dug it up anddid something to it like what i found blood and feathers she left her fear unspoken hoping the policeman would pick up on it dupree put his cup down and stood beside her hes a boy they can be curious about things like that if you want i can talk to him i guess im just worried has he ever hurt any living animals ive told him off for throwing stones at cats and hes mischievous about bugs and stuff but i dont think hes ever really hurt anything well then id maybe leave him be this time she nodded but he sensed once again that she was far away from him walking in the country of her past he finished his coffee and placed the mug carefully on the tray id better be going he said she didnt reply but as he moved to get his coat her hand reached for him and laid itself softly upon his arm he could feel the heat of her through the fabric of his shirt she looked up at him and the expression on her face was unreadable im sorry she said like i said its been a long time ive forgotten how this should go then he inclined his head and body toward her bending almost double to reach her he kissed her and her mouth opened beneath his and her body moved against him later she led him into her bedroom and they undressed in darkness and he found her by the light of her eyes and the paleness of her skin and the fading scent of her perfume for a time all of their pain was forgotten and the night gathered them to itself and wrapped them briefly in peace and while they made love the painter giacomelli sat in his studio the lamp on the table casting its harsh light across brushes and paints and leaning canvases jack wanted a drink he wanted a drink very badly but he was too afraid to drink he wanted to be alert and ready after his conversation with dupree and larry amerling he had gone for a lateafternoon walk along the wooded trails that crisscrossed the center of the island but he had not gone as far as the site instead he had stood at a forest of dead trees the roots drowned by bog and looked toward the dark interior in which the ruins lay there was a stillness there it seemed the kind of quiescence that comes on latesummer days when the sky is overcast the heat oppressive and unyielding and the world waits for the weather to break and the skies to explode violently into rain he stood on the trail looking out over the patch of dead beech trees their trunks gray and skewed as their decaying root structures failed to hold them upright a mist seemed to hang about themno not a mist exactly but rather it appeared as if their slow decay had now become visible the tiny fragments combining to cast a veil over the trees and the ground he dragged his fingers across the front of his coat and raised his hand before him expecting to see them coated in gray but they were clean he walked no farther that day now he sat and stared at one of the flawed paintings which were in their way better than anything that he had ever done before for the waves seemed to move over the bodies causing them to bob slightly in the tide and there was a silver light over the waters and the rocks that he had never previously managed to capture for it had never been apparent to him until now in fact he admitted he couldnt recall adding the sheen of light to the picture either and no moon hung in the dusk sky of his work or what used to be his work moloch woke for a moment he felt himself in the semidarkness of the prison for in the cell block a dull light hung over all things even at night he could hear men snoring and footsteps he raised himself from the sweat of his pillow and ran his hands through his hair then saw willard now also awake watching him from his post beneath the window the curtains drawn to discourage snoopers he had been dreaming again but this time there was no girl and no killing instead he was alone among the trees walking through wooded trails dead leaves crunching beneath his feet moonlight gilding the branches yet when he looked up there was no moon visible and the skies were black with clouds ahead of him lay a darkness marked only by the thin shapes of dead beech trees impaled upon the earth like the spears of giants something waited for him in the shadows i could map this place he thought this landscape of my dreams i know it well for i have seen it every night for the last year and each time it becomes more familiar to me i know its paths its rocks the landings along its coastline only that darkness and what lies within it is hidden from me but in time i will know that too he got to his feet willard remained seated his eyes fixed on him you okay asked moloch dexter doesnt like me said willard shepherd neither they dont have to like you i think they want to hurt me moloch was grateful for the cover of darkness they wont do that theyll do what i say what you say echoed willard he spoke in a monotone thats right now lets go downstairs get something to eat he waited until willard rose for a moment they stood together at the doorway each seemingly unwilling to turn his back on the other at last willard stepped through and moloch followed him just as moloch had followed him from the bar years before i trust you followed him to a house theyll do what i say followed him to a woman what you say and bound himself to willard in damnation the last day and how can man die better than facing fearful odds macaulay horatius chapter eight the giant was gone he left her before the clock read five for he would soon have to relieve the patrolmen on duty and allow them to catch the ferry back to the mainland a new cop was coming over on the return leg a rookie he said one who had never been given island duty before he stroked her hair as he spoke his arm holding her to him as they lay close together in the false intimacy resulting from their lovemaking for it was false dupree wanted to be close to her but how could he draw near when she would tell him so little and when he suspected the veracity of even those small details that she chose to reveal in the restaurant he had been startled by how beautiful she looked during her time on the island it had seemed to him that she did all that she could not to attract attention to downplay and even to camouflage her looks but when shed entered good eats that night heads had turned and dupree had tried hard not to look smug as she walked to his table it made him determined that the night should be special for her for them both without being asked dale zimmer had taken personal responsibility for their meal moving between the kitchen and the dining room solicitous without being overbearing from their window table overlooking the water they could see the lights of the neighboring islands shining brightly like small night suns hoping to dazzle the stars in the candlelight he had found himself occasionally overawed by her and had concentrated so hard on trying not to break or spill anything that his head hurt by the end of the meal the only taints upon the evening were the encounter with lubey and scarfe at the rudder and duprees niggling concern at the fact that his companion was still keeping things from him marianne was aware of his unease her years spent moving and hiding had heightened her perceptions making her acutely sensitive to how others were regarding her now alone she replayed the events of the previous night in her mind recalling his reactions his hesitations the fleeting changes in expression as he listened to her speak she had not intended the night to end as it had or if she had then she had not admitted it to herself but as the evening went on and the wine began to have its effect she wondered what it would be like to make love to him to take him inside her she had been a little afraid afraid of the weight of him his bulk and the awkwardness that came with it for there was little that was graceful about him he was a man constantly waiting for the sound of falling objects a man always out of step with the world but then he came to her bed and he was gentle and his touch was surprisingly tender she felt guilty for lying to him about her past but she had no choice in the matter to tell him the truth could lead to her losing danny worse it would expose her and then he would find out and his people would come lost amid birdsong the warmth of him still upon the pillow marianne began to cry dupree drove first to his own house where he showered and changed into his uniform in his bathroom as he listened to the water running in the shower he smelled marianne upon him and felt a twinge of regret that her scent would soon be washed from his body later after he had changed he picked up his shirt from the night before and brought it to his face there was a small stain on the material where her face had pressed against him and he touched the traces of makeup with his fingertip then he carefully placed the shirt in the bathroom closet above the laundry basket barker was sitting in the office reading a novel when dupree arrived the sound of running water came from the open bathroom door where lockwood was brushing his teeth sleep well asked barker he was grinning pretty good said dupree maintaining a poker face dinner good that was pretty good too breakfast i havent eaten breakfast yet you should eat breakfast you need to keep up your strength i like a woman to make me breakfast the morning after dupree scowled at him is this in the real world or the fantasy one now it was barkers turn to frown hey my wife makes breakfast every morning now that i come to think of it sometimes we even have sex the night before not often but sometimes more than i need to know said dupree so much more than i need to know lockwood came out of the bathroom he walked like a dancer on the balls of his feet he and the overweight barker were an unlikely pairing but dupree liked them both in their own way i borrow you for a few minutes dupree said to lockwood he wanted someone to help him take mariannes car back to her house but he wasnt about to ask barker to do it lockwood was less likely to use his suspicions about duprees nocturnal activities as a source of humor sure lockwood grabbed his jacket and followed dupree outside i have to take a car back to its owner id like you to follow me in the explorer you got nothing else to do and give me a ride back here afterward no problem i appreciate it they drove out to marianne elliots house dupree parked outside her front door leaving the keys in the ignition he looked up at the window of her bedroom but the drapes were closed he wondered what she was doing until he saw the drapes move slightly and then marianne was standing at the window looking down on him she smiled nervously and gave him a little wave he waved back then walked over and got into the explorer next to lockwood lockwood looked at him so did she make you breakfast dupree reddened i asked you to come along because i didnt think you were as big a horses ass as barker lockwood shrugged not smaller just quieter they drove along in silence for a time until lockwood asked dupree if sally owen had found him last night yeah i took care of it lubey give you any trouble nope just shot his mouth off some you think he and terry scarfe were just catching up i dont know maybe theyre thinking of forming a book club a picturebook club those guys are dumb lubey is but scarfe is a little smarter hes like a rat hed sell his mothers corpse for cash if he could bother to dig her up you think he was dealing on the island dupree winced hed been so distracted by marianne that he hadnt bothered to search either scarfe or lubey yet he didnt believe scarfe would be stupid enough to bring drugs over with him but he hadnt known that scarfe and lubey were friendly and even though they were laughing together the night before he still got the feeling that they werent particularly close scarfe wanted something from carl lubey and that couldnt be good because carl lubey had nothing positive to offer anyone ill keep an eye on lubey he said at last you hear anything about scarfe over in portland maybe youd give me a call will do said lockwood they turned onto island avenue it was still dark but the sky was brightening slightly anything else i should know asked dupree well were still having trouble with the radios phones too the problems with the radios were a recent development the radio system in the explorer was a dual arrangement when the portland pd had updated the islands equipment the old radio had been left in the explorer and a second portable system had been plugged into it the new radio allowed the patrol cop to stay in touch with both the island base and dispatch over in portland the old system meanwhile enabled the island police to contact outside agencies such as the state police or the fire department over the last week there had been gaps in transmission each of the island cops dupree included had experienced some difficulty in raising either portland or the station house while on other occasions there had been the equivalent of a crossed line faint voices audible in the background of regular transmissions the radios had been checked and judged to be in perfect working order ghosts in the machine as lockwood had put it now the problem seemed to have spread to the phone lines what about the phones asked dupree same as the radio line was dead at least four times last night just for a couple of seconds you know i picked up there was nothing then the dial tone kicked in other times there was light static could be the storm weathermen are saying that its going to hit the coast sometime tonight although ive never heard of an approaching snowstorm affecting communications in that way before dupree didnt reply he was reminded of the previous days conversation with amerling and jackits like the build up before an electrical stormand the task that he had been putting off until after his dinner with marianne the visit to the site you know anything about this rookie cop macy asked dupree i know shes cute thatll be a big help with respect joe its not as if shes entering a war zone no said dupree i guess not while the two men drove together sharon macy stood in line for the small ferry shed heard tales about thorson and his ferry most of them she hoped gross exaggerations one of the other field training officers christine mccalmon had jokingly offered her the use of a life jacket for the trip macy had gone down to the dock the day before to take a look at the ferry as it left for its earlyevening sailing it looked a little rickety but macy figured it was better than rowing across casco bay in a teapot there were three other people beside her at the dock on commercial street all with their eyes fixed on the little diesel boat which was currently occupied by thorson and his crewman thorson didnt appear to be in too much of a hurry to get going macy thought he looked kind of hung over and figured that she could probably arrest him for some form of seagoing violation if she chose but she guessed that nobody would thank her for it maybe if she took out her gun and forced him at gunpoint to get his ass in gear then she might get their support and admiration it was cold on the dock and the wind nipped painfully at her nose and ears capn said the man beside her what the hell are we waiting for supplies said thorson i promised huddie harris that id carry over some machine parts his sister said shed carry them along before five its fivefifteen now ayuh that was it thought macy thorsons ayuh was the equivalent of a shoulder shrug a complete abdication of responsibility he had promised huddie his parts huddie had probably promised him a couple of sixpacks and some cash in return and nobody was going to be allowed to get in the way of their arrangement she kicked at a stone and pushed her hands deeper into her pockets as a woman wearing a quilted jacket shuffled along the dock pulling a beatup metal box on wheels erin harris she lived in portland but spent weekends out on dutch with her brother macy recalled her face from an altercation outside the eastland hotel a month or two back when the wife of one of erins sometime boyfriends had decided that enough was enough and that erin should quit messing with her man macy found it kind of difficult to figure out what the man in question saw in either of the women because erin harris was ugly on the outside and uglier still on the inside but she was a bargain compared to the woman with whom she had been slugging it out that night barron had tried to intervene but erin harris had taken a swing at him and macy had been forced to spray her maced by macy as barron had put it later it had all been kind of ugly macy kept her head down and watched quietly as the box was passed down to thorson erin shot a glance at macy as she passed there was no disguising the hostility in her face macy didnt look away okay said thorson all aboard were good to go the four passengers climbed aboard the ferry three occupying the wooden benches on the lower deck while macy took a seat on the exposed upper deck minutes later they were heading out to sea the gulls crying above them and gray waves breaking at the bow macy was already in uniform an l l bean backpack lay at her feet she had taken barrons advice and brought a couple of books with her as well as a discman and a bunch of cds she slipped a cd into the player as portland grew smaller behind her the first bars of the scud mountain boys freight of fire filling her ears as the spray splashed her face the lead singer joe pernice advising her to bring her guns and all her ammunition and she felt the weight of the pistol beneath her jacket and smiled as she recalled barrons tales of giants and the bones of men buried beneath pine trees dupree was dealing with another reporter one who was clearly trying to kill time during the early shift this one was calling from florida so at least the interview didnt have to be conducted facetoface which was something like most beat cops dupree had a natural distrust of reporters there had been an accident down in the keys a couple of days earlier in which three teenagers had drowned after a stolen car went off a bridge the reporter was trying to pull together a feature about the danger of wayward teens and the accident on dutch was a good tiein yeah the boy was dead when we got there said dupree there was nothing we could do for him the girl was badly injured she died at the scene he grimaced even as he said the words then listened to the next inevitable question about what safety measures had been introduced in the aftermath were doing everything we can to ensure that a tragedy like this never happens again were looking at ringfencing the entire area maybe sowing the slopes with scrap metal to stop anyone taking a car up there again it should have been done years before thought dupree i should have forced them to do it but they wanted to leave the emplacement as it was and anyway kids will be kids there had never been an accident on the slope before the deaths of wayne cady and sylvie lauter it was just one of those things the reporter thanked him then hung up the clock on the wall read am the ferry would be due in soon bringing with it his partner for the next twentyfour hours barker was already down at the little jetty smoking a cigarette and kicking his heels impatiently lockwood sitting quietly beside him dupree wondered again about sharon macy the arrival of a new face was always difficult the older cops were used to joe by now but the younger ones could never hide their feelings toward him when they encountered him for the first time usually it was just surprise sometimes amusement and very occasionally a kind of uneasiness he knew that there were those who referred to him as a freak in addition rookies and trainees rarely got sent out to the islands but the rotation had been hit by illness family obligations and amassed vacation time the department was filling in the gaps with whatever it had he climbed into the explorer and drove down to the dock trying to pick out the ferry in the semidarkness the ferry service was subsidized by a small tax levied on the islands residents each year nobody ever complained about the tax they valued their independence but the islanders still needed the safety net that portland provided with its stores and hospitals and movie theaters and restaurants in the event of a medical emergency like that time sarah froness had fallen off her roof and broken her back while stringing up christmas lights the cops on duty could radio for a helicopter pickup from the baseball diamond north of liberty it had taken the chopper crew just thirty minutes to get to dutch on that occasion and sarah froness could still be seen ambling into the market to buy her weekly supply of trash magazines and sixforfive beers although she didnt go climbing ladders on december anymore and she walked a little more gingerly than before sylvie lauter hadnt been so lucky and dupree blamed himself for what had occurred he replayed the events of that night over and over wondering what might have happened if they had gotten to the crash site a little earlier if old buck tennier had made the call as soon as hed noticed the revving of the cars engine instead of waiting until he heard the crash but it wasnt his fault dupree and the other cops should have patrolled the area more often making it too risky for the wilder kids to use it but sanctuary was still a big island for a pair of cops to cover they couldnt be everywhere and now two young people were dead sanctuary he had found himself using that name more often in recent days not only when he was talking to older islanders like amerling or giacomelli but also to visitors and new residents he had even caught himself using the name when he was speaking with the reporter earlier that morning he always thought of it as sanctuary in his own mind but over the years he had managed to make a distinction between that name and its official name in his daytoday work sanctuary was its past dutch was its present the fact that he was increasingly slipping into the old usage indicated a leaching of the past into his perception of the island an acknowledgment of its grip upon him upon all of them he thought of sylvie lauters final moments of her pain and of the blood that had stained his clothing he thought too of the autopsy and the peculiarities it had uncovered there had been damage to the back of sylvie lauters tongue and throat as if something had been forced into her mouth maybe she and wayne had been arguing or fooling around before the crash and somehow she had managed to wound herself as he had told jack and amerling gray matter had been found in one of the cuts and had subsequently been identified as wing material from a moth manduca quinquemaculata the tomato hornworm moth a member of the sphinx moth family dupree had never seen one and didnt even know what the insect looked like until a specimen was sent to him from a sympathetic university researcher up in orono it had a fourinch wingspan and a large body that tapered almost to a point five or six pairs of yellow spots ran down its abdomen there was a kind of beauty to its wings which even on this dead specimen seemed to shimmer but overall dupree thought the insect ugly the markings on its body and its strange pointed tail making it seem like some peculiar hybrid of moth and reptile he had no idea how fragments of that kind of insect however small could have found their way into sylvie lauters mouth most moths were dead by july or august this moths season was june to september but it was now january and no moth could survive the temperatures on the island he had asked around but nobody on the island bred moths killed plenty of them sure but didnt breed them yet somehow sylvie lauter had come into contact with a tomato hornworm the same species of moth that dupree had found in the newton womans bedroom and that now lay dead in its jelly jar beside the original specimen from orono it was peculiar he told himself but nothing more for a second he almost believed it now the ferry could be clearly seen a finger trail of diesel fumes rising behind it joe took his binoculars from the floor and trained them on the boat it was still too far away to distinguish faces but he counted six people onboard he experienced a tingling in his fingers his feet felt too big for his shoes and despite the cold the explorer felt stuffy and warm he rolled down the window and as the icy breeze hit his face he realized that he was sweating the ferry passed fort gorges rust seeping in tear trails from the bars on its windows then followed the mailboat route between the diamonds and peaks passing pumpkin knob on the right then long island before leaving great chebeague on its left and moving into luckse sound skirting chebeague once again as it headed into broad sound slaloming between bangs and stave bates and ministerial the tiny islands that dotted casco bay so many of them that they had been christened the calendar islands because it was once erroneously believed that there were in all slowly a larger island began to emerge rising slightly at its wooded center the white finger of an observation tower visible at its highest point a small unmanned lighthouse at its northeastern extreme dutch island although macy preferred the old nomenclature of sanctuary macy had been curious about why sanctuary should have remained in the jurisdiction of portland after all long island which was closer to the shore was the responsibility of the cumberland county sheriff s department sanctuary meanwhile was farther out beyond even jewell island barron had shrugged when shed asked it goes way back he said its tied up with the first settlers and with the ones who came after its to do with the duprees as well they used to be pretty wealthy and they funded a lot of development in portland particularly after the fire of eighteen sixtysix that moneys gone now but the ties remain the folks out on dutch voted to remain under portlands jurisdiction they pay taxes and with melancholy joe out there being a martyr and doing more than his fair share it doesnt cost the city too much macy could see a blackandwhite explorer parked above the passenger shelter the slowly rising sun shone on the windshield the giant was waiting the ferry docked and macy shouldered her bag erin harris was the first to disembark her brother was waiting for his machine parts beside a red dodge truck she could see the family resemblance since they were both ugly and both looked like men he glanced once at macy recalling her from his efforts to bail his sister out but there was no hostility in his look after all it was his sister she had maced not him and it didnt look as if he was too fond of her anyway she spotted the two cops barker and lockwood and exchanged some words of greeting they wished her luck she thanked them and then headed up to the explorer the door of the vehicle opened and a man climbed out her first instinct was to wonder how he had managed to get into the explorer to begin with his great frame unfolded like that of some huge dark insect until he towered almost two feet over her his eyes were hidden behind a pair of shades and he wore no cap he extended a hand the size of a shovel blade joe dupree he said she allowed her own hand to be briefly engulfed in his like a little fish being swallowed up by an eel sharon macy he released her hand put your stuff in the back you want the tour sure do we get to stop and take pictures he laughed briefly it sounded she thought like tectonic plates might sound as they rubbed against one another beneath the earth i think you can safely leave your camera in your bag they did a uturn then headed up the short road that led from the jetty to the main intersection dupree hung a left you always meet the ferry try to its more important in summer than winter we get a lot of people through here in july and august i was only kidding about the pictures this place is beautiful in summer and there are some pretty expensive summer homes dotted around the island mantle the guy who runs the fable computer company he has a house here big time warner executive named sandra morgan owns a cottage out by beech cove and there are a couple of others too theyd be real pissed if someone trashed their houses he pulled in at the redbrick municipal building we do it all out here theres a doctor comes out from the mainland two afternoons a week and doc bruder is still here although hes officially retired but were the first point of contact were also the fire department game wardens school patrol crossing guards and dogcatchers he left the explorer macy followed the sliding garage doors were open revealing four vehicles parked inside medcu fourteen said dupree pointing at the ambulance inside the door if an emergency arises we go out in this do what we can to get the patient comfortable then get them to the ferry landing or in a really urgent case out to the baseball diamond for a chopper pickup he moved on to the red fire trucks and patted the first this is engine fourteen we use it mostly to pump water over there is ladder fourteen the primary attack vehicle thats what we take out to fires while were waiting for the local volunteers to get organized that smaller truck in the corner is tank fourteen basically its just a big bucket on wheels we take it out to those places on the island that dont have hydrants are there many of those a couple he said in a tone of voice suggesting that half the island was probably without hydrants he carried on into the station house there was an open area with a table and two chairs some books and magazines on the table to the left was the communications center a radio a computer a bulletin board pasted with notices reminders and scribbled notes a large map of the island dominated one wall we have a secretary nope all nineoneone calls go through the dispatch center in portland but most people just call us direct paperwork filing well we do that ourselves across the main reception area was a second room housing an emergency generator various pieces of equipment and a locker containing a single shotgun this is it for weapons said macy we dont have too much call for swat teams out here said dupree last time i used this was to kill a rabid raccoon it had been so long since id fired it i was just grateful that it didnt blow up in my face macy took the mossberg pumpaction from his hands it had been cleaned recently she noticed doesnt look so bad she said i gave it a pretty good cleaning a day or two back said dupree she glanced at him alerted by his tone why something happen no he said but you never know he wasnt smiling guess not she said upstairs was a sofa bed a tv some chairs a small kitchen area and a bathroom with a shower stall and toilet no cells she said nope if we make an arrest we call portland they send out a boat and take the prisoner back until then there are two steel loops in the main reception area ive had to use them a handful of times weve only got one patrol vehicle we used to have a golf cart as well but it broke down i live about two hundred feet from here and ive got my own jeep if we need another vehicle come on ill buy you a cup of coffee and introduce you to some people as macy followed him from the building she rubbed her fingers together feeling the oil on her skin she couldnt be certain but from the smell of the shotgun it had been fired recently somebody had been practicing dupree introduced her to the folks at the market to the tooker sisters at the diner nancy tooker halfjokingly warned her to stay away from her berman to dale zimmer and jeb burris and finally to larry amerling by then it was time for lunch and dupree suggested to macy that she take the explorer and drive around the island in the company of the postmaster while he made some calls amerling the old lothario was quite content to spend his lunch hour in the company of an attractive young woman especially one who had read his book if he tries anything dupree warned her shoot him what if she tries anything with me larry protested dupree looked hard at macy you get that desperate shoot yourself there was no road leading directly to the site which was surrounded on three sides by patches of bog instead dupree parked at the top of ocean street which ran north from island avenue almost to the center of the island and walked along the trail toward the burial ground the forest was mainly evergreens but there were also scattered maples and beech and hemlock amerling was right the trail was obscured by the fallen branches and the last dry leaves but tan winter maleberry had also encroached some of its round seed capsules cracking beneath his feet along with grayblack winterberry bushes and tattered larches within ten minutes dupree was in trouble the trail had virtually disappeared and only his own knowledge of the island enabled him to continue in what he thought was the right direction it came as a shock to him when he found himself approaching a stretch of road and realized that somehow he had walked southwest instead of southeast and was now back on ocean street except maybe half a mile below where he had started frustrated he retraced his steps and found that he had mistaken a secondary walking trail for the main path for bushes and briers had obscured the principal artery so effectively that there was no way to distinguish it from the rest of the forest unless one knew where to look he hacked a way through using his maglite and continued along the path almost losing his way twice more when it once again began to disappear as he drew nearer to the site he noticed that more and more trees were dying and that the patch of bog at the islands center appeared to be increasing in size still water lay like a black mirror almost level with the narrow causeway formed by the trail as it crossed the marsh if heavy rains came in the spring the trail would be submerged here the greenery was at least understandable leaf retention being reasonably common among bog plants bog rosemary bog laurel and labrador tea grew steadily beside green tubular pitcher plants the remains of insects still trapped in their inner pools the trees here appeared stunted their trunks lost beneath the encroaching bog others had their shallow roots layered with a dark green sphagnum moss and lush creeping vines the life here was hidden visible only to those who were patient and knowledgeable enough for it to reveal itself back swimmers and beetles dragonfly larvae and mayfly nymphs and smaller mammals like voles and squirrels moved busily through this world what seemed quiet and dead was secretly alive wary but alive and yet there were no birds increasingly dupree was aware of the silence created by their absence it was so quiet that the snapping of the twigs beneath his feet rang like smallarms fire in the forest and his breathing sounded loud enough to be heard offshore he continued to walk leaving the bog behind him and entering the deepest part of the forest at last he could see ahead of him the shapes of stones through the trees once again there appeared to be some recent growth of briers and shrubs along the trail but these were not green in fact their branches broke dryly in his hand when he touched them they seemed dead and long dead yet somehow they were still growing he was almost at the entrance to the site when he saw movement a patch of gray drifted between the trees perhaps fifty feet ahead of him at the farthest edge of the site it seemed to hang in the air for a moment then was absorbed into a tree trunk an image of jacks painting flashed in his mind with its gray shapes that were almost figures it was an illusion that was all still he removed his gun from its holster but kept it pointed toward the ground as he forced his way through the final curtain of briers and branches and found himself standing before the remains of the settlement even from this angle he could see what once were the corners of houses the remains of chimneys the frames of doors in winter the patterns were more noticeable for during the summer the rich greenery of the island obscured the manmade forms some unexplained growth had also occurred here although not to the same extent as on the trail at the very center of the site stood the stone cross that his ancestor had raised almost as tall as dupree himself the names of those who had died here were etched upon it for most of the graves were unmarked and there were those whose remains had never been found among them the settlers who had been cast into the marsh dupree thought that he had never seen this place so silent so still he advanced walking carefully around the tilted gravestones until he reached the cross he rested his hand upon it to draw a breath then pulled it away as though it were a column of heated metal he took three steps back and looked up at the cross then slowly extended his hand again and allowed it to come to rest on the stone he had not been mistaken the cross was vibrating he could almost hear it hum dupree knelt maintaining his contact with the stone all the way down the intensity of the vibration seemed to increase as he neared the ground finally he laid a palm flat upon the earth and felt the pulse resonate through his fingers passing along his arm and into his body until his ears rang with it and his own heart seemed to beat in time with the reverberation it was like standing above a mine and feeling the rhythmic throbbing of the machinery far below from the trees at the edge of the site the flash of gray came again dupree rose and moved toward it the gun now extended before him twenty feet fifteen ten something touched his face he fell back a step nearly loosing off a shot in his surprise his left hand swinging and striking a glancing blow at the thing in the air he looked down and saw the moth lying stunned upon the ground its narrow pointed wings moving slightly it was another hornworm there were more of them on the tree trunk ahead of him the yellow spots on their abdomens like mold on the bark slowly the insect on the ground rose then joined its fellows on the tree as dupree drew closer he could distinguish moths upon the branches around him moths upon the stones moths hidden in the tangles of the dead briers dupree had never encountered anything like it before they did not belong on this island at any time for even in the summer there were no tobacco plants no potato plants or tomato plants upon which they might feed in winter their extinction was guaranteed they should not be here thought dupree they should be dead then he turned and saw that his surroundingsthe remains of the houses the grave markers even the great crosswere now entirely obscured by the insects their slow movements seeming to bring the stones to life dupree could hear the moths brushing against one another the sound of them like a soft whispering carried on the breeze with the back of his hand he touched those on the nearest tree and felt their wings trembling against his skin but not a single insect fled from his touch or took to the air small fragments of their tissue adhered to his fingers coating them lightly with a pale dust he thought that he could taste them in his mouth just as sylvie lauter must have tasted them in her final moments dupree stood silently among them as the sun crossed the sky and the clouds lowered until at last he left that place the pitch of the whispering increasing in intensity as he went before abruptly ceasing entirely as though some secret halfheard conversation had concluded at last in unity and resolve chapter nine barron was having a very bad day in fact barron was having his second bad day in a row the first had commenced with the phone call from boston advising him that his services would be required in the very near future barron had tried to explain to the man on the other end of the line that this wasnt a good time for him that he was under pressure the appearance of parker in the bar had rattled him badly he had no idea how much the private detective knew or even suspected but barron feared his persistence he wanted to keep his head down and behave like a model cop for a while still he told the caller nothing about parker he was afraid that they might scent trouble and feed him to the department they had photographs christ they had a video barron would have to eat his gun because there was no way he was doing jail time no way then there was terry scarfe part of barrons deal with the russians was that he would look out for scarfe scarfe had contacts he was a fixer scarfe also owed them and he couldnt pay them back if he was stuck in jail barron knew that they had their hooks in scarfe until his dying day and that he would never be permitted to pay in full the debt that he owed barron understood this because he feared that he was in the same terrible position what worried barron was that scarfe knew about him and scarfe was a screwup the dipshit had run from him that night he was on patrol with macy if he had kept his head down they might well have passed by him instead barron had been forced to chase him to search him and then to empty him out because the moron was carrying if another patrol had picked him up ten minutes later and found his stash barron might have been compelled to explain how he had missed it during his search assuming scarfe didnt hand him over on a plate to save his own skin true he could have argued that scarfe had been clean during the first search and nobody would have been able contradict him but there was still the danger of arousing suspicion then there was macy to contend with barron didnt know how much macy had seen during his search of scarfe but trainee cops had buckled under pressure in the past and barron didnt know if macy would be a standup girl if push came to shove even if she kept her mouth shut barron didnt like the idea of macy having anything on him the russian didnt listen to barrons objections he was bought and paid for he was to wait for a call when that call came the following morning it marked the start of barrons second bad day because the call came from scarfe dupree made it back to town in time for the arrival of the twelvethirty pm ferry still shaken by his experience at the site amerling was right things were happening and there was nothing that they could do except hold on tight during the ride and pray that it was over quickly he smelled perfume close by he looked to his left and saw that marianne elliot was beside him smiling shyly there was a knapsack on her back and she was sipping coffee from a steel travel mug hi she said hi you going over to the mainland ive got some things to do she said ill get the ferry back this evening and danny hes still with bonnie claeson i dropped by to say hi i think hes forgiven me for last night anyway i promised to bring him back something from portland and he seemed happy with that she touched his sleeve i had a good time with you last night she said quietly thank you youre supposed to say that you had a good time too she teased i had the best time he said she leaned in the window kissed him quickly on the lips then headed toward the dock over by the diner nancy tooker who had witnessed the exchange raised her hand and gave him a cheerful wave dupree tried to sink deeper into his seat barron met scarfe in the parking lot behind the levis store in freeport it was relatively quiet there and most of the cars had outofstate tags they sat in barrons plymouth watching the lot theyre coming in today said scarfe they want to meet you no way said barron i dont think youre in a position to argue barrons right hand lashed out catching scarfe on the side of the face scarfes head struck the passenger window dont you ever talk to me like that again the fuck you think you are talking to me that way he stared straight ahead gripping the wheel tightly working at the plastic scarfe said nothing barron wanted to scream to rage at the injustice of it all he was a cop these people had no right to put him through this he could smell scarfe beside him he stank of sweat and unwashed clothes and desperation barron needed to get away from him give me the keys scarfe handed over the keys to an isuzu trooper parked out at the maine mall the trooper sourced by scarfe was scanner equipped barron was to use the trooper for his part of the job then just leave the keys in it and walk away scarfe would take care of its disposal now get out of the car said barron scarfe climbed out silently there was a red mark on his left cheek and his left eye was tearing you didnt have to hit me he said i know said barron i did it because i wanted to then he drove away chapter ten they ditched the vans at a wrecking yard just outside brockton and prepared to pick up some replacements powell and tell took care of the details although powell who had grown fond of driving the econoline expressed his regret at seeing it go well maybe we could hold on to it just for you suggested tell we could get something written along the side like we are the guys youre looking for they watched as the econolines roof collapsed inward under the pressure of the cranes jaws glass shattered and the van shuddered as if in pain it reminded powell of the way a mans face will crumple when hes shot yeah youre right still we had some good times in that van tell tried to figure out if powell was joking but couldnt you need to make some more friends man he said they headed for the battered trailer that functioned as the lots office it smelled bad an ancient gray filing cabinet spewed yellowed paper from an open drawer and the carpet was dotted with cigarette burns nicotinesmeared blinds obscured the windows looks like business is booming said powell you guys must be planning to float on the stock exchange pretty soon there were three men waiting for them and none of them smiled two pieces of exsoviet muscle stood at either side of a third man who sat behind a cheap plastic desk the seated man was wearing a plaid jacket over a vile sports shirt the other men favored leather blouson jackets the sort that bad disc jockeys wore to public events even powell who still missed the days when a guy could wear the sleeves of his pastel jacket rolled up to his elbows thought the men were kind of badly dressed tell meanwhile was trying to figure out where the guys were from dexter had told him that the main man was russian so he figured the others were probably russian too they were dressed like shit which was kind of a giveaway tell didnt know what it was about the new breed of immigrant criminals but they had the dress sense of fucking lizards everything had to shine if these guys were making money they were spending it all on acrylics the seated man had skin like a battlefield hed tried to mask the damage with a beard but it was scraggly and untidy his hair was thinning unevenly a patch of pink showed over his left ear tell wondered if the guy had some kind of disease and was relieved that he hadnt been forced to shake his hand he had introduced himself as phil yeah right thought tell phil short for vladimir dexter didnt come himself no asked phil dexters kind of busy right now said tell im offended that he would not take the time to visit an old friend you get his christmas card cause i know he sent it no card said phil well thats a shame said tell yes said phil it is he looked genuinely hurt tell was getting antsy dexter had warned him to stay cool shepherd too but phil was beginning to get on his nerves and hed been in his company for only a couple of minutes were in kind of a hurry here said tell yes always hurry said phil too much rush its the way of the world said powell people dont take the time to stop and smell the roses tell looked at him but powell appeared to be genuine the only thing tell was smelling in here was rotting carpets and cheap aftershave your friend know said phil he understand tell was going to have words with powell once they got outside he didnt want powell to start thinking of himself as some kind of mystic phil picked up a brown envelope from the desk and tossed it to tell two vans he said we wanted three no three two only no time too much rush said tell phil smiled for the first time yes yes too much rush you tell dexter to come see me tell raised the envelope in farewell and tried to smile back yeah you bet he and powell turned to leave they were at the door when phil said and hey tell looked back phil was now standing and all three men had guns in their hands you tell him to bring my money when he comes phil said and you tell him to hurry macy was enjoying larry amerlings company she could tell that he was used to charming the pants off the women who came by the post office literally in some cases she felt certain but he was funny and knowledgeable and macy was already beginning to get some sense of the geography of the island amerling told her to hang a right and they followed the road uphill until they came to the main lookout tower it had five stories four of them with horizontal slit windows on three sides a concrete lip overshadowing each window there was a single chimney at the top five glassstrewn steps led up to the reinforcedsteel doorway the door was open kids said amerling joe tries to keep the towers locked up but they just break right back in again mind if i take a look asked macy hold your nose said amerling ill stay here and smoke a cigarette they both got out of the explorer amerling walked down to the road to light up stealing a glance back at macy as she climbed the steps finelooking woman thought amerling if i was only he tried to make the calculation then gave it up as too depressing macy pushed the door open and stepped inside to her left the words toilet here had been spraypainted on the wall over what had once served as a fireplace she decided not to look down there were no windows on this level and the floor was bare concrete to her left a flight of concrete steps led up to the next level she took them and came to the second floor the slit windows were masked with layers of plexiglas and dead insects were trapped inside macy continued to climb until the concrete steps were replaced with wooden stairs to the top floor a ladder hung down from a square access door leading to the roof she climbed up and slipped the bolt the wind hit her as she stepped onto the roof causing her jacket to flap outward like the wings of a startled bird she zipped it up and walked to the edge the tower stood high above even the tallest trees and from her vantage point she could see the cove the smaller towers along the coastline the neighboring islands ships heading out to sea even the mainland itself in the distance the air smelled clean and fresh with a faint hint of smoke but the skies were heavy and gray and there was a bitingly cold edge to the wind she turned to her right and saw amerling smoking his cigarette he looked up and waved and she raised a hand in return until she was distracted by the sight of a blue truck rolling up the road it was in bad shape because grayblue exhaust fumes not only curled from the pipe but seemed to envelop the vehicle entirely that cant be right macy thought hes moving fast and the wind is blowing against him anyway how can the fumes surround him in that way then as she watched the truck slowed and the smoke appeared to peel away forming two columns that faded into the forest to the left and right and then dispersed macy waited for a moment or two longer still unsure as to quite what she had seen then climbed back down the ladder and headed to the door she didnt notice the crude drawings of dying men and burning houses carved into the concrete with a piece of discarded stone or the length of white hair caught in the bottom rung of the ladder or the childs cloth doll that watched her impassively from the corner of the room its body shimmering as the moths moved upon it the truck had pulled up alongside larry amerling the man leaning out of its window wore a dirty green windbreaker and a sea dogs baseball cap his face was permanently tanned from years of working outdoors but his nose was red and swollen and veins had broken badly across his cheeks he made a sucking sound with his teeth as macy approached and allowed his eyes to linger on her thighs and crotch she was relieved to note that amerling looked embarrassed on the mans behalf this heres carl lubey said amerling he lives up the road carl this is officer macy pleased to meet you said lubey he made it sound like an invitation to his bed macy contented herself with a nod and gave no indication that the mans name meant anything to her so this was the brother of the man dupree had killed she hated herself for agreeing with barrons assessment but if his brother had been anything like carl then dupree might have done society a favor carl lubey was making her skin crawl you got something wrong with your truck she asked him trucks running fine he replied seemed to me like you were producing a lot of fumes you ought to get it looked at dont need looking at i told you trucks fine if you say so it happens again and you could be looking at a citation lubey made that sucking noise through his teeth again you want to come over maybe help me clean out my pipes you let me know he said he winked broadly at her then put the truck in gear and went on his way this time there was only a hint of exhaust smoke does he live alone out there asked macy does carl look like the kind of guy who has women beating down his door yeah hes alone i dont think he ever got over he stopped i know about it said macy yeah well then you understand he always did have a lot of bitterness inside him what happened to his brother just added a little extra piss to his vinegar if youll excuse the phrase pardon me saying it but it didnt look like there was anything wrong with his truck macy shook her head when he was coming up the road it seemed like he was surrounded by gray smoke then it just sort offaded away it was real odd she turned to amerling but he was looking away staring at the road carl lubey had just taken as if hoping to see some trace of the smoke for himself id best be getting back he said he stomped his cigarette out on the ground then picked up the butt and put it in the pocket of his jacket mail wont sort itself they drove in silence for a time until macy said i couldnt see the site from the top of the tower thats what they call it isnt it the site amerling took a moment to reply trees keep it hidden even in winter even in winter theres a lot of evergreens out here its over to the south isnt it thats right but you cant get there by car and even on foot you need to know where youre going at this time of year with the light fading so early im not even sure i could find it another time then said macy sure amerling lied another time moloch saw dexter staring back at him in the rearview leonie and dexter sat up front braun behind them and moloch farther back there was a hollow panel in the floor big enough for a man to lie in if necessary although if he was there for longer than a couple of minutes hed probably suffocate moloch knew it was for weapons maybe even drugs it was a last resort for him in the event of a police search and nothing more you okay asked dexter moloch nodded they had been traveling for about three hours and his back ached they had passed the toll booth at the new hampshire state line shortly after nine and entered maine the traffic was light most of it headed south toward boston they took the kittery exit and pulled up outside the kittery trading post braun and leonie went inside leaving moloch to rage alone silently as they had drawn closer and closer to maine moloch had felt a pain building in his head he found himself drifting into sleep his eyes closing and his chin nodding to his chest until a charge like a jolt of electricity forced him back into waking once again but in those glancing moments of semirest his body racked by exhaustion he was tormented by visions images of pasts both known and unknown at once familiar and strange he saw himself as a small boy hands pressed against the window of a black car as it pulled away from a suburban house the boys bicycle momentarily forgotten his fingers brushing the glass as the car sped up a man struggling in the backseat his eyes wide with panic two men holding him down the mans hand reached out as if somehow the boy could save him but nobody could save him dad no not dad not really but the closest he had come to finding one a foster father and a foster mother on a street of identical houses each with a small square of green lawn its quiet disturbed only by the hiss of sprinklers and now the noise of the car as it pulled away from the curb inside the house the woman was crying she lay slumped in a corner of the kitchen blood running from her nose and mouth she had been baking a cake and now flour and broken eggs covered the floor around her the boy went to her and she took him in her arms and held him to her the next day more men came and they were forced to leave the house the boy fled with his notmother moving from town to town watching her as she grew more and more desperate descending into some terrible dark place all her own where men came and pounded on her body and left piles of ragged bills on the dresser when they were done and the boy wondered as he grew older who am i and where have i come from if i am not of this woman then there were other womenmothers sisters daughtersflashing before him and he heard halffamiliar names spoken he was in a house by a lake he was on a streetcar a man holding his hand he was on the island and his voice was whispering know me wife moloch jerked into wakefulness again dexter was now reading a newspaper moloch closed his eyes again this is not my past it is a past but it is not mine i am more than this the island returned to him and he smelled the sea and the pines and he heard a sound as of a moth tapping on glass struggling to escape the darkness or to return to it the others returned about a half hour later they had bought warm clothing waterproofs and a selection of minor weaponry knives mainly a handheld ax and a hunting bow for dexter as for guns they already had what they needed powell handed dexter the bow case dexter opened it and removed the big bow contained within i dont understand why you need that moloch said he still felt groggy and ill he needed sleep proper sleep the tapping sound that he had heard in his dream had not gone away now that he was awake instead it remained there like water trapped in his inner ear its not about needing i like the feel of a bow you ever kill a man with a bow asked powell no killed one with an arrow though dexter grinned you really think were going to need all this stuff up here braun asked moloch moloch shook his head as much in answer as in an effort to rid himself of the infernal noise in his head we get there find her make her return my money then we kill her we dont want to make trouble for ourselves and bring them down upon us if everything goes according to plan well have her before they even know weve been there so like i asked why do we need all of this moloch looked at him the way he might have looked at a slow child because nothing ever goes according to plan he said simply the ferry to portland contained just two passengers an old man going to see his oncologist and marianne she missed danny and wished that he were with her but she had to visit the banks and he would quickly have become bored with the waiting and the filling out of forms bonnie had asked her little about her date apart from inquiring whether it had gone well she told her that danny and richie had enjoyed their evening together and she didnt mind if he stayed with her for the best part of another day richie had cheered at the news richie was a wonderful kidshe could never think of him as anything but a kidand the people on the island looked out for him in some ways dutch was the best environment for a boy like him no harm could come to him and in the closeknit community he knew affection and support to danny he was almost like a big brother even though danny who was a smart boy recognized that his playmate was different and that in some ways danny had to look out for richie more than richie had to watch out for danny but she had warned danny not to follow richie when he went exploring on the island she knew that richie liked to ramble through the woods and that bonnie had given up trying to discourage him from doing so because richie would go anyway sneaking out of the house and sending her wild with worry better that he told her where he was going than to have him simply disappear without a word while marianne liked richie she knew that he was incapable of looking after her son and danny had been told on pain of eternal grounding and loss of his allowance for the rest of his life not to go anywhere with richie unless bonnie went along too ahead of her she could see the boats bobbing at the docks on commercial resigned now to a day without danny she was looking forward to getting a few things done she planned to visit her hairdresser eat a leisurely lunch maybe even head out to the maine mall for a while she would have the best part of four hours to herself but first there was the money to take care of once that was done she would breathe a little easier she was wearing a money belt beneath her sweater and while she would certainly have preferred not to have to carry so much cash around portlands streets didnt worry her she would not be walking them at night behind her gray clouds gathered there would be snow by morning according to the weather channel she had checked the forecast before leaving and the worst of the weather would not hit until much later that night thorson had announced that the ferry would leave portland at sixthirty that night with a final sailing at ten she would probably make the sixthirty or else the last sailing with time to spare and she and danny would be locked up safely at home by the time the snows came in her kitchen bonnie clauson was watching cnn while chopping vegetables for dinner she thought that she might make something special since danny was with them a pot roast perhaps and a pumpkin pie on the tv she could see a vehicle being pulled from a river somewhere in the south it looked hot down there and the backs of the policemens shirts were dark with sweat she wondered if mike her current boyfriend might be persuaded to chip in some cash so that they could take richie away this summer shed ask him when she saw him next weekend mike drove trucks for a living and was sort of quiet but he was patient with richie and kind to her and that was enough for bonnie for the present now the picture had changed and a mans face filled the screen he looked handsome she thought apart from his eyes they were sort of narrow an impression accentuated by the thin vertical lines that ran down each cheek and the intelligence in them was marred by contempt maybe it was just the law he despised she mused but she didnt think so she figured this guy hated just about everything bonnie turned the tv up in time to hear his name moloch wasnt that a biblical name it sounded kind of biblical bonnie wasnt much of one for churchgoing or bible thumping but the name gave her the creeps she went back to preparing her food the soaps would begin soon her stories as her mother used to call them soon she forgot all about the man named moloch but her son did not he continued to stare at the television with rapt attention watching the parade of faces there was the man with the piercing eyes and the black man and the young man with the blond hair their pictures had been on tv a lot lately richie sat very still and took them all in they arrived in portland shortly before one moloch had by now moved into the front bench seat sick of being incarcerated in the back of the van the changes he had made to his appearance meant that only someone who took the time to examine him very closely would even begin to connect him with the face on the news reports and if moloch found someone examining him that closely well that person wouldnt live long enough to tell anyone what he or she had seen they pulled up on commercial and looked out to sea close by was the dock for the dutch island ferry there was nobody onboard braun had gone to check the schedule last sailing is at ten he said when he returned ferry comes back to the mainland first thing tomorrow morning moloch considered this for now we rest up get some motel rooms away from the center of town we can talk about it again after we meet scarfe dexter nodded there was a days inn out by the mall hed seen the sign on the way into town dexter liked days inns once you got used to the fact that they all looked the same they became a little like home marianne had no problems at the banks in total she withdrew some from three separate accounts depositing each wad of notes carefully in the belt beneath her sweater when she was done she treated herself to a cab ride out to the maine mall and allowed herself to be pampered in the hairdressers for a couple of hours then feeling better than she had in many months she ate chinese food at the malls food court then walked across the parking lot to t j maxx where she bought herself a dkny leather jacket that according to the tag had been reduced by she bought new sneakers for danny and added them to the harry potter tradingcard game in her bag she considered going to the movies it had been so long since shed sat in a movie theater to watch something that wasnt a cartoon or a kids comedy maybe she could make the twilight showing over at the maine mall cinema she glanced at her watch saw that it was just after sixten and broke into a trot as she headed for the theater what the fuck is wrong with her mouth said dexter he and braun were watching a payperview movie in their motel room tom cruise was some kind of deformed guy in love with a spanish chick with dark hair tom had dumped cameron diaz for the darkhaired chick which made no sense to dexter at all especially since the darkhaired chick seemed to have picked up the wrong mouth somewhere along the line well he said to braun look at it looks good to me said braun dexter had run out of movies to watch on his dvd player and had turned on the tv braun couldnt concentrate on his book with the movie playing so he had resigned himself to watching the screen there was nothing else for them to do anyway not until scarfe contacted them nah i aint saying she aint pretty or nothing hell id fuck her for free but her mouthi dont know its just too big for her face who is she anyway penelope cruz she married to him or something no cruz with a z i hear hes dating her though fucking tom cruise you think its true about him what that hes yeah no you think he could be going out with her if he was it might be a front hell of a front hell of an ass too yeah but that mouth it just looks wrong tell and shepherd were sitting in the ihop beside the days inn eating pancakes with lots of sugar and butter and cinnamon on top shepherd was listening to tell tell was full of shit sometimes but it was kind of interesting shit like there they were in the ihop and this guy had rolled by in his wheelchair he was wearing khakis and one of those black pow mia tshirts his legs were gone from the knees down and his trousers were pinned up his arms were huge shepherd figured the guy must be pushing himself up the side of mountains to get arms that big then tell said you know my brother was a cripple no shit lost a leg in vietnam couple of months before tet which leg right leg no shit came home on crutches with one trouser leg pinned up just like that guy except he still had one leg he was real upset man had a right to be upset he lost a leg sure terrible thing losing a limb he stayed in his room drinking sleeping in his own filth wasnt nobody could get through to him then he got this phone call ed sullivanyou remember ed sullivan yeah he was a strangelooking guy head and body didnt look like they matched he had short arms was what it was anyway ed was a big supporter of the war and he wanted he should do his part so he invited some vets on to the show and my brother was one of them he loved ed sullivan so he went to the show hell yeah he went he and his buddies were flown in driven to the studio in big limousines given frontrow seats the whole deal theyd all lost limbs in vietnamarms and legs and shit ed insisted that all the guys should be cripples otherwise they could be just anybody you know anyhow during the dress rehearsal for the show ed calls for the lights and cameras to be pointed at them and he starts making a big fuss and the audience starts whooping and hollering so ed looks at the boys and smiles that big smile he had and tells them to take a bow i mean its ed sullivan telling them to take a bow so my brother and his buddies they stand up to take their bow yeah so they stand up and my brother fell over he only had one leg he stood up kind of wavered for a second then went sideways banged his head most of the other guys whod lost legs managed to stay upright by supporting themselves on their seats although they all looked kind of unsteady not my brother though he was gonna stand up straight and take a bow if ed sullivan told him to he loved ed sullivan a mans got to love another man to try to stand straight on one leg just because he told him to do it your brother must have been kind of pissed at ed though no he wasnt pissed at all fact was he said he kind of appreciated someone treating him like he still had both legs so after that my brother got himself a false leg he wanted to be able to stand upright next time someone important told him to he used to take it off to sleep though thats how he died there was a fire in his apartment block and when the alarms went off there was smoke and shit and he died trying to find his false leg he didnt want to be no cripple hobbling out he wanted to preserve his dignity the ed sullivan show taught him that he loved ed sullivan no shit no shit shepherd thought that was kind of interesting that was what he meant about tell we did a bank job once over in pensacola said shepherd not wanting to be outdone in the storytelling stakes spent two weeks casing the bank this was in the old days before all them new security systems and lasers and shit it was a different time man needs a degree to take down a bank now yeah they do make it hard for a man these days and no mistake anyway we get to the bank morning of the job manager goes in his staff after him and we come in behind them before they got a chance to close the door and and theres two guys with masks already in there waiting to hold up the bank theyd come in through the roof during the night and they were standing in there when the manager arrived no shit well we were kind of perturbed you know we must have been casing the same bank during that same two weeks and we never saw each other can happen surely can so we got this moment right where were looking at them wearing their masks and theyre looking at us wearing our masks and the manager and his people are looking at all of us so i say the fuck are you doing this is our bank and this other guy says the fuck it is we spent a month on this job bullshit no i dont think so coming in through the roof that takes some planning tell relented i guess so theres a standoff until i say well why dont we split the take and the two guys look at each other and kind of shrug and say okay so you split the take fiftyfifty seeing as how theyd had to come in through the roof and all that was damn christian of yall yep mighty white like you said it was a different time that happened now thered be a bloodbath but people had principles then they had standards so yall went away happy kind of the two guys got to their car and we held them up took their share of the cash survival of the fittest absolutely we didnt kill them though course not you had standards damn straight it was a different time you said it a different time more pancakes sure said shepherd why not willard stood in the parking lot of the days inn smoking a cigarette there was the ihop maybe one hundred feet away where shepherd and tell were eating willard could see them at the window they hadnt asked him to come along with them they were probably talking about him at this very minute plotting how to get him out of the way willard wasnt too worried about tell but shepherd and dexter were real threats maybe braun too willard hated shepherd dexter and braun he pulled the baseball cap lower on his head and looked at himself in the side mirror of the van with his blond hair covered and a thin growth of beard he didnt look too much like the picture of him that they were showing on tv moloch had warned him against going out but willard wanted some air he started walking and had almost finished his cigarette by the time he reached the sidewalk he took a last long drag on the butt and watched the woman approach she stood at the entrance to the theater parking lot willard registered the disappointment on her face its closed he said willard thought that it looked like it had been closed for some time a couple of months at least she looked at him she said nothing for a moment or two then replied id forgotten i think theres another theater somewhere around here said willard he had seen something about it in the guestservices book in his room yeah said the woman i know ill just give it a miss willard smiled his best smileyou take care nowand wondered what it would be like to cut her marianne smiled back and turned away she walked quickly but not too quickly she didnt want to give anything away even as her insides churned and she thought willard its willard theyre here it was only coincidence that had exposed her to the man named willard it was during the last days when she was becoming more and more fearful of moloch and his ways she thought that he might in turn be growing suspicious of her that he was concerned by what she might know and of what might happen if the police forced her to reveal any knowledge of his activities or if she chose to do so of her own volition one day one week before the date she had chosen for her escape she had seen willard sitting in a car outside their house and knew that moloch had told him to watch her she recognized the pretty young man from his photograph in the newspaper the one linking him to the death of the older woman and from one previous occasion when she had arrived early for a rare dinner with her husband and had seen him at the bar talking intently to willard his mouth almost touching the younger mans ear so that she had thought at first that they might be lovers she had kept her distance and had approached her husband only after the other man had gone it was karen meyer who told her the young mans name after marianne explained how she had seen willard waiting near the house that was why she hadnt been in touch karen had been angry it was their nexttolast meeting arranged in advance to clear up any remaining details or concerns they were standing in a single stall in the ladies room at the mall you took a risk coming here a risk to both of us no i didnt he followed me for two days he didnt know id spotted him and i gave him no indication that i knew i behaved like an angel and i know thats what he told edward karen relaxed a little who is he asked marianne his name is willard i dont know anything more than that about him he just looks pretty theres something wrong with him though real deep down look in his eyes and youll find yourself dying in a thousand different ways with his hands on you right to the end you see him coming for you again and you take off you hear me you take off and you never look back well come up with another way to get the stuff to you but you see willard coming up your garden path and hes only going to be coming for one reason he might drop by to check up on you again before then so act naturally over the next few days dont give them any cause to suspect and that was what she had done walking calmly ignoring the presence of the man her husband might be planning to have kill her on the last day the day of molochs bank job she knew she was safe willard would be with him or close to him but it was not until she was two hundred miles from the city danny asleep in his seat that she began to relax even slightly she continued to move from city to city town to town never staying long in any one location before settling at last upon the island the place to which she had decided to flee many months before after reading a feature about the maine islands in a travel magazine content that for now her trail was unlikely to be uncovered but she had never forgotten willard or the potential threat that her husband even incarcerated might pose to her it could have been merely a coincidence of course that willard was now up north far from home but she didnt think so no they were here and they were coming for her for if they were in portland then they knew she was on the island and soon they would arrive on it as she walked away from willardnot too fast not too slowshe tried to retrace their steps figuring out how they had found her only two people could have told karen and her sister marianne walked to maine mall road and tried to hail a cab using the opportunity to pause and glance back to where willard still stood he was not looking at her then he turned and his eyes seemed to alight on her face marianne waited for him to head into the ihop or back toward the motel instead willard began to walk quickly along the sidewalk he was heading straight for her willard didnt talk much he guessed that a lot of folks considered him dumb seeing as how he had never been much for school and maybe they thought he was afraid to open his mouth because people might laugh at what came out but willard wasnt afraid of anyone and those who might have felt the urge to laugh at him would quickly have suppressed it as soon as they looked in willards eyes sure willard had trouble with reading and he wasnt so good with figures but he had the instincts and intelligence of a natural hunter combined with a curiosity about the nature of pain and hurt when applied to others he had sensed something from the woman when she had looked at him it was more than the natural fear that he frequently recognized in women the care they took not to get themselves trapped alone with a stranger the grip with which they held on to their purses the casual look around the smarter ones took as they prepared to open their car door in the parking lot no this was different keener separated thought willard with a husband who isnt taking it too well or maybe trying to avoid a boyfriend who doesnt want to split from her because then hell have to find someone else to beat on willards nostrils were almost twitching as she stood before him he liked the scent of her it aroused the predator in him he wasnt so sure about her hair though shed dyed it some dowdy color that didnt suit her streaking it more than altering it entirely he couldnt figure out why shed do something like that except hed heard on tv that it was kind of the fashionable thing to do a few years ago if so this woman needed to get back on the fashion train because it was surely leaving the station without her willard watched her walk away she had slim legs and a nice ass beneath her coat he could see the shape of it as she pulled the coat against herself on another occasion he might have followed her learned more about her just in case he decided to visit her at some point in the future but moloch had warned him after the incident with the woman in the bedroom willard hadnt liked the way moloch spoke to him neither had he appreciated the look that had passed between moloch and dexter afterward like a principal and a teacher agreeing on the unspoken decision to expel an errant student from school willard saw the woman try to hail a cab she looked anxious strange he thought she walks to the movie theater from the mall and now she suddenly has to get a cab he rubbed his foot across the stillsmoldering cigarette butt crushing it into the sidewalk and then there was that hair it was shitty almost as if it was designed to make her look more common than she was there was a goodlooking woman under there but she seemed to be deliberately trying to hide her presence a mental picture flashed a woman standing beside moloch at the state fair the woman smiling uneasily willard tried setting the image of the woman with the dyed hair beside molochs wife shit marianne saw the cab at almost the same instant that willard began to speed up his progress the lights were changing to amber over by chilis restaurant and the cabdriver seemed inclined to stop she waved her hand frantically causing cars to honk their horns as she ran across the road and saw the driver glance to his right where a competitor was exiting from the hampden inn with an empty cab in that second he made his decision and hit the accelerator shooting through the lights as they turned to red in his rearview mirror he pulled in alongside her and she clambered in just as willard started to run commercial said marianne please and quickly the cabdriver glanced in the rearview as he got ready to pull out and spotted willard hey he said you know this guy marianne looked back willard was running between the traffic dodging the oncoming hoods almost gracefully he was maybe thirty feet from the cab a guy i once dated she said i really dont want to talk to him theres ten bucks in it for you for an extra ten ill date him myself said the cabdriver he swung out and shot away from the curb marianne heard a noise from behind like fingers vainly dragging along the trunk of the cab but she did not look back willard stood on the curb watching the cab head off toward portland had the lights at the mall entrance gone red then he might have caught up with them but the cab had a free run to the main intersection willard took a deep breath and debated whether or not he should tell moloch what had occurred he might have been wrong about the woman of course but the look on her face as she had seen him approach through the back window of the cab told him that his suspicions were correct it was her she knew who he was and if she knew that then she must also know that they had come for her at last the shock on her face told him one more thing she didnt know that moloch was free otherwise she wouldnt have been trying to pass an idle evening with some shitty movie he had to tell moloch already the woman would be preparing to run again willard was surprised by how calm moloch appeared to be at least initially as it turned out the calm didnt last long youre certain it was her said moloch pretty sure her hair is different and she looked kind of dowdy but i saw her face as that cab pulled away she knew me how theres no way that she could have known who you are maybe she picked up on me when i was tailing her back before she ran if she did then youre the shittiest tail i ever knew willard bridled at the insult but said nothing you should have caught her now she knows were here where can she go theres no way she could have made the ferry you think thats the only boat down there they have water taxis she could go to another island and get someone to bring the kid to her you think we have time to scour every island for her get the others describe her to them and set them to looking for her in town if nobody has found her by seven we bring everything forward willard left him moloch called braun in his room braun listened then hung up we need to get going he told dexter the hell are you talking about asked dexter this shit is only starting to get good willard saw the wife he thinks she made him dexter swore then turned off the tv they packed up and joined moloch and the others in his room shepherd and tell had just arrived tell still had sugar on his sweater an extra twentyfive thousand for the one who finds her said moloch he looked at willard and i want her intact you hear willard didnt even nod but he could see dexter grinning at him once again he recalled the look that had passed between dexter and moloch willard decided that he was going to have to deal with dexter and sooner rather than later the cab dropped marianne on commercial footsteps from the ferry dock the dock was empty and she could see the lights of the ferry disappearing into the evening darkness she swore and felt the fear wash over her it almost reduced her to tears she tried to hold herself together they would be expecting her to head back to the island if only to get danny maybe if she could get someone to pick up danny and get him off the island then she could avoid going back to dutch at all briefly she considered calling the cops and telling them everything but marianne was afraid that they would take danny away from her perhaps even jail her no the cops were not yet an option except she dialed and told the dispatcher that she had seen a man out by the mall who looked like the guy on tv you know the blond guy she gave an accurate description of willards dress right down to the baseball cap then hung up that would give them something to think about she didnt have much time she dropped some coins in the slot and rang bonnie claesons number the phone rang three times and then was picked up hello she said there was static on the line but it wasnt regular static it ebbed and flowed at first it sounded a little like soft cotton being rubbed between someones fingers for an instant an image came to her unbidden an insect beating its wings while around it a host of others did the same in preparation for some great flight then the line died she tried again and got only a busy signal she tried three more numbers including jacks with the same result finally marianne gripped her bag and ran for a water taxi just as the first flurries of snow began to fall shepherd arrived first at the pier only to see the water taxi disappearing from sight a tiny puff of smoke seeming to mock him as it went he removed a pair of binoculars from his pack and found the woman in the prow of the boat she was as far as he could make out the only passenger as he stared at her she looked back toward the pier and he was certain that she was looking at him he thought he could read fear in her eyes tell appeared beside him and shepherd smiled shes going home willards instincts were honed to perfection he saw the patrol car before the cop inside could spot him and slipped into the starbucks in the old port stripping himself of his coat and hat as he went he didnt know who they were looking for but he could guess the woman had seen him and she had called the cops to make life difficult for him willard didnt care life had always been difficult for him he ordered a coffee then slipped back out onto the streets and lost himself from view as soon as willard told him of his encounter with marianne moloch called scarfe and headed for the meeting place he had suggested the rocky outcrop by the twin lights in cape elizabeth the rocks and the small beach were deserted with the approaching storm even the locals had retreated to their homes there were two men waiting on the beach snow already whitening their shoulders and hair one was scarfe the other was barron so this is the tame cop moloch looked at the policeman with a mixture of distaste and amusement barron was wearing jeans sneakers and a padded jacket he looked uneasy im not your tame cop he said what would you prefer to be called pedophile cop child molester cop please let me know i want you to be as comfortable as possible in your dealings with me barrons face flushed but he didnt reply you should have been more careful officer your tastes have made you the bitch of anyone to whom your creditors choose to offer you just tell me what you want said barron softly moloch turned to scarfe ive heard a lot about you none of it very impressive i advise you not to let me down now tell me about the island for the next ten minutes scarfe detailed all that he had discovered from carl lubey including the presence and routines of the giant cop joe dupree and the reported arrival that morning of the rookie cop macy a rookie moloch had interrupted maybe our luck is holding and the woman marianne elliot shes out there her house is over on the southeastern shore there arent too many other houses around there the boy is with her does she have a boyfriend asked moloch scarfe swallowed lubey says shes been seen around with the cop dupree they had dinner together last night moloch motioned him to continue but he looked unhappy at the development theres a boat waiting for you down at the marine company you go in after dark on the northern shore some ways from the womans house there are no good landings over where she is except for a little inlet that belongs to an old painter guy who watches the bay like a hawk you try coming in that way and if he spots you hell start making calls the sea there is threaded with rocks anyway even experienced sailors steer clear of it you need to stay as far as possible from the dock on island avenue on your way in and from any houses along the shore like the painter people on the island keep a close eye on what happens there and who comes and goes the northeastern shore is virtually unpopulated though lubey will meet you at the landing he has a truck hell take you to the womans house then bring you back to the boat when your business is done he doesnt want money he has one favor to ask go on he wants you to kill dupree if you get the chance no cops interrupted barron nobody gets hurt that was the deal i dont remember making a deal with you officer said moloch you will do as youre told or your superiors will receive information that will end your career and make you the whore of every diseaseridden rapist that your states prison system can put your way dont interrupt us again he turned back to scarfe i make no promises about the cop it might be easier to get rid of him at the start it was leonie moloch bit at his lip if the cop was seeing his wife then the cop deserved what was coming to him there was nothing worse than the thought of another man inside his wife scarfe unfolded papers from his pocket this is a map of the island ive made some copies its kind of rough but it shows the main roads the town and the location of the womans house and those of her nearest neighbors moloch took the map examined it then folded it and handed it along with the copies to leonie i couldnt help but notice that you said you in your detailing of the arrangements made you not us that worries me ive done what you asked me to do youre coming with us you dont need me you know about boats and you know this area some of my associates have experience of such matters but these are unfamiliar waters and there is bad weather approaching and if your friend mr lubey lets us down we will have someone to fall back on heavily scarfe nodded i understand moloch turned to barron your role in this affair is simple officer you monitor the police bands if there is even a hint of police activity that might concern us i want you to nullify it i understand that there is no cell phone coverage on the island there are pockets but only close to town the eastern shore is out of range you will take up a position on the dock if our return is jeopardized in any way you will signal us with your headlights as we return to land is that clear thats all for now mr scarfe youll come with us our departure is imminent moloch dexter and willard dropped leonie and braun on commercial the two older men sat in the van close by the casco bay ferry terminal while willard stayed in the shadows and watched the approaches along commercial the plan was virtually unchanged one group would make for the island with scarfe while leonie and braun would follow by water taxi and land at the cove as the late ferry crossing had been canceled due to thorsons innate caution and the early arrival of the snow barron would keep an eye on all new arrivals just in case the woman managed to slip by them and make it back to portland i didnt want her to see us before we came moloch said to dexter i didnt want her to know i wanted to see the shock on the bitchs face myself youll still see it i reckon she has a lot of shock left in her moloch didnt look so happy dexter thought he had been sleeping badly dexter had heard him crying out that happened to men who had been jailed dexter knew even after their release part of them always remained incarcerated and that was the part that intruded on their dreams dexter meanwhile had his own worries i dont like this whole island deal he said too many things can go wrong i dont like having just one escape route i dont like having to leave the same way i came in and we dont know shit about this lubey guy we have a boat one of us will stay with it the whole time like i told you we can take her and be gone before anyone even knows weve been there we just need to stay out of trouble as for lubey hes a driver nothing more do you trust the cop no but i think hes too frightened of the consequences to cross us plus our friends in boston have promised him a little gift for his cooperation his fear and his lust should combine to keep him in line and the policeman out on the island when they get there braun and leonie will kill him if only for having the temerity to fuck my wife and willard something like regret flashed across molochs features no pain he said i want him to feel no pain in the shadows willard was looking at a small map of the bay held behind a protective plexiglas screen he had changed his clothes and was now wearing a tourists fleece with a lobster on the front he had darkened his hair in a mens room with a kit he had bought in a drugstore and it was now a shimmering black with the index finger of his right hand he traced the route of the ferry following each little dot as carefully as if he were tracing the route onto paper his finger stopped on the island then he jerked it back suddenly a spider was crawling across the map its body covered the island somehow the spider had found its way inside the case and now it was trapped vainly seeking a way out maybe it had been trying to shelter from the cold but now the case would be its tomb there would be no insects in there for it to feed on and eventually it would grow thin and die willard watched it crawl its legs occasionally slipping on the surface of the map causing the spider to drop an inch or two before its silk arrested its slide at last it crawled back up to the toprighthand corner of the case and huddled there waiting for its end willards mouth was dry he looked up from the map and stared out to sea trying to find light in the distance but he could not his stomach felt bad he was concerned about dexter and shepherd but he was worried too about the island willard had a survivors instincts and now that little inner voice on which he had relied for so long was telling him to leave to make his escape while he still could but willard wasnt going to run deep inside he still trusted moloch he wanted to trust him he needed him he lived for the light of molochs approval it was his weakness willard was crazy crazier than even he himself knew crazier even than moloch suspected but deep down he just wanted to be loved chapter eleven powell was having trouble with the boat guy he was fat and old and dumb with grease stains on his shirt he didnt smell so good powell had to turn his face away anytime the guy spoke to him his breath was so bad powell just hoped his boat didnt stink as bad as he did powell wasnt happy on the sea he didnt need any encouragement to puke on boats but he suspected that the stench from this guys boat might be about to give him a little push in the right direction just for good luck the boat was a fifteenfooter with a small enclosed wheelhouse barely big enough for two men powell knelt down close to it took a sniff and backed off it reeked of rotting fish and the boat guys breath as if it were so toxic that it had stuck to the hull and cabin like gum powell had read somewhere that all smells are particulate which meant that tiny little molecules of the boat guys stench were now wending their way through his nasal passages it made powell even more irritated with the boat guy than he already was and powell had been pretty pissed at him before he even got within ten feet of his stinking boat the guy wasnt even supposed to be here but he had started to worry about his boat being taken out in bad weather and had come down to the dock to express his concerns now powell was left to clear up the mess before moloch and the others arrived because if they got here first then the boat guy was dead the way powell saw it the last thing this operation needed was more dead people they already had enough corpses to form a conga line from here to virginia scarfe had assured powell that the boat guy would keep his mouth shut just as he had done in the past powell hoped that for his sake the boat guy started shutting up pretty soon because powell was beginning to feel seriously nauseous you got paid right said powell i know cause scarfe says he did it yeah i got paid i got the money right here so that boat is worth more than you paid me were renting it said powell his patience wearing thin as paper we dont have to pay you what the boat is worth thats why its called renting and not buying but suppose something happens to it scarfe said the fat guy looked over powells shoulder to where scarfe stood in the shadows scarfe looked away the boat guy was on his own powell reached out and grabbed his shoulder in order to keep him focused then instantly regretted touching him i could give a rats ass what scarfe said with luck youll have your boat back tonight four five hours tops weve been more than generous you got insurance right yeah i got insurance but insurance never pays like it should why are you telling me go write your congressman all i want is the boat its nothing illegal is it powell looked hard at the guy are you for fucking real where do you get off asking a question like that you want me to tell you the boat guy started to back off no i dont want to know then take your money and get your fat stinking ass out of my sight this piece of shit is all fueled up right sure its ready to go okay then we have any problems with this and were not going to be looking for a refund you understand were going to want a different level of compensation i understand youll have no problems with her for a moment powell looked confused how do you know he began then stopped the boat he was talking about the boat shit powell let out a deep breath no problems with her he echoed good now go buy yourself some tic tacs moloch dexter and willard arrived shortly after the boat guy had gone on his way and tell and shepherd emerged from out of the shadows they had wrapped up warm in preparation for the crossing and had put on the waterproofs purchased in kittery the wind had picked up in the last half hour the snow blew hard against their faces powell noted with some amusement that the snowflakes were settling neatly along the lines of tells cornrows contrasting nicely with his dark skin powell thought that it made the little man look kind of decorative dexter too come to think of it he didnt consider sharing this observation with them he suspected that they wouldnt find it funny storm coming in with a vengeance said scarfe good said moloch so are we powell shepherd and dexter clambered down into the boat after moloch scarfe following then willard scarfe started the motor he glanced behind him watching the four men shrug themselves into life jackets then take their seats on the plastic benches powell alone and holding on grimly to the side tell untied the boat tossed the rope down to the deck then clambered aboard moloch stood beside scarfe in the wheelhouse scarfe was looking at the sky and the thickening snow the docks around them were already nearly lost to sight and the sea beyond was a vision in static they were alone on the water how long will it take us to get across asked moloch theres a head wind and visibility sucks well have to take it slow we dont hit anything and nothing hits us then well make it in under two hours she could have been there and gone by the time we get to her scarfe shook his head uhuh shes facing the same difficulties as we are plus i reckon that theres going to be no more traffic into and out of the island until morning the ferry is bedded down for the night thorson is no captain crunch he wont take her out if theres even a smell of danger unless she gets someone to take her off the island in a private boat and i dont think thats going to happen then shes stuck there problem is we may be stuck there too moloch raised his hand gripped scarfes chin and turned the smaller mans face to his thats not going to happen you understand scarfes reply was muffled because molochs grip was so tight but it was clear that he knew where he stood moloch released his grip and scarfe pulled the boat away from the dock already powells face was gray across from him dexter took a package from his pocket and unwrapped it revealing a meatball sub as the boat moved away powells cheeks bulged dont puke on my shoes warned dexter powell didnt he puked on his own shoes braun and leonie had some trouble convincing the water taxi to take them over to sanctuary the guy didnt want to go but leonie who had read up on the island during the hours at the days inn gave him a sob story about being a cousin of sylvie lauter and how she had come hundreds of miles to console sylvies mother leonies tale would have broken a softer man but the boatman looked like he was made of teak with a mahogany heart braun stayed out of it figuring that if they both began to work on the guy they would intimidate themselves out of a ride leonie gave him the boatman relented she watched him fold the bills and place them in a waterproof wallet that hung on a string around his neck then tuck the wallet under his shirt satisfied she turned away leonie had none of the scruples of powell and braun she did not like leaving loose ends she would get the money back from him when she killed him marianne sat beneath the awning of her water taxi her arms curled tightly around her her chin buried beneath folds of coat and scarf she was shaking uncontrollably the boatman thinking her cold offered her coffee from his flask and she thanked him and wrapped her gloved fingers around the tin cup but still she shook she had tried calling her sister before the boat left but the phone had only rung she had called karen meyer with the same result she knew in her heart that both were dead that she had cost them their lives it was her fault all her fault but if she died then danny would also die and it would all have been in vain there was still a chance for them if she could get to danny in time thorson had canceled his final sailing and appealing to his better nature was not an option she knew his reputation and doubted if he would make even one leg of the journey and risk being stranded in portland even if he was willing to go to sea marianne feared that someone would be watching the ferry in case she tried to escape certainly from the mainland and possibly from the island itself but there were others who might be prepared to take them off the island if not as far as the mainland then at least to one of the larger neighboring islands carl lubey had a boat and sometimes made runs if someone was in enough trouble and was prepared to pay him handsomely for it he was an option although the idea of being at his mercy was unappealing her other option was jack the painter he also had a boat and she knew that he cared for danny if he was sober he was their best chance there were lights to her right and left the houses on nearby islands their windows hanging suspended in the darkness like fissures in the fabric of the night or the promise of new worlds she fantasized about taking danny and disappearing through one of them sewing it closed behind her so that nobody could ever find them again the lights disappeared as the snow thickened and the wind picked up the little boat tossed on the waves and she held tightly to the ropes spray drenching her face and chilling her hands she wore the boatmans spare oilskins but water was still finding its way through she thought of her son and she thought too of joe dupree she could turn to him but the risks were too great she would be forced to reveal the truth about herself and she couldnt do that but there was another reason that she was unwilling to ask him for help she had seen willard and knew that moloch must be close by there would be others too perhaps not as bad as her husband and the pretty dangerous boyman but bad enough joe dupree was not strong enough to stand against them if she turned to him for help they would kill him they would kill them all dupree stood at the station house door and watched the snow fall already island avenue was empty the stores had closed early and the rudder and good eats would not be opening for business the ferry would return to port any minute now and thorson would kill the lights on the dock and hang out a sailing canceled sign the snow was already sticking to the sidewalks the shadows of the flakes made huge by the glow of the streetlights as they descended no cars were moving anywhere on the island the risks of ending up in a ditch or worse taking a tumble into the cold sea were too great he heard footsteps behind him macy was wrapped up warm she had added an extra sweater to her uniform and her hands were double wrapped in a pair of woolen gloves and a leather pair from the station locker no luck she said she had been trying to raise portland on the radio for the last hour but there was only static the phone line meanwhile had exchanged a dial tone for a steady hum dupree had wandered over to check with larry amerling in his house behind the post office but his phone was also without a proper tone it looked as if the entire island was going into communication meltdown did you get out to the site amerling asked dupree as the policeman prepared to leave yes i went out there and there were moths a lot of moths thats all dupree debated telling him about the vibrations in the ground then decided against it the postmaster looked edgy enough as things stood thats all and after this snow i dont think well be seeing too many more moths on the island until the summer stay warm larry ill check in with you at the post office tomorrow morning he left the postmaster pulling the front door closed behind him a moment or two later he heard the sound of the dead bolts locking now beside him he saw macy trying to dial a cell phone number the display showed a ringing phone symbol indicating that it was attempting to make a connection then returned to the verizon home screen the aerial strength indicator read virtually nil even the reception on the tv in the rec room was terrible guess we batten down the hatches she said guess so he didnt even look at her quiet time she thought i can do quiet time i just wish youd close the damn door macys day had been spent on largely mundane matters there was the b ampe that turned out to be nothing more than an embarrassed husband who had climbed in through the kitchen window while dead drunk the previous night broken plates and knocked over the portable tv in the kitchen then fallen asleep in the spare room because he was afraid of waking his wife unaware that she had popped enough sleeping pills to allow half of san francisco to sleep through an earthquake his wife had eventually come to spotted the damage and called the cops the first her husband knew about it all was when macy arrived at their door while he was throwing up in the john the woman began hollering at her husband and calling him ten types of asshole while he just held his head in pain and shame macy left them to it apart from the happy couple she had issued a warning to the owners of a scrawny mongrel dog that was trying to bite passing cars and talked to a couple of kids who were smoking and probably drinking theyd hidden the beer cans somewhere in the undergrowth but macy was damned if she was going to go beating the bushes with a stick for a couple of miller high lifes out by the old gun emplacement shed taken their names then told them to haul their asses back home one girl dressed in a black leather motorcycle jacket and combat pants with a korn tshirt underneath and a spiked dog collar around her neck hung back are you going to tell my mom and dad she asked macy the girls name according to her drivers license was mandy papkee i dont know you got any reason why i shouldnt we werent doing any harm we just came out here to remember wayne and sylvie macy knew about the accident on the island the week before a lot of the people she had met that day insisted on talking about it if only to assure her that things like that didnt happen very often on dutch sometimes the older ones said on sanctuary reinforcing the seemingly dual nature of the islands existence you knew them everybody knows everyone else out here said mandy i mean duh its an island duh repeated macy pointedly sorry said mandy look were not going to be back out here not for a long time i can promise that why because it gives us the creeps this was like a stupid dare we shouldnt have come here it just feels wrong because of what happened to your friends maybe mandy clearly didnt want to say anything more but she looked around at the trees as if half expecting sylvie and wayne to emerge bloodied from the undergrowth looking for a beer and a toke look just give us a break okay macy relented okay she said and watched mandy follow her friends back to the road something flitted across the grass toward macys feet it was a moth an ugly gray one macy flicked her foot at it and the moth flew away she strolled over to the damaged tree against which the stolen car had finally come to rest and saw the little shrine that had been raised in memory of the dead teenagers she touched nothing by the time she got back to the explorer mandy and the other kids were gone that was about as interesting as things got for the most part she drove around the island familiarizing herself with its roads and trails talking to people as they went about their daily business occasionally she made contact with dupree but he seemed distracted when the light began to fade she returned to the station house and stayed there she went upstairs to the little galley kitchen beside the rec room poured chicken soup from a can into a plastic bowl then placed the bowl in the microwave she took a book from her pack lay back on the sofa and started to read there was still some time to kill before the ferry arrived out on sunset road doug newton checked on his mother her breathing was shallow and the dark patches around her eyes were like new bruises he touched the old womans skin with the backs of his fingers she felt cold even though the radiators were turned up as high as they would go doug went to the hall closet and took out another comforter he laid it on her bed tucking it in beneath her chin then walked to the alcove window and looked out onto his yard the exterior lights were on and he could see the snow falling and the shapes of the trees slowly emerging as the flakes came to rest upon them beyond there was only darkness doug tugged at the lock on the window it was firmly closed as were all the windows in the house he recalled what he believed he had seen a little girl at his mothers halfopen window her fingers prising at the gap to widen it when doug had entered the room the girl had stared at him for no more than a second or two then retreated by the time doug reached the window she was gone from sight the girl was five or six years of age or so he had told joe dupree but doug had said that last part with a slight tremor of doubt in his voice because the girl might have had the body of a child but her eyes were much older and her mouth was all wrong it was very round like it was about to give a kiss the funny thing about it was that joe dupree old melancholy joe himself hadnt laughed at him or accused him of wasting police time the way that other cop tuttle had instead joe had told him to do just what he was doing keep his mother warm and keep the doors and windows locked just in case just in case doug went back downstairs turned on the tv and tried to watch a game show through a snowstorm worse than the one outside on church road nancy and linda tooker were arguing over the dogs theyd taken the collie and the german shepherd indoors because of the snow but now the dogs just wouldnt stop whining nancy had opened the kitchen door to see if they wanted to go back out but the dogs had instead retreated farther into the house and were now lying in the darkness at the top of the stairs still crying it was you who wanted pedigree dogs said nancy damn things are too highly strung i told you can it said her sister she was trying to connect to aol but with no success eventually the screen just froze and she was forced to unplug the computer from the wall when she tried to restart it nothing happened nancy she said i think i broke the computer but nancy wasnt listening instead she watched through the kitchen window as gray shapes danced across the snow her sister joined her and together they stood in silence as the insects flew among the snowflakes seemingly untroubled by the wind that shook the windows and caused closed doors to strike against their frames once or twice they banged against the glass and the tookers got a clear look at the ugly moths without consulting each other the two sisters locked all the doors secured the windows and took their places with the dogs in his little bedroom carl lubey wrapped himself up warm and pulled on a pair of steelcapped boots the wind tugged at the windows of his house causing them to rattle furiously what little warmth there was seeped out through countless cracks and gaps in the woodwork ron was the one with the talent for houses not carl carl was the mechanic ron was the builder the handyman now his brother was gone and carl was left alone to deal with the wind and the rain and the snow as best he could he went to his bedside locker and removed the browning it had a shitty plastic grip plate that was supposed to look like wood but didnt and the magazine catch jammed on occasion but carl wasnt fussy he didnt think hed have much call to use it not if the visitors came through for him if things went like they were supposed to his brother would sleep easy in his grave tonight at the heart of the island close by the site there was movement among the trees and beneath the earth despite a wind that blew hard from the west shrubs bent toward the east and flurries of snow rose in spirals and formed shapes that almost resembled the bodies of men before they disintegrated and tumbled gently toward the ground seen from above it might have appeared that gray light was seeping out from the ground or a thin dirty smoke that left no mark on the snow there were no more whispers now the wind sounded like voices and the voices were joyful chapter twelve macy spotted the ferry pulling into port from her vantage point on the second floor its arrival had been delayed by the weather thorson unwilling to push the ferrys speed into little more than double figures the faint streamer of smoke was barely visible through the thickening snow although thorson had lit the boat itself like a christmas tree it almost hurt her eyes to look at it ferrys in she called to dupree he was catching up on paperwork in the little office the doors leading outside were now firmly closed and the heating had kicked in enough to enable him to remove his jacket you dont have to go he said im pretty sure its my turn nah im dressed for it besides it will give me something to do thanks he said and returned to his reports the wind had picked up force and the snow blew directly into her face stinging her cheeks she removed the windshield cover from the explorer and tossed it on the passenger seat then started the engine and drove carefully down to the dock parking over by the passenger shelter until the ferry came in the chains on the wheels made a ratcheting sound on the road and the snowplow attachment that she and dupree had fitted on earlier that evening rattled against the grille a handful of passengers disembarked from the ferry all of them apparently locals who raced for their own cars or caught rides from friends or family macy watched them leave then saw another smaller vessel heading into port the water taxi docked and a harriedlooking woman was helped out by the boatman there seemed to be some argument and macy was about to head over and intervene when the boatman abruptly turned away cast off and headed out of port he paused briefly to exchange some words with thorson who leaned over from his roost to talk then continued on his way the woman did a double take when she saw the explorer then headed straight up the hill to where her car was parked macy followed pulling in alongside her as she fumbled with her car keys everything okay maam the woman looked at her and tried to smile yes thank you everythings fine im just late to pick up my son thats all hell be worried macy smiled as if she really understood what it was like to have a child waiting for her to return but the woman was no longer looking at her instead she was staring over macys shoulder looking back out to sea macy glanced in her rearview mirror but the ferry was the only boat in sight the water taxi was already lost amid the snow can i ask your name maam the woman jerked as if shed just been hit with an electric shock marianne elliot she said my name is marianne elliot were you having trouble with the taxi just a disagreement about the fare thats all in the end i paid a little over the odds but its a bad night it was good of him to take me over after i missed the ferry macy examined the womans face but saw no reason to doubt her story she patted the car roof and moved back well miss elliot you take care on the road i know youre in a hurry but you want to get back to your son safe and sound dont you for the first time the woman seemed to truly notice her yes she said more than anything else in the world thorson was sipping coffee in the cabin of the ferry when macy came onboard the captain offered her his flask and a spare cup but she declined youre not making another crossing right she asked dupree had told her to check although he had been pretty certain that thorson would not be taking the ferry out again thorson stared out into the night he even looks like a ferry captain thought macy white beard red cheeks yellow oilskins he was a good captain according to dupree in all its long history there had never been an accident involving thorsons ferry he was just more respectful of the sea than most you kidding theres already a smallcraft advisory in place and even the casco bay ferries are going to stop running in an hour there wont be a boat on the water after that soon as i finish my coffee im heading home and thatll be me done until the morning okay just thought id make sure say you know the captain of that water taxi that came in just now yeah thats ed oldfield i was surprised to see him out so far on a night like this he say anything to you about the woman he brought over marianne no just that she seemed to want him to wait for her and take her back to portland he wouldnt do it if he waited any longer hed be stuck here overnight and hes got a family at home on chebeague macy thanked him and returned to the explorer then headed back through town toward the station house dupree was still hunched over his desk painstakingly typing details into the primitivelooking computer on his desk as he tried to avoid hitting two keys simultaneously with his big fingers he looked up as macy entered brushing snow from her jacket anything unusual a few locals and a water taxi just one passenger onboard she said her name was marianne elliot macy picked up on the look that crossed duprees face you know her yeah he said was he blushing she wondered shes a friend she was in quite a hurry said she was late to pick up her kid thorson said he thought she might be trying to get back to the mainland tonight dupree frowned nobodys going back to portland tonight maybe ill take a run by her place later make sure shes okay despite herself macy felt one of her eyebrows arch what said dupree nothing said macy trying to sound innocent nothing like a concerned active police force yeah he sounded dubious speaking of concerned and active you mind taking a short ride out dupree was worried about marianne now he couldnt understand why she would want to return to portland before morning unless there was something wrong hed use his own jeep to drop in at her place as soon as he had finished his paperwork no problem but that snow is falling pretty heavily and the wind is picking up some soon its going to start to drift i dont want you to make a full circuit of the island not in this weather larry amerling told me you were out by the main watchtower today you think you can find it again its easy enough to find take a right on division and straight on till morning right thats it heard you ran into carl lubey while you were out there he was charming still single too quite a catch yeah like catching rabies could you swing by lubeys place he pointed it out to her on the wall map its a shithole so you cant miss it even in this weather couple of rustedout cars in the drive and a big screwyou satellite dish in the yard last night i had to roust him from the bar along with a mainland lowlife named terry scarfe according to thorson terry didnt come back over today but i still dont like the fact that he and lubey were spending time together macy zipped up her jacket and got ready to go but dupree stopped her i guess you already know it but carl lubey is the brother of a man i shot i killed him carls a sleazebag but hes harmless alone if i go out there ill only rile him up and the next thing we know well have him cuffed to the chair over there smelling up the place until morning i hate to do this to you on your first night and all but it will put my mind at rest if i know that carl lubey is tucked up safe in his bed the tree coverage should mean that the road is still okay but you run into any problems and you just come right back yhear macy told him that she would secretly she was pleased to be leaving the station house the tv wasnt working properly and she was likely to be cooped up inside until morning one last trip out would kill some time and leave her with more of her book to read she drove carefully up island avenue until she left the street lamps behind then put her headlights on full and followed the coast toward division carl lubey was not tucked up safe in his bed although he was starting to wish that he was curiously he was thinking about macy just as macy was now thinking about him because he was staring into the innards of his truck a truck that right now just would not start the cop had warned him she said shed seen it billowing fumes but he just hadnt listened son of a bitch it had been driving okay earlier in the day but now just when he needed it to run the engine was turning over with a click the battery was new so it couldnt be that inside his garage with the lamp hanging from the hood carl took a rag and wiped the oil from his hands it could be the starter he figured but that would take time to repair and he didnt have that kind of time he had people to meet and if scarfe was telling the truth they were the kind of people who wouldnt take kindly to being kept waiting he didnt want them to wait either the sooner they got what they wanted the sooner he would get what he wanted which was a big dead policeman carl was a coward he knew he was a coward although sometimes when he was liquored up he liked to tell himself that he was just smart and that men like him smaller and weaker than those around them had to find other ways to fight back when people did them a bad turn if that meant stabbing them in the back then so be it if they hadnt crossed him they wouldnt have had to worry about their backs anyway carls brother was differentstrong and hard and hell maybe even kind of mean but a real man one who had stood up for his little brother time and time again and because ron had been a standup guy for carl when the time came carl had been a standup guy for him carl still remembered the call theyd both been out drinking in portland and ron had headed off with some woman hed picked up in threedollar deweys she looked kind of familiar to carl according to ron she was jeanne aiello all grown up generations of aiellos had lived out on dutch until jeannes parents had grown tired of the isolation and had left for more civilized surroundings now little jeanne was back in maine working in one of those tourist stores in the old port and seemed real happy to be making rons acquaintance once again carl left them to it and because he was still thirsty and had a beer appetite he took a cab out to the great lost bear on forest avenue and got himself a big basket of wings it wasnt carls favorite bar owing to the fact that the portland cops liked to drink there but he was hungry and the bear was one of the few bars that served food late at night he was halfway through his wings when his cell phone started ringing and he heard his brothers voice when he answered the call ron wasnt panicked though or afraid he just told carl to get in a cab and head over to windham and carl had done just that leaving the cab about a half mile from the address his brother had given him as he had been instructed to do ron was waiting at the door of the house when he got there and waved his brother in quickly there were cuts on his face the woman was lying on the bathroom floor and her face was all torn up the mirror above the sink was shattered and there was a big shard of it in her eye smaller pieces were embedded in her cheeks and her forehead carl looked at his brothers right hand and saw that some of the womans hair was still caught in his nails i just lost it man said ron i dont know what happened she brought me back here and we was drinking fooling around we head for the bedroom and i try to get it on and next thing shes pushing me away calling me an animal we started fighting she ran to the bathroom and then i was just pushing her against the wall and i couldnt stop he began to cry i couldnt stop carlie i couldnt stop it was carls finest moment he told his brother to go find some rubber gloves and cleaning products anything that could help them clear the scene while ron wiped everything carl wrapped the woman in sheets then doublebagged her with black plastic garbage sacks using tape to bind her tight as a flys ass they washed everything down until the house was cleaner than it had ever been before then filled a suitcase with clothes makeup and what little jewelry they could find there wasnt much that could be done about the broken mirror so carl just removed the last pieces from the frame and put a small vanity mirror from the bedroom on the bathroom sink that way he hoped anyone who saw it would think that jeanne had broken the bathroom mirror herself and was content to use the vanity mirror until she got around to replacing it they put the suitcase and the body in the trunk of her car and drove down to their boat jeanne was loaded into the cabin and covered with a tarp and then carl parked her car on india street and walked back to rejoin his brother when they were half an hour out of port they weighted her body with carls old toolbox which they kept in the boat for emergencies and then dumped her overboard she was never seen again by any living person her body descending beneath the waves lost to the eyes of the world and watched only by the ghost of a boy for this was his place jeanne aiello was reported missing by her parents two days later but by then her car had already been found the cops were suspicious maybe because carl and ron had gone a little overboard with their cleaning leading the cops to wonder why a woman seemingly intent on heading off without telling anyone where she was going would clean her house so assiduously before she left but there was no body for them to examine and the description of the man with whom she had left the bar was so general that half the guys in portland could have filled the bill it looked as if carl and ron had managed to get away literally with murder but the relief was only temporary it pained carl to see the deterioration in his brother he stopped working started drinking more and began talking gibberish about the woods that was what frightened carl most the stuff about the forest his brother was spending more and more time in the woods he liked to hunt deer and before the cull in the island had been nearly overrun with them nobody objected much to folks shooting them and filling up their freezers with the meat although there was no way that ron and carl had a freezer big enough for all the dead meat ron had created in the woods but ron wasnt even hunting anymore he would just head out into the woods with a couple of sixpacks or a bottle of sour mash and when he returned he would be carrying on conversations that had clearly begun a long time before and were the continuation of some ongoing argument no i tell you i aint done it it werent my fault no no no you got to let me be now yhear he also stopped shaving and combing his hair because doing those things meant looking in mirrors and ron didnt like looking in mirrors anymore because rons reflection wasnt the only one he saw when he looked in the glass on the night that ron died carl had left him to go meet up with some people down at the rudder ron had seemed pretty lucid clearer at least than he had been in months hey little brother he said as carl headed for the door his brother was sitting slumped in an easy chair staring at the fire i been thinking i forced you to do a bad thing that night with the woman i shouldnt have made you get involved youre my brother said carl id do anything for you theyre gonna make me pay said ron i have to pay for what i done there are boundaries that youre not supposed to overstep they wont tolerate that so you have to pay who whos going to make you pay but ron didnt seem to hear him but i figure that if i pay maybe thatll be enough maybe they wont want no more maybe theyll leave you be but when carl tried to get more out of him ron had drifted off into a boozy sleep he remembered sitting at a table in the rudder not drinking much because he was so disturbed by his brothers words he heard the sound of the approaching chopper then someone came in and said that snowman that cop with the dumb name had been shot and that and then the guy had looked at carl and carl had known they said later that his brother had been shooting at the houses nearby that he was all fired up over some imaginary boundary dispute with his neighbors but carl never believed that was true ron wasnt shooting at houses when he died and the boundaries of which he spoke had nothing to do with hedges or lawns he was shooting at the things he imagined were speaking to him in the woods and it was the transgression of their boundaries that led to his death it was bullshit of course rons mind had just collapsed under the weight of his guilt but since then carl had kept well clear of the woods that surrounded his house sticking to the roads and the main paths whatever had tormented his brother might have been all in his head but carl recalled an incident a week or two back shortly after the fourth anniversary of rons death when he was out in the yard bringing in supplies from his truck and he looked out into the forest and saw someone watching him from among the trees carl didnt panic though instead he laid the brown paper bags down on the ground and never taking his eyes off the figure in the woods removed his shotgun from its case in the back of his truck he loaded it up with the truck shielding him then headed for the trees the figure was dressed all in gray and seemed to shimmer who are you asked carl as he drew closer and then the figure had exploded shards of it spreading in all directions into the trees into the sky along the ground and toward carl carl turned his face away and shielded himself with one arm he felt things striking him felt them moving as they did so when at last he lowered his arm there was nothing before him but darkness and trees but something was caught in the folds of his coat it fluttered and beat against him until he released it and allowed it to fly free it was a moth a gray moth somehow carl had managed to disturb a whole bunch of them in the trees that was the only excuse he could find even as he backed toward his truck and recalled the shape that they had somehow formed the shape of a woman that was all beside the point joe dupree the freak cop had killed carls brother and now there would be payback for what he had done for the chance of revenge carl was prepared to risk a trip into the woods after all he would not be going in alone carl looked at his watch hissed in irritation and returned to the engine of his truck the first boat piloted by scarfe came in sight of cray cove shortly before nine they could barely see the island through the wall of snow but scarfe knew what he was doing without him they would have run aground on rocks and drowned before they even came within sight of land despite the weather scarfe had enjoyed being in command of a boat again being on the sea was one of the things he had missed most while locked up scarfes father knew about boats and had passed on that knowledge to his son as soon as the diesel engine began to turn over and the vibrations commenced beneath his feet scarfe was at home under other circumstances he would have cranked the boat faster as soon as they were out on the bay instead he throttled down and kept a steady pace across the water in the face of the wind until at last they came to the jetty powell tied the boat up and with a hint of regret scarfe cut the engine he looked out on the silhouette of the island barely visible through the falling flakes and thought again that it was strange to see an outer island so thickly forested most of them boasted little more than sawgrass and burdock but sanctuary was different sanctuary had always been different the snow thought moloch was a mixed blessing the weather would keep other people indoors and permit them to move about with greater ease but there was now the risk of some of them getting separated and lost and if anyone did spot them they would have a hard time explaining why they were wandering around in a near blizzard yet as soon as he set foot on the island molochs fears seemed to dissipate images flashed through his mind pictures from his dreams and other less familiar thoughts he saw trails hidden from the eyes of others he recalled the names of trees and plants a great wave of understanding broke upon him i know this place i know it moloch gestured to dexter powell shepherd and scarfe inviting them to follow him tell said nothing willard just watched them quietly you stay here for now moloch told tell and willard watch the boat when we get back well need to leave fast then they moved away slowly fading into the gathering whiteness the water taxi was within sight of the island when leonie appeared at the boatmans shoulder the crossing had been rough and both she and braun were wet and cold their heads and shoulders sprinkled with snow how do you find your way in from here leonie asked the boatman shrugged the worst is past this is easy a child could do it truth is i could put this boat in anywhere along here dock is just as good a place as any he smiled and she smiled back she was a goodlooking woman it was nice to see a mixedrace couple happy together he thought he looked over to the little parking lot by the shelter expecting to see the shape of the police explorer but it wasnt there no call for it he supposed now that thorsons ferry was docked you folks are looking for a place to stay the motels over there he said pointing to his right the motel had four rooms and backed onto a slope that led down to the small rocky cove that gave the town its name if theres nobody around call over at the bar jeb burris owns both his house is just behind it leonie thanked him then added looks quiet yeah sure doesnt look like theres anyone around leonie stepped away raised her silenced pistol and shot the boatman in the head willard watched the group of men depart cray cove was a small inlet with a jetty made of rocks that jutted out a little from the shore it was secluded and willard could make out no lights on the shore a pathway led up from the stony beach and he could see flashlights dancing the only visible sign of the ascent to the road above during the crossing moloch had sat beside him and told him that he would not be joining them you dont trust me said willard moloch touched the younger mans shoulder im concerned about you thats all maybe youve been forced to do too much this last week i just want you to bring it down a couple of notches take a breather as for trust its tell i dont trust not you weve never worked with him before if things go wrong and he tries to leave without us you take him apart you hear willard nodded and moloch left him and returned to the wheelhouse willard wanted to believe him he wanted to believe him so badly he might have stifled his doubts too had it not been for dexter as dexter had disembarked he had glanced back at willard and willard had understood that as far as dexter was concerned it was the last time that they would look upon each other dexter had even smiled at him the five men were making slow progress on the track slipping on the newfallen snow and stumbling into one another dexter reached the top before the others followed closely by powell moloch shepherd and scarfe were some way behind it was dexter who saw the man first he was standing at the doorway of a small threestory tower with slit windows one gloved hand shielding his eyes so he could better see the lights of the approaching men dexters first impression was that the man was pulling a face at him taunting him but then dexter spotted the heavy lids the muted curiosity in the eyes the slight slackness at the jaw we got trouble said dexter richie claeson liked snow more than just about anything else in the world he thought about waking danny and asking him to come out with him but then he reconsidered danny was small and didnt know the woods like he did so richie dressed quietly then put on his boots his thick coat and his hat and gloves and headed out he didnt tell momma she was asleep in front of the tv and he didnt want to wake her anyway she would tell him no and he didnt want that he wanted to see the island in the snow but instead of heading directly through the forest he had stuck close by the road until he found himself upon the shore richie usually felt no threat from the woods and he was though he would never have been able to put it in such terms acutely sensitive to danger a consequence of his condition that had kept him safe from harm on those occasions when he was at risk from older boys or once while he was in portland with his mother and an old man had tried to entice him into an alleyway with the promise of discarded comic books he had smelled the threat the old man posed a stale scent of raddled discharges and unwashed clothing and had walked away keeping his head down his left side to the wall his eyes slightly to the right in case the man should choose to follow him the woods were different they were safe there was a presence in the woods although richie had long believed that he had no reason to be afraid of it the woods still smelled as woods should of pine and fallen leaves and animal spoor but there was a stillness to them a watchfulness that made him feel safe as if some stronger older being was watching over him just as mrs arbinot in the kindergarten had tried to look out for him before they took richie away from the other children and put him in the special school in portland he liked the special school he made friends there for the first time proper friends he even kissed a girl abbie and recalled with embarrassment the feelings that she had aroused in him and how he had halfshuffled away from her to disguise his growing discomfort but the woods had changed in recent times in the past richie had caught glimpses of the boy the one who stood at the waters edge staring out at the sea the boy who left no footprints on the wet sand richie had tried calling to him and waving but the boy never looked back and eventually richie had given up trying to talk to him sometimes he saw the boy in the woods but mostly the boy stayed by the shore and watched the waves break the boy didnt frighten richie though the boy was dead he just didnt want to leave the island and richie could understand that richie didnt want to leave the island either but the gray girl did frighten richie he had seen her only two or three times hanging in the air her feet not quite touching the ground her eyes like the backs of black beetles that had crawled into her head and nested in her sockets but she scared richie bad enough to make him piss his pants the gray girl was angry angry with everyone who lived because she wanted to be alive too the boy was waiting for something but the little gray girl didnt want to wait she wanted it now so richie had begun to stay away from the site where the woods were thickest and from the tall watchtower at the center of the island he used to like the big watchtower a lot from the top he could see for miles and miles and the wind would blow his hair and he could taste the sea on his tongue when he opened his mouth but that was the gray girls place now joe dupree came by to check on it and he would make sure that the door was locked but the gray girl didnt like it when the door was locked so she found ways to open it again the gray girl wanted the door open because if it was open then people might come in and if people came in and they werent too careful then they might get to play with the gray girl she was the worst but there were others too and the area around the tower and the cross belonged to them to go in there now would be like standing in front of a train the train wouldnt mean to hit you wouldnt have any intention of hurting you but if you got in its way it would kill you as it hurtled toward its destination that was what the woods now felt like to richie a dark tunnel with a train rushing through it ready to smash anything in its path but the shore was still safe and there were trees beneath which to shelter except tonight the snow had started to fall really heavily heavier than richie had ever seen it fall before and the wind had grown very strong and had blown the snow into richies eyes he had sought cover in one of the old observation towers a little one by the road hoping to wait out the bad weather then the boat had come he could barely make it out until it got close to shore but he heard the men as they reached land and suddenly he was afraid he wanted to go home he left the shelter of the tower just as the black man appeared and saw him tells voice brought willard back he could no longer perceive moloch and the others for they had now ascended the slope but he thought that he could still catch glimpses of their flashlight beams through the snow there was a pain in willards belly it made him want to curl up in a ball like a little child his eyes stung and he felt tears creep down his cheeks i said you want to stow these away willard wiped his face hurriedly as tell handed him a stack of life jackets he pointed to the storage chest at the stern of the little boat in there willard took the jackets in his arms then knelt down to store them behind him he heard tell rummaging in his pack then sensed the little man moving close behind him he looked over his shoulder and into the barrel of the pistol tells own gun a colt was still in his belt the gun in his hand was a oneshot silenced to hell and back no noise that was molochs instruction to tell no noise and no pain youre a crazy bastard you know that said tell you gave us all the fucking creeps willard didnt blink as the trigger was pulled hes a dummy said dexter powell looked at him what did you say the guys a dummy repeated dexter hes handicapped richie stood across the road from them but didnt move powell squinted against the snow and saw the mans face except now that he looked the man seemed younger more a kid than an adult but dexter was right the kid or man or whatever the hell he was was retarded what are we going to do with him asked powell take him back to the boat i guess said scarfe let tell keep an eye on him until we got to go then turn him loose he heard a scrabbling sound behind him and turned to see moloch hauling himself up the last stretch of trail with the aid of a sapling moloch looked at richie and richie stared back bad men said richie what did he say asked powell richie began to walk quickly away but they could hear him muttering to himself he recognized me said moloch the fuck could he do that dex said he was a dummy i dont know how tv maybe stop him dexter and powell began to move after him but the snow was thicker up here on the exposed road and they struggled and slipped as they tried to catch up with him hey wait up called dexter but richie kept his head down his face set determinedly it was the face he wore when other boys taunted him or tried to show him pictures of naked ladies it was the face he wore when he was afraid and trying not to cry bad men he whispered to himself badmenbadmenbadmen behind him he heard the black man swear loudly as he stumbled richie started to run carl lubey was beginning to panic he had tried everything he knew and there was still no sign of life from the truck as a last resort hed decided to change the battery he was lifting the spare from the back of the garage when the radio in the truck exploded into life almost deafening him with the last bars of freebird the radio was permanently tuned to the islands amateur station run by dickie norcross out of his attic except dickie broadcast only between the hours of two and six and it was now well past dickies goodbye time and that ones going out to all the folks on the island who are battening down the hatches for a hard night ahead said the disc jockeys voice it sounded strangely familiar to carl it wasnt dickie norcross not by a long shot dickie had a kind of highpitched voice and tended to limit his voiceovers to birthday greetings and obituaries this was a womans voice especially carl lubey over there in the deep dark forest whos having trouble with his truck aint ya carlie the voice was distorted as though the woman had just put her mouth right over the mike this ones for you carl said the voice and then the first bars of freebird commenced freebird his brothers favorite song its all freebird all night continued the dj and carl knew the voice recalled it from that night in the old port when his brother had leaned into little jeanne aiello as their voices rose in harmony over the sound of some piece of southernrock shit playing on the jukebox carl lubey grabbed a crowbar and smashed the radio with one blow sending the dead womans voice back into the void from which it had issued fuck said dexter the dummy was disappearing from sight even in his bright orange winter clothing he would soon be lost in the snow already he was little more than a blur among the falling snowflakes but for some reason he was staying away from the woods instead dexter could see him silhouetted against the cliff edge some forty feet above the water running with a strange awkward gait his elbows held rigid against his sides dexter drew his bow from his back and notched one of the heavy beman camo hunter arrows against the string the head was triangular with three blades extending out from the central point what are you doing dexter felt scarfes hand on his arm distracting him from the coldness of the arrow against his cheek get your hand off me man hes handicapped hes no threat to us i said get your hand off me do as he says it was moloch scarfes hand remained on the black mans arm for a second or two longer then fell away dexter aimed then released the arrow richie could no longer hear the men behind him maybe he was safe maybe they were letting him go he thought of his mother and began to cry his mother often told him that he wasnt a little kid anymore that he was a man and that men didnt cry but he was frightened and he wanted to be back at home back in his bed he wanted to be asleep he wanted richie felt a push at his back as if a great hand had shoved him forward and then a searing pain tore straight through the center of his being and erupted from his chest he staggered and looked down his fingertips brushed the blades as his mind tried to register what he was seeing it was an arrow in him through him hurt richie did a little pirouette on the tips of his toes then fell from the cliff into the waiting sea the circuit was completed and so it would begin as it had begun once before many years ago with the loss of a boy and the arrival of men upon the island sanctuarys long wait was over it was the beginning and the end all over the island the power failed and the lights went out and sanctuary was plunged into darkness carl lubey knocked his beer from the rickety table by his easy chair and cursed the blackness there was still a faint glow from the tv which was always left on but it was fading rapidly the thick drapes were drawn on all the windows as they always were because carl didnt like the thought of anybody peering inside and seeing his business he shuffled across the carpet barking his shin painfully against the table and then catching his foot on a cable and almost sending himself sprawling on the floor until his right hand found the switch on the wall and gave it a few futile flicks nothing not that hed expected anything to happen but carl was kind of an optimist at heart and liked to think that sometimes the easiest solution was the best to others especially those whod made the mistake of trusting carl to fix their siding or pave their driveways carl was a lazy cornercutting creep carl preferred optimist himself it had a nicer ring to it carl had gone inside to pour himself a stiff drink and then the lights had gone out the incident with the radio had unnerved him but the more he thought about it the more he figured it was one of the island assholes jerking him around he couldnt figure out who it might be or how they might have done it but it was the only explanation he could come up with now lost and disoriented in his own house he vowed revenge on whoever it was in the kitchen he found a flashlight but the batteries were dead he rummaged in the drawers until he came across a pack of candles and a box of matches he lit a candle and jammed it into the top of an empty beer bottle to keep the wax from dripping onto his hand carl heard a fluttering sound against the window then a shadow flew above him it was a moth excited by the light from the candle carl watched it until it came to rest briefly on the kitchen sink it was a big bastard its long body dotted with small yellow orbs the moth had no right to be in carls kitchen hell it had no right to be alive at all now that winter had come he was so rattled that he failed to connect it with the moths he had glimpsed in the forest the week before the moths that had briefly assumed the shape of a woman instead carl crushed the insect with the base of the empty beer bottle the fuse box was in the basement along with a bunch of spare fuses mind it could be something as simple as the main switch tripping after all carl had wired the place up himself and sometimes like on the odd occasion when he decided to take a proper shower the act of turning on the water would cause every light in the place to switch off as well as the refrigerator shit thought carl he had the best part of half a cow in the freezer in his basement and he didnt want to take the chance of his winter feed turning to maggot food if the cold spell broke he raised the candle and headed toward the basement he had almost reached the door when he heard the noises coming from below they were soft hardly there at all as though someone was moving very slowly and carefully through the accumulation of garbage and stolen goods that carl kept stored down there there was somebody in his basement maybe the same somebody who had caused the switches to trip plunging carl into darkness so hed be easier to subdue carl had no idea who that someone might be but he wasnt taking any chances he drew the browning from his belt and opened the basement door macy was about a tenminute ride from carl lubeys house when her engine failed she stopped the explorer and stepped out onto the road the snowflakes gathering on her hair all that was visible to her were the snow and the shapes of the trees around her she got back into the vehicle and tried the radio but there was no response no static no crackle nothing she turned the key in the ignition and received only a click in return then banged her hands impotently against the wheel before resting her forehead against the plastic she had three choices she could stay here which was hardly a choice at all she could head back toward town and try to hook up with dupree or she could keep going toward lubeys house and check him out just as dupree had asked her to do and then use his phone to call for help or get him to tow her back to town with his truck she got out again took a flashlight and an emergency pack from the trunk and began walking in the direction of lubeys place carl lubey opened the basement door toward him keeping away from the exposed opening there was no other way into or out of the basement and only two small windows in the walls neither of which was large enough to admit anything bigger than a small child in any case both of those windows were firmly locked to prevent rodents or forest mammals from making their home in carls basement there was now silence below he wondered if it might have been his imagination or the occasional shifting of materials that occurs in such spaces a consequence of drafts and rot carl took a breath and registered for the first time the stink in the room it was a dense damp smell like stale seawater something else hung behind it something more unpleasant a kind of stagnancy and carl was reminded of the time he and ron had found a dead seal on the beach bloated and rotten carl hadnt been able to eat for two days afterward because the stench of the dead seal seemed to cling to his skin and the insides of his nostrils it made no sense to carl it was snowing outside and the days preceding had been fiercely cold nothing decayed in this cold even carls beef might survive a couple of days if the weather held out but the smell was there he was sure of it it trickled into the hallway now and began to adhere to his clothes but it was definitely coming from the basement maybe the pipes had burst down there soaking the stacked newspapers and cardboard boxes even his brothers old clothes the ones carl hadnt had the heart to get rid of carl stepped through the doorway the candle illuminated the wooden stairs leading down into the basement and cast a faint glow into the sunken room itself he heard the first step creak beneath his feet as he moved forward the circle of light from the candle expanding as he advanced catching the whitewashed walls the shelves stacked with paints and tools the boxes piled on top of one another the more valuable itemsa couple of portable tvs some toasters and vcrsoff to one side draped with a tarp there was movement there carl was sure of it hey you down there come out now i can see you no point in hiding the figure retreated back into the shadows beneath the steps come on now carl repeated he tried to catch a glimpse of the shape through the slats of the stairs i wont hurt you but youre making me real nervous come out or i dont know what i might do carl moved down two more steps and the basement door slammed closed behind him he turned and felt his feet slide out from under him for a moment he teetered on the very edge of the step then his balance failed him and he tumbled down the remaining stairs as he fell his thought was hands i felt hands on my legs scarfe stared hard at dexter but kept his mouth closed until the big man spoke to him you got something to say asked dexter we could have taken him alive you think i could barely see the fucking guy to take the shot if i hadnt taken it wed have lost him you didnt have to kill him dexter looked to moloch to intervene but moloch was already moving past them following the road as it sloped down the road at his right and the sound of the sea to his left listen said dexter to scarfe i got six more arrows you keep fucking with me and one of them might just have your name on it youre forgetting something whats that scarfe was red with cold and righteous indignation it made him forget how much dexter frightened him im not a dummy running away from you he said youll find me a little harder to kill dexter sprang for scarfe but the smaller man was too fast for him he slipped past dexter drawing his gun as he did so within seconds dexter was staring down the barrel of the glock the gun was shaking in scarfes hand you done fucked up now said dexter youre the one with a gun aimed at him then you better use it pussy boy or else im going to kill you scarfe heard movement behind him and the sound of a hammer cocking let it go said moloch both of you let it go scarfe lowered his gun dexter made a move for him but powell reached out and held him back by extending his forearm in front of his chest i wont forget that said dexter scarfe his burst of adrenaline receding backed away shepherd who had stayed quiet throughout followed moloch to the edge of the forest he should be here he said lubey should be here its the weather said moloch its just delayed him he called to scarfe but scarfe wasnt looking at him instead he was staring down at the sea below hey he said softly yet there was something in his tone that made moloch and the others approach him even causing dexter to forget his animosity in order to follow his gaze hey repeated scarfe the guy hes still alive carl lubey lay on his back among the newspapers and the fallen boxes slowly coming to his head ached he didnt know how long he had been out but he guessed it had been no more than a minute or two there was light coming from somewhere close by and an acrid smell burning he turned his head and saw the flames licking at the newspapers beneath the basement stairs carl tried to raise himself but there was a weight across his chest and he couldnt feel his legs he reached out and encountered no obstacle merely a coldness in the air that chilled his fingers despite the growing heat the flames were licking against the back wall devouring paper and clothing and old suitcases soon they would reach the shelves of paints and spirits carl saw more flames flicker in the darkness to his left he couldnt figure out how the fire had spread over there because it was as far away as you could get from the conflagration over by the far wall yet he could clearly discern flares of light close to the floor they were slowly moving toward him but they werent increasing in size and he could feel no warmth instead they seemed to hang in midair like sparks carried on a breeze and suddenly carl understood that what he was looking at was not fire but the reflection of fire caught in shards of mirror that were now drawing closer and closer to him the smell of dead fish and rotting seaweed growing stronger filling his nostrils with the stench of decay a womans ruined face emerged from the shadows and carl opened his mouth as the flames reached the paint and turpentine on the shelves and his final agony was lost in a great roar chapter thirteen dupree leaned back in his chair and stretched chair and bones alike made cracking noises so he stopped in midextension and carefully eased himself back toward the desk if he broke the chair he would have to requisition another and that would mean dealing with the jibes because the wiseasses in supplies would assumecorrectlythat his great bulk had taken out the item of furniture in question in the end it would be easier for everyone if he just bought his own damn chair he checked his watch and shuffled his completed paperwork to one side of the desk none of it had been very urgent but he had allowed untyped reports to pile up these last few weeks and the blizzard had given him an excuse to remain at the station house and catch up on the mundane details of speeding offenses duis and minor fender benders the reports had also allowed him to forget for a while his worries about the island the time spent immersed in the routines of daytoday life had enabled him to put those concerns into perspective when macy returned he would take a drive over to mariannes house and make sure she was okay he wanted to know why she had been in such a rush to get back to portland and enough time had elapsed since the arrival of the water taxi to make it look as if he wasnt checking up on her too closely it might have been something to do with danny but if danny was really sick then marianne would have been in touch with him to arrange emergency transportation all in all it was a puzzler he heard the main station door open and footsteps in the reception area dupree had asked headquarters to consider putting in a counter to section off the office from the public area but so far nothing had been done it wasnt a big deal at this time of year but during the summer when the incidence of petty thefts lost children and stolen bicycles took a sudden sharp rise there could be up to a half dozen people crowding around the office door he left his desk and stepped out into reception to his right a pretty black woman with an afro was running the fingers of her left hand along the side of engine she wore a hooded waterproof jacket and blue jeans tucked into shinhigh boots the fake fur lining of her hood was spangled with melting snow can i help you maam the woman looked at him and her eyes widened my arent you the big one said leonie dupree didnt react like i said can i help you with something maam sure baby you can help me she said she turned away from the engine and he saw the silenced pistol in her hand you can help me by taking the thumb and middle finger of your left hand and lifting that gun from your holster you think you can do that dupree caught movement to her right as a man appeared from the shadows behind the fire trucks he was redhaired and wrapped up tightly against the cold in a padded blue coat but dupree could see that he was a big man even without the padding he too had a gun in his hand the silencer like a swollen tumor at its muzzle and it was also pointing in duprees direction now said braun do it slowly dupree moved his hand to his holster flipped the clasp and drew the gun out using his thumb and middle finger as he had been told the two strangers didnt tense as he performed the action and he felt his heart sink he had only read about people like this in newspapers and internal memoranda they were killers real stonecold killers lay it down on the floor then kick it toward me said the man dupree did as he was told the man stopped the gun with his foot as it reached him beside him the woman closed the door to the station house and turned the lock who are you asked dupree doesnt matter said braun tell me where your partner is at i dont know dont fuck with me shes out on patrol i dont know where she is exactly call her the man and woman moved in unison keeping the same distance from each other as they advanced on dupree in a tentotwo position shes out of radio contact braun fired his gun aiming to duprees left the shot blew a hole in the computer screen on the desk behind him why would you think im fucking with you andre i want you to call her and bring her in dupree didnt know if the radio was still out but he had no plans to use it even if it was functioning again macy would be no match for these people if he brought her back here the way things were looking he was no match for them himself i cant do that said dupree you mean you wont do it comes down to the same thing why are you doing this braun smiled regretfully you shouldnt have fucked his wife he said he raised his gun and sighted down the barrel you really shouldnt have fucked his wife then without warning the lights went out doug newton was sitting downstairs in his favorite chair when the power died his first reaction was that of most people on the island he reached for a flashlight so he could check the fuse box when the flashlight wouldnt work he went scouting for candles eventually finding a pack of tea lights behind the spare bulbs in the kitchen cabinet he dropped a tea light in an ashtray lit it then took a second candle and placed it on a saucer his mother would be frightened if she woke and found that her tv wasnt working she liked the light from the tube found it comforting her greatest fear doug believed was that she might be alone when she died and she would rather die with nick at nite than nobody at all doug had just begun to climb the stairs when the candles flickered slightly and he felt the blast of cold air a window was open at the same instant a shuffling sound came from above then a tapping that sounded like small bare feet running on boards finally he heard his mother cry out doug knew that the cops with the possible exception of joe dupree hadnt believed him when hed told them about the little girl hell doug wasnt too sure that he believed it himself but hed seen it and he was pretty certain his mother had seen it too although she later convinced herself that it was just a dream ever since then as he had admitted to dupree doug had kept a pistol by his bedside and a loaded shotgun beside the hat stand in the hallway he put the two tea lights down on the hall table and picked up the shotgun light filtered through the small square window at the first landing as he ascended the stairs but he didnt really need it doug knew this house hed been born here lived here and would die here if he had his way his mothers room was the second on the right the door was slightly ajar as it always was and doug thought that he could see shadows moving against the wall from inside came the sounds of thrashing and what might have been his mother softly whimpering doug hit the door at a run the shotgun at his shoulder the sheets had been thrown back from his mothers bed and lay piled on the floor snow was blowing in through the open window the flakes billowing and colliding with one another before falling gently on the carpet the gray girl crouched over dougs mother her mouth pressed against the old womans lips while his mothers thin arms and skeletal hands pushed at her trying to force her away her hands caught in the folds of the gray girls gown which appeared to move independently of the limbs it concealed it seemed to be part of the girl as though her body had fused with the shroud in which she had been interred creating a new skin that hung over her arms like wings as doug entered the gray girl disengaged herself from his mother and swiveled her head in the direction of the intruder he saw then that she was old desperately old a child in form only her hair blond from a distance was now clearly silverwhite her cheeks were sunken and doug perceived bone protruding through the parched skin below her eyes which were entirely black her mouth was strangely rounded and doug was reminded of a lamprey a creature designed by nature to adhere to another creature and draw the life from it beneath the girl he saw his mothers face her lips trembling and tears falling from her face her breathing was barely audible and as doug moved toward the bed the light faded from her eyes and he heard the rattle in her throat as she died the gray girl hissed at doug and he saw the rage in her black eyes at what doug had done the distraction of his presence depriving her of that which she sought her hand reached out her fingers little more than bone wrapped in tattered parchment and doug fired the force of the blast blew the gray girl from the bed and tossed her against the wall she rolled when she hit the floor then rose up again and stood before him framed by the window the shot had torn holes through her gown and the skin beneath but no blood came and there was only a smear of gray tissue where she had struck the wall she stood and regarded doug with a malevolence that made him want to run and hide to curl himself up into a ball in a closet until she went away for an instant doug pictured himself cocooned listening in the darkness then hearing the pad of those feet as they approached and halted before his hiding place the door being drawn slowly open as doug fired again and the gray child disintegrated into a cloud of moths the room was filled with snowflakes and insects and broken glass and the sound of doug newton crying for his dead mother and for himself nancy tooker was descending warily to the kitchen to get some food for her sister and the dogs when the lights went out she was a big woman as officer berman had not failed to notice and once she missed her step there was no way that she could keep her balance she tumbled awkwardly down the stairs striking the slate floor hard with her head and coming to rest with a sigh her sister cried out her name then used both the wall and the stair rail to support herself as she descended to nancys side after a moments hesitation the dogs followed there was blood flowing from a wound in nancys head a shard of bone had broken through the skin of her left arm and her left ankle was clearly broken her breathing was very shallow and linda feared that her sister had done herself some internal damage that only a hospital could ascertain she went to dial the station house number but the line was dead she switched the phone off powered it up then tried again but there was still no tone linda ran to the living room where she removed the cushions from the armchairs and couches and did her best to make her sister comfortable she was afraid to move her and wasnt sure that she could have even if shed wanted to for linda was sixty or seventy pounds lighter than her sister instead she gingerly raised nancys head and slipped a cushion beneath it then tried to do the same for her arm and ankle during the whole operation nancy moaned softly only once when linda placed a pair of cushions beneath her leg that worried linda more than anything else because moving that leg should have hurt nancy like a bitch she went to the hall closet and removed all the coats she could find then laid them across her sister to keep her warm their nearest neighbors were the newtons just on the other side of fern avenue if she could get to them she could use their phone assuming that the problem with the phones hadnt affected the whole island she didnt want to think about what might happen to nancy if that were the case someone would just have to drive over to joe dupree and tell him what had happened so he could call for help from the mainland she leaned in close to her sister stroked her hair from her eyes and whispered to her nancy im going to go for help i wont be gone but five minutes linda kissed her sisters brow it was clammy and hot she stood and shrugged on her own overcoat at her feet the dogs began to turn in circles alternately barking and whining no you dumb mutts this isnt a walk but the dogs werent following her to the door instead they were moving back from it max the german shepherd went down on his front paws his tail between his legs and began to growl something of their fear returned to linda as she looked back at them the hell is wrong with you both she asked she opened the front door and the gray girl pounced for a moment there was confusion in the station house the blinds had been drawn in duprees office and the heavy cloud cover meant that there was no moonlight with the loss of the street lamps the small station house was suddenly plunged into darkness the suppressed guns spat softly but dupree was already moving braun and leonie heard a door opening in the farrighthand corner of the office both fired toward the sound go around said leonie dont let him get into the woods braun ran into the street then hung a left and made for the rear of the station silently leonie advanced toward the back room her night vision was already improving and she could see the shape of the doorway ahead of her she stopped to the right of the frame and listened there was no sound from inside leonie crouched down and risked a glance inside she saw a big water tank with a small generator behind it oilskins were hanging from hooks on the wall there were two lockers one of them open beyond them the back door stood ajar and snow was already beginning to cover the floor leonie moved slowly into the room to her right was a narrow gap between the tank and the wall the open mouth of a pipe was visible in the gap leonie paused for a moment and the pipe belched fire she heard the bellow of the shotgun as her being ignited in pain and then a voice was calling her name braun it was braun she tried to speak but no words would form she felt herself sliding down the wall bra there was blood in her mouth br the monstrous form of the giant emerged from the shadows in the corner of the room the very darkness come to life there came the sound of another load being jacked but already she knew that he would have no call for it leonies fingers brushed the gun upon the floor beside her and she was no longer dying in an alien place she was a young girl walking across a patch of waste ground the revolver like a warm hand upon her belly spreading tendrils of heat through her body and filling her with pleasure and power she felt a great pressure build inside her pain and remembrance intertwining like lovers in her mind her lips parted in a kind of ecstasy and her eyes closed as the life left her body her final breath briefly catching in her throat before at last it found its release braun was almost at the corner when he heard the shotgun blast ahead of him he could see the open back door of the station house there were no footprints in the snow leonie he cried out instinctively there was no reply braun looked toward the forest the big cop could be anywhere inside the station house if he approached the doorway braun would make an easy target he retreated instead making his way in a wide arc into the trees at the back of the station he moved as quietly as he could the snow muffling his footfalls the doorway was empty but it was dark inside and he could see no movement within then the reinforced steel door closed suddenly propelled shut by the force of duprees shoe and braun swore loudly he couldnt leave the cop alive in there he would call for help and next thing he knew there would be a blue army arriving on the island braun prepared to move just as a noise came from close by he spun rapidly his back to the station house there was something big in the trees a deer perhaps or maybe the rookie had come back and was already behind him the sound came again but this time it was far to his right his first thought was that whatever it was it was moving quickly but that was swiftly followed by the realization that nothing could move that fast through the woods he would have heard branches rustling twigs snapping even in the snow now there was more than one and the disturbances seemed to be coming from above his head as though some great bird were flying unseen through the trees braun rose and started moving backward trying to keep both the woods and the station house in sight his gun panning across the trees there were figures moving in the darkness they were gray seemingly iridescent like moonlight shining on the fur of animals and they glided across the snow or flitted through the gaps between the branches of the evergreens then one of the shapes seemed to halt and he caught a glimpse of gray skin and a reflection of himself in a dark pupil and teeth rotting yellow teeth what the fuck the gray shape curled in on itself like paper crumpled in a fist then moved swiftly toward him braun started firing but the thing kept on coming braun staggered out of the cover of the woods and turned to see joe dupree leaning against the wall of the station the shotgun at his shoulder he dove to the ground as the shotgun bucked in duprees hands bark and splinters exploded from the tree trunk above brauns head he heard a second shot and felt a pull at his left arm he looked down to see blood above his elbow and part of his forearm reduced to red meat by the blast a searing white heat began to burn its way through his upper body braun staggered into the forest and the gray shapes followed linda tooker wasnt a particularly fast mover even during rush hour in the diner which never numbered more than a dozen people yet still put the sisters under pressure she served at a slower pace than her sister cooked which meant lukewarm sandwiches and cool soup for everyone yet in the instant after she registered the approaching figureits tattered skin its black eyes its mouth like a sucking woundshe reacted faster than she had since high school she slammed the door in the gray girls face and felt the wood strike her but the gap wouldnt close she looked to her right and saw the childs fingers caught between the door and the frame the nails were sharp and yellowed and there was no flesh on the bones they looked like twigs wrapped in burnt paper delicate enough to be snapped off by a heavy door except the fingers werent snapping they were gripping linda felt her feet begin to slide on the floor as the door was pushed inward thats not possible she thought no child could be so strong there must be someone else out there someone helping her then a second hand materialized in the growing breach this time braced against the frame and the gray girls face appeared her black eyes focused not on linda but on her sister no shouted linda she jammed her right foot against the last stair placed her forearm against the door and swung her fisted right hand with all her force into the childs face she heard bone crack as the blow struck and the childs head rocked slightly then it was back in the opening again the gray skin open across the nose to reveal the dirty bone beneath the punch appeared only to have angered her increasing her strength for she pushed with renewed force lindas legs giving way the gap now almost big enough to permit the childs whole body to enter linda heard herself sob as her strength failed and the door opened wide a dark blur shot by her from the hallway and she felt the dogs fur brush against her shoulder as max leaped and struck the gray girl his jaws tearing at her throat as his weight knocked her away from the doorway linda slammed the door shut behind them locking and bolting it then sliding down its length until she came to rest on the floor the collie claude began to scratch at the door trying to reach its companion from outside she heard scuffling noises in the snow and maxs growls then the dog howled sharply once and all was quiet chapter fourteen the five men stood on the edge of the shallow cliff the stony beach some forty feet below them and stared at the figure that stood amid the waves its features could not be distinguished but there was no mistaking the arrow that pierced its torso it remained still despite the force of the water rolling in from behind to its right was a rocky outcrop blocking the pierced man from the view of tell and willard on the boat no way said dexter no fucking way ive taken a black bear with one of those arrows theres no way he can still be alive moloch regarded the sea in silence then turned to shepherd go down there and finish him shepherd shook his gray head once not me he said no i dont think you heard me correctly you seem to have turned an order into a request shepherd remained impassive he had been watching moloch carefully throughout the boat journey growing more and more troubled by what he was seeing and in the short time since their arrival on the island his concerns had only increased he had seen molochs eyes glaze over when nobody was looking his lips moving forming unspoken words during the ascent of the slope moloch had slipped more times than any of the others and his eyes seemed to be focused less on the climb than on the thin scrub and brush that had found purchase among the rocks when they had reached the top it had taken dexter to alert him to the presence of the retarded man moloch had not been looking at the tower or at the man in the bright orange vest his gaze was fixed on the woods and his lips were moving again this time shepherd could distinguish words and phrases we move on did they tell you to keep watch for me i told you id return the last was repeated again and again over and over like a mantra i told you id return i told you id return i told you like i just told you not me shepherd said he didnt break eye contact with moloch but he was aware of the gun in the other mans hand throughout their confrontation shepherds own hand rested lazily against the folding stock of the mossberg persuader that hung from a leather strap on his shoulder he had jacked a load as soon as theyd landed and his finger was inches from the trigger shepherd did not know what would happen if he was forced to kill moloch he guessed that he would have to take out dexter too powell could go either way he figured scarfe didnt concern him scarfe just wanted to get out of this alive moloch considered the other man carefully then seemed to reach a decision this once he said shepherd nodded and moloch turned to powell dexter shepherd noticed had notched another arrow on his bow during the standoff shepherd wondered if it had been meant for him we may yet find out he thought you do it then follow moloch told powell shit said powell gesturing at dexter it was this asshole couldnt kill him and now i got to go down there dexter didnt react to the taunt in the space of a couple of minutes four white men had managed to get in his face each one in a different way scarfe had laid a hand on him powell had insulted him shepherd had almost forced dexter to kill him and a retarded man with an arrow through his chest simply refused to die faced with so many possible targets dexters wrath had simply diffused briefly leaving him more puzzled than angry just do it moloch told powell and quietly powell sighed theatrically and removed his gun from its holster he rummaged in the pockets of his jacket until he found the suppressor then attached it to the muzzle molochs insistence on silence puzzled him there was nobody out here to hear a shot and anyway even if someone was outside the wind and snow would muffle any noise still powell wasnt about to argue with moloch like shepherd he found molochs behavior peculiar but he wasnt going to risk taking a bullet in order to point it out how will i find you when im done theres a path through the forest youll pick it up behind the tower stay on it and it will lead you straight to us for now we move on when he said the words he looked puzzled we move on shepherd said nothing but his finger found the trigger guard of the mossberg and remained there were not waiting for carl lubey asked scarfe hes not here and i want to get off the road and out of sight said moloch in case you hadnt noticed were on a tight schedule well make for his place and take it from there theres a snowstorm blowing said scarfe and you dont know the island youre wrong said moloch i know this island very well scarfe shook his head in disbelief and looked to the other men for support but they were already preparing to follow their leader powell meanwhile shot dexter a look of disgust then began to descend the rocks toward the beach scarfe watched him go until dexter grasped his arm by my reckoning pussy he said you got no lives left dexter released him and spit once into the snow by scarfes foot scarfe shot one last look at the figure that stood among the waves before adjusting his pack on his shoulder and following moloch shepherd and dexter across the white road that skirted the woods he expected moloch to stop and look at a map or check a compass but instead he moved purposefully into the trees within minutes the four men were heading for the center of the island on an old trail that wound its way through the forest while they walked scarfe unfolded his map from his pocket and tried to read it hampered by darkness and snow and wind it was a struggle but he eventually confirmed what he had suspected from the moment they had found the trail it wasnt detailed on the map somehow moloch had found an unmarked path moloch drifted sometimes he was beside dexter moving through a white forest the snow melting on his face and hair at other times there was no snow just a harsh wind and frost upon the ground and there were other men around him dressed in furs and handstitched hides eventually the two worlds began to coexist like transparencies laid one upon the other and he was both moloch and someone else a man at once known and unknown moloch was confused but not frightened by the sensation for what he felt more than anything else was a sense of belonging a feeling of returning this was not home this was not a place of solace or comfort there was no shelter for him here but it was the beginning here moloch or whatever he truly was had flamed into being whatever else might happen here he would at last reach an understanding of himself and those torn pictures that had tormented him in so many dreams would reform themselves enabling him to see himself as he truly was he was coming to recognize that all this was meant to be his wife was always going to flee here and he was always going to follow men would come with him for men had come with him before because that was the way it had always been it had been taken out of his hands and all that he could do was follow the path to its end and to the final revelation that awaited him it took powell only minutes to half climb half slide his way down the slope to the rocky beach when he reached the bottom he was breathing heavily and his hands stung from the cold his finger was almost numb as he inserted it beneath the trigger guard he advanced to the shoreline and raised the gun resting its barrel against his forearm the man with the arrow through his torso stood in the water the sea was just below the level of his chest but the waves that billowed against him had no effect he remained entirely still his orange jacket glowing luminously in the faint light that somehow contrived to penetrate the dense clouds above powell could even see the point of the arrow gleaming just above the water hes dead thought powell hes dead but hes just too dumb to realize it hes like a dinosaur waiting for the message to penetrate to his brain well ill help it along ive got an express delivery for him going straight to his head powell sighted then squeezed off two shots in quick succession and watched in satisfaction as twin puffs of red sprang from the breast of the figure among the waves the man didnt fall powell lowered the gun and waited it appeared to him that the injured man had drawn closer to the shore it looked like he had moved forward a clear five feet or more as the water was now approaching the level of his navel powell took aim again and emptied the clip into the injured man he thought he saw him buck slightly at the impact of the bullets but that was the only sign powell got that he had struck home he ejected the empty clip replaced it then advanced into the sea the cold was intense but he shrugged it away instead he concentrated on the head of the man moving toward him steadily despite the waves and with every step he took he fired a shot the last one struck the top of the guys head when powell was barely five feet away his chin lay against his chest and no movement came from him powell could see the wounds left by the bullets could even see something white glistening through a hole in the mans skull hes dead now powell told himself theres something holding him in placesoft sand maybe or rocks or even the remains of a boatbut hes dead for sure whatever is anchoring him there it sure as hell isnt free will at that moment powell became aware of a presence to his rear he looked back to see a boy watching him from the shore the boys clothing looked dated and the waves worshiped at his bare feet his skin was pale and he held his hand to his throat as if remembering some ancient hurt powell was about to speak to him when the dead man in the sea raised his head a sharp clicking noise in his throat alerting the gunman to the movement powell slowly turned to face him then rocked back on his heels trying to steady himself against the twin impacts of shock and water it was the dummy but not the dummy the distortion in his facethe drooping mouth the toowide eyes the sheer strangeness of his features compositionwas now gone and the man before him was well handsome and his eyes gleamed with newfound intelligence powell fumbled for a new clip but the coldness and the damp caused his fingers to betray him and the clip slipped from his grasp and dropped into the sea with a soft splash he looked down to follow its progress then raised his eyes in time to see a huge wave rising up behind the dead man who stood before him it lifted him off his feet and propelled him at speed toward powell his body riding the crest carried forward like a piece of driftwood before it slammed into the gunman powell screamed as he felt the point of the arrow enter his chest the dead mans arms enveloping him his face pressed hard against powells his mouth twisted into a smile the wave broke over them and they disappeared beneath the sea carl lubeys home was already engulfed in flames by the time macy reached it she had seen the smoke rising and had smelled it on the wind which caused her to speed up her progress toward the house she made a couple of halfhearted efforts to get close to the front door then gave up as the heat forced her back her main concern was the possibility that the fire might reach the forest but lubey had cleared his land of trees in order to allow space for his garden thereby creating a natural firebreak with luck the break combined with the heavily falling snow would be enough to contain the conflagration but somebody needed to be told about it just in case macy took the radio from her belt and tried for the third time since shed left her vehicle to raise someone on the system on the first two occasions the radio had been dead clicking emptily just like the ignition in the car now as she stood within sight of lubeys burning home she could hear static she brought the handset close to her mouth and spoke this is macy do you read me over she tried again using her call sign this is sixnineone over static nothing more she was about to replace the handset when its tone changed slowly she raised the radio to her ear and listened it wasnt static now perhaps it had never been it seemed to her that what she was hearing was an irregular hissing sound like someone constantly adjusting escaping gas she listened harder and thought she distinguished patterns and pauses a kind of cadence not static and not hissing but whispers at the edge of the forest moloch and his men watched the sky glow above the tips of the trees their flashlights were dead and now as they paused before the distant conflagration dexter took the opportunity to change the batteries using the spares in his pack nothing happened the flashlight remained dark those batteries were fresh from the store said dexter scarfe tried changing the batteries in his own flashlight and found that it too remained dead bad batch he said looks like were shit out of luck he took his zippo from the pocket of his jacket lit it then held it close to the map his finger pointed to details i figure were here best i can reckon it carls house is over there he raised his hand and pointed toward the flames since his place is the only one in that section of the island that means dexter finished the sentence for him that either we got a forest fire which dont seem likely or right now lubeys house is just about the warmest place to be on this island explains why he didnt make it to the rendezvous a mans likely to be distracted if his house is burning down around his ears people will come said scarfe the cops run the fire department dupree will be here soon i dont think so said moloch interrupting for the first time he regarded scarfe for a moment until the smaller mans mouth gaped in understanding and he looked away moloch traced his finger across the woods on the map we keep going then take a look at whats going on from cover we need lubeys truck if were going to get out of here ahead of the cops the fire will be our marker dupree was looking to the east where a faint red glow hovered above the trees larry amerling stood beside him the old postmasters house was nearest the station and he had heard the gunfire dupree had almost turned his gun on him for braun had headed into the forest only moments before and dupree had been about to follow him when the postmaster had intervened amerling took a look at the body of the woman in the generator room he emerged pale and gulping cold air we need to get some men over to that fire said dupree but theres at least one armed man out there and probably more why do you say that something he told me before the lights went out i want you to go and get frank macomber and as many of the fire crew as you can round up the phones are out so youll have to do it doortodoor make sure frank brings a gun then i want you to come back here and try to contact someone on the radio if you dont get any results within the next half hour then start sending up distress flares from the dock we need to keep people indoors and off the streets as well already dupree could see some of those who lived off island avenue approaching the station house to inquire about the power cuts among them was big earl kruhm who had a good head on his shoulders earl can take care of that said amerling nobodys going to argue with him talk to him said dupree make sure he understands that folks could be in danger if they dont stay indoors it shouldnt be too hard to convince them what with the blizzard and all and larry tell frank and the firemen to stay out of the forest as much as they can you hear make sure they keep to the trails amerling nodded and went to get his car he came back minutes later just as dupree was filling his pockets with shotgun shells joe my car wont start its dead dupree looked at him almost in irritation then took the keys to engine from a hook in his office and tried to start the truck it turned over with a click no radios no phones no cars no power he said no help said amerling its begun hasnt it i guess so i felt it out at the site but i didnt tell you i dont know why i guess i didnt want to worry you amerling managed a twisted smile wouldnt have made a difference anyway but thanks for sparing my feelings macys out there said dupree she was headed for carl lubeys place before that fire started he felt a rush of concern for the young woman he hoped that she hadnt taken it into her head to do something stupid when shed seen the fire at least she didnt seem like the type for futile heroics he put out of his mind the terrible possibility that the fire and macy might be connected and that she might be hurt or worse we stick to the plan he told amerling go doortodoor theyre going to have to head for that fire on foot and do what they can once they get there he hefted the shotgun onto his shoulder and started for the door where are you going im going after the dead womans partner after that im heading for marianne elliots place i think shes in serious trouble amerling watched him go but he didnt say what was on his mind i think were all in serious trouble time melted scarfe felt it more acutely than the rest they should have been at lubeys house by now but instead they were still walking through the woods and the glow of the fire was no longer always visible to them even moloch seemed to realize it he paused and stared around him momentarily confused were lost said scarfe no said moloch were still on the trail then the path is going in circles powell should have caught up by now said dexter moloch nodded head back down the trail see if hes on his way dexter left at speed and moloch drew the map from inside his jacket scarfe after a moments hesitation joined him in examining it while shepherd leaned against a tree and said nothing we got on the trail about here said scarfe indicating with a finger and lubeys place is here thats fifteen minutes on a good day twenty or more in weather like this it has to be close maybe we passed it but when they looked up the light from the fire was still ahead of them makes no sense said scarfe he looked to shepherd for support but shepherd was not looking at him he was staring into the forest his hands shielding his eyes moloch called his name i thought i saw something said shepherd out there he pointed into the depths of the woods scarfe squinted but could see nothing the snow was blowing in his face making it difficult to distinguish even the shapes of the more distant trees he could smell smoke though its the fire he said maybe you saw smoke no thought shepherd not smoke he was about to say more when dexter returned from his brief reconnaissance theres no sign of him he told moloch moloch kicked at the newly fallen snow if hes lost hell find his way back to the boat if hes lost echoed dexter you think a dummy with an arrow through him took him fuck him if he got washed away so much more money for the rest of you we keep going they shouldered their weapons and followed moloch deeper into the forest chapter fifteen marianne was still shaken by her encounter with the new female cop she had been afraid that the woman would make her follow her to the station house that something in her face or behavior had revealed the truth of her situation she could see it in the cops face why else would she have come after her she knows im running she knows ive been bad shell make me go with her and ill break down and tell them everything and theyll take danny away and ill go to jail for stealing the money and marianne forced herself to stay calm she fumbled with the car key a couple of times before she managed to fit it into the ignition and watched in the mirror as the cop seemed to pause and consider her once again then the key clicked into place and the engine purred into life marianne was maybe a little too heavy on the gas as she drove away but the cop appeared content to let her go she relaxed a little when she saw the explorer move down toward the ferry until the enormity of the situation she was dealing with came back to her and she gripped the wheel so tightly that the veins stood out on her hands the knuckles blanching beneath the skin she had been so distracted these last few days that she hadnt bothered to watch anything on tv except light comedies and her absence from the market meant that she hadnt picked up a newspaper since the previous weekend something terrible had happened and now he was free because he would not allow others to punish her on his behalf no he would want to do it himself if they were in maine then he was with them they had found her and moloch was probably already on his way to the island maybe he even had men here already waiting for her she would get back to bonnies and find danny crying in the grip of strangers and bonnie and richie hurt or dead there would be nothing for her to do but comfort her son while they sat and waited for moloch to come she thought again of her sister patricia and her useless husband whom she suspected of cheating on her yet with whom she continued to stay because despite it all she loved him and felt that there was still something worthwhile and decent within him perhaps she was right for when she had told them both of her plan to run and reminded them that if she ran then they would have to run too they had accepted it with equanimity and bill had held his wifes hand and told his sisterinlaw that they would support her in any way they could true bill had lost his job and there was nothing to keep them where they were but marianne could still not disguise her surprise at his reaction the memory of it made her ashamed for she knew in the quiet dark places of her heart that they were both dead and that they had died because of her yet part of her suspected that they were not the reason that moloch had found her bill didnt know her exact location and patricia would never tell marianne wiped away mucus and tears with the heel of her hand patricia would never tell she would die before she told jesus pat im sorry im so sorry i was so scared of him i thought i had no other choice he hurt me and he was starting to hurt danny i should have killed him but id have gone to jail and id never have seen danny grow up but now if i could go back i would murder him i would take a knife to him in his sleep and stab him until the blood dripped through the mattress to the floor beneath i would cut him again and again for all that he had done to us i would tear him apart with the blade until his face was unrecognizable i would do all of this to protect danny except except that sometimes when she awoke in their bed during those final months the room rich with darkness or the first dawn light seeping through the drapes she would turn to him and find him awake staring lazily at her as if daring her to take him on as though guessing the thoughts that were in her head and inviting her to test her strength against him then when she did not respond he would draw her to him and without tenderness work himself inside her his hands pinning her arms to the bed no words would be exchanged no intimacies spoken it was simply his way of letting her know that he could do with her as he wished that she was alive by his grace alone and that such grace was not without its limits had she stayed with him she would have been dead within the year of that she was certain he might have let danny live but what life would he have had with such a man so they ran and in doing so contaminated every life that they touched and now patricia and bill were dead because of them then there was karen they had stayed in touch and marianne had recently sent her a photo of danny on his last birthday a smear of chocolate cake across his face and a cardboard crown on his head his name spelled out on it in colored letters she had sent the photograph from boston during a shopping trip her first foray out of maine since theyd arrived there sunglasses permanently perched on her nose to hide her eyes her hair tied up tight in a bun her face unadorned by makeup and therefore she thought unremarkable she had called karen a little later that evening from a telephone at south station before catching her bus back north the number that karen had given her was a private unlisted second line only a handful of people family and friends mostly had the number if she was away from the phone the call was automatically redirected to her private cell day or night karen would answer a call that came through on one of those phones but when marianne had called earlier there had been no reply did karen tell she wondered probably but not willingly marianne felt no bitterness no anger that karen had revealed their location to moloch instead there was only the same terrible guilt that she felt over her sister and bill her stupidity and her selfishness had exposed them to terrible harm and they had paid the ultimate price for their affection for her she hoped only that karen had told all that she knew early on and had spared herself some pain at the end now bonnies house was coming into view marianne braked and killed the lights but the house was quiet as she approached only her friends rustbucket plymouth in the drive through the living room window she could see bonnie snoozing in front of the television she pulled up hard outside the window the gravel beneath the wheels making a sound like the breaking of waves then she ran to the door and knocked hard it took bonnie a couple of seconds to get to the door wheres danny she said when she was facing the older woman bonnie stepped back to let her in hes in bed you can leave him there if you like hey honey she reached for marianne but marianne pulled away from her and headed for the stairs whats the matter she took the steps two at a time bonnie close behind marianne pushed the bedroom door hard and saw one empty bed in the twinbed room in the other danny lay sleeping she sagged back against the wall put her hands on her knees and lowered her head in relief aw hell said bonnie richie must have sneaked out i dont believe that boy ill have to call joe and get him to keep an eye out for him marianne laid a hand on her wrist i need to get danny out of here before you call anyone bonnie but richie is out there hes always out there bon i need to get danny away from here why have i done something wrong bonnie i cant explain it all not now but there are men coming and theyre going to make trouble for danny and me i need to get us both away from the house then find a way off the island bonnie looked distraught honey youre making no sense what men if youre in trouble we have to call the police marianne shook her head she wanted to grab bonnie and force her to understand she wanted to strike out at someone and ease some of her rage and fear most of all she wanted to take danny in her arms and get him away from here they were coming moloch and his men were coming for all she knew they were already moving purposefully toward her home trying to smell her out no no police i did something bad a few years ago i had to do it i had to get danny away and keep us both safe now i have to move again bonnie please help me get him dressed bonnie reached out and took her by the shoulders look she said if theres one thing i know about its men men gone bad or men who were bad to begin with if these people have tracked you down once then they can do it again you cant run away for the rest of your life you need to talk to joe you need to trust him bonnie i broke the law i took money that didnt belong to me if i can get off the island with danny i can make this okay honey you cant get off the island its snowing hard in case you havent noticed theyve taken all the boats off the water it was on the news no taxi is going to come all the way out here now and nobody on the island is going to take a boat out in this weather its too risky marianne almost gave up then it was all too much she should stop running she should tell joe everything better still she should just lie down in front of her house danny in her arms and wait for them to find her then it would all be over and they could rest at last together bonnie she said and this time the tone in her voice made the older woman flinch i have to go tell stared down the barrel of the gun at willard the sound of the hammer clicking emptily still seemed to hang in the air tell felt it echoing through his brain looking into willards eyes he knew that it sounded his death knell as surely as if it were he that was looking into the muzzle of the gun and the weapon was about to discharge a shot straight into his brain he swallowed then swiped the barrel wildly at willard willard dodged it easily and something flashed in his hand tell experienced a fierce pain in his belly as the blade entered willard rose forcing the blade up as he did so and the tearing began tell could smell willards breath against his face it smelled sweet like cheap perfume i could see it in your eyes willard whispered i could smell what you were planning to do before we ever left the dock it was seeping through your pores with your sweat you should never have let that gun out of your sight tell shuddered against the blade his hands clutching tightly at willards shoulders he told you to do this didnt he he told you to kill me tell tried to speak but only blood came from his mouth goodbye said willard as tell died against him marianne had danny blearyeyed and irascible at being woken from his sleep dressed within five minutes she left bonnie standing at her front door looking anxiously after her as she headed for their house they would need clothes toiletries most of all they would need the money she strapped danny into his seat and glanced at her watch there wasnt much time left she started the car and hit the headlights behind her danny had already dozed off to sleep again god danny im sorry for this im so sorry as soon as marianne was gone from sight bonnie claeson went straight to the liquor cabinet and poured herself a vodka she looked at it then on impulse walked to the kitchen and poured the drink down the sink she was worried about marianne and danny but more than that she was worried about richie he probably hadnt gone far and nothing had ever happened to him during his wanderings on the island he knew it well and usually stayed close to the roads and trails but the weather was turning real bad and that was a factor her son wouldnt have taken into account on his latest nocturnal ramble no she had to call joe for all of their sakes she walked into the hallway picked up the phone and began to dial then stopped there was no dial tone she replaced the receiver and tried again but it remained silent no not quite silent she could hear faint noises it was like holding a shell to ones ear and hearing if only ever so faintly the sound of the sea then she heard richies voice momma momma bad men badmenbadmenbadmenbadmenbad richie she called a highpitched wailing tone a kind of electronic scream almost shredded her eardrum and she thrust the phone away when it had receded she brought the receiver back to her ear richie she was crying now and felt the certainty of his loss like a great darkness that covered her wrapping itself around her body and head suffocating her in its depths then the darkness became real as the lights went out and the tv died and the buzz of the refrigerator stopped like the life of an insect suddenly cut short and in the midst of her sorrow and pain she heard a sound like a sudden exhalation of breath as though a great many souls had found at last the release that they had sought for so long marianne was barely on the road when the engine of her car failed no she cried not now she tried to start it again but the car was dead she could go back to bonnie and ask to borrow her plymouth but by now bonnie would have called the police and she would argue with her again or insist that she needed to find richie first and there would be more delays and joe would come and then there would be no way out she opened her door then dannys and began pulling him from his car seat no mommy im tired im sorry danny really i am she held him in her arms and started to run it was shepherd who went astray first he was bringing up the rear the bulk of dexter like a great black bear before him the shapes in the forest had unnerved him scarfe might have been right it could have been smoke from the fire or even shadows cast by it from the topmost trees he had glimpsed them only briefly but it had seemed to him that they were moving against the wind walking parallel to their own group he tried to tell dexter as they walked but dexter was only mildly concerned could be locals on their way to help at the fire he said we can take care of them at the house or avoid them doesnt matter shepherd didnt think it would be that simple they looked almost like men but shepherd could have sworn that they were wearing furs and even out here people had probably given up on furs a long time ago as they continued along the trail shepherd spent more and more time looking behind him or to either side and less time trying to keep dexter in sight the snow grew thicker and the bear shape ahead grew fainter distinguishable only from the trunks of the trees by its movement shepherd stumbled on a hidden stone and landed on his hands and knees in the snow when he stood up there was no one in front of him and the trail was gone shit he said he put his hands to his mouth and whistled then waited there was no response he whistled again then tried calling he didnt care about the barely glimpsed figures now he had a gun and anybody who was out here with them would have to be crazier than than moloch he heard himself finish because moloch was crazy they all knew it even if none of them had the guts to say it out loud this obsession with the woman had led them into alien territory during just about the worst snowstorm that shepherd had ever encountered what they had here was a fullon blizzard with shepherd now stuck on his lonesome in the heart of it and he was one hundred percent pissed at this turn of events he had come for the promise of easy money the lure of for a couple of days work that money could buy him a lot a small house somewhere cheap and quiet maybe a share in a business like dexter and braun shepherd was tired hed done time and as you got older jail time aged you faster even as the years inside passed slowly infinitesimally slowly the aging process seemed to accelerate dexter had seen young men come out old from a nickel stretch and older men come out dying after a dime shepherd wasnt sure that he could survive another spell inside this was to have been his final gamble dexters and brauns too he guessed except that dexter had changed since theyd last met now he spent his spare time staring into space or watching those damn dvds in which everybody went down in a blaze of glory at the end dexter had given up hope and now shepherd wasnt sure that he was any saner than moloch his was just a better organized form of insanity shepherd looked at the compass on his watch if he headed northeast back the way they had come he could find the road and then follow it to the boat the way things were going that boat was going to be a regular hot spot for lost men he made one last effort to summon the others then turned around and headed back toward the sea dexter noticed shepherds absence first but the wind had found renewed force and was now howling into their faces when he opened his mouth to speak snowflakes began to colonize it like bugs on a summers day hey he shouted moloch and scarfe paused shepherd aint back there moloch buffeted by the wind the snow thick around his boots joined dexter how long i dont know i checked just now and he was gone scarfe joined them placed his fingers to his lips and whistled the sound was loud and shrill even allowing for the dampening effect of the falling snow there was no reply dexter leaned close to molochs ear this is turning to shit what do you suggest we do go back no were down to three men and we got no means of communication i say we head back to the boat and wait this thing out then what you think they wont clear the roads come morning first light man first light and we can do this thing be gone before the people on the island start making breakfast she knows were here first light shell be gone worse maybe shell figure that the best thing to do is to come clean with the cops she does that my friend and we are royally fucked we go on listen moloch shoved him hard we go on the bitch is running now we dont have much time it didnt take shepherd long to figure out that he was lost after all the forest should have been thinning out by now instead it seemed to him thicker than ever even though he was still heading northeast according to the compass he was forced to push low foliage back from his face his gloves were sticky with sap and his cheeks were scarred by errant branches the only consolation was that the snow was not as heavy on the ground the great trees above and around him sheltering him from the worst of it he leaned against a tree trunk took out his zippo and lit up keeping the cigarette shielded in his palm he took a long drag closed his eyes then released the smoke through his nostrils when he opened his eyes there were three men moving through the forest about fifty feet ahead of him shepherd whistled loudly but they didnt respond so he flicked the butt into the snow and started to go after them he had closed the gap by about twenty feet when the man bringing up the rear turned around it wasnt dexter first of all dex had been wearing a black jacket and green combat pants this guy was wearing some kind of hooded arrangement made from skins and fur his face wasnt visible beneath the hood when he stopped the other men paused too and all three of them stared back at shepherd then the man bringing up the rear raised his weapon and even through the snow shepherd could see that it was an old old gun a muzzle loader shepherd dived for cover as the gun flashed and smoke rose and a noise like cannon fire echoed through the forest when shepherd looked up the men were spreading out he could see the one who had fired at him reloading as he moved his hand ascending and descending as he pressed the ball down shepherd aimed his own weapon and fired two shots he didnt give a damn about the need for silence or for concealment of their presence right now his need was to survive shepherd saw one of the men rise and he fired again the shot tearing through the layer of furs and watched with satisfaction as he went down and rose again no way said shepherd thats not possible they were surrounding him he could see one of them trying to flank him to get behind him and cut off his retreat shepherd retreated firing as he went using the trees for cover twice he heard the great eruptions of the muzzle loaders and one shot came so close that he felt its heat against his cheek as it passed he had been backing away for about a hundred feet when he found himself in the clearing to his rear were a number of roughhewn houses built from tree trunks there were six or seven in all in the doorway of one he spied a womans body naked from the waist down there was blood on her face and neck other bodies lay nearby in various states of undress and mutilation he could smell burning no he said aloud remembering the layout of the island from molochs map i was going toward the boat this is the south i could not have gone so far astray the image faded and now he was surrounded only by broken rocks and old graves and a huge stone cross that cast its shadow on him he registered the shot at almost the same instant as his belly exploded in agony his dropped his shotgun and fell to his knees clutching his stomach his body began to burn as though wreathed in flame the pain was too much he took his hands away to examine the wound but his jacket was intact but i feel pain i feel pain he heard snow crunching beneath approaching footsteps and looked up to see the three figures closing in on him their heads low and hooded their weapons held at port arms two of them paused while the third moved forward so close now to shepherd that the wounded man could smell the stink of dead animals that rose from the hunter he tried to crawl away and felt a hand grip his leg pulling him back shepherd searched inside his jacket and found the butt of his colt he twisted and raised the weapon aiming it at the man who was dragging him backward then emptied five shots into him the hunter released him and lowered the hood of furs from his head aw fuck said shepherd as he saw at last what had come for him his disintegrating mind registered pale withered skin and blue lips and eyes that burned cold red with a fearsome implacable fury here were the true hunters unbound by time and space traversing the centuries in their quest for vengeance seeking final reparation for old sins shepherd started to cry they should never have come here it was a mistake a terrible mistake aw fuck aw fuck aw fuck aw fuck he placed the barrel of the gun against his skull aw fuck aw fuck aw and fired moloch and his men heard the sound of the shotgun blasts and the final shot as shepherd turned his gun upon himself dexter and moloch exchanged a glance but said nothing willard moving along the road skirting the outer reaches of the forest paused as he too heard the shots then began to run faster he wanted answers and dead men could tell him nothing he also wanted to believe in moloch to be reassured that tell had acted on the wishes of dexter and shepherd and not those of moloch himself if moloch was in trouble then he would need willards help willard would show his loyalty and moloch would reward it with his love and sharon macy trying to warm herself before the flames rising from lubeys house heard them as well they sounded some way off she stared into the forest its outer reaches now lit by the fire and tried to discern movement within but there was nothing keeping away from the flames she circled the house and retreated into the shadows moloch had grown quieter dexter watched him as they progressed toward the fire but didnt say what was on his mind they had lost two men already maybe moloch was right perhaps powell had just given up and headed back to the boat and shepherd had done the same but dexter didnt think so that wasnt like either man they had been approached because dexter knew that they would stand firm for shepherd it was primarily about the money for powell the promise of a little action but they had also come because there were few opportunities for men like them to strike back at all that they hated to break a prisoner loose to hunt down a betrayer to kill a cop their discipline was almost military they were not the kind of men to turn back at the first sign of trouble moloch swiped at something unseen in the air as though swatting away a fly no thought dexter not a fly more like unwanted company there were voices in molochs head they were whispering to him saying things in a mocking familiar tone but he couldnt understand the words and each time he felt his footing slip and reached out to grasp a tree or a rock for support he seemed to endure a kind of mental flash blood men among the trees a woman beneath him dying as blade and man moved in unison and darkness the sensation of being trapped in a mine or a tunnel network or a honeycomb he felt a hand on his shoulder and thought gray theyre gray you okay it was dexter im good he said im theyre gray and they carry lights real good braun was leaving a trail of blood on the snow there was nothing he could do to stop it hed tried to stem the flow but the cops shot had torn up his arm badly despite the cold he was sweating and feverish he wanted to rest to lie back against a rock and let sleep come but dupree was following him he had caught a glimpse of him through the trees and had considered waiting for him in the darkness in the hope of ambushing him but he was afraid that if he stopped to rest he might lose consciousness and become an easy target and he wasnt running only from dupree when he paused briefly to catch his breath and examine his copy of the crude map while leaning against a big fir the snow thick on his shoulders and bright red hair he heard a whispering and saw the gray shapes moving along the ground trying to get ahead of him and cut off his escape he was delirious with pain he told himself his mind was playing tricks on him forcing him to believe that figures were crawling along the ground clutching at roots and stones with emaciated hands as they pulled themselves across the earth braun checked the compass attachment on his watch all he knew was that if he continued due east he would reach the heart of the island and from there a trail hacked through the forest for tourists would lead him close by lubeys house he broke through a bank of evergreens and found himself in a clearing filled with dead trees most of them little more than white staves their branches long since decayed some had fallen sideways to be supported here and there by their stronger fellows creating archways over the trail braun tested the black ground on either side of the causeway and felt his foot begin to sink it was beaver bog he figured or something similar he began moving anxious to get back under the cover of the trees again out here he was a sitting duck for the cop braun was halfway across the bog when he realized that the gray figures were no longer shadowing him when he looked back he thought he glimpsed a single pale shape moving across the snow like a crazed hound chained to a post walking over and over the same ground braun raised his gun and fired off a shot he didnt care about the cop now didnt care about moloch or the woman or the money braun just didnt want to die out here among these things he became aware of new movement around him the surface of the marsh rippled the forms of what swam beneath visible briefly when they broke the surface braun fired down at one and something gushed darkly then fell away he heard a slithering sound behind him and spun just in time to see a dark body sliding back into the bog blackened withered feet glimpsed beneath the wetness of its shroud its hips still round a halo of white hair pooling briefly on the surface of the bog before sinking back into its depths its a woman thought braun no it was a woman then a voice spoke and he turned to see dupree using a tree for cover his shotgun pointing directly at braun i said drop it braun started to giggle dupree couldnt figure out what the gunman was doing he had seen him pause in the middle of the trail then begin firing wildly at the trees and the bog maybe he was hallucinating from the pain of his wound if so his unpredictability would make him even more dangerous he made his move when the man turned quickly seemingly distracted by something on the ground behind him dupree took up a position against the biggest fir he could find then shouted a warning the man turned dupree gave him a second warning the man laughed then raised his gun and fired in the policemans direction dupree pulled the trigger and blew him into the marsh brauns lower body took the force of the blast and he fell backward his feet slipping from beneath him the trees tilted crazily and he was lost for a moment in snowflakes suspended between the path and the blackness below then his back hit the water and his head disappeared into the murk he tasted rot and decay and even as the pain began to separate body from mind life from death he attempted to raise himself up his face cleared the surface and he spit mud and vegetation from his mouth he tried to open his eyes but his vision was blurred he could see the shape of the cop dupree the gun held to his shoulder as he approached him along the path and he could sense movement in the marsh to his right and left as the black beings converged upon him the cop was right above him now braun was dying he could feel it as a gathering darkness punctured by slivers of red like wounds in burnt skin it was coming slowly too slowly the things in the bog were faster they would get to him first and braun didnt want that he didnt want to go that way with a last surge of effort braun raised his gun from the water and died in the shotguns merciful roar moloch cleared the trees first and stood looking at the remains of carl lubeys burning house the garage door was open and he could see the truck inside the hood gaping the shape of the cab behind it making it seem like the flaming skull of some great bird scarfe and dexter took up positions at either side of him nobody spoke for a moment looks like our rides gone said dexter scarfe shielded his face from the heat of the flames and thought about running hed take his chances with the russians back in boston they were brutal but at least they werent crazy it was supposed to be simple scarfe would do the groundwork set them up with carl lubey and take off then scarfe found himself pushed into the role of boatman and now there were cops being killed and handicapped men shot with arrows and his buddy carls place was burning like a bonfire at halloween with carl he felt sure burning right along with it scarfe didnt hold out much hope for the woman they were hunting either nor her boy the money wasnt going to be enough for moloch whatever shed done to him scarfe figured it must have been pretty bad there was a rustle of bushes to scarfes right and a female cop appeared her gun was in her hand scarfe looked at her then moloch and dexter followed his lead scarfe recognized macy at the same instant that she recognized him aw this is just great said scarfe dexter didnt even wait for the cop to speak he just started shooting i was too slow thought macy dumb and slow but the black man had moved so fast forcing her to run then the others had joined in and the forest around her was now alive with falling branches shredded leaves and the hiss of bullets melting snow macy hit a rock with her foot and went tumbling down the slope at the rear of carl lubeys property wrenching her ankle painfully before at last coming to rest among a pile of trash and discarded metal she was in lubeys private dump and it stank macy got to her feet but her ankle almost instantly collapsed beneath her weight so she leaned against a tree for support above her she heard the men moving but the trees on the slope shielded her from the light of the fire there was another blast of gunfire macy pressed her face hard into the tree and drew her body in as close as she could to the trunk a bullet blew bark inches from her face and she closed her eyes a second too late to avoid being momentarily blinded by a spray of wood and sap it got into her mouth and she coughed trying desperately to mask the sound with the sleeve of her jacket but the men heard her a thrashing came from the trees above as one of them began to descend macy hurt and afraid headed into the forest they sent scarfe according to molochs map and the late carl lubeys directions they were pretty close to his wifes house scarfe could take care of the cop while they got the woman they would wait for scarfe at her house then find a car and head back to the boat it sounded simple even scarfe thought it sounded easy except he had no intention of coming back to the womans house scarfe wasnt really a killer hed never killed anybody but he was pretty certain that he could do it if he had to the cop knew who he was if she got away scarfe would be in serious shit maine didnt have the death penalty but hed die behind bars as an accomplice to murder if the cop lived to tell what shed seen scarfe was a weak man and a coward but he was quite capable under those circumstances of killing a cop the ground was now rising beneath macys feet the slope gradually becoming more pronounced so that she could feel the effort of the climb in her right leg she was trying to keep her weight off her left foot although the pain was not as intense now it was a pretty bad sprain but at least the ankle wasnt broken that said her pursuer was gaining on her she couldnt see well enough in the snow to pick him out but she could hear him there was only one but uninjured and perhaps better armed than she was ahead of her a tall structure blotted out the descending snow the islands main observation tower the one she had explored during her introductory tour earlier that day watching for rocks and stray roots she made her way toward it the rusted iron door stood partially open she had slipped the bolt earlier she recalled and had wrapped the chain around it someone had been there since then from behind came the sounds of her pursuer she couldnt keep running her ankle hurt too badly after a moments hesitation she entered the tower feeling broken glass crunch beneath her feet there was no bolt on the inside of the door to her right the flight of concrete steps led up to the second level she followed them then stopped a moth was bouncing against one of the windows she looked up and in the faint light saw more of the insects fluttering around the room one of them brushed against her face and she slapped it away feeling it against her palm and then instinctively rubbing her hand against her leg as if she risked contamination from its touch a noise came from somewhere above her it sounded like boards creaking beneath the weight of a footfall macys bowels churned she shouldnt have come in here the realization hit her with the force of a fist everything about the place felt wrong she was like a rat caught in a maze with no prize at the end of it or an insect teetering on the edge of a jar of sugared water the sound came again clearer now she imagined that she heard someone crying it sounded like a little girl hey called macy softly hey are you okay scarfe saw a gray shape in the shadows moving close to the ground he raised his gun then pivoted swiftly to his right as he registered a second presence in the trees then a third behind him the shapes in a state of constant movement circling him from the shelter of the forest whos there he whispered more to himself than to anyone else then louder whos there the sound of the wind in the trees was almost deafening a mist appeared to rise before him and he thought that he could discern figures and for a second even faces then the figures spread out moving faster trying to surround him scarfe ran the ground rising before him until he came to the clearing and the tower macy walked across the floor and stood at the base of the next flight of steps all was darkness above but she could see faintly the edges of the wooden floor she reached out a hand to steady herself against the wall then recoiled instantly as she felt movement on her skin there were more moths up here as she looked closer she saw that they entirely covered the wall beside the ascending stairs macy took a step back and a figure passed across the top of the steps she had a fleeting image of something small and gray with whiteblond hair a tattered gown seemed to hang from it as though she were shedding a skin it was a girl a little girl dressed in gray the crying came again honey come on down said macy you dont have to be afraid no you come up but macy didnt move the voice was not that of a child it was older it sounded sick there was desire in that voice despite the tears and hunger macy stood still undecided and again the image of a honey pot came to her then her decision was made for her there came a gunshot followed by a second moments later she heard the door beneath her slam closed and then there was silence willard was unusual in many ways not the least of which was his total lack of imagination he didnt read books didnt like movies didnt even watch much tv he didnt need to live in a fantasy world created by others instead willard moved through this world and carved his own reality from it yet even willard felt that there was something wrong with this island there was a buzzing in his head like an outoftune radio he thought that he sensed movement around him but when he looked closer there was nothing willard felt as if he were the subject of a conversation that he couldnt quite hear or the punch line of a joke that had not yet been told he considered his options he could go back to the boat and return to the mainland but he didnt know much about boats and even if he could get it started he didnt think he could even find the mainland in this weather but he also had scores to settle and questions to be answered when willard had all the information at his disposal he would then decide what moves to make against the others macy went down the stairs as quietly as she could carefully placing each foot so that she did not slip she listened carefully and once or twice she believed she heard heavy breathing the sound of a man recovering from sudden unaccustomed exertion she kept her back against the wall trying to listen to both what was below her and what was above a shadow moved across the plexiglas of the window and macy puzzled found her attention distracted the shadow came again and macy was aware of a darkness hovering beyond the window out of sight yet still capable of stealing what little light she had the gun in her hand made a regular arc first pointing down toward the unknown man below then swinging up toward the shadows above and the child who was not a child the darkness in the stairway was almost liquid pouring from the walls and oozing down the stairs she was halfway down when she heard a soft hiss and the gray girls hand emerged from the shadows and pushed her macy lost her footing and stumbled down the last of the concrete steps the porch light was out and the house was in complete darkness as marianne at last reached her home even the nightlights that came on automatically as the day faded were out theyre here theyve cut off the power and theyre here but then she looked to her right where jacks house lay and saw that it too was dark that never happened for the old man stayed awake until the wee hours working in his studio she saw him sometimes when she couldnt sleep during the warm summer months and sat outside on her porch watching him working on his terrible paintings it was a power failure that was all although it didnt explain her car dying coincidence she decided after all what other reason could there be she found her keys opened the door then slammed it closed behind her with the heel of her shoe she carried danny upstairs and laid him on his bed then took two bags from her closet and began thrusting clothes into them her own first then dannys she grabbed some toys and books and placed them in his bag then zipped it closed finally she pulled down the attic stairs and headed up her flashlight wasnt working and she was almost certain that shed filled her bag with a selection of mismatched clothing but it didnt matter what mattered was the knapsack that lay hidden under piles of trash and junk at the rear of the attic she stepped carefully one hand raised ahead of her so that she would not bump her head on the eaves kneeling down she began tossing bags and boxes away until beneath her fingers she felt the canvas straps on the bag she dragged it out hauled it to the edge of the attic door then tipped it down into the hallway it landed with the kind of sound that only three quarters of a million dollars can make scarfe too had seen the shadows outside panicked he held his gun in a doublehanded grip and tried to catch the figures as they moved beyond the windows then two noises came together a scuffling from the staircase across from him and a rattle as something thrust itself against the door from outside torn between the two threats scarfe retreated against the wall just as macys voice called out police drop your weapon and then the door flew open and the man in her sights turned to stare at what lay beyond he raised his weapon and fired macy aware only of the gun and the threat that it posed fired at the same time and watched the man buck against the wall then slide down the gun falling from his hand macy advanced toward scarfe and kicked his gun away with her foot the doorway was empty only snow was entering the shot had taken him clean in the chest and he was bleeding from the mouth she tried to open his jacket but his hand gripped hers as he tried to speak tell me said macy tell me why youre here elliot scarfe whispered moloch he was staring straight at her pulling her closer and then his gaze shifted to a point over her shoulder and his grip tightened she was already turning when she felt a presence close by flitting mothlike in the shadows the gray girl hung in the air behind her moving swiftly back and forth trying to find some means of access to the dying man macy could see her eyes jet black within her wrinkled skin and the edges of her teeth almost hidden beneath the lips of her rounded mouth she raised her gun as scarfe began to spasm beside her his nails dug into her painfully the gray girl darted forward then retreated again as macy shielded the dying mans body from her scarfe coughed once and his fingers relaxed their grip as the life passed from him macy watched as the childs features contorted with rage her head and arms trembling with the depth of her anger and then she seemed to sink back into the shadows in the corner seconds later a flight of moths burst from the darkness and disappeared into the night forming a mist that moved against the direction of the wind heading deeper and deeper into the forest making for the very heart of the island chapter sixteen dexter and moloch left carl lubeys burning house behind them traveling southwest until they came to a road banks of firs standing like temple columns at either side you want the map asked dexter i know where were going said moloch he sounded distracted almost distant we need to spread out take them from every angle dexter stared at him spread out how theres just you and me moloch acted like a man suddenly awakened from a strange dream once again the sensation of worlds overlapping came to him but it was accompanied by an uncomfortable feeling of separation moments earlier he had been surrounded by men men willing to act at his command he had strength and authority now there was only dexter and moloch himself was weakening increasingly he was troubled by the sense that he was less alive here than he was in the past that each time he flipped between worlds he left more of himself behind in an earlier life they havent come back yet he asked who shepherd and scarfe no they aint back yet moloch nodded then pointed her house is just over that rise shouldnt take us more than he glanced at his watch it had stopped you know what time it is dexter wore a seiko digital no numerals showed on its face i dont know its not working right it doesnt matter said moloch but again dexter detected a wavering note in his voice dont fall apart on me now man he thought not after all this time the wind was dying down now the snow falling a little less thickly they leaped a small ditch that ran along the side of the road now almost entirely filled with snow and stepped out onto the trail in doing so they almost ran into the woman she let out a little yelp of surprise then saw their guns and started to back away now where are you going said dexter he advanced upon her gripped her by the hair and dragged her back to moloch bonnie claeson had given up on the phone on her car and on joe dupree she had given up on everything something had broken inside her when shed heard her sons voice echoing down a dead telephone line and so she had retreated into a beautiful illusion richie her sad troubled loving son was out in the snow alone probably tired and afraid she had to find him and bring him home she wore only an open coat over her sweater and jeans and her clothing was now crusted white with flakes her cheap boots had not protected her feet yet she did not feel the cold she was lost to herself and now she only wished for her son to appear out of the darkness his orange jacket bright against the snow his face filled with relief and affection as his mother came for him and drew him to her im searching for my boy she said have you seen him she looked first at dexter then at moloch examining their faces they seemed familiar to her briefly her clouded mind was illuminated by a flash of clarity she shook her head and moved away from the two men never allowing her eyes to leave their faces they were richies bad men the men from the tv she heard her sons voice crying out its last words to her momma momma bad men badmenbadmenbadmenbadmenbad dexter saw the recognition in her eyes shit he said now were gonna the gunshot came from so close to his head that he recoiled in shock his ears ringing the woman crumpled to the ground and began to bleed on the snow beside him moloch holstered his gun we could have taken her with us said dexter she could have helped us you going soft on me dex came the reply and dexter was sure now that moloch was mad in the unspoken threat he heard the death sentence being passed on willard the abandonment of powell shepherd and scarfe to their fates and the singleminded obsession that had brought them to this place it was no longer about money or a woman or a child moloch might once have thought that it was but it wasnt he had come here for some unknowable reason of his own and those who stood alongside him were expendable were going to die here dexter realized i think i always knew and just hoped that it wouldnt be true but it will end here i have no choice now but to follow it to its end and to embrace it when it comes no said dexter i aint going soft he walked over to where the woman lay and looked down on her she was lying very still her eyes blinked and he saw her chest rise and fall blood spreading from the wound on her left breast her lips formed a word richie she whispered for the boy was beside her now he had always appeared wondrous to her always kind but now he seemed transformed his features perfectly sculpted and his eyes alive with an intelligence that he had never known in life richie she repeated he reached out his hand to her and took it in his own and he drew her to him and carried her away so that she would not feel the pain of the final bullet marianne was on her doorstep when she heard the shots they came from close by two overnight bags crammed full of clothing lay by her feet and the knapsack hung over her shoulder danny sat on top of one of the bags still drowsy when he heard the shots he looked up briefly then resumed his previous position his head cupped in his hands his eyes nearly closed come on danny we have to go where there was that whining tone to his voice and for the first time she lost her temper with him were going to jacks now get up danny i mean it you get up or im going to give you such a spanking that you wont be able to sit for a week do you hear me get up the boy started to cry but at least he was on his feet marianne took a bag in each hand then gave him a little swipe with one of them propelling him toward the door she pulled it closed behind her with her toe then urged him on down the path to jacks house once they got to jacks she could convince the old man to take them off dutch even if they got only as far as one of the neighboring islands it would be enough all that mattered was that they get away from here the weight of the gun in her coat pocket slapped painfully against her leg as she walked but she didnt care it had been in the knapsack with the money she had cleaned and oiled it only twice in the years since she had fled following instructions from a gun magazine and had never fired it not even on a range she would use it though if she was forced to do so this time there would be no fear she would take his dare she was stronger than he had ever suspected stronger than even she had known she would kill him if she had to and some secret part of her hoped that she would be given that opportunity from the top of the rise moloch and dexter watched them leave the house but they were not the only ones far to their right almost at the edge of jacks property a pretty man with blond hair stood among the trees and admired once again the shape of the womans legs the swell of her breasts beneath her open coat the way her jeans hugged her groin in her way she was to blame for all that had happened to him for his rejection and abandonment by the man he admired so much she had deceived him betrayed his beloved moloch and he would make her pay he vaguely recalled molochs warning that she was not to be harmed but he had the hunger upon him now he would first make her tell him where the money was and then he would finish her after all willard had needs too jack heard the banging on his kitchen door as he dozed in his armchair he had tried to paint but nothing came instead he found himself drawn again and again to the painting with the two figures burned upon it his fingers tracing their contours as he tried to understand how they had come to be then the lights had gone out and the heat with them the small fire faded in the grate and he noticed only when the cold began to tell on his bones there was no wood left by the fireplace so he grabbed his coat and opened the door preparing to risk the cold in order to replenish his stock from the store of firewood in the shed but as he stood at the door he became aware of a presence beyond the house no not a single presence but many presences whos there he called but he expected no reply instead he thought he saw a shadow move against the wind gray upon the white ground like a cobweb blown or an old cloak discarded there were more shadows to his left and right they seemed to be circling the house waiting go away he said softly please go away he closed and locked the door then and checked all the windows he took a blanket from his bed wrapped it around his shoulders and sat as close as he could to the dying embers of the fire he thought that he might have slept for a time for he dreamed of shadows moving closer to the great picture window and faces pressed against the glass their skin gray and withered their lips thin and bloodless their eyes black and hungry they tapped at the glass with their long nails the tapping growing harder until at last the glass exploded inward and they descended upon him and began to devour him jacks eyes flicked open he could still hear the banging and for a moment he found himself unable to distinguish between dream and reality then he heard marianne elliot calling his name and he struggled to his feet his joints stiff from sitting slumped against the chair he walked to the kitchen door and saw the faces of marianne and danny the woman scared and panicky the boy drowsy and his face streaked with tears he opened the door come in he said whats wrong she dropped the bags she was holding then knelt down and hugged the boy close to her im sorry for shouting at you danny im so sorry the boy began to cry again but at least he hugged her back marianne the boys head cradled against her neck looked imploringly at jack we need to get off the island theres no way you can get away from here until this snow thins out some more he said we cant wait that long jack said nothing she understood that he wanted more from her danny she said go inside and lie down for few minutes the boy did not need to be told twice he passed by the old man and headed for the couch where he instantly fell asleep ive told some lies she said when she saw her son curl up with his eyes closed my husband isnt dead he was put in prison i betrayed him to the police so that danny and i could get away from him andi took money from him a lot of money she opened the knapsack and showed jack the wads of notes his mouth opened slightly in surprise then closed with a snap im not sure how he got it all but i can guess and so can you now hes here on the island and hes brought men with him theyre close i heard shots she reached out and took the painters hand my car is dead but you have a boat i need you to get us away from here even just to one of the other islands if we dont leave theyll find us and theyll kill me and take danny away she paused or they may kill danny too my husband he never had any love for danny the old man looked back at the swing door of the kitchen beyond which the boy lay sleeping you told joe dupree any of this marianne shook her head hell help you you know that hes different i was afraid afraid that theyd put me in jail or take danny from me i dont know enough about the law to say one way or the other but it seems to me that theyd be a little more sympathetic than that just take us off the island please ill think about telling someone once were away from here jack bit his lip then nodded okay we can try this all your stuff its all that i had time to pack jack took a bag in each hand then kicked the knapsack and said youd best look after that yourself they entered the living room jack leading marianne was so close behind him when the shot came that jacks blood hit her in the face before he fell to the floor there was a wound at his shoulder he clutched it with his hand his teeth clenched as he trembled and began to go into shock danny awoke and started crying loudly but she could not go to him she could not move all that she could do was stare impotently at her husband even as dexter frisked her and took the gun from her coat he raised it so that moloch could see it moloch grinned is that a gun in your pocket or are you just not happy to see me moloch asked he stepped closer to her and struck her hard with his right hand sending her sprawling on a rug she lay still for a moment then crawled across the floor to danny and gathered him in her arms youd better make that last said moloch you dont have much time left together moloch stared at his reflection in the painting his face seeming to hang suspended above the dark waves that the old man had painted the twin arms of the outcrops like horns erupting from his head almost touching above his hair he moved on to the next a watercolor filled with blues and greens before returning to the first the waves in this version were very dark almost black white peaks breaking through like the pale bodies of drowning men a sliver of moonlight cast a weak silver glow across the skies above there were no stars i like this one he said jack seated on the floor his hands bound before him with a length of clothesline peered up at the intruder he was deathly pale apart from a smear of blood across his cheek in the murk of the room the blood appeared black against the pallor of his face creating a strange resemblance between the artist and the work of art before which moloch now stood you go away and you can have it for free said jack molochs mouth twitched the only sign he gave that he might be enjoying the joke something ive learned he said you get nothing for free in this life although i can say with some certainty that if you fuck with me money is never likely to be a worry for you again dexter stood behind the couch the appearance of the woman and the money seemed to have concentrated molochs mind some he was no longer rambling dexter began to experience a faint hope that they might somehow get out of this alive his hand rested on the back of dannys neck in what might have been almost a protective way were it not for the fact that the tips of his fingers were digging painfully into the boys skin almost cupping his spine make him stop said marianne hes your son make him stop hurting him moloch walked toward the boy who attempted to shrink back but found himself anchored to the spot by the force of dexters hand moloch reached out and touched the back of his hand to the boys cheek youre cold he said if youre not careful youll catch your death he glanced at marianne he doesnt look much like me you sure hes mine maybe hes something that you and that dyke bitch cooked up between you with a turkey baster shes dead by the way but i suspect you knew that already mariannes eyes blinked closed she bit her lip to try to keep from crying actually i got to tell you that a lot of people are dead because of you your sister her husband fuck knows how many people on this island all because you were a greedy bitch who screwed over her own husband you try that out for size see how it fits on your conscience he turned to dexter how long have we been here ten fifteen minutes maybe we cant afford to wait any longer for the others but now that we have a boat a little closer to homemoloch kicked jacks leg causing the old man to flinchit looks like i have some time to kill in a manner of speaking he reached out to marianne lifted her up by the arm and started to guide her toward the bedroom danny tried to hold on to her but dexters hand kept him rooted to the couch ive been waiting a long time to see you again he whispered he grabbed her left breast and squeezed it painfully look upon this as a conjugal visit marianne tried to pull away from him instead he thrust her forward sending her staggering into the hallway there was a time said moloch when you used to beg me for what im about to give you he pushed her against the wall the length of his body pressed hard against her and clasped her cheeks in his hands forcing her mouth into the shape of a kiss he composed his own features into an expression of sadness maybe youve just forgotten the good times he said you know i can promise you that in all the years weve spent apart ive never been with another woman he forced his mouth over hers she struggled making small moans of disgust against his lips then her body began to relax her mouth now working along with his his hand relaxed its grip upon her cheeks marianne bit him hard in one single movement of her jaws almost severing his bottom lip her teeth meeting where they cut through the flesh moloch howled he hit her across the side of the head with his fist and she tumbled to her right falling against a small table and sending a bowl of freshcut flowers crashing to the ground danny screamed moloch held his hand to his wounded mouth cupping the blood that was pouring from the cut he stared at himself in the hall mirror then looked down at marianne his words were distorted as he tried to talk without moving his ruined lip but she understood they all did im going to cut you for that he said after ive fucked you im going to cut you to pieces and then im going to start on the boy he took his knife from his belt flicked the blade open then advanced on her he caught her by the hair and began to drag her down the hallway danny screaming all the time jack struggling against his bonds then the sliding doors exploded and blood shot from dexters chest he tried to turn and a second shot sent him sprawling into the fireplace he rolled away from the red glow of the ashes a third shot hit him in the small of the back and he finally lay still willard entered through the ruined glass shards crunching beneath his feet yall look surprised to see me he said joe dupree was almost within sight of jacks house when he heard the shots and the shattering of glass mariannes house had been empty he figured that she must have taken danny over to jacks he was approaching the house from the west so the big windows were on the opposite side and he could not see what was transpiring inside he tightened his grip on the shotgun and began to circle the house moloch smiled at willard i knew youd make it he said willard looked confused you told them to kill me moloch shook his head no that was dexters decision and he didnt tell me about it until we were in trouble i wanted to kill him for it but by then i needed all the help i could get theres something on this damn island something that wants us all dead and we need to stick together if were going to get off it alive willard looked at the older man and moloch could see that he wanted to believe him whatever love willard had for anything in this world he had for moloch you hadnt killed dexter id have killed him myself once we got to land i wont shed tears for him despite the agony of his lip moloch tried to seem compassionate and concerned about willards own pain it appeared to work the gun trained on moloch wavered then fell thank you willard said moloch willard nodded where we at he asked moloch shook marianne hard by the hair my wife and i were about to make love but now ive decided to go straight to the afterglow what happened to your mouth moloch smiled his teeth red love bite he said then looked to jack you got a firstaid kit in the kitchen under the sink moloch inclined his head toward the kitchen go in see what you can find for my mouth he told willard willard took one last look at dexter lying unmoving on the floor then headed for the kitchen tucking his gun into his belt the only sign of doubt he exhibited was his reluctance to turn away from moloch he was still looking back at him as the kitchen door swung closed on its hinges hiding him from the view of those in the living room and joe duprees great hand closed around his throat willard tried to reach for his gun but the giants left hand plucked it from its belt and laid it gently on the top of the refrigerator willards feet began to rise from the ground he tried to make a sound but duprees grip was too strong he kicked out with his feet hoping to hit the walls or the door and alert moloch but the giant held him in the very center of the large kitchen away from anything that might allow willard to give his presence away willard stretched for the giants face but his arms were too short instead he dug his nails into the duprees hand tearing and gouging even as he felt his eyes bulging from his face his lungs burning spittle shot from his mouth and he began to shudder then the giants grip tightened and the small bones in willards neck started to snap outside molochs head turned sharply toward the kitchen willard he called you okay in there he discarded his knife keeping a grip on mariannes hair he drew his own gun he pressed it hard against her temple moving her slowly toward the living room he saw jack look to his right the boy too moloch risked a look around the corner the female cop was standing at the ruined window her gun was raised she fired the glass on the painting closest to molochs head shattered at the same instant dupree emerged from the kitchen his great bulk filling the doorway as he crouched slightly to enter the room moloch instantly drew marianne up to her full height and forced her against him using her body as a shield the barrel of the gun now pushed hard into the soft flesh beneath her chin only dupree could see him macy stood uncertainly at the window moloch adjusted his line of sight so that he could see the hall mirror and macys reflection in its surface peekaboo he said i see you you stay right there missy dupree remained still the shotgun pointed at moloch the two men confronted each other for the first time brought together by forces neither fully understood and bound together by circumstances barely recognized their shared knowledge of the woman who stood between them their links to the island and its strange bloody heritage and finally their own curiously similar situations for they were both men out of place in the world and only sanctuary could hold out to them a promise of belonging let her go said dupree its over you think said moloch i reckon its just beginning your people are all dead and youll never be allowed to leave this place let her go uh no i dont think thats going to happen my wife and i have just been reunited after a long absence weve got a lot of catching up to do moloch jerked mariannes head back and despite the pain that it caused him kissed her cheek leaving a bloody smear on her skin i bet she didnt tell you about me im shocked people got to be honest right from the start otherwise what hope is there for two lovers in this world marianne kept her eyes away from dupree afraid to look at his face to her left she could see macy her gun moving as she waited for moloch to make himself a target for her yeah i know all about you and my wife i dont like a man who milks through another mans fence no matter what hes been told but im inclined to forgive you after all she used you dupree couldnt hide his confusion what did you think that she was attracted to you you fucking freak this isnt beauty and the beast this is real life she took us both for a ride but hey dont beat yourself up over it shes smarter than i gave her credit for and theres no denying that shes a looker not for too much longer maybe but right now most men would give a lot to split this particular piece of white oak she used you used you as a lookout an earlywarning system so she could take off with my money when the time came marianne tried to speak but the gun pressed so hard into her skin that she felt sure it would push through into her mouth now at last she allowed herself to stare into duprees face as she tried to communicate with him to express her shame her regret her fear and her feelings for him theyre lies hes telling lies i never wanted to hurt anyone least of all you shell try to deny it but it was there in her head i know her hell i was married to her for long enough and she still fucked me over maybe she even thought that you might protect her if things went wrong well she was right about that much at least because here you are in the mirror moloch saw macy attempt to move off making for the front door to cut off another line of escape missy i said i could see you you move another fucking inch and ill blow my bitch wifes brains all over the ceiling macy stopped put the shotgun down moloch told dupree you can get rid of the smith on your belt as well i wont even waste my time counting to three dupree against all his instincts did as he was told laying the shotgun down gently on the floor followed by his smith amp wesson you too missy said moloch he kept his back to the wall so that he could see macy clearly she didnt move you think im fucking with you do it macy began to lower the gun slowly as molochs attention flicked back to dupree look at you he said youre a freak a giant pretending to be a knight in shining armor but you dont read your fairy stories mr giant the gun moved suddenly from mariannes face its barrel now pointing at dupree at the end of the story the giant always dies he pulled the trigger and the policemans throat blossomed like a new flower it seemed to happen slowly for joe dupree he thought that he could almost see the bullet as it moved tearing a path through the cold air it entered his skin in tiny increments fractions of inches ripping through flesh and bone exiting just to the right of his spine he fell backward through the kitchen door coming to rest close to willards body he tried to breathe but already his throat was flooding with blood the kitchen door was held open by his feet and he saw marianne spin and strike at molochs injured mouth then throw herself against him in an effort to dislodge his gun he saw macy moving through the living room her gun extended her face turning in horror toward him he watched moloch push marianne away then run for the door firing as he did so his wife scrambling for the cover of the corner as the bullets sent plaster and paint flying from the walls then he was gone macy uncertain whether to follow him or tend to her wounded comrade she ran to dupree limping slightly favoring her right foot stay with me joe she began well get help he reached out took her shirt in his hand then pushed her away still she paused he could not speak but he pointed his hand in the direction of the fleeing man she nodded and headed after moloch stopping just once to look back at the dying policeman marianne came to him she was crying the boy was behind her staring at the two men on the kitchen floor im sorry she said im so sorry she tried to remove her coat in order to lay it on him but he gripped her hand and brought it instead to his lips no she whispered we have to keep you warm but then she registered the blood spreading behind his head flowing from the exit wound hidden from them and she knew no she repeated softer now dont do this the giant coughed and began to spasm she tried to hold him down but his great weight was too much for her his body jerked as he clawed at the floor an irregular clicking noise emerging from the back of his throat then the spasming stopped and joe duprees eyes widened as he died as though in sudden understanding of the nature of this world chapter seventeen moloch ran he was conscious of movement around himbranches whipping in the wind dead leaves pirouetting and the shapes that lingered at the limits of his perception not caring now whether he noticed them or not merely content to shadow his progress through the forest there was blood on his shirt and face he could feel it cooling upon him in the night air his lip ached the pain like needles in his mouth each time he drew a breath he heard the sounds of pursuit coming from behind and knew that the female cop was coming after him he thought of all that he wanted to do to the woman all of the hurt that he desired to inflict on her and on his wife at least hed put an end to the big cop that was something his head struck a broken branch almost severed by the actions of the storm and he cried out as he fell back against the tree when the pain in his mouth and head had subsided he took a breath and stumbled along a narrow pathway that wound through a patch of marshland until finally he found himself in a clearing in the middle of the forest low stones lay half buried in the ground and a simple stone cross stood at its center he moved slowly forward until he was facing the monument it was still possible to read the names on it and he found his hand reaching out to trace the letters his bloodied finger outstretched he touched the stone and men forest shooting women woman the fillings in his mouth tingled and he felt suddenly lightheaded he staggered back as the ground began to crumble under his feet visions of suffering and death assailed him he felt flesh beneath his fingers and smelled powder on the air a noise came from below as the earth gave way beneath him and moloch tumbled into blackness marianne turned danny away from joe duprees body hiding his face in the folds of her jacket just as daysyearsbefore she had allowed him to shield himself from the reality of a birds death willards body lay in a corner partly concealed by the breakfast counter danny wouldnt stop crying he was holding on to her so tightly that his nails were drawing blood behind them jack had raised himself and now stood at the kitchen door she found a knife in a drawer and used it to cut the bindings on his hands then gently removed dannys fingers from her legs i want you to stay here with jack okay danny let out a loud wail and tried to claw his way back to her but she kept him at arms length and pushed him into the old mans arms jack held him as firmly as he could folding his uninjured arm across dannys chest marianne picked up duprees gun from the floor then headed for the front door ill be back before you know it danny you look after jack for me but danny could only cry and in the confusion and shock of the moment none of them noticed that dexters body was gone moloch fell for what seemed like a long long time yet the distance could have been only twenty feet for when he hit the bottom he could still see a ragged hole above him loose earth spilling down from the edges snowflakes joining it in its descent dim light filtered down bathing him in a patina of gray like one who was already fading from this world the impact made him gag and he lay for a moment tasting bile and blood in his mouth moloch smelled damp earth he reached out a hand blindly and felt it brush against ragged hair woman a womans hair he instantly drew his hand back forcing the fear from himself the cop was coming if he stayed here and waited to be found he would be trapped like an animal he needed to find a way out he needed to know what was around him he advanced into the shadows grateful now for the improvements forced upon his vision by hours of struggling through the snowstorm without flashlights he discovered that he had been touching the exposed roots of vegetation moloch released a spluttering laugh of relief then heard it die in his mouth as he began to take in his surroundings he was in a semicircular hollow of earth and stone about fifteen feet in diameter at its extremities were openings large enough for a man to crawl through on his belly moloch approached the widest of the entrances and carefully reached inside disturbing some beetles as he felt the ends of more tree roots dangling from the top of the tunnel he listened from beyond he could hear the sound of flowing water he glanced back toward the hole through which he had fallen then took another look at the walls of earth and stone that descended from it there was no way that he could climb them either he stayed here and waited to be found or he took his chances in one of the tunnels moloch had no fear of enclosed spaceseven prison had not troubled him in that waybut he still felt uneasy about committing himself to the hole before him he might have trouble squeezing through if it narrowed significantly farther on and he had no idea how or for what purpose the tunnels had been constructed still there was the sound of water which could mean that the tunnel led to the bank of a river or stream and he thought that he could make out a faint light ahead he made his decision he got down on his knees and entered the hole twenty feet above macy entered the clearing she was still feeling the shock of duprees death and of her own actions in the tower until tonight she had never fired her gun in the line of duty and had barely had cause to draw it from its holster now a man had died at her hands and another was fleeing from her and joe dupree was dead because she hadnt been fast enough joe dupree was dead because of her her foot struck stone she looked down at the monument protruding from the ground at the others surrounding it and at the raised stone cross at the center of the little cemetery she was reluctant to enter the clearing her quarry was still armed and she was unwilling to risk exposing herself she crouched down low and tried to scan the forest there was blood on the snow by the cross she swallowed then headed toward the middle of the site she was almost upon it when her foot treaded air and she stumbled her leg disappearing into the hole she fell backward then scuttled away from the gap anticipating gunfire from below but no sound came she counted to five then inched forward again the opening was new she could see damp earth and the tree roots were moist when she touched her fingers to them she risked a quick glance below barely allowing the top of her head to appear over the rim of the hole in order to provide the smallest possible target she could see nothing but fallen earth broken branches and a light dusting of snow down below joe duprees killer was down there he had to be she was about to descend when a hand gripped her shoulder she looked up to see marianne elliot behind her dont said marianne you have to get out of here we both have to get out of here now even in the falling snow the trail left by moloch and macy had been easy for marianne to discern they were heading toward the site marianne followed them carefully checking the woods ahead and always trying to use trees for cover but could not see either of them they were too far ahead she was almost at the clearing when something brushed by her feet she looked down and saw a gray shape moving swiftly past her tattered clothing hanging on mummified skin wisps of hair protruding from beneath the folds of its shroud it appeared to float slightly above the ground leaving no trace of its passage while its thin hands used rocks and tree trunks to pull itself along like a diver exploring the seabed marianne shrank from it and her legs touched another shape as it swept by her seemingly oblivious to her presence she raised her head and saw that she was surrounded pale forms moved across the forest floor some as big as men others as small as children she caught indistinct glimpses of faces lost in the folds of gowns and shrouds flashes of torn feet broken skin and large dark eyes rooted to the spot she tried to scream but no sound came then a voice spoke and it was her voice yet it did not come from her leave the voice said and marianne thought that she felt a hand brush against her skin and she saw a man descending upon her moloch yet not moloch and she felt him enter her and the blade beginning its work cutting and tearing at her she was dying and others were dying around her the voice came again a soft womans voice leave and the gray shapes continued to weave around her disappearing beneath rocks and under tree trunks descending through all the dark hollow places and into the world below the last to sink away was a woman marianne could see the swell of breasts beneath her clothing and her long hair gently brushing the snow before she descended the woman stared back at her and marianne looked into her own face it was a face ruined by old wounds its nose broken and its cheekbones shattered its eyes a deep black as though colonized by some terrible cancer but it was still a face that closely resembled her own then the woman found a gap between the roots of a great beech tree and was gone dexter had made it to the edge of the old mans yard half stumbling half crawling until he reached the treeline he had jammed wads of bills now soaked with red into the waistband of his pants ahead of him he could see a narrow pathway leading from the cliff edge to the shore the boat would be down there if he could get to it he would take his chances on the sea if he stayed on the island he would be found or he would die he leaned against a tree trunk to catch his breath but when he tried to rise again he found that he could not his body had taken too many shots he had lost too much blood he was weakening dexter slid down the bark until he came to rest on the ground the blizzard was easing he noticed the snow was falling more gently now he stretched his legs out before him and removed the money from his pants the bills were smeared so thickly with his blood that he could barely read the denominations he removed the band from one of the wads spread the notes in his hand and watched the wind spirit them away some carried up into the air others dancing across the snow dexter noticed other shapes moving among the discarded bills one came to rest on his leg he reached down and gently touched the moths wings it fluttered against his fingers then took flight he watched it following its progress until it came to rest upon a small girl who stood among the trees watching him dexter could see her long pale hair but her face was lost in shadow she looked almost like a moth herself dexter thought a cloak hung over her shoulders so that when she extended her arms they took on the appearance of wings hey said dexter you think you could help me he swallowed i want to get down to the water i have money you could buy yourself something nice he extended one of the remaining wads of bills toward her the girl moved forward thats it said dexter come on now you help me get out of here and ill the gray girls feet were not touching the ground she floated toward dexter her arms wide and her dark eyes gleaming her skin wrinkled and decayed dexter opened his mouth to scream and the gray girls lips closed on his her hands gripped his head and her knees pinned his arms to the trunk of the tree blood poured from the meeting of their mouths as dexter shook the life slowly being drawn from him and into the gray girl a life taken in return for the life stolen from her and then the gray girl drew back from the dead man her dark eyes closing briefly in ecstasy moths falling dead around her as she followed her companions at last into the depths moloch was ten feet into the tunnel now and rather than narrowing it seemed to have increased in size he paused and listened if the cop decided to come down after him he would be in real trouble but he didnt believe that she would it was a considerable drop down moloch was surprised that he hadnt injured himself in the fall no she would wait maybe look for a rope she would not risk being trapped beneath the earth with him he moved on he had progressed five or six feet more when he thought that he heard movement behind him he stopped and found only silence jittery im getting jittery then he heard it again clearer now for a second he thought it was falling earth and panic hit him as he imagined the tunnel collapsing around him trapping him he listened harder and realized that what he was hearing was scraping the slow movement of earth beneath nails and hands the same sounds that he himself had probably been making since he had begun moving through the tunnel he tried to turn his head but the tunnel was still too narrow to allow him to see clearly behind him the cop it had to be the cop she had come down after all maybe she had brought rope with her or had found some among the detritus of the forest shit he started to pull himself forward again faster now he was certain that he could hear water hell he could even smell it cool air was coming through the tunnel he felt it on his face took a deep breath and then it was gone moloch stopped again the airflow had ceased he had heard no sounds of collapse something had deliberately blocked the tunnel the sounds from behind were drawing closer and now another smell had taken the place of the river and the forest a stench like old meat left to boil in a pot for too long of offal and waste he found himself retching from it light filtered through the tunnel it was silver almost gray he was grateful for it even if he could not identify its source he didnt want to be trapped down here in the darkness with with what he tried to turn his head again and found that he now had enough space to peer behind him the tunnel wall curved slightly but he could still hear the sound it was closer now he thought if it was the cop she would give him some warning if it was the cop whos there he called out the sound stopped but he sensed that his pursuer was at the very edge of the tunnel wall barely out of sight i got a gun he said you better back out now i hear you following me ill use it the light seemed to grow stronger around him there were graywhite worms emerging from the earth of the tunnel wall coiling around it probing then moloch saw the nails on the ends of the pale fingers and the wounds on the back of the hand wounds that would never heal there was movement everywhere now above and below earth dropped onto his head from above as something scrabbled across one of the higher tunnels it was like a honeycomb teeming with dark life moloch heard himself sobbing with fear even as he turned and found himself gilded in silvery light and in the final seconds of life granted to him he saw the womans face her skin gray parchment her hair a handful of strands clinging to the skull the roots of her teeth exposed by the retreating gums and the parted lips he could make out the cuts in her face the damage inflicted by fist and knife the lamp in her hands radiated dimly for in the darkest places even the dead need light he smelled her breath fetid and rank and he heard her voiceknow me husbandas the light died and he was enveloped in darkness hes down there said macy theres nowhere he can go but marianne was pulling her back you dont understand she said theres something else down there too macy looked at her she remembered the tower and the floating child and the look on scarfes face as he stared out into the forest and saw what was pursuing him macy began to run a rumbling sound came from the ground below her and she felt the earth begin to give way beneath her she increased her speed marianne beside her the two women racing as the ground around the site collapsed taking the stones and the cross and the remnants of the settlement with it smothering molochs final cries in the thunder of its destruction chapter eighteen barron sat in the suv over by the portland marine company an empty coffee container from the eleven on congress in the cup holder by his right hand the radio playing some cheap trick for the night owls once or twice prowl cars had passed his way but hed hunched down low in his seat and the cops hadnt even slowed the suv just another vehicle parked in the lot the snow was still falling although the wind had died down some the suv was warm the heat on full blast but he had kept his gloves and coat on just the same barron had spent most of his evening trying to reach a decision about parker the private detective who was nosing around people listened when parker spoke and it was only a matter of time before somebody with real authority started paying attention to his noises about a sexual predator at work in the area possibly a predator in a uniform the men in boston were his only option he was their tame cop in so deep with them now that he could never escape if they heard he was under threat then they might be prepared to deal with his problem for him the russians didnt give a rats ass about reputation or influence they were in it for the money and anything that threatened their sources of income or their carefully cultivated contacts would be annihilated without a moments thought he had once hoped that they might let him go but it had been a faint hope if that was the case he might just have to resign himself to the fact and take advantage of the situation he glanced again at the dashboard clock almost midnight all was quiet if scarfes buddies did come back to the port it looked like they would be able to do so without interference barron had even spotted one or two ships dense with lights braving the bay as the snow began to ease and the wind faded from a howl to a whisper the streets were deserted and scarfes battered grand am was parked not ten feet from where he sat along with two vans they had wheels they were free and clear once they got back to portland barron had done all that he could be expected to do he had waited he had kept an ear to traffic on the two police bands he had his cell phone ready the number he had been given by the men in boston written on a napkin and not stored in the phones memory just in case any of this came back to bite him on the ass then his scanner burst into life and next thing barron knew there was a chopper being readied for a run to dutch the coast guard was moving in and there were enough armed police heading for the water to mount an invasion barron started his engine and drove it had all turned to shit just as he had expected barron ditched the suv at hoyts pond then retrieved his own car and headed home he spent the next two hours pacing his apartment floor wondering if he should run fearing that his colleagues were already coming for him sold out by scarfe to save himself after a while he just had to know he returned to commercial and contrived to bump into one of the detectives from headquarters who gave him the lowdown on the situation dupree was dead killed by persons yet to be identified some maybe all of those responsible were also dead but they were still searching the island macy had blooded herself terry scarfe who appeared to be tied in with those involved had died at her hands barron was particularly happy to receive this last piece of information if he had survived scarfe would have fed him to the department like fish bait barron returned to his apartment relieved and began to feel the old urge gnawing at him brought on in part by his relief at what he had learned about the events on dutch his appetites had forced him to risk his job and jail time for men he didnt know yet he was still unable to control his urges lipska the little polack who acted as bostons representative in maine had promised him some payback if he did as he was told even as he was blackmailing him in anothers name barron felt saliva flooding his mouth and the welcome ache building at his groin he made the call yeah its me something went wrong and the cops moved on the island he gave lipska a summary of what little he knew now i want whats coming to me he sighed when he heard the other mans reply yeah i know i still got to pay but you promised me something fresh with a little off the top for my time barron grinned man you crack me up you really do ill be waiting barrons apartment lay off forest close to the university it took up the entire top floor of the building the rooms below rented out to students and nurses from maine medical they paid their rent to barron although they didnt know it he used an agency to them he was just another tenant barron didnt want them bothering him with their shit he took a beer from the fridge walked to the bathroom and lit some candles then ran a bath testing the water with his fingers to make sure the temperature was okay he wanted it just a little too hot so that it would have cooled down just enough by the time the package arrived he stripped put on a robe then turned some music on low he was just heading back to the kitchen for another beer when there was a knock at his door there had been no buzzer no voice over his intercom he went to his bedside table and took out his gun keeping it to his side and slightly behind his back as he approached the door he looked out of the peephole then relaxed and opened the door there was a boy standing before him fifteen or sixteen at most just the age barron liked he had dark hair and pale skin with reddishpurple smudges beneath his eyes truth be told barron thought he looked kind of ill and for a moment he was worried that maybe the kid had the virus but lipska had assured him that he was clean and that was one thing about lipska he didnt lie about shit like that howd you get up i leave the door open i must have left the door open barron heard himself babbling but hell the kid had something he was almost otherworldly barron felt certain that tonight was going to be special he stepped aside to let the kid enter noticing his faded crude trousers his rough cotton shirt his bare feet bare feet the hell was lipska thinking on a night like this you leave your shoes at the front door barron asked the boy nodded he smelled clean like the sea yeah bet they got real wet maybe tomorrow well head out buy you some sneakers the boy didnt reply instead he looked toward the bathroom steam was rising from the tub you like the water the boy spoke for the first time yes he said he followed the older man into the bathroom his thumbs rubbing against his fingers tracing the grooves that the waves had worn into his skin like an old song waiting for the touch of the victrola needle to bring it alive i like the water very much lipska arrived forty minutes later and tried the buzzer there was no reply he tried twice more then tested the door with his hand it opened at his touch he gestured to the boy waiting in the car and the young man stepped out he wore jeans a white tshirt and a black leather jacket he was shivering as he followed lipska into the house the door to barrons apartment was open when they reached it lipska knocked once then again harder this time the door unlatched beneath the pressure of his hand inside there was water on the floor just a little as if someone had left the shower or the bath without properly drying off first to lipskas left the bathroom door stood half open and he heard the sound of the tap dripping the only light came from there barron he called barron man you in there its lipska he walked to the bathroom door and pushed it open he took in the naked man his knees above the surface of the water his head below it eyes and mouth open one arm dangling over the edge of the tub registered too the faint tang of saltwater that hung in the air he turned to the boy who had remained standing at the door lets go he said dont i get my money said the boy ill give you your money said lipska forget you were ever here just forget you were ever here lipska led the boy down the stairs and out into the street then stopped as two uniformed policemen advanced toward him a plainclothes detective walking close beside them behind the cops he saw the private detective named charlie parker leaning against a mustang parkers face was expressionless as the uniforms separated lipska from the boy only when lipska was cuffed did parker step away from the car and join the cops whats this about said lipska i think you know what this is about said parker no said lipska i dont parker leaned in close to lipskas face its about barron he said its about children epilogue the best way to suppose what may come is to remember what is past george halifax marianne looked out of the window to where the boy sat on the small wooden bench at the end of the garden from that seat it was possible to peer through the branches of the evergreens and catch glimpses of the sea beyond she stood at the sink her hands immersed in soapy water and waited for him to move but he did not he has not cried she thought he has not wept since the night joe dupree died he has not asked that we leave this place and for the present we cannot they are still trying to work out what happened here men are dead and the reporters have washed over the island like a flood questioning anyone who will stand still long enough to talk to them two weeks have gone by and still they ask questions so many had died because of her bonnie claeson was dead and richie too his body had been washed ashore the night after the blizzard the body of another man joined with it both impaled upon a single arrow joe dupree the man who had shared her bed had been laid to rest the week before she had wept by his grave haunted by the thought that he had died believing that he had been used and that she had felt nothing at all for him the police were unwilling to let her leave the state until they had finished their investigation and so the bodies of patricia and bill remained on ice in a morgue until she could officially identify them she had read of the discovery of karen meyers body in the newspapers marianne had brought death upon them all and for that she could never forgive herself they had found her husbands body two days before buried in the remains of a network of tunnels beneath the site it appeared that he had died in the collapse the searchers discovered dirt in his mouthdirt and human remains there were finger bones lodged in his throat throughout the days that followed sharon macy had been her ally her protector the two women united by their experiences the investigators had taken away the money but she had been told quietly that no charges would be filed against her the states of maine and virginia proved remarkably sympathetic to her plight perhaps recognizing that a battered wife fleeing her husband to save herself and her child would sway even the most hardhearted of jurors but danny concerned her most of all he had suffered through a terrible ordeal and had seen men die in front of him she felt that she needed to get him away from the island and the memories it held for him in the hope that time and distance might fade them they were seated at the breakfast table and he was merely toying with his cheerios when shed brought the subject up for the first time i dont want to leave danny replied i want to stay here but after all that has happened it doesnt matter the bad men are dead we may have to leave people here may not want us to stay after what happened they wont make us leave he said and now it was she who seemed to be the younger one the child and he the older one the one offering reassurance how do you know he told me who told you joe he told me it would be okay she let it rest then not wishing to return either of them to the vision of the dying policeman on the floor the ragged wound in his throat and his blood spilling across the tiles it came to her at night unbidden just as she supposed that it came to danny too she would not allow it to torment her sons waking moments as well but then larry amerling came to her and he and jack sat with her in her living room amerling told her that nobody on the island blamed her for what had happened at least nobody who mattered and that she couldnt be held responsible for the actions of her husband the deaths of bonnie and richie and joe would remain with them always and nobody who knew them would ever forget them but they would not be brought back by forcing marianne and danny to leave joe cared for you and i know bonnie and richie did too said amerling of all people they would want you to stay she cried and told them that she would think about it but jack his right arm still in a sling took her hand and hushed her and told her that there was nothing to think about then larry amerling said something very strange maybe im just getting fatalistic in my old age but i think that what happened was meant to happen he said strange as it sounds you and danny were brought here for a reason your husband too there are things about that night that i dont understand and that i dont want to understand ive spoken to officer macy to linda tooker and her sister to old doug newton and others too a lot of people on this island have tales to tell about what they saw that night you didnt cause any of that it was here waiting my guess is that it had been waiting for a long time for the chance to emerge the island feels different now because of it its been purged of something thats troubled it and its at peace you should stay youre part of us sometimes i think you were always part of us now as she stood watching her son she wondered at the change that had come over him in recent days he was quieter more subdued and that was to be expected but rather than his confidence being shaken or his becoming fearful of the world beyond the island he seemed to have grown in assurance as a consequence of the events that had occurred the night sounds that scared her did not trouble him and he no longer even required his nightlight to be left on the little rocket that she had bought for him at abacus in the old port for his last birthday in truth he now appeared happier in the darkness as she watched him a shadow passed over him it must be clouds she thought straining to look up at the winter sky maybe its just the play of light but theres nothing out there nothing that i can see the sky is empty of clouds and the yard is clear but for my son on his bench and the shadow that stretches across him like a sentinel seated on his bench the boy stared straight ahead he did not look behind him even as he saw the shadow grow and felt the presence at his shoulder listen said the giants voice my father told me these things and now i will tell you it is important that we remember so that the nature of the island may be understood the first one who came was named thomas lunt and he brought with him his wife katie and their children erik and johann that was in the spring of with them came the leggits robert and marie marie was pregnant at the time and would later give birth to a boy william others came in the weeks that followed these are their names you must remember them danny its very important that you remember and the boy listened and he remembered all that he was told acknowledgments while sanctuary is an entirely fictitious island
