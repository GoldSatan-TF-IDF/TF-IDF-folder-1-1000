elizabeth george i richard for rob and glenda introduction to exposure i first wrote this story for sisters in crime volume ii having been inspired to do so by taking two summer sessions at cambridge university through a program offered by ucla the first session in was called the country houses of great britain and from it i took my initial inspiration for a story which i called the evidence exposed the second session in was a course on shakespeare and its curious and whimsical look at william shakespeare as a closet marxistno matter the anachronous bent of such a lookbecame part of the foundation for a novel i wrote called for the sake of elena which was set in cambridge the evidence exposed was my first attempt at a crime story in abbreviated form it was also the first short story id written in about twenty years as such it was a noble effort but i was never completely happy with it indeed fairly soon after publication i realized that id killed the wrong person and it became my intention to rewrite the story if i ever had the chance to do so a lot of life supervened in the meantime i always seemed to have other novels under contract courses to teach and research to do occasionally even i was asked to write other short stories and when the request coincided with an idea that i believed could be contained in less than six hundred pages id apply myself once again to the challenging format finally my swedish publisher wanted to put out a slim volume of my storiesof which at this point there were only three i agreed my english publisher discovered this book and weighed in with a request to print it in english my german and french publishers followed suit and in very short order my american publisher made the same request at this point i realized that it was time to rewrite the evidence exposed as well as to add to the small collection two more stories that id been mulling over consequently i set about revising and rewriting the evidence exposed and what you have herefor the first timeis the new version of that older and far clunkier story im quite pleased with the way it came out it has a new point of view and a new victim and abinger manor has a new owner but the rest of the characters remain the same exposure when members of the history of british architecture class thought about the abinger manor affair later on each one of them would say that sam cleary had been the likeliest candidate for murder now you might ask yourself why anyone would have wanted to kill a harmless american professor of botany whoon the surface at leasthad done nothing more than come to cambridge university with his wife to take part in a summer session at st stephens college but thats the crux of the matter you see the with his wife part of it old samseventy if he was a day and a spiffy dresser with a bent for bow ties and tweeds even in the middle of the hottest summer england had seen in decadestended to forget that his wedded frances had come along for the experience as well and when sam forgot that frances was there his eyes started wandering in order to take a visual sampling of the other ladies it appeared to be second nature to the fellow this visual sampling might have been something that frances cleary could have overlooked her husband after all couldnt be expected to walk around cambridge with blinders on and cambridge in the summer brought out fine ladies like mayflies looking for barbecues but when he took to spending long evenings in the college pub entertaining their classmate polly simpson with tales of everything from his childhood spent on a farm in vermont to his years in nam where according to sam he saved his entire platoon singlehandedly well that was too much for frances not only was polly young enough to be sams granddaughter and then some she wasif youll pardon the expressiondropdead gorgeous and blonde and curvy in a way that poor frances hadnt been even in her glory years so when the night before the day in question saw sam cleary and polly simpson in the college pub laughing talking teasing each other as usual giggling like kidswhich at twentythree polly still was as a matter of factand acting otherwise like individuals with something specific on their minds till two in the morning frances finally had words with her husband and her husband wasnt the only one to hear them noreen tucker was the messenger delivering news of this delicate subject over breakfast the next day having been awakened by the sound of francess accelerating displeasure at two twentythree in the morning and having been kept awake by the sound of francess accelerating displeasure till exactly four thirtyseven that was when a slamming door punctuated sams decision to listen no more to his wifes accusations of heartless insensitivity and insidious infidelity under other circumstances an unwilling eavesdropper might have kept her own counsel regarding this overheard marital contretemps but noreen tucker was a woman who liked the spotlight and since she had so far achieved precious little recognition in her thirty years as a romance writer she took her bows where she could thats what she was doing on the morning of the day in question as other members of the history of british architecture class gathered to break bread together in the cavernous dining hall of st stephens college dressed in laura ashley and a straw boater in the mistaken belief that projecting youthfulness equated to youthfulness noreen imparted the salient details of the clearys earlymorning argument and she leaned forward with a glance to the right and the left to underscore both the import and the confidential nature of the information she was sharing i couldnt believe my ears she told her fellow students in breathless summation who looks milder mannered than frances cleary i ask you who and to believe she even knew such language existed why i was just slayed to hear it truly i was completely mortified i didnt know whether i should knock on the wall to quiet her down or go for help although i cant imagine the porter would have wanted to get involved even if id gone for him and anyway if id actually gotten involved in some way there was always the chance that ralph here mightve been pushed into the middle of it trying to defend me you know and i couldnt put him at risk could i sam mightve asked him to step outside and ralph here is in no condition to get into a brawl with anyone are you sweetheart ralph here was more a blob in a safari jacket than an actual person noreens shadow and constant companion no one in the history of british architecture class had managed to get more than ten words from the man in the eleven days theyd been in cambridge and there were those among the larger group of students taking other classes in st stephens college who swore he was altogether mute what went for his condition was hypoglycemia which was the topic noreen segued into once she was done dissecting the cleary marriage and sams attraction to the ladies in general and polly simpson in particular ralph here she informed her listeners was an absolute martyr to the ailment low blood sugar was the curse of ralph heres family she explained and he had the worst case of any of them hed even passed out once at the wheel of their car while on the freeway dont you know it was only through noreens quick thinking and even quicker acting that utter disaster was avoided i grabbed the wheel so fast youd think id been trained as a rescue professional of some sort noreen revealed its astonishing the level we can rise to when the worst happens dont you agree as was her bent she waited for no reply instead she turned to her husband and said youve got your nuts and chews to take on the outing today dont you sweetie my own we cant have you passing out cold in the middle of abinger manor now can we up n the room ralph said into his bowl of corn flakes just make sure you dont leave them there his wife replied you know how you are how you are is henpecked was the description offered by cleve houghton as he joined their table ralph needs exercise not that junk you keep feeding him every time he turns around noreen speaking of junk was noreens rejoinder with a meaningful look at the plate he carried overloaded with eggs sausage grilled tomatoes and mushrooms i wouldnt be so quick to cast stones cleve dear surely that cant be good for your arteries i did eight miles along the backs this morning he replied all the way to grantchester with no heavy breathing so my arteries are fine thank you the rest of you should try some running hell its the best exercise known to man he tossed back his hairthick and dark it was something a man of fifty could be proud ofand caught sight of polly simpson just entering the dining room he amended his comments with the second best exercise and smiled lazily and with hooded eyes in pollys direction noreen tittered goodness cleve rein yourself in i believe shes spoken for already or at least shes spoken about noreen used her own comment as introduction to the topic shed covered before cleves appearance on the scene but she added a few more thoughts this time round most of them centering on polly simpson as a natural born troublemaker and someone certainly fingered by noreen on day one to cause some sort of dissension in their midst after all when she wasnt sucking up to their instructorthe better to massage her final grade no doubtwith exclamations over the beauties in every slide the tiresome woman foisted daily upon her students she was cozying up to one man or another in a way that she probably thought of as friendly but anyone else with a grain of sense would have called outright provocative whats she actually up to i ask you noreen demanded of anyone who was continuing to listen at this point there they sit with their heads together night after night she and sam cleary and doing what you cant tell me theyre discussing flowers theyre laying their plans for afterwards together you mark my words whether the words were marked was something no one commented upon since polly simpson was fast upon her classmates carrying a tray on which shed placed a virtuously weightconscious single banana and a cup of coffee she wore her camera slung round her neck as usual and when she set down her tray she strode to the end of the table and focused her shutter on the group at their morning meal on the afternoon of their first session in the history of british architecture class polly had declared to them that she would be the seminars official historian and so far shed been as good as her word believe me youll want this as a souvenir she announced each time she caught someone in her lens i promise people always like my pictures when they see them jesus polly not now cleve groused as the girl made adjustments to her lens at the far end of the breakfast table but he sounded goodnatured about his complaint and no one missed the fact that he ran one hand back through his hair to give it just the sort of gq tousle that promised to make him look thirty again the whole class isnt present polly dear noreen said and surely you want everyone in the picture dont you polly looked around then smiled and said well heres em and howard showing up weve got most of the crowd but surely not the most important people noreen persisted as the other two students joined them dont you want to wait for sam and frances not everyone needs to be in every picture polly said quite as if noreens question hadnt been fraught with enough undercurrents to drown a gorilla all the samenoreen murmured and she asked emily guy and howard breentwo san franciscans whod buddybonded on the first day of classif theyd run into either sam or frances on l staircase where they all had rooms they didnt get much sleep last night noreen said with a meaningful glance in pollys direction i wonder could they have slept right through their alarm this morning not with howard singing in the shower emily said i heard him from two floors below howard said no day begins right without a morning tribute to barbra noreen not much liking this potential shift in the topic put an end to it by saying and here i thought bette midler was the rage with all of your sort at this there was an uncomfortable little silence at the table pollys lips parted as she lowered her camera emily guy knotted her eyebrows and did her spinstersinnocence bit of pretending she didnt quite understand what noreen was implying cleve houghton snorted always maintaining his manly man pose and ralph tucker kept spooning up corn flakes howard himself was the one to break the silence he said bette midler nope i only like bette if im wearing my high heels and fishnets noreen and i cant get into the shower with them on water ruins the patent leather polly snickered emily smiled and cleve stared at howard a good ten seconds before bellowing an appreciative guffaw id like to see you in heels and fishnets he said all in good time howard replied ill need to eat my breakfast first so noreen tucker you see might also have been a good candidate for murder she liked stirring the pot to discover what sort of burnton goodies were adhering to the bottom and when she had them good and stirred up she liked the way they bittered the brew she didnt realize that she was doing this however her intentions were simple enough no matter what their outcome actually was if conversations revolved around topics she had chosen she could orchestrate the flow of discussion and thereby keep herself at the head of the class being at the head of the class meant having all eyes fixed upon her and having all eyes fixed on her in cambridge ameliorated the sting of having no eyes fixed upon her anywhere else the problem was victoria wilderscott their instructor a dizzy woman who favoured khaki skirts and madras shirts and who habitually and unconsciously sat in class during their discussions in such a way as to show her underpants to the gentleman students victoria was there to fill their minds with the minutiae of british architecture she wasnt the least interested in summer session gossip and she and noreen had been at polite but deadly loggerheads from the first a pitched battle to see who was going to control what went for content in the classroom noreen always tried to sideline her with probing and generally absurd questions about the personal lives of the architects whose work they were studying did christopher wren find his name an impediment to acquiring a lasting love in his life did adams ceilings imply something deeply sensuous and ungovernable within his nature but victoria wilderscott merely stared at noreen like a woman waiting for a translation to be made before she said yes well and brushed noreens questions away like the thirsty female mosquitoes they were shed been preparing her history of british architecture students for the trip to abinger manor from the first day of class abinger manor deep in the buckinghamshire countryside reflected every style of architecture known to great britain while simultaneously being the repository of everything from priceless rococo silver to paintings by english flemish and italian masters victoria had shown her students endless slides of coved ceilings broken pediments gilded capitals on marble pilasters ornate stone drip spouts and dogtoothed cornices and when their brains were saturated with architectural details she sopped up the overflow with additional slides of porcelain silver sculptures tapestries and furniture galore this she told them was the crown jewel of english properties the stately home had only recently been opened to view and the wait to see it among people who were not so fortunate as to be enrolled in the history of british architecture class at cambridge universitys summer session was a minimum of twelve months and thats only if the eager visitor spent days on end trying to get through by telephone for reservations none of this reservationsbyinternet nonsense victoria wilderscott told them at abinger manor they do things the oldfashioned way which was of course the proper way to do them they would see this monument to days gone bynot to mention to proprietyin a few hours after a rather long drive across the countryside they were to meet that morning after breakfast at the queens gate which gave way to garrett hostel lane at the end of which their minicoach would be waiting for them it was here where the assembled students picked up their sack lunches and browsed through them with the usual complaints about institutional food that they were finally joined by a subdued sam cleary and a miserablelooking frances if clothes made a statement about the outcome of their weehours discord sam had clearly emerged the winner dapper as always in a trim sports jacket with his bow tie cleverly complementing the forest green highlights in his tweed trousers frances on the other hand was dowdiness incarnate in a drab toolarge tunic and a matching toolarge pair of trousers she looked like a refugee from the cultural revolution polly seemed eager to mend whatever breach she might have caused between the professor and his wife after all she was nearly fifty years sams junior and a girl with a boyfriend back home in chicago to boot she might have enjoyed the attentions of an older mana really older man as she would have put it in the college pub for several nights running but that was not to say that she would ever have considered fanning the flames of sams interest to build to something more true he was extremely nice looking with all that gray hair and that blush of good health on his cheeks but there was no way around the fact that he was also old and he couldnt compare to pollys own david despite davids so far unshakable and somewhat obsessive interest in developing a career studying howler monkeys polly called out a cheerful good morning to the clearys and motioned to them with her camera shed put on an enormous telephoto lens for their outing which served her purposes well at the moment she could take the picture she wanted of sam and his wife while keeping her distance from them she said stay right there by the herbaceous border the colours are sensational with your hair frances francess hair was gray not that stunning white that some women are blessed with but battleship gray she had a lot of it which was fortunate but the dullness of its colour made her look dour at even her best moments and this not being one of her best moments she looked pretty much the worse for wear amazing what lack of sleep can do to one isnt it noreen tucker murmured with great meaning as the clearys approached the rest of the students after posing cooperativelyat least on sams partfor pollys picture ralph you havent forgotten your nuts and chews have you sweetie we dont want any crises in the hallowed halls of abinger manor this morning ralphs answer comprised a downward motion with his thumb in the direction of his waist this was easily interpretable the plastic bag in which he kept his trail mix was pluming out of his safari jacket like the tail of an infant marsupial if you feel the shakes coming you have a handful of that right away noreen instructed him no waiting around for permission from someone you hear me ralph will do will do ralph meandered over to the lunch bags next to the queens gate and huffed his way down to pick two of them out of the wicker basket that guyll be lucky to make it to sixty cleve houghton said to howard breen and whatre you doing to take care of yourself showering only with friends howard replied they were joined then by victoria wilderscott who steamed in their direction in her khaki and madras with her glasses perched on the top of her head and a threering binder clutched to her bony chest she squinted at her students as if perplexed by the fact that they were out of focus a moment later she realised why she said oops the specs right then and lowered them to her nose as she continued breezily youve all read your brochures i trust and the second chapter in great houses of the british isles so were all perfectly clear on what were going to see at abinger manor that marvelous collection of meissen that you saw in your textbook the finest in england the paintings by gainsborough le brun turner constable and reynolds that lovely piece by whistler the holbein the rococo silver some remarkable furniture the italian sculptures all those wonderful period clothes the gardens are exquisite by the way they rival sissinghurst and the park well we wont have time to see all of it but well do our best you have your notebooks your cameras polly has hers noreen pointed out i believe that makes any others redundant victoria blinked in the direction of their class historian from the first shed made no secret of the fact that she approved of pollys zeal and she only wished more of her students were willing to throw themselves into the cambridge experience in like manner to victoria that was the trouble with agreeing to teach these summer sessions in the first place they were generally flooded by welltodo americans whose idea of learning stopped at watching television documentaries from the comfort of their living room sofas yes well victoria said and beamed at polly have you documented our pending departure get over by the gate you guys polly said in answer lets have a group shot before we take off you pose with the others victoria said ill take the picture not with this camera polly said its got a light meter fit only for an einstein no one can figure it out it belonged to my grandpa is your grandfather still alive then noreen asked archly he must be what polly terribly old seventy perhaps not a bad guess polly said hes seventytwo a real antique yeah but hes a tough old geezer and completely full of polly stopped herself her gaze went to sam then to frances then to noreen who said pleasantly full of what full of wit and wisdom no doubt emily guy put this in like victoria wilderscott she admired polly simpsons energy and enthusiasm and she envied without being consumed by that emotion the fact that life was unspooling before her and not closing off as it was for herself for her own part emily guy had come to cambridge to forget an unhappy love affair with a married man that had consumed the last seven years of her life so any indication in another woman of a propensity to involve herself hopelessly in love triangles was something that she reacted to badly like noreen shed seen polly in conversation with sam cleary in the evenings but unlike noreen shed taken it for nothing more than a young girls kindness towards an older man who was clearly besotted with her frances clearys jealousy was not polly simpsons problem emily guy had decided the first time she saw frances frown over the tabletop in pollys direction further to making amends to frances though polly did her best to stay out of sam clearys sight line for the trip to abinger manor she walked to the minicoach in the company of cleve houghton and she spent the journey to buckinghamshire riding across the aisle from him and involving him in earnest conversation these two activities of course were not missed by noreen tucker who as weve seen liked to start fires wherever she could our polly definitely wants more than a cracker she murmured to her silent husband as they rolled along the parched summer countryside and you can bet what shes after is made out of gold ralph gave no replyit was always rather difficult to tell whether he was cognizant or merely somnambulating his way through a dayso noreen cast around for a more attentive listener finding it in howard breen across the aisle from her he was leafing through the brochure theyd all been given on the glories of abinger manor she said to him age doesnt matter when moneys involved dont you agree howard howard raised his head saying money for what money for baubles money for travel money for living a fancier life hes a doctor divorced got piles of cash and shes been drooling over those slides of victorias since the first day of class if you havent noticed so wouldnt she just love a nice antique or two to take home to chicago as a souvenir and isnt cleve houghton just the man to buy her one now sam clearys been brought into line by frances howard lowered his brochure and looked to his companion on the journeyemily guyfor an interpretation of noreens remarks shes talking about polly and cleve houghton emily said and added in a low voice having moved on from polly and sam its all about money with a girl like that noreen said believe me if you had a bucket or two shed be after you as well howard no matter your well your sexual preferences if i may call them that consider yourself lucky to be escaping howard cast a glance in the direction of polly who was in the process of illustrating some point she was making by gesturing with her hands he said damn escaping i dont want that i can always go either ac or dc if the moons full and the winds blowing from the east im ripe for the plucking matter of fact noreen youve started to look pretty damn good to me in the past few days noreen looked flustered why i hardly think i noticed howard grinned noreen wasnt someone to take a putdown lightly nor was she a woman who chose to respond with a frontal attack she merely smiled and said well if youre bent that way today howard im afraid i cant help you as im spoken for but im sure our emily will be happy to oblige in fact ill bet thats just what shes been hoping for a mans interest can make a woman feel well like anythings possible cant it even that an ac might become a dc on a permanent basis i expect youd like that emily every woman needs a man after all emily grew hot despite the fact that there was no way on earth that noreen tucker could have known anything about her recent past the hopes shed invested in a love affair that had seemed like a case of starcrossed lovers meeting at last and had turned out to be nothing more than a squalid little attempt to make something special from what was actually a series of hurried couplings in hotels that had left her feeling lonelier than before so she wasnt the first person that day to think that noreen tucker might serve a greater purpose for mankind by being rubbed off the planet at the front of the coach victoria wilderscott had spent most of the trip across the countryside expatiating by microphone on the beauties of abinger manor she appeared to be making the peroration of her remarks as the tour coach turned down a leafy lane thus the family remained staunchly royalist to the end in the north tower youll see a priests hole where king charles was hidden prior to his escape to the continent and in the long gallery youll be challenged to find a gibb door thats completely concealed it was through this door that the king began his escape on that fateful night and it was because of the familys continued loyalty to him that the owner was later elevated to the rank of earl that title has passed down through the family of course and while the present earl comes only at the weekends to the estate his motherwho herself by the way is the daughter of the sixth earl of ashertonlives on the grounds and i wouldnt be surprised if we ran into her shes known for mixing in with the guests a bit of an eccentric as these types frequently are when the tour coach made its final turn and the history of british architecture class got their first glimpse of abinger manor an appreciative murmur went up among them despite whatever else was on their minds victoria wilderscott turned in her seat delighted to hear their reaction to the place she said i promised you didnt i it does not disappoint across a moat that was studded with lily pads two crenellated towers stood at the sides of the buildings front entry they rose five stories and on either side of them crowstepped gables were surmounted by impossibly tall impossibly decorated chimneys bay windows a later addition to the house extended over the moat and gave inhabitants a view of the extensive garden this was edged on one side by a tall yew hedge and on the other by a brick wall against which grew an herbaceous border of lavender aster and dianthus the history of british architecture class wandered towards this with a quarter hour to explore it prior to their scheduled tour they were not the only visitors to the manor that morning a large tour coach pulled into the environs of the manor directly behind them and from it debouched a crowd of german tourists who immediately joined polly simpson in taking photographs of the front of the manor house two family groups arrived simultaneously in range rovers and immediately struck out for the maze in which they quickly became lost and began shouting at each other to help them find their way and a silver bentley joined the other vehicles moments later gliding to a stop in near perfect silence from this final vehicle a handsome couple stepped the man tall and blond and dressed with the sort of casual flair that suggests money the woman dark and lithe and yawning as if shed slept for most of the journey unbeknownst to the rest of the visitors to abinger manor on this day in question these last two arrivals were thomas lynley and his intended bride lady helen clyde and they had a vested interest in being there since the primary inhabitant of abinger manor was lynleys own fearsome aunt augusta the aforementioned dowager countess who wished her nephew to see for himself that one could open ones property to view without disaster dancing attendance she wanted him to do the same with his own extensive property in cornwall but so far shed not made much progress persuading him of the ideas efficacy were not all the duchess of devonshire lynley would tell her gently if a nexttonothing mitford can do it and bring it off then so bloody well can i was her reply but they didnt go in search of aunt augusta as well they might have done considering the relationship instead thomas lynley and helen clyde joined the others in the garden and admired what his aunt had done to keep it blooming despite the drought of course the others had no way of knowing that this thomas lynley who quietly walked round the garden with his arm lightly dropped round his future wifes shoulders was actually a member of the family who now lived in a single wing of the stately building but more importantlyespecially considering the events that were to occur within that buildingthe others had no way of knowing that his means of employment was as a detective with new scotland yard instead what they saw was what people generally saw when they looked upon thomas lynley and helen clyde the careful expenditure of money on an unostentatious quality of appearance and of dress the polite and deferential silence of years of good breeding and a bond of love that looked like friendship because it was from friendship that that love had blossomed in other words they were grossly out of place among the visitors to abinger manor that day when the bell rang for the tour to begin the group assembled at the front door they were greeted by a determinedlooking girl in her midtwenties with spots on her chin and too much eye makeup she ushered them inside locked the door behind them in case anyone had any ideas of absconding with a preciousnot to mention portableknickknackand she began speaking in the sort of english that suggested shed been well prepared for foreigners simple words simply spoken with plenty of pauses they were she told them in the original screens passage of the manor house the wall to their left was the original screen they would be able to admire its carving when they got to the other side of it if they would please stay together and not stray behind the cordedoff areas photographs were permitted only without a flash things went well at first the group maintained a respectful silence and pictures were taken dutifully without flash the only questions asked were asked by victoria wilderscott and if the guide offered apocryphal answers no one was the wiser it was in this manner that they came to the great hall a magnificent room that was everything victoria wilderscott had promised her students it would be while the guide catalogued its features for them the group dutifully took note of the towering coved ceiling of the minstrel gallery and its intricate fretwork of the tapestries the portraits the fireplaces and the carpets cameras focused and clicked appreciative murmurs rose somewhere in the room a clock delicately chimed half past ten as if in accompaniment to this a ferocious growl interrupted the guides programmed speech someone giggled and a few people turned to see polly simpson clutching her stomach sorry she said only a banana for breakfast this remark lit something of a fire beneath the normally taciturn ralph tucker while the tour group attended back to their guide he sidled over to polly and gallantly offered her the front of his safari jacket energy boost he said good for the blood she smiled her thanks at him and dipped her hand inside to scoop out some trail mix he did the same of course they had to eat surreptitiously and they did it like two naughty school kids with attendant snickers of mischief it was easy enough to carry off since their guide was leading them out of the great hall where they went up a flight of stairs and into a narrow corridorlike room this long gallery the guide informed them as they assembled behind a velvet cord that ran the length of the room is one of the most famous in england it contains not only the finest collection of rococo silver in the country part of which you can see arranged to the left of the fireplace on that demilune table thats a sheraton piece by the waybut also a le brun two gainsboroughs a reynolds a holbein a charming whistler two turners three van dycks and a number of lesser known artists in the case at the end of the room youll find a hat gloves and stockings that belonged to elizabeth the first and heres one of the most remarkable features in the entire house she walked to the left of the sheraton table and pushed lightly on a section of the paneling a door swung open previously hidden by the structure of the wall several of the german tourists clapped appreciatively the guide said its a gibb door clever isnt it servants could come and go through it and never be seen in the public rooms of the house cameras clicked in the guides direction necks craned voices murmured and thats when it happened the guide was saying id like you to especially take note of when events conspired to interrupt her someone gasped hon nor hon and someone else cried oh my god a third voice called out watch out ralphs going down and in short order thats exactly what happened ralph tucker gave an inarticulate cry and crashed down onto one of abinger manors valuable satinwood tables he upset an enormous flower arrangement smashed a porcelain bowl of potpourri which sent its contents flying across the persian carpet and toppled the table onto its side this in effect ripped the velvet cord from its brass posts down the entire length of the room as ralph landed in an unmoving heap on the floor noreen tucker shrieked ralph sweetie pie and plunged through the crowd to get to her spouse she pulled on his shoulder as chaos broke out around her people pressed forward others backed away someone began praying someone else cursing three german women fell onto sofas that were available now that the line of demarcation was gone a man shouted for water while another called for air there were thirtytwo people in the room with absolutely no one in charge since the guidewhose training had been limited to memorizing salient details about the furnishings of abinger manor and not first aidstood rooted to the floor as if she herself had had some part in whatever had just happened to ralph tucker voices came from every direction is he jesus he cant be ralph ralphie sie ist gerade ohnmdchtig geworden nicht wahr someone call an ambulance for gods sake this last was said by cleve houghton whod managed to fight his way through the crowd and who had dropped to his knees had taken one look at ralph tuckers face and had begun administering cpr now he shouted at the guide who finally roused herself flew through the gibb door and pounded up the stairs ralphie ralphie noreen tucker wailed as cleve paused took ralphs pulse and went back to cpr kami er nicht etwas unternehmen one of the germans cried as another said schauen sie sich die gesichtsfarbe an it was then that thomas lynley joined cleve removing his jacket and handing it over to helen clyde he eased through the crowd straddled the elephantine figure of ralph tucker and took over the heart massage as cleve houghton moved to ralphs mouth and continued blowing into the mans lungs save him save him noreen cried help him please victoria wilderscott reached her side she said theyre helping him dear if youll come this way i wont leave my ralph he just needed to eat is he choking someone asked have you tried the heimlich and the tour guide crashed back into the room she called out ive just phoned but her words faltered then stopped she could see as well as everyone else that the two men working on the body on the floor were attempting to revive what was already a corpse thomas lynley took charge at this point he brought forth his warrant card and showed it to the guide saying quietly thomas lynley new scotland yard have someone tell my auntlady fabringhamtheres been a mishap in the gallery but for gods sake keep her out of here all right he knew augustas propensity for involving herself in matters not her concern and the last thing they needed was to have her tramping round giving orders which would only complicate matters an ambulance was on its way after all and there was nothing more to be done other than to get this unfortunate individual to hospital where hed be pronounced dead by an official employed for just that purpose lynley suggested that the others continue on their tour if for no other reason than to clear the room for the arrival of the rescue crew no one much felt like going forward to see the further glories of abinger manor at this juncture but leaving the weeping noreen tucker behind the rest of the company filed obediently out of the room this was not before lynley bent to the body on the floor however and opened the fist that was clenched in death cleve houghton said to him heart failure ive seen them go like this before but while lynley nodded he made no reply instead he examined the remains of the trail mix that dribbled from ralphs fingers onto the floor when he looked up it was not at cleve but rather at the departing group and he looked at them with serious speculation because it was more than clear to the countryborn thomas lynley if to no one else at the moment that ralph tucker had been murdered while noreen tucker sank weeping into a priceless chippendale chair and helen clyde went to her and put a comforting hand upon her shoulder the door closed behind the tour group and within moments they were being asked to admire the drawing room especially the pendant plasterwork of its remarkable ceiling it was called the king edward drawing room their muchsubdued guide told them its name taken from the statue of edward iv that stood over the mantelpiece it was a threequartersize statue she explained not lifesize for unlike most men of his time edward iv was well over six feet tall in fact when he rode into london on the twentysixth of february in frankly no one could believe that the young woman was going on there was something indecent about being asked to admire chandeliers flocked wallpaper eighteenthcentury furniture chinese vases and a french chimneypiece in the face of ralph tuckers death no matter that the man was essentially no one to any of them he was still dead and out of respect for his passing they might have abandoned the rest of the tour so everyone was restless and uneasy the air was close composure seemed brittle when cleve houghton finally rejoined them in the winter dining room with the news that ralph tuckers body had been taken away he passed along the information that thomas lynley had also put out a call for the local police police emily guy whispered horrified by the implication the word quickly swept through the rest of the company the students of the history of british architecture class began eyeing each other with grave suspicion everyone knew it had to be the trail mix the difficulty was the same for all of them however no one could root out the answer to the pressing question of why anyone on earth or anywhere else would want to murder ralph tucker noreen tucker yes shed stuck her nose into everyone elses business from day one and she was certainly the least likely among them to win the congeniality award or perhaps sam cleary done in by his wife for stepping outside the vows of marriage one time too many for her liking or even frances herself eliminated by sam to give him a clear shot at something more with polly simpson but ralph no it didnt make sense everyones thoughts thus went in the same general direction it was when they ended up with polly simpson that several individuals remembered a terrible but significant detail polly too had eaten from ralph tuckers trail mix and not for the first time as a matter of fact for hadnt she also dipped into it on their very first outing when ralph in a moment of bonhomie that was not repeated generously offered the mix round the tour coach in place of afternoon tea on their way back to cambridge after a long day looking at properties in norfolk yes she had she alone certainly had so it was possible that she had been fingered for murder with ralph tucker merely an unfortunate casualty whod had to be done away with as well this made more than one person watch polly with some concern waiting for the least sign that she too was about to collapse from whatever it was that had taken ralph from them someone even quietly suggested that she might want to retire to a lavatory and do what she could to upchuck just in case but polly who didnt seem to understand the implication being made merely grimaced at the suggestion and went on taking her pictures albeit noticeably subdued from her usual ebullience death by trail mix naturally brought up the question of poison in peoples minds and that made people ask themselves how someone was supposed to get a poison in cambridge you couldnt just walk into the local pharmacy and ask for something fastacting untraceable and nonmessy so it stood to reason that the poison in question had been brought from home and that led people into thinking more seriously about noreen tucker and whether her devotion to dear ralph was all that it seemed the group was in the library when thomas lynley and his lady rejoined them with lynley running his speculative gaze over everyone in the room his companion did much the same having been brought into the picture while poor ralph was being loaded into the ambulance they separated and took up positions in different parts of the crowd neither of them paid the slightest attention to what the guide was saying instead they gave their full attention to the visitors to abinger manor from the library they went into the chapel accompanied by the sounds of their own footsteps the echoing voice of the guide the occasional snapping of cameras lynley moved through the group saying nothing to anyone save his companion with whom he spoke a few words at the door again they separated from the chapel they went to the armory from there into the billiard room from there into the music room from there they traipsed down two flights of stairs and went into the kitchen the buttery beyond it had been turned into a gift shop and the germans made for this as the americans did likewise it was at this moment that lynley spoke if i might see everyone together he said as they began to scatter if youll just stay here in the kitchen for a moment mild protests rose from the german group the americans said nothing weve a problem to consider im afraid lynley said with regard to mr tuckers death problem sam cleary asked the question as others chimed in with whats going on and what do you want with us it was heart failure cleve houghton asserted ive seen enough of that to tell you as have i a heavily accented voice put in the remark came from a member of the german party and he looked none too pleased that their tour was once again being disrupted i am a doctor i too have seen heart failure i know what i see this begged the question naturally of why the man hadnt done something to help out during the crisis but no one mentioned that fact instead thomas lynley extended his hand in his palm lay half a dozen seeds it looks like heart failure he explained thats what an alkaloid does it paralyzes the heart in a matter of minutes these are yew by the way yew someone asked what was yew those would be from the potpourri victoria wilderscott pointed out it spilled all over the carpet when mr tucker fell lynley shook his head they were mixed in with the nuts in his hand he said and the bag he was carrying in his jacket was peppered with them he was murdered im afraid so everyones secret fears had been harped aright and while some of them dwelled once more on the question of why ralph tucker had been murdered the rest of them looked to the only person in the kitchen who would know beyond a doubt the potential harm contained in a bit of yew the germans in the meantime were protesting heartily the doctor led them you have no business with us he said that man was a stranger i insist that we be allowed to leave of course thomas lynley said i agree and leave you shall just as soon as we solve the problem of the silver what are you talking about it appears that one of you took the opportunity of the chaos in the gallery to remove two pieces of rococo silver from the table by the fireplace theyre milk jugs rather small extremely ornate and definitely missing this isnt my jurisdiction of course but until the local police arrive to start their inquiries into mr tuckers death id like to take care of this small detail of the silver myself he could of course only too easily imagine what his aunt augusta would have to say about the matter if he didnt take care of it what are you going to do frances cleary asked fearfully do you plan to keep us here until one of us admits to something the german doctor scoffed you cannot search us without some authority thats correct of course thomas lynley said unless you agree to be searched silence ensued into it feet shuffled a throat cleared urgent conversation was conducted in german someone rustled papers in a notebook cleve houghton was the first to speak he looked over the group hell i have no objection but the women victoria wilderscott pointed out with some delicacy lynley nodded to his companion who was standing by a display of copper kettles at the edge of the group this is lady helen clyde he told them shell search the women and so they searched the men in the scullery and the women in the warming room across the corridor both thomas lynley and helen clyde made a thorough job of it lynley was all business helen employed a more gentle touch each of them had the individuals in their keeping undress and redress each of them emptied pockets bags rucksacks and canvas totes lynley did all of this in a grim silence designed to intimidate helen chatted with the women in a manner designed to put them at ease in neither case did they find anything however even victoria wilderscott and the tour guide had been searched lynley told them to wait in the tearoom he turned back to the stairway at the far end of the kitchen wheres he going now polly simpson asked hands clutching her camera to her chest hell have to look for the silver in the rest of the house emily guy pointed out but that could take forever frances cleary whispered it doesnt matter does it were going to have to wait for the local police anyway hell no this was heart failure cleve houghton said theres no silver missing its probably being cleaned somewhere but this alas was not the case as lynley discovered when he made the report he did not wish to make to his paternal aunt augusta was all suitable horror and compassion when told that a visitor to her home had died on the premises but she was vengeance incarnate when she learned that a sneaky little criminal had had the sheer audacity to take possession of one of her priceless treasures she expounded for a good five minutes on what she intended to do to the perpetrator of this crime and it was only by assuring his aunt that the lawin the person of himselfwould work tirelessly on her behalf that lynley was able to prevent the woman from accosting the visitors herself he left augusta to the ministrations of her three corgis and retraced his steps to find the tour group they had left the buttery and were being held in the courtyard and lynley could see them from the windows in the private wing where his aunt now lived he studied them taking note of the fact that even in crisis people tended to adhere to cultural stereotypes the germans stood grimly in tiny clusters of people with whom they were already intimate husbands with their wives wives and husbands with their children inlaws with their offspring and grandchildren students with their compatriots they did not venture beyond the boundaries of these already established groups and for the most part they stood in stiff silence the americans on the other hand mingled not only with each other but also with the english family groups whod been on the tour with them they spoke to each other some somberly and some with a fair degree of animation and one among them even took a few pictures lynley had noted polly simpson earlier as a reflex reaction that grew from the fact that hed once been in love with a young photographer he wasnt so many years away from that affair that he hadnt noticedas he would have done during the time of that involvementthe equipment which polly was using it was odd he thought as he watched her how our attachment to a person allows us to learn things that we never expect to learn not only about ourselves not only about them but about aspects of life that we might otherwise remain in ignorance of watching polly below him in the courtyard lynley was able to imagine his former lover in the same circumstance with the same enthusiasm for light and texture and composition able to concentrate on the work she was doing by dismissing what had just preceded it this was part of the resilience of youth he decided somewhat pompously since he himself was not yet forty and having spent fifteen years in pursuit of the criminal element he allowed himself a moment wistfully watching polly simpson at work with her camera before retracing his steps to the group he was crossing through the kitchen on his way to the buttery when the significance of what hed just seen in the courtyard finally struck him and even then it only struck him because hed recalled more than once playing the pack mule for his former lovers photographic equipment hearing her say more to herself than to him ill need the twentyeight millimeter to get this shot and then standing patiently by while she made the switch in her lenses more than that he realised that all throughout the tour and before itas he and helen had made a circuit of the grounds among the other visitors to abinger manorhed seen a truth without actually registering what he was seeing which was so easy to do he thought when you dont consider the logic behind whats in front of your eyes he strode through the buttery from there he went out into the courtyard so sure he was of what he was about to do that he dismissed the germans and the two english families and waited in grim silence while they left the courtyard when they had done so he sought out polly simpson and without ceremony he took the camera from her shoulder she protested with hey thats mine whatre you he silenced her by opening the first of the film containers that were affixed to the strap of the camera it was empty as were the others he said ive been noticing you taking pictures since we arrived how many would you say youve exposed she said i dont know i dont keep count i just keep taking them till i run out but youve brought no extra film have you i didnt think id need it no curious you began taking pictures the moment you stepped into the garden you havent stopped except during the crisis in the gallery i expect or did you photograph that as well emily guy gasped sam cleary said see here and would have gone further had his wife not clutched at his arm whats this all about victoria wilderscott said everyone knows polly always takes pictures indeed with this lens lynley asked its a macro zoom polly said and as lynley grasped the lens forcefully she cried hey dont that thing cost a mint did it lynley said he twisted it off he upended it smartly against the palm of his hand two pieces of silver tumbled out several people gasped a dummy cleve houghton said soberly and every eye in the courtyard went to polly simpson it was a sombre history of british architecture class that returned to cambridge late that evening they were of course minus three of their members what remained of ralph tucker was undergoing the postmortem knife while his widow made the most of her circumstances by accepting the hospitality of a solicitous augusta dowager countess of fabringham who was well aware of americans bent towards litigation at the drop of the hat and was eager to avoid a close encounter with any form of american jurisprudence and polly simpson was in the custody of the local police charged with the primary crime of murder and the secondary thwarted crime of burglary polly simpson was heavily on the minds of her fellow students needless to say and needless to say they all felt rather differently about her sam cleary for one felt a perfect fool for having failed to recognize that pollys fascination with him had in reality extended only as far as his knowledge of botany shed hung on his every word and story it was true but hadnt she guided him most towards his work till she had what she needed from him a poison she could put her hands on simply by taking a walk along the college backs in cambridge frances cleary for another felt reassured true ralph tucker was dead so the cost was high but shed learned that her husband wasnt the object of young girls fatal attraction that shed thought he was so she rested far more secure in her marriage secure enough indeed to allow sam to ride home in the minicoach right next to emily guy emily guy and victoria wilderscott felt disappointed and depressed by the days events but for different reasons victoria wilderscott had just lost the first enthusiastic student shed had in a summer session from america in years while emily guy had discovered that a pretty young girl so much admired because she had no weakness for men had a weakness for something else instead and the men themselveshoward breen and cleve houghton they thought of pollys arrest as a loss for his part cleve mourned the fact that her arrest would put an end to his hopes of getting her to bed despite the twentyseven years between their respective ages and for his part howard breen was happy to see the last of her since her departure left cleve houghton available to him after all one could always hope at the end of the day and thats what the americans actually ended up learning in the history of british architecture class that summer in cambridge hope hadnt worked for polly simpson but thats not to say it wouldnt work for the rest of them introduction to the surprise of his life the inspiration for this story came from a double homicide that caught my attention in the early s it received a great deal of publicity at the time and although the defendant was found not guilty of the charges i spent a lot of time considering his potential for guilt and how if indeed he committed the crime the killing might have come about heres what i concluded although there were two victims of that crimea young man and a slightly older womanit seemed to me that the wife was the target the husband was an obsessive man estranged from his wife his life was dominated by thoughts of her specifically with thoughts of how she had left him and in leaving him how she had humiliated him he was a minor celebrity in his mind she was nothing yet she walked out on him and to make matters worse she no longer gave any indication that things might work out eventually between them shed initially said she wanted acoolingoff period because their relationship was so volatile hed agreed to that but now she was talking about divorce and the dword made him feel like a fool not only would he probably lose his kidsthey had two of them a boy and a girlbut a divorce was going to cost him a bucket and she didnt deserve a dime of what he had thoughts like these began swarming in his mind until every hour of every day was torture for the husband only when he slept was he free from the wife and from her plans to take his kids take his money and no doubt hook up with some young stud all at his expense but even then at night the husband dreamed about her and the thoughts during the day and the dreams at night were driving him so crazy he thought hed die if he couldnt do something about them it seemed to him that the only way to wipe her out of his mind was to kill her she deserved it anyway hed always watched how she came on to men shed probably been unfaithful to him a dozen times already she was a lousy wife and a lousy mother and hed be doing his kids a favor at the same time as hed be wiping her out of his mind if he just got rid of her so he laid his plans he and the wife lived no great distance apart if he got his timing down to the second he could zip over to her house kill her and be back at his own placeall within about fifteen minutes maybe less but he knew that the cops would want him to account for every second on the night his wife was murdered so he decided to set things up for a night when he had a flight to catch to another part of the country to make things look even tighter hed phone a limousine to take him to the airport who the heck he thought would ever figure that a killer would off his wife barely a half hour before a limo was picking him up the question of the weapon was a tricky one he couldnt use a gun for obvious reasons it was a crowded neighborhood and one gunshot would have everyone out in the street wondering what was going on he couldnt shoot her inside her house either because their children would be upstairs in bed and the last thing he wanted was to have them wake up and come running down to find their dad standing over their mothers body with a smoking gun there was always a garrote but that allowed her to be able to fight him off so no he needed something quick like a gun but silent like a garrote and a knife seemed like the only answer so on the night in question he dressed in black so as not to leave any forensic evidence behind he wore gloves on his hands and a knitted cap on his head he was a big mantall hefty muscular and strongand she was small if everything went according to plan hed have her out of the way in less than a minute and then hed be free of her at last he went to her house a townhouse which was set back from the street behind a wall he knocked on the door she had a dog but the dog knew him and shouldnt be a problem oddly enough she opened the door to his knock instead of asking who it was the way she normally did but that also was of no account he asked her if shed just step outside so they could talk for a minute without waking up the kids im heading out in an hour he told her i wanted to talk to you about what his decision to go ahead and not contest the divorce the settlement she wanted one or both of their children it doesnt matter because whatever he asked to talk to her about was what got her to step outside the house and when she did that he was upon her so quickly that she never knew whathit her he spun her around plunged the knife into her neck and he slashed it across her throat with a power that came from the fury he felt toward her because she wouldnt get out of his mind because she was going to take his children because she was going to rob him blind just because it was over in an instant he lowered her dead and bloody body to the ground and turned to leave just as the gate opened and a young man entered he was on a friendly errand simply returning a pair of sunglasses to their owner he was on his way home from work and the last thing he expected to see was the husband with a knife in his hand and his wifes mutilated body on the ground before him the young mans first reaction was to draw a breath in shock he said what thebut he had time for no more the husband leapt upon him with the knife in his hand slashing and stabbing there was no noise this was not a hollywood movie where men fight for their lives to the accompaniment of sound effects and music this was real and in a real fight there is only silence broken by grunts or groans neither of which are audible behind a wall during the fight the husband lost the knitted hat he had on he lost one of the gloves he was covered with blood and his own knife had cut him on the hand but he prevailed the young man died his only crime being helpful the husband now had a problem on his hands though valuable time had been lost in the second killing he couldnt stop to find the hat and the glove he also had to get home throw his clothes into the washer get into the shower and get out to that limousine this was what he did losing the second glove in his haste as for the knife that was not a problem he put it in his golf bag which he was taking with him on his trip the golf bag might have been xrayed at the airport with the baggage set to go into the hold of the jet but among the golf clubs it would hardly be noticed and even if it was it didnt constitute an explosive so it would hardly be remarked upon when he arrived at his destination his plan was simple to execute he dressed in sweats and went out for an earlymorning run he took the knife with him and disposed of it somewhere along the route within a scant few hours he would be notified of his wifes murder but he had his alibi and even if that didnt hold up he had plenty of money to hire lawyers to get him out of whatever mess that kid with the sunglasses caused him when i considered that crime and the husbands potential for guilt it triggered within me the idea for the short story that follows in it a husband begins obsessing about his young wifes faithlessness with unexpected results the surprise of his life when douglas armstrong had his first consultation with thistle mccloud he had no intention of murdering his wife his mind in fact didnt turn to murder until two weeks after consultation number four at that time douglas watched closely as thistle prepared herself for a revelation from another dimension she held his wedding band in the palm of her left hand she closed her fingers around it she hovered her right hand over the fist that shed made and she hummed five notes that sounded suspiciously like the beginning of i love you truly gradually her eyes rolled back up and out of view beneath her yellowshaded lids leaving him with the disconcerting sight of a thirtysomething female in a straw boater striped vest white shirt and polkadotted tie looking as if she were one quarter of a barbershop quartet in desperate hope of finding her partners when hed first seen thistle douglas had appraised her attirewhich in subsequent visits had not altered in any appreciable fashionas the insidious getup of a charlatan who wished to focus her clients attention on her personal appearance rather than on whatever machinations she would be going through to delve into their pasts their presents their futures andmost importantlytheir wallets but hed come to realize that thistles odd getup had nothing to do with distracting anyone the first time she held his old rolex watch and began speaking in a low intense voice about the prodigal son about his endless departures and equally endless returns about his aging parents who welcomed him always with open arms and open hearts about his brother who watched all this with a false fixed smile and a silent shout of what about me do i mean nothing he had a feeling that thistle was exactly what she purported to be a psychic hed first come to her storefront operation because hed had forty minutes to kill prior to his yearly prostate exam he dreaded the exam and the teethgrating embarrassment of having to answer his doctors jovial ribpoking everything up and about as it should be with the truth which was that newtons law of gravity had begun asserting itself lately to his dearest appendage and since he was six weeks short of his fiftyfifth birthday and since every disaster in his life had occurred in a year that was a multiple of five if there was a chance of knowing what the gods had in store for him and his prostate he wanted to be able to do something to head off the chaos these things had all been on his mind as he spun along pacific coast highway in the dim gold light of a late december afternoon on a drearily commercialized section of the roadgiven largely to pizza parlors and boogie board shopshe had seen the small blue building that hed passed a thousand times before and read psychic consultations on its handpainted sign hed glanced at his gas gauge for an excuse to stop and while he pumped super unleaded into the tank of his mercedes across the street from that small blue building he made his decision what the hell hed thought there were worse ways to kill forty minutes so hed had his first session with thistle mccloud who was anything but what hed expected of a psychic since she used no crystal ball no tarot cards nothing at all but a piece of his jewelry in his first three visits it had always been the rolex watch from which shed received her psychic emanations but today shed placed the watch to one side declared it diluted of power and set her fogcolored eyes on his wedding ring shed touched her finger to it and said ill use that i think if you want something further from your history and closer to your heart hed given her the ring precisely because of those last two phrases further from your history and closer to your heart they told him how very well she knew that the prodigal son business rose from his past while his deepest concerns were attached to his future now with the ring in her closed fist and with her eyes rolled upward thistle stopped the fivenote humming breathed deeply six times and opened her eyes she observed him with a melancholia that made his stomach feel hollow what douglas asked you need to prepare for a shock she said its something unexpected it comes from nowhere and because of it the essence of your life will be changed forever and soon i feel it coming very soon jesus he thought it was just what he needed to hear three weeks after having an indifferent index finger shoved up his ass to see what was the cause of his limpdick syndrome the doctor had said it wasnt cancer but he hadnt ruled out half a dozen other possibilities douglas wondered which one of them thistle had just tuned her psychic antennae onto thistle opened her hand and they both looked at his wedding ring where it lay on her palm faintly sheened by her sweat its an external shock she clarified the source of upheaval in your life isnt from within the shock comes from outside and rattles you to your core are you sure about that douglas asked her as sure as i can be considering the armor you wear thistle returned the ring to him her cool fingers grazing his wrist she said your name isnt david is it it never was david it never will be david but the d i feel is correct am i right he reached into his back pocket and brought out his wallet careful to shield his drivers license from her he clipped a fiftydollar bill between his thumb and index finger he folded it and handed it over donald she said no that isnt it either darrell perhaps dennis i sense two syllables names arent important in your line of work are they douglas said no but the truth is always important someday notdavid youre going to have to learn to trust people with the truth trust is the key trust is essential trust he told her is what gets people screwed outside he walked across the highway to the cramped side street that paralleled the ocean here he always parked his car when he visited thistle with its vanity license plate drilit virtually announcing who owned the mercedes douglas had decided early on that it wouldnt encourage new investors if someone put the word out that the president of south coast oil had begun seeing a psychic regularly risky investments were one thing placing money with a man who could be accused of using parapsychology rather than geology to find oil deposits was another he wasnt doing that of course business never came up in his sessions with thistle but try telling that to the board of directors try telling that to anyone he unarmed the car and slid inside he headed south in the direction of his office as far as anyone at south coast oil knew hed spent his lunch hour with his wife having a romantic winters picnic on the bluffs in corona del mar the cellular phone will be turned off for an hour hed informed his secretary dont try to phone and dont bother us please this is time for donna and me any mention of donna always did the trick when it came to keeping south coast oil off his back for a few hours she was warmly liked by everyone in the company she was warmly liked by everyone period sometimes he reflected suddenly she was too warmly liked especially by men you need to prepare for a shock did he douglas considered the question in relation to his wife when he pointed out mens affinity for her donna always acted surprised she told him that men merely recognized in her a woman whod grown up in a household of brothers but what he saw in mens eyes when they looked at his wife had nothing to do with fraternal affection it had to do with getting her naked getting down and dirty and getting laid its an external shock was it what sort douglas thought of the worst getting laid was behind every manwoman interaction on earth he knew this well so while his recent failures to get it up and get it on with donna frustrated him he had to admit that he was feeling concerned that her patience with him was trickling away once it was gone shed start looking around that was only natural and once she started looking she was going to find or be found the shock comes from outside and rattles you to your core shit douglas thought if chaos was about to steamroller into his life as he approached his fiftyfifth birthdaythat rotten bad luck integerdouglas knew that donna would probably be at the wheel she was twentynine four years in place as wife number three and while she acted content hed been around women long enough to know that still waters did more than simply run deep they hid rocks that could sink a boat in seconds if a sailor didnt keep his wits about him and love made people lose their wits love made people go a little bit nuts of course he wasnt nuts he had his wits about him but being in love with a woman nearly thirty years his junior a woman whose scent caught the nose of every male within sixty yards of her a woman whose physical appetites he himself was failing to satisfy on a nightly basis and had been failing to satisfy for weeks a woman like that get a grip douglas told himself brusquely this psychic stuff is baloney right right but still he thought of the coming shock the upset to his life and its source external not his prostate not his dick not an organ in his body but another human being shit he said he guided the car up the incline that led to jamboree road six lanes of concrete that rolled between stunted liquidambar trees through some of the most expensive real estate in orange county it took him to the bronzed glass tower that housed his pride south coast oil once inside the building he navigated his way through an unexpected encounter with two of scos engineers through a brief conversation with a geologist who simultaneously waved an ordnance survey map and a report from the epa and through a hallway conference with the head of the accounting department his secretary handed him a fistful of messages when he finally managed to reach his office she said nice picnic the weathers unbelievable isnt it followed by everything all right mr armstrong when he didnt reply he said yes what fine and looked through the messages he found that the names meant nothing to him he walked to the window behind his desk and looked at the view through its enormous pane of tinted glass below him orange countys airport sent jet after jet hurtling into the sky at an angle so acute that it defied both reason and aerodynamics although it did protect the delicate auditory sensibilities of the millionaires who lived in the flight path below douglas watched these planes without really seeing them he knew he had to answer his telephone messages but all he could think about was thistles words an external shock what could be more external than donna she wore obsession she put it behind her ears and beneath her breasts whenever she passed through a room she left the scent of herself behind her dark hair gleamed when the sunlight hit it she wore it short and simply cut parted on the left and smoothly falling just to her ears her legs were long when she walked her stride was full and sure and when she walked with himat his side with her hand through his arm and her head held backhe knew that she caught the attention of everyone he knew that together they were the envy of all their friends and of strangers as well he could see this reflected in the faces of people they passed when he and donna were together at the ballet at the theater at concerts in restaurants glances gravitated to douglas armstrong and his wife in womens expressions he could read the wish to be young like donna to be smoothskinned again to be vibrant once more to be fecund and ready in mens expressions he could read desire it had always been a pleasure to see how others reacted to the sight of his wife but now he saw how dangerous her allure really was and how it threatened to destroy his peace a shock thistle had said to him prepare for a shock prepare for a shock that will change your world that evening douglas heard the water running as soon as he entered the house fiftytwohundred square feet of limestone floors vaulted ceilings and picture windows on a hillside that offered an ocean view to the west and the lights of orange county to the east the house had cost him a fortune but that had been all right with him money meant nothing hed bought the place for donna but if hed had doubts about his wife beforeborn of his own performance anxiety growing to adulthood through his consultation with thistlewhen douglas heard the water running he began to see the truth because donna was in the shower he watched her silhouette behind the blocks of translucent glass that defined the showers wall she was washing her hair she hadnt noticed him yet and he watched her for a moment his gaze traveling over her uplifted breasts her hips her long legs she usually bathedlanguorous bubble baths in the raised oval tub that looked out on the lights of the city of irvine taking a shower suggested a more earnest and energetic effort to cleanse herself and washing her hair suggested well it was perfectly clear what that suggested scents got caught up in the hair cigarette smoke sautéing garlic fish from a fishing boat or semen and sex those last two were the betraying scents obviously she would have to wash her hair her discarded clothes lay on the floor with a hasty glance at the shower douglas fingered through them and found her lacy underwear he knew women he knew his wife if shed actually been with a man that afternoon her bodys leaking juices would have made the panties crotch stiff when they dried and he would be able to smell the afterscent of intercourse on them they would give him proof he lifted them to his face doug what on earth are you doing douglas dropped the panties cheeks hot and neck sweating donna was peering at him from the showers opening her hair lathered with soap that streaked down her left cheek she brushed it away what are you doing he asked her three marriages and two divorces had taught him that a fast offensive maneuver threw the opponent off balance it worked she popped back into the waterclever of her so he couldnt see her faceand said its pretty obvious im taking a shower god what a day he moved to watch her through the showers opening there was no door just a partition in the glassblock wall he could study her body and look for the telltale signs of the kind of rough lovemaking he knew that she liked and she wouldnt know he was even looking since her head was beneath the shower as she rinsed off her hair steve phoned in sick today she said so i had to do everything at the kennels myself she raised chocolate labradors he had met her that way seeking a dog for his youngest son through a reference from a veterinarian he had discovered her kennels in midway city less than one square mile of feedstores other kennels and dilapidated postwar stucco and shake roofs posing as suburban housing it was an odd place for a girl from the pricey side of corona del mar to end up professionally but that was what he liked about donna she wasnt true to type she wasnt a beach bunny she wasnt a typical southern california girl or at least thats what he had thought the worst was cleaning the dog runs she said i didnt mind the groomingi never mind thatbut i hate doing the runs i completely reeked of dog poop when i got home she shut off the shower and reached for her towels wrapping her head in one and her body in the other she stepped out of the stall with a smile and said isnt it weird how some smells cling to your body and your hair while others dont she kissed him hello and scooped up her clothes she tossed them down the laundry chute no doubt she was thinking out of sight out of mind she was clever that way thats the third time steves phoned in sick in two weeks she headed for the bedroom drying off as she went she dropped the towel with her usual absence of selfconsciousness and began dressing pulling on wispy underwear black leggings a silver tunic if he keeps this up im going to let him go i need someone consistent someone reliable if hes not going to be able to hold up his endshe frowned at douglas her face perplexed whats wrong doug youre looking at me so funny is something wrong wrong no but he thought that looks like a love bite on her neck and he crossed to her for a better look he cupped her face for a kiss and tilted her head the shadow of the towel that was wrapped around her hair dissipated leaving her skin unmarred well what of it he thought she wouldnt be so stupid as to let some heavy breather suck bruises into her flesh no matter how turned on he had her she wasnt that dumb not his donna but she also wasnt as smart as her husband at five fortyfive the next day he went to the personnel department it was a better choice than the yellow pages because at least he knew that whoever had been doing the background checks on incoming employees at south coast oil was simultaneously competent and discreet no one had ever complained about some twobit gumshoe nosing into his background the department was deserted as douglas had hoped the computer screens at every desk were set to the shifting images that preserved them a field of swimming fish bouncing balls and popping bubbles the directors office at the far side of the department was unlit and locked but a master key in the hand of the company president solved that problem douglas went inside and flipped on the lights he found the name he was looking for among the dogeared cards of the directors rolodex a curious anachronism in an otherwise computerage office cowley and son inquiries he read in faded typescript this was accompanied by a telephone number and by an address on balboa peninsula douglas studied both for the space of two minutes was it better to know or to live in ignorant bliss he wondered at this eleventh hour but he wasnt living in bliss was he and he hadnt been living in bliss from the moment hed failed to perform as a man was meant to so it was better to know he had to know knowledge was power power was control he needed both he picked up the phone douglas always went out for lunchunless a conference was scheduled with his geologists or the engineersso no one raised a hair of an eyebrow when he left south coast oil before noon the following day he used jamboree once again to get to the coast highway but this time instead of heading north toward newport where thistle made her prognostications he drove directly across the highway and down the incline where a modestly arched bridge spanned an oily section of newport harbor that divided the mainland from an amoebashaped portion of land that was balboa island in summer the island was infested with tourists they bottled up the streets with their cars and rode bicycles in races on the sidewalk around the islands perimeter no local in his right mind ventured onto balboa island during the summer without good reason or unless he lived there but in winter the place was virtually deserted it took less than five minutes to snake through the narrow streets to the islands north end where the ferry waited to take cars and pedestrians on the eyeblink voyage across to the peninsula there a stripetopped carousel and a ferris wheel spun like two opposing gears of an enormous clock defining an area called the fun zone which had long been the summertime bane of the local police today however no bands of juveniles roved with cans of spray paint at the ready the only inhabitants of the fun zone were a paraplegic in a wheelchair and his bikeriding companion douglas passed them as he drove off the ferry they were intent upon their conversation the ferris wheel and carousel did not exist for them nor did douglas and his blue mercedes which was just as well he didnt particularly want to be seen he parked just off the beach in a lot where fifteen minutes cost a quarter he pumped in four he armed the car and headed west toward main street a treeshaded lane some sixty yards long that began at a faux new england restaurant overlooking newport harbor and ended at balboa pier which stretched out into the pacific ocean graygreen today and unsettled by roiling waves from a winter alaskan storm number b main was what he was looking for and he found it easily just east of an alley was a twostory structure whose bottom floor was taken up by a timewarped hair salon called jjsheavily devoted to macramé potted plants and posters of janis joplinand whose upper floor was divided into offices that were reached by means of a structurally questionable stairway at the north end of the building number b was the first door upstairsjjs natural haircutting appeared to be abut when douglas turned the discolored brass knob below the equally discolored brass nameplate announcing the business as cowley and son inquiries he found the door locked he frowned and looked at his rolex his appointment was for twelvefifteen it was currently twelveten so where was cowley where was his son he returned to the stairway ready to head to his car and his cellular phone ready to track down cowley and give him hell for setting up an appointment and failing to be there to keep it but he was three steps down when he saw a khakiclad man coming his way sucking up an orange julius with the enthusiasm of a twelveyearold his thinning gray hair and sunlined face marked him at least five decades older than twelve however and his limping gaitin combination with his clothessuggested old war wounds you cowley douglas called from the stairs the man waved his orange julius in reply you armstrong he asked right douglas said listen i dont have a lot of time none of us do son cowley said and he hoisted himself up the stairway he nodded in a friendly fashion pulled hard on the orange julius straw and passed douglas in a gust of aftershave he hadnt smelled for a good twenty years canoe jesus did they still sell that cowley swung the door open and cocked his head to indicate that douglas was to enter the office comprised two rooms one was a sparsely furnished waiting area through which they passed the other was obviously cowleys demesne its centerpiece was an olivegreen steel desk filing cabinets and bookshelves of the same issue matched it the investigator went to an old oaken office chair behind the desk but he didnt sit instead he opened one of the side drawers and just when douglas was expecting him to pull out a fifth of bourbon he dug out a bottle of yellow capsules instead he shook two of them into his palm and knocked them back with a long swig of orange julius he sank into his chair and gripped the arms arthritis he said im killing the bastard with evening primrose oil give me a minute okay you want a couple no douglas glanced at his watch to make certain cowley knew that his time was precious then he strolled to the steel bookshelves he was expecting to see munitions manuals penal codes and surveillance texts something to assure the prospective clients that theyd come to the right place with their troubles but what he found was poetry volume after volume neatly arranged in alphabetical order by author from matthew arnold to william butler yeats he wasnt sure what to think the occasional space left at the end of a bookshelf was taken up by photographs they were clumsily framed snapshots mostly they depicted grinning small children a grayhaired grandma type several young adults among them encased in plexiglas was a military purple heart douglas picked this up hed never seen one but he was pleased to know that his guess about the source of cowleys limp had been correct you saw action he said my butt saw action cowley replied douglas looked his way so the pi continued i took it in the butt shit happens right he moved his hands from their grip on the arms of his chair he folded them over his stomach like douglass own it could have been flatter indeed the two men shared a similar build stocky quickly given to weight if they didnt exercise too tall to be called short and too short to be called tall what can i do for you mr armstrong my wife douglas said your wife she may be now that it was time to articulate the problem and what it arose from douglas wasnt sure that he could so he said whos the son cowley reached for his orange julius and took a pull on its straw he died he said drunk driver got him on the ortega highway sorry like i said shit happens what shits happened to you douglas returned the purple heart to its place he caught sight of the graying grandma in one of the pictures and said this your wife forty years my wife names maureen im on my third howd you manage forty years with one woman she has a sense of humor cowley slid open the middle drawer of his desk and took out a legal pad and the stub of a pencil he wrote armstrong at the top in block letters and underlined it he said about your wife i think shes having an affair i want to know if im right i want to know who it is cowley carefully set his pencil down he observed douglas for a moment outside a gull gave a raucous cry from one of the rooftops what makes you think shes seeing someone am i supposed to give you proof before youll take the case i thought thats why i was hiring you to give me proof you wouldnt be here if you didnt have suspicions what are they douglas raked through his memory he wasnt about to tell cowley about trying to smell up donnas underwear so he took a moment to examine her behavior over the last few weeks and when he did so the additional evidence was there how the hell had he missed it shed changed her hair shed bought new underwearthe black lacy victorias secret stuff shed been on the phone twice when hed come home and as soon as he walked into the room shed hung up hastily there were at least two long absences with insufficient excuse for them there were six or seven engagements that she said were with friends cowley nodded thoughtfully when douglas listed his suspicions then he said have you given her a reason to cheat on you a reason what is this im the guilty party women dont usually stray without there being a man behind them giving them a reason cowley examined him from beneath unclipped eyebrows one of his eyes douglas saw was beginning to form a cataract jeez the guy was ancient a real antique no reason douglas said i dont cheat on her i dont even want to shes young though and a man your age cowley shrugged shit happens to us old guys young things dont always have the patience to understand douglas wanted to point out that cowley was at least ten years his senior if not more he also wanted to exclude himself from membership in the club of us old guys but the pi was watching him compassionately so instead of arguing douglas told the truth cowley reached for his orange julius and drained the cup he tossed it into the trash women have needs he said and he moved his hand from his crotch to his chest adding a wise man doesnt confuse what goes on herethe crotchwith what goes on herethe chest so maybe im not wise are you going to help me out or not you sure you want help i want to know the truth i can live with that what i cant live with is not knowing i just need to know what im dealing with here cowley looked as if he were taking a reading of douglass level of veracity he finally appeared to make a decision but one he didnt like because he shook his head picked up his pencil and said give me some background then if shes got someone on the side who are our possibilities douglas had thought about this there was mike the poolman who visited once a week there was steve who worked with donna at her kennels in midway city there was jeff her personal trainer there were also the postman the fedex man the ups driver and donnas youthful gynecologist i take it youre accepting the case douglas said to cowley he pulled out his wallet from which he extracted a wad of bills youll want a retainer i dont need cash mr armstrong all the same all the same douglas had no intention of leaving a paper trail via a check how much time do you need he asked give it a few days if shes seeing someone hell surface eventually they always do cowley sounded despondent your wife cheat on you douglas asked shrewdly if she did i probably deserved it that was cowleys attitude but it was one that douglas didnt share he didnt deserve to be cheated on nobody did and when he found out who was doing the job on his wife well they would see a kind of justice that even attila the hun was incapable of extracting his resolve was strengthened in the bedroom that evening when his hello kiss to his wife was interrupted by the telephone donna pulled away from him quickly and went to answer it she gave douglas a smileas if recognizing what her haste revealed to himand shook back her hair as sexily as possible running slim fingers through it as she picked up the receiver douglas listened to her side of the conversation while he changed his clothes he heard her voice brighten as she said yes yes hello no doug just got home and we were talking about the day so now her caller knew he was in the room douglas could imagine what the bastard was saying whoever he was so can you talk to which donna on cue answered nope not at all shall i call you later gosh that would be great today was what was great i love to fuck you really outrageous ill have to check it out i want to check you out baby are you wet for me i sure am listen well connect later on okay i need to get dinner started just so long as you remember today it was the best youre the best right bye she hung up and came to him she put her arms round his waist she said got rid of her nancy talbert god nothings more important in her life than a shoe sale at neiman marcus spare me please she snuggled up to him he couldnt see her face just the back of her head where it was reflected in the mirror nancy talbert he said i dont think i know her sure you do honey she pressed her hips against him he felt the hopeful but useless heat in his groin shes in soroptimists with me you met her last month after the ballet hmm you feel nice gosh i like it when you hold me should i start dinner or dyou want to mess around another clever move on her part he wouldnt think she was cheating if she still wanted it from him no matter that he couldnt give it to her she was hanging in there with him and this moment proved it or so she thought love to he said and smacked her on the butt but lets eat first and after right there on the dining room table he managed what he hoped was a lewd enough wink just you wait kiddo she laughed and released him and went off to the kitchen he walked to the bed where he sat disconsolately the charade was torture he had to know the truth he didnt hear from cowley and son inquiries for two agonizing weeks during which he suffered through three more coy telephone conversations between donna and her lover four more phony excuses to cover unscheduled absences from home and two more midday showers sloughed off to steves absence from the kennels again by the time he finally made contact with cowley douglass nerves were shot cowley had news to report he said hed hand it over as soon as they could meet hows lunch cowley asked we could do tail of the whale over here no lunch douglas told him he wouldnt be able to eat anyway he would meet cowley at his office at twelve fortyfive make it the pier then cowley said ill catch a burger at rubys and we can talk after you know rubys at the end of the pier he knew rubys a fifties coffee shop it sat at the end of balboa pier and he found cowley there as promised at twelve fortyfive polishing off a cheeseburger and fries with a manila envelope sitting next to his strawberry milkshake cowley wore the same khakis hed had on the day theyd met hed added a panama hat to his ensemble he touched his index finger to the hats brim as douglas approached him his cheeks were bulging with the burger and fries douglas slid into the booth opposite cowley and reached for the envelope cowleys hand slapped down onto it not yet he said ive got to know cowley slid the envelope off the table onto the vinyl seat next to himself he twirled the straw in his milkshake and observed douglas through opaque eyes that seemed to reflect the sunlight outside pictures he said thats all ive got for you pictures arent the truth you got that okay pictures i dont know what im shooting i just tail the woman and i shoot what i see what i see may not mean shit you understand look just show me the pictures outside cowley tossed a five and three ones onto the table called catch you later susie to the waitress and led the way he walked to the railing where he looked out over the water a whalewatching boat was bobbing about a quarter mile offshore it was too early in the year to catch sight of a pod migrating to alaska but the tourists on board probably wouldnt know that their binoculars winked in the light douglas joined the pi cowley said you got to know that she doesnt act like a woman guilty of anything she just seems to be doing her thing she met a few meni wont mislead you but i couldnt catch her doing anything cheesy give me the pictures cowley gave him a sharp look instead douglas knew his voice was betraying him i say we tail her for another two weeks cowley said what ive got here isnt much to go on he opened the envelope he stood so that douglas only saw the back of the pictures he chose to hand them over in sets the first set was taken in midway city not far from the kennels at the feed and grain store where donna bought food for the dogs in these she was loading fiftypound sacks into the back of her toyota pickup she was being assisted by a calvin klein type in tight jeans and a tshirt they were laughing together and in one of the pictures donna had perched her sunglasses on the top of her head to look directly at her companion she appeared to be flirting but she was a young pretty woman and flirting was normal this set seemed okay she could have looked less happy to be chatting with the stud but she was a businesswoman and she was conducting business douglas could deal with that the second set was of donna in the newport gym where she worked with a personal trainer twice a week her trainer was one of those sculpted bodies with a head of hair on which every strand looked as if it had been seen to professionally on a daily basis in the pictures donna was dressed to work outnothing douglas had not seen beforebut for the first time he noted how carefully she assembled her workout clothes from the leggings to the leotard to the headband she wore everything enhanced her the trainer appeared to recognize this because he squatted before her as she did her vertical butterflies her legs were spread and there was no doubt what he was concentrating on this looked more serious he was about to ask cowley to start tailing the trainer when the pi said no body contact between them other than what youd expect and handed him the third set of pictures saying these are the only ones that look a little shaky to me but they may mean nothing you know this guy douglas stared with know this guy know this guy ringing in his skull unlike the other pictures in which donna and her companionofthemoment were in one location these showed donna at a view table in an oceanfront restaurant donna on the balboa ferry donna walking along a dock in newport in each of these pictures she was with a man the same man in each of the pictures there was body contact it was nothing extreme because they were out in public but it was the kind of body contact that betrayed an arm around her shoulders a kiss on her cheek a full body hug that said feel me up baby cause i aint limp like him douglas felt that his world was spinning but he managed a wry grin he said oh hell now i feel like a classa jerk this guy douglas indicated the athleticlooking man in the picture with donna this is her brother youre kidding nope hes a walkon coach at newport harbor high his name is michael hes a freespirit type douglas gripped the railing with one hand and shook his head with what he hoped looked like chagrin is this all youve got thats it i can tail her for a while longer and see nah forget it jesus i sure feel dumb douglas ripped the photographs into confetti he tossed them into the water where they formed a mantle that was quickly shredded by the waves that arced against the piers pilings what do i owe you mr cowley he asked whats this dumb ass got to pay for not trusting the finest woman on earth he took cowley to dillmans on the corner of main and balboa boulevard and they sat at the snakelike bar with the locals where they knocked back a couple of brews apiece douglas worked on his affability act playing the abashed husband who suddenly realizes what a dickhead hes been he took all donnas actions over the past weeks and reinterpreted them for cowley the unexplained absences became the foundation of a treat she was planning for him the purchase of a new car perhaps a trip to europe the refurbishing of his boat the secretive telephone calls became messages from his children who were in the know the new underwear metamorphosed into a display of her wish to make herself desirable for him to work him out of his temporary impotence by giving him a renewed interest in her body he felt like a total idiot he told cowley could they burn the damn negatives together they made a ceremony of it torching the negatives of the pictures in the alley behind jjs natural haircutting afterward douglas drove in a haze to newport harbor high school he sat numbly across the street from it he waited two hours finally he saw his youngest brother arrive for the afternoons coaching session a basketball tucked under his arm and an athletic bag in his hand michael he thought returned from greece this time but always the prodigal son before greece it was a year with greenpeace on the rainbow warrior before that it was an expedition up the amazon and before that it was marching against apartheid in south africa he had a resumé that would be the envy of any prepubescent kid out for a good time he was mr adventure mr irresponsibility and mr charm he was mr good intentions without any followthrough when a promise was due to be kept he was out of sight out of mind and out of the country but everyone loved the son of a bitch he was forty years old the baby of the armstrong brothers and he always got precisely what he wanted he wanted donna now the miserable bastard no matter that she was his brothers wife that made having her just so much more fun douglas felt ill his guts rolled around like marbles in a bucket sweat broke out in patches on his body he couldnt go back to work like this he reached for the phone and called his office he was sick he told his secretary must have been something he ate for lunch he was heading home she could catch him there if anything came up in the house he wandered from room to room donna wasnt at homewouldnt be home for hoursso he had plenty of time to consider what to do his mind reproduced for him the pictures that cowley had taken of michael and donna his intellect deduced where they had been and what theyd been doing prior to those pictures being taken he went to his study there in a glass curio cabinet his collection of ivory erotica mocked him miniature asians posed in a variety of sexual postures having themselves a roaring good time he could see michael and donnas features superimposed on the creamy faces of the figurines they took their pleasure at his expense they justified their pleasure by using his failure no limp dick here michaels voice taunted whats the matter big brother cant hold on to your wife douglas felt shattered he told himself that he could have handled her doing anything else he could have handled her seeing someone else but not michael who had trailed him through life making his mark in every area where douglas had previously failed in high school it had been in athletics and student government in college it had been in the world of fraternities as an adult it had been in embracing adventure rather than in tackling the grind of business and now it was in proving to donna what real manhood was all about douglas could see them together as easily as he could see his pieces of erotica intertwined their bodies joined their heads thrown back their hands clasped their hips grinding against each other god he thought the pictures in his mind would drive him mad he felt like killing the telephone company gave him the proof he required he asked for a printout of the calls that had been made from his home and when he received it there was michaels number not once or twice but repeatedly all of the calls had been made when hedouglaswasnt home it was clever of donna to use the nights when she knew douglas would be doing his volunteer stint at the newport suicide hotline she knew he never missed his wednesday evening shift so important was it to him to have the hotline among his community commitments she knew he was building a political profile to get himself elected to the city council and the hotline was part of the picture of himself he wished to portray douglas armstrong husband father oilman and compassionate listener to the emotionally distressed he needed something to put into the balance against his environmental lapses the hotline allowed him to say that while he may have spilled oil on a few lousy pelicansnot to mention some miserable ottershe would never let a human life hang there in jeopardy donna had known hed never skip even part of his evening shift so shed waited till then to make her calls to michael there they were on the printout every one of them made between six and nine on a wednesday night okay she liked wednesday night so well wednesday night would be the night that he killed her he could hardly bear to be around her once he had the proof of her betrayal she knew something was wrong between them because he didnt want to touch her any longer their thriceweekly attempted couplingsas disastrous as theyd beenfast became a thing of the past still she carried on as if nothing and no one had come between them sashaying through the bedroom in her victorias secret selectionofthenight trying to entice him into making a fool of himself so she could share the laughter with his brother michael no way baby douglas thought youll be sorry you made a fool out of me when she finally cuddled next to him and murmured doug is something wrong you want to talk you okay it was all he could do not to shove her from him he wasnt okay he would never be okay again but at least hed be able to salvage a measure of his selfrespect by giving the little bitch her due it was easy enough to plan once he decided on the very next wednesday a trip to radio shack was all that was necessary he chose the busiest one he could find deep in the barrio in santa ana and he deliberately took his time browsing until the youngest clerk with the most acne and the least amount of brainpower was available to wait on him then he made his purchase with cash a call diverter just the thing for those onthego socal folks who didnt want to miss an incoming phone call once douglas programmed the diverter with the number he wanted incoming calls diverted to he would have an alibi for the night of his wifes murder it was all so easy donna had been a real numbskull to try to cheat on him she had been a bigger numbskull to do her cheating on wednesday nights because the fact of her doing it on wednesday nights was what gave him the idea of how to snuff her the volunteers on the hotline worked it in shifts generally there were two people present each manning one of the telephone lines but newport beach types actually didnt feel suicidal very frequently and if they did they were more likely to go to neiman marcus and buy their way out of their depression midweek especially was a slow time for the pill poppers and wrist slashers so the hotline was manned on wednesdays by only one person per shift douglas used the days prior to wednesday to get his timing down to a military precision he chose eightthirty as donnas death hour which would give him time to sneak out of the hotline office drive home put out her lights and get back to the hotline before the next shift arrived at nine he was carving it out fairly thin and allowing only a fiveminute margin of error but he needed to do that in order to have a believable alibi once her body was found there could be neither noise nor blood obviously noise would arouse the neighbors blood would damn him if he got so much as a drop on his clothes dna typing being what it was these days so he chose his weapon carefully aware of the irony of his choice he would use the satin belt of one of her victorias secret slayhimwherehestands dressing gowns she had half a dozen so he would remove one of them in advance of the murder separate it from its belt dispose of it in a dumpster behind the nearest vons in advance of the killinghe liked that touch getting rid of the evidence before the crime what killer ever thought of that and then use the belt to strangle his cheating wife on wednesday night the call diverter would establish his alibi he would take it to the suicide hotline plug the phone into it program the diverter with his cellular phone number and thus appear to be in one location while his wife was being murdered in another he made sure donna was going to be at home by doing what he always did on wednesdays by phoning her from work before he left for the hotline i feel like dogshit he told her at fiveforty oh doug no she replied are you ill or just feeling depressed about im feeling punk he interrupted her the last thing he wanted was to listen to her phony sympathy it may have been lunch what did you have nothing he hadnt eaten in two days but he told her shrimp because hed gotten food poisoning from shrimp a few years back and he thought she might remember that if she remembered anything at all about him at this point he went on im going to try to get home early from the hotline i may not be able to if i cant pull in a substitute to take my shift im heading over there now if i can get a sub ill be home pretty early he could hear her attempt to hide dismay when she replied but doug i mean what time do you think youll make it i dont know by eight at the latest i hope what difference does it make oh none at all really but i thought you might like dinner what she really thought was that she was going to have to cancel her hot romp with his baby brother douglas smiled at the realization on how nicely hed just unhooked her little caboose hell im not hungry donna i just want to go to bed if i can you be there to rub my back you going anywhere of course not where would i be going doug you sound strange is something wrong nothing was wrong he told her what he didnt tell her was how right everything was felt and was going to be he had her where he wanted her now shed be home and shed be alone she might phone michael and tell him that his brother was coming home early so their tryst was off but even if she did that michaels statement after her death would conflict with douglass uninterrupted presence at the suicide hotline that night douglas just had to make sure that he was back at the hotline with time to disassemble the call diverter hed get rid of it on the way homenothing could be easier than flipping it into the trash behind the huge movie theater complex that was on his route from the hotline to the neighborhood where he livedand then hed arrive at his usual time of ninetwenty to discover the murder of his beloved it was all so easy and so much cleaner than divorcing the little whore he felt remarkably at peace considering everything hed seen thistle again and shed held his rolex his wedding band and his cuff links to take her reading shed greeted him by telling him that his aura was strong and that she could feel the power pulsing from him and when she closed her eyes over his possessions shed said i feel a major change coming into your life notdavid a change of location perhaps a change of climate are you taking a trip he might be he told her he hadnt had one in months did she have any suggested destinations i see lights she responded going her own way i see cameras i see many faces youre surrounded by those you love theyd be at donnas funeral of course and the press would cover it he was somebody after all they wouldnt ignore the murder of douglas armstrongs wife as for thistle shed find out who he really was if she read the paper or watched the local news but that made no difference since hed never mentioned donna and since hed have an alibi for the time of her death he arrived at the suicide hotline at five fiftysix he was relieving a uci psych student named debbie who was eager enough to be gone she said only two calls mr armstrong if your shift is like mine i hope you brought something to read he waved his copy of money magazine and took her place at the desk he waited ten minutes after shed left before he went back out to his car to get the call diverter the hotline was located in the dock area of newport a maze of narrow oneway streets that traversed the top of balboa peninsula by day the streets antique stores marine chandleries and secondhand clothing boutiques attracted both locals and tourists by night the place was a ghost town uninhabited except for the newwave beatniks who visited a coffee dive three streets away where anorexic girls dressed in black read poetry and strummed guitars so no one was on the street to see douglas fetch the call diverter from his mercedes and no one was on the street to see him leave the suicide hotlines small cubbyhole behind the real estate office at eightfifteen and should any desperate individual call the hotline during his drive home that call would be diverted onto his cellular phone and he could deal with it god the plan was perfect as he drove up the curving road that led to his house douglas thanked his stars that hed chosen to live in an environment in which privacy was everything to the homeowners every estate sat like douglass behind walls and gates shielded by trees on one day in ten he might actually see another resident most of the timelike tonightthere was no one around even if someone had seen his mercedes sliding up the hill however it was january dark and his was just another luxury car in a community of rollsroyces bentleys bmws lexuses range rovers and other mercedes besides hed already decided that if he saw someone or something suspicious he would just turn around go back to the hotline and wait for another wednesday but he didnt see anything out of the ordinary he didnt see anyone perhaps a few more cars were parked on the street but even these were empty he had the night to himself at the top of his drive he shut off the engine and coasted to the house it was dark inside which told him that donna was in the back in their bedroom he needed her outside the house was equipped with a security system that would do a bank vault proud so he needed the killing to take place outside where a peeping tom gone bazooka or a burglar or a serial killer might have lured her he thought of ted bundy and how hed snagged his victims by appealing to their maternal need to come to his aid hed go the bundy route he decided donna was nothing if not eager to help he got out of the car silently and paced over to the door he rang the bell with the back of his hand the better to leave no trace on the button in less than ten seconds donnas voice came over the intercom yes hi babe he said my hands are full can you let me in be a sec she told him he took the satin belt from his pocket as he waited he pictured her route from the back of the house he twisted the satin around his hands and snapped it tight once she opened the door hed have to move like lightning hed have only one chance to fling the cord around her neck the advantage he already possessed was surprise he heard her footsteps on the limestone he gripped the satin and prepared he thought of michael he thought of her together with michael he thought of his asian erotica he thought of betrayal failure and trust she deserved this they both deserved it he was only sorry he couldnt kill michael right now too when the door swung open he heard her say doug i thought you said your hands and then he was on her he leapt he yanked the belt around her neck he dragged her swiftly out of the house he tightened it and tightened it and tightened it and tightened it she was too startled even to fight back in the three seconds it took her to get her hands to the belt in a reflex attempt to pull it away from her throat he had it digging into her skin so deeply that her scrabbling fingers could find no slip of material to grab on to he felt her go limp he said jesus yes yes and then it happened the lights went on in the house a mariachi band started playing people started shouting surprise surprise sur douglas looked up panting from the body of his wife into popping flashes and a video camcorder the joyous shouting from within his house was cut off by a female shriek he dropped donna to the ground and stared without comprehension into the entry and beyond that the living room there at least two dozen people were gathered beneath a banner that said surprise dougie happy fiftyfive he saw the horrified faces of his brothers and their wives and children of his own children of his parents of one of his former wives among them his colleagues and his secretary the chief of police the mayor he thought what is this donna some kind of a joke and then he saw michael coming from the direction of the kitchen michael with a birthday cake in his hands michael saying did we surprise him donna poor doug i hope his heart and then saying nothing at all when he saw his brother and his brothers wife shit douglas thought what have i done that indeed was the question hed be askingand answeringfor the rest of his life introduction to good fences arent always enough so often im asked where my ideas for stories come from i always answer in the same way story ideas come from everywhere and anywhere i might see a wire service article in the la times and realize that it contains the kernel for a novel as i did when i wrote wellschooled in murder i might see an exposé in a british newspaper and decide that it can serve as the foundation for a novel as i did when i wrote missing joseph i might want to use a specific location in one of my books so ill design a story that fits into that location as i did when i wrote for the sake of elena i might see someone on the street or in the underground overhear a conversation between two individuals listen to someones experience study a photograph or determine that a particular type of character would be interesting to write about or sometimes what stimulates the story idea is a combination of any of these things often when ive completed a project i cant remember whatgot me started on it in the first place but thats not the case with the following short story in october of i went on a walking and hiking tour of vermont after id completed the second draft of my novel a traitor to memory id long wanted to see the new england fall colors and this trip was to be my reward for a long and enervating time spent at the computer over the fifteen months of writing two drafts of a complicated book my intention was to see and to photograph the landscape as i was traveling on my own i decided to sign up for a tour of other likeminded individuals interested in the exercise and the atmosphere we stayed in country inns at night and during the day we hiked through some of the most spectacular foliage ive ever seen we had two guides brett and nona what one of them didnt know about the flora the fauna the topography and the geography of the region the other one did it was while we were on one of these hikes that nona told me the story of an eccentric woman who once lived near her own home as soon as i heard the tale i knew i was listening to the kernel of a short story that i would write and when i got home from hiking in vermont thats what i did it seemed fitting to use a variation of a line from robert frostthat famous literary new englanderas the title for my piece good fences arent always enough twice each year a neighborhood in the attractive old town of east wingate managed to achieve perfection whenever this happenedor perhaps as an indication that it had happenedthe wingate courier celebrated the fact with a significant spread of appropriately laudatory column inches dead in the center of its smalltown pages photos included citizens of east wingate who wanted to better their social standing their quality of life or their circle of friends then tended to flock to that neighborhood eagerly with the hope of picking up a piece of real estate there napier lane was just the sort of place that could at any moment and in the right circumstances be named a perfect place to live it was very high on potential if not quite there in every respect it had atmosphere provided by enormous lots houses over a century old oaks maples and sycamores even older sidewalks cracked with time and character picket fences and brick paths that wound through front yards lapping against the sort of friendly porches where neighbors gather on summer nights if every house had not yet been restored by some young couple with a lot of energy and inclined to nostalgia there was in napier lanes curves and dips an open promise that renovation would come to them all given enough time on the rare occasion that a house on napier lane came up for sale the entire neighborhood held its breath to see who the buyer would be if it was someone with money the purchased house might join the ranks of those painted glistening sisters who were raising the standard of living one domicile at a time and if it was someone with easy access to that money and a profligate nature to boot chances were that the renovation of the property in question might even occur quickly for it had been the case that a family now and then had bought a house on napier lane with restoration and renovation in mind only to discover upon embarking on the job how tedious and costly it actually was so more than once someone began the augean project thats known as restoring a historic property but within six months admitted defeat and raised the for sale sign of surrender without getting even within shouting distance of completion such was the situation at its prior inhabitants had managed to get its exterior painted and its front and back yards cleared of the weeds and debris that tend to collect upon a property when its owners arent hypervigilant but that was the extent of it the old house sat like miss havisham fifty years after the wedding that didnt happen dressed to the nines externally but a ruin inside and languishing in a barren landscape of disappointed dreams literally everyone within sight of was anxious to have someone take on the house and set it to rights except willow mckenna that is willow who lived next door just wanted good neighbors at thirtyfour and trying to get pregnant with her third of what would ultimately besome years henceseven children willow hoped merely for a family who shared her values these were simple enough a man and a woman committed to their marriage who were loving parents to an assortment of moderately well behaved children race color creed national origin political affiliation automotive inclination taste in interior decoration none of that mattered she was just hopeful that whoever bought would be a positive addition to what was in her case a blessed life a solid family represented that one in which the dad went out to a white collar if not distinguished job the mom remained at home and saw to the needs of her children and the children themselves were imaginative but obedient with evident respect for their elders happy and carrying no infectious diseases the number of children didnt matter the more the better as far as willow was concerned having grown up with no relations of her own but always clinging to the futile hope that one set of foster parents or another would actually want to adopt her willow had long made family her priority when shed married scott mckenna whom shed known since her sophomore year in high school willow had set about making for herself what fate and a mother whod abandoned her in a grocery store had long denied her jasmine came first max followed two years later if all went according to plan cooper or blythe would arrive next and her own life which had lately felt dark cold and cavernous with maxs entry into kindergarten would once more stretch and fill and bustle relieving the nagging press of anxiety that shed been experiencing for the last three months you could go to work will her husband scott had counseled parttime i mean if youd like that is no need financially and youd want to be here when the kids get home from school anyway but a job wasnt what willow wanted she wanted the void filled in a way only another baby could fill it that was where her inclinations lay toward family and babies and not toward neighborhoods that might or might not be designated perfect places to live so when the sold sign appeared over the realtors name on what she wondered was not when the new neighbors might logically be expected to make the necessary improvements to their environmenta front yard edged by a new picket fence would be a good place to start thought the gilberts who lived on the other side of but rather how big the family was and would the mom want to exchange any recipes everyone it turned out was disappointed for not only did no instant transformation take place in napier lane but no family moved a plethora of belongings into the old victorian house at all make no mistake a plethora of items were delivered but as for the mom the dad the teeming happy shouting children that were meant to accompany those items they did not materialize in their place came one lone woman one lone andit must be saidrather odd woman she was called anfisa telyegin and she was the sort of woman about whom rumors spring up instantly first there was her general appearance which can largely be described by the single word gray gray as to hair gray as to complexion gray as to teeth and eyes and lips gray as to personality as well she was much like chimney smoke in the dark definitely present but indecipherable as to its source creepy the youngsters on napier lane called her and it wasnt a leap of too much imagination to expand from that to the less pleasant witch her behavior didnt help matters she returned neighborly hellos with the barest courtesy she never answered her doorbell to children selling girl scout cookies candy magazines or wrapping paper she wasnt interested in joining the thursday morning mothers coffee that rotated among the houses of the stayathome moms andthis was perhaps her biggest sinshe showed no inclination to join in a single one of the activities that napier lane was certain would help it top the short list of spots designated in east wingate as models of perfection so invitations to progressive dinners were ignored the fourth of july barbecue might not have occurred at all christmas caroling did not see her participate and as for using part of her yard for the easter egg hunt the idea was unthinkable indeed six months into her acquisition of napier lane all anyone knew of anfisa telyegin was what they heard and what they saw what they heard was that she taught russian language and russian literature at night at the local community college what they saw was a woman with arthritic hands a serious and regrettable case of dowagers hump no interest in fashion a tendency to talk to herself and a great passion for her yard at least that was how it seemed at first because no sooner had anfisa telyegin removed the for sale sign from the dusty plot that was her front yard but she was out there murmuring to herself as she planted english ivy which she proceeded to fertilize water and baby into a growth spurt unparalleled in the history of the lane it seemed to people that anfisa telyegins english ivy grew overnight crawling along the packed earth and sending out tendrils in every direction within a month the shiny leaves were flourishing like mongrel dogs saved from the pound in five months more the entire front yard was a veritable lake of greenery people thought at this point that she would tackle the picket fence which sagged like kneehighs on an eightyyearold or perhaps the chimneys of which there were six and all of them guano streaked and infested with birds or even the windows where the same drunken venetian blinds had covered the glass without being dusted or changedfor the last fifty years but instead she repaired to the backyard where she planted more ivy put in a hedge between her property and her neighbors yards and built a very large chicken coop into which and out of which she disappeared and emerged at precise intervals morning and night with a basket on her arm it was filled with corn on the access route it was emptyor so it seemed to anyone who caught a glimpse of the womanon the egress whats the old bag doing with all the eggs asked billy hart who lived across the street and drank far too much beer i havent seen any eggs leslie gilbert replied but she wouldnt have naturally because she rarely moved from her sofa to the window during the daytime when the television talk shows were claiming her attention and she couldnt be expected to see anfisa telyegin at night not in the dark and between the trees that the woman had planted along the property line just beyond the hedge trees that like the ivy seemed to grow with preternatural speed soon the children of napier lane were reacting to the solitary womans strange habits the way children will the younger ones crossed over to the other side of the street whenever passing the older ones dared each other to enter the yard and slap hands against the warped screen door that had lost its screen the previous halloween things might have gotten out of hand at this point had not anfisa telyegin herself taken the bull by the horns she went to the napier lane veterans day chili cookoff while its true that she didnt take any chili with her its also true that she did not show up emptyhanded and no matter that jasmine mckenna found a long gray hair embedded in the lime jello salad with bananas that was anfisas contribution to the event it was the thought that countedat least to her mother if not to the rest of the neighborsand that proffered jello encouraged willow to look with a compassionate eye upon the strange elderly woman from that moment forward im going to take her a batch of my dropdead brownies willow told her husband scott one morning not long after the veterans day chili cookoff won by ava downey by the way for the third consecutive and maddening year i think she just doesnt know what to make of us all shes a foreigner after all which is what the neighbors had learned from the woman herself at the cookoff born in russia when it was still part of the ussr a childhood in moscow an adulthood far in the north somewhere till the soviet union fell apart and she herself made her way to america scott mckenna said hmm without really registering what his wife was telling him hed just returned from the graveyard shift at trioptics incorporated where as a support technician for trioptics complicated software package he was forced to spend hours on the phone with europeans asians australians and new zealanders who phoned the helpline nightlyor for them dailywanting an immediate solution for whatever mindless havoc theyd just wreaked upon their operating system scott are you listening to me willow asked feeling the way she always felt when his response lacked the appropriate degree of commitment to their conversation cut off and floating in outer space you know i hate it when you dont listen to me her voice was sharper than she intended and her daughter jasmineat the present moment stirring her cheerios to reduce them to the level of sogginess that she preferredsaid ouch mom chill whered she get that scott mckenna looked up from his study of the financial pages of the daily newspaper while fiveyearold maxalways his sisters echo if not her shadowsaid yeah mom chill and stuck his fingers into the yolk of his fried egg from sierra gilbert probably willow said hmph jasmine countered with a toss of her head sierra gilbert got it from me whoever got it from who scott said snapping his paper meaningfully i dont want to hear it said to your mother again okay it only means jasmine poop she stuck out her tongue shed cut her bangs again willow saw and she sighed she felt defeated by her strongwilled daughter on the fast path to adolescence and she hoped that little blythe or cooperwith whom she was finally and blessedly pregnantmight be more the sort of child shed had in mind to bring into the world it was clear to willow that she wasnt going to receive scotts acknowledgment ofmuch less his benediction onher plan for the dropdead brownies unless and until she made it clear why she thought a neighborly gesture was called for at this point she waited to do so until the kids were off to school safely escorted to the bus stop at the end of the street and attended theredespite jasmines protestsuntil the yellow doors closed upon them then she returned to the house and found her husband preparing for the daily five hours of sleep he allotted himself prior to sitting down to work on the six consulting accounts that so far described what went for mckenna computing designs nine more accounts and he would be able to leave trioptics and maybe then their lives would be a little more normal no more regimented sex in the hours between the kids going to bed and scotts leaving for work no more long nights alone listening to the creaking floorboards and trying to convince herself it was only the house settling scott was in the bedroom casting his clothes off he left everything where it fell and fell himself onto the mattress where he turned on his side and pulled the blankets over his shoulder he was twentyseven seconds away from snoring when willow spoke ive been thinking hon no response scott hmmm ive been thinking about miss telyegin or mrs telyegin willow supposed shed not yet learned if the woman next door was married single divorced or widowed single seemed most likely to willow for some reason that she couldnt quite explain maybe it had to do with the womans habits which were becoming more apparentand patently strangeras the days and weeks passed most notable were the hours she kept which were almost entirely nocturnal but beyond that there was the oddity of things like the venetian blinds on being always closed against the light of miss telyegin wearing rubber boots rain or shine whenever she did emerge from her house of the fact that she not only never entertained visitors but she never went anywhere besides to work and home again precisely at the same time each day when does she buy her groceries ava downey asked she has them delivered willow replied ive seen the truck leslie gilbert confirmed so she never goes out in the daytime at all never before dusk willow said thus was vampire added to witch but only the children took that sobriquet seriously nonetheless the other neighbors began to shy away from anfisa telyegin which prompted willows additional sympathy and made anfisa telyegins effort at the veterans day chili cookoff even more worthy of admiration and reciprocation scott she said to her drowsy husband are you listening to me can we talk later will thisll only take a minute ive been thinking about anfisa he sighed and flipped onto his back putting his arms behind his head and exposing what willow least liked to see when she looked upon her spouse armpits as hairy as abrahams beard okay he said without a display of anything resembling marital patience what about anfisa willow sat on the edge of the bed she placed her hand on scotts chest to feel his heart despite his present impatience he had one a very big one shed seen it first at the high school sock hop where hed claimed her for a partner rescuing her from life among the wallflowers and she depended now upon its ability to open wide and embrace her idea its been tough with your parents so far away willow said dont you agree scotts eyes narrowed with the suspicion of a man whod suffered comparisons to his older brother from childhood and whod only too happily moved his family to a different state to put an end to them what dyou mean tough five hundred miles willow said thats a long way not long enough scott thought to still the echoes of your brother the cardiologist which followed him everywhere i know you want the distance willow continued but the children could benefit from their grandparents scott not from these grandparents scott informed her which was what she expected her husband to say so it was no difficult feat to segue from there into her idea it seemed to her she told scott that anfisa telyegin had extended a hand of friendship to the neighborhood at the chili cookoff and she wanted to reciprocate indeed wouldnt it be lovely to get to know the woman on the chance that she might become a foster grandparent to their children shewillowhad no parents whose wisdom and life experience she could offer to jasmine max and little blytheorcooper and with scotts family so far away family doesnt have to be defined as blood relations willow pointed out leslies like an aunt to the children anfisa could be like a grandmother and anyway i hate to see her alone the way she is with the holidays coming i dont know it seems so sad scotts expression changed to show the relief he felt at not having willow suggest they move back to be near his loathsome parents she sympathized withif she didnt understandhis unwillingness to expose himself to any more comparisons to his vastly more successful sibling and that empathy of hers which hed always seen as her finest quality was something he accepted as not being limited to an application only to himself she cared about people his wife willow it was one of the reasons he loved her he said i dont think she wants to mix in with us will she came to the cookoff i think she wants to try scott smiled reached up and caressed his wifes cheek always rescuing strays only with your blessing he yawned okay but dont expect much shes a dark horse i think she just needs some friendship extended to her and willow set about doing exactly that the very same day she made a double batch of dropdead brownies and arranged a dozen artfully on a green plate of depression glass she covered them carefully in saran wrap and fixed this in place with a jaunty plaid ribbon as carefully as if she were bearing myrrh she carried her offering next door to it was a cold day it didnt snow in this part of the country and while autumns were generally long and colorful they could also be icy and gray that was the case when willow left the house frost still lay on her neat front lawn on the pristine fence on the crimson leaves of the liquidambar at the edge of the sidewalk and a bank of fog was rolling determinedly down the street like a fat man looking for a meal willow stepped watchfully along the brick path that led from her front door to the gate and she held the dropdead brownies against her chest as if exposure to the air might somehow harm them she shivered and wondered what winter would be like if this was what a day in autumn could do she had to set her plate of brownies on the sidewalk for a moment when she reached the front of anfisas house the old picket gate was off one hinge and instead of pushing it open one needed to lift it swing it and set it down again and even then it wasnt an easy maneuver with the ivy now thickly overgrowing the front yard path indeed as willow approached the house she noticed what she hadnt before the ivy that flourished under anfisas care had begun to twine itself up the front steps and was crawling along the wide front porch and twisting up the rails if anfisa didnt trim it soon the house would disappear beneath it on the porch where willow hadnt stood since the last inhabitants of had given up the effort at diy and moved to a brandnewand flavorlessdevelopment just outside of town willow saw that anfisa had made another alteration to the home in addition to what shed done with the yard sitting next to the front door was a large metal chest with grocery delivery stenciled in neat white letters across its lid odd willow thought it was one thing to have your groceries delivered wouldnt she like to have that service if she could ever bear the thought of someone other than herself selecting her familys food but it was quite another thing to leave it outside where it could spoil if you werent careful nonetheless anfisa telyegin had lived to the ripe old age of whatever it was she must willow decided know what she was doing she rang the front bell she had no doubt that anfisa was at home and would be home for many hours still it was daylight after all but no one answered yet willow had the distinct impression that there was someone quite nearby listening just behind the door so she called out miss telyegin its willow mckenna it was such a nice thing to see you at the chili cookoff the other night ive brought you some brownies theyre my specialty miss telyegin its willow mckenna from next door napier lane to your left again nothing willow looked to the windows but saw that they were as always covered by their venetian blinds she decided that the front bell had not worked and she knocked instead on the green front door she called out miss telyegin once more before she began to feel silly she realized that she was making something of a fool of herself in front of the whole neighborhood there was our willow bangin away on that womans front door like an orphan of the storm ava downey would say over her gin and tonic that afternoon and her husband beau who was always at home from the real estate office in time to mix the beefeaters and vermouth for his wife just the way she liked it would pass along that information to his pals at the weekly poker game from which those men would carry it home to their wives till everyone knew without a doubt how needy willow mckenna was to forge connections in her little world she felt embarrassment creep up on her like the secret police she decided to leave her offering and phone anfisa telyegin about it so she lifted the lid of the grocery box and set the dropdead brownies inside she was lowering the heavy lid when she heard a rustling in the ivy behind her she didnt think much about it till a skittering sounded against the worn wood of the old front porch she turned then and gave out a shriek that she smothered with her hand a large rat with glittering eyes and scaly tail was observing her the rodent was not three feet away at the edge of the porch and about to dive into the protection of the ivy oh my god willow leapt onto the metal food box without a thought of ava downey beau the poker game or the neighborhood seeing her rats were terrifyingshe couldnt have said why and she looked around for something to drive the creature off but he took himself into the ivy without her encouragement and as the last of his gray bulk disappeared willow mckenna didnt hesitate to do so herself she leapt from the food box and ran all the way home it was a rat willow insisted leslie gilbert took her gaze away from the television shed muted the sound upon willows arrival but hadnt completely torn herself away from the confrontation going on there my father had sex with my boyfriend was printed on the bottom of the screen announcing the days topic among the combatants i know a rat when i see one willow said leslie reached for a dorito and munched thoughtfully did you let her know i phoned her right away but she didnt answer and she doesnt have a machine you could leave her a note willow shivered i dont even want to go into the yard again its all that ivy leslie pointed out bad thing to have ivy like that maybe she doesnt know they like ivy i mean in russia itd be too cold for rats wouldnt it leslie took another dorito ratsre like cockroaches will she said its never too anything for them she fastened her eyes to the television screen least we know why she has that box for her groceries rats bite through anything but they dont bite through steel there seemed nothing for it but to write a note to anfisa telyegin willow did this promptly but felt that she couldnt deliver such news to the reclusive woman without also proffering a solution to the problem so she added the words im doing something to help out and she bought a trap baited it with peanut butter and bore it with her to the next morning at breakfast she told her husband what she had done and he nodded thoughtfully over his newspaper she said i put our phone number in the note and i thought shed call but she hasnt i hope she doesnt think i think its a reflection on her that theres a rat on her property obviously i didnt mean to insult her hmm scott said and rattled his paper jasmine said rats rats yucky yuck mom and max said yucky yucky yuck having started something with the deposit of the trap on anfisa telyegins front porch willow felt duty bound to finish it so she returned to when scott was asleep and the children had gone off to school she walked up the path with far more trepidation than shed felt on her first visit every rustle in the ivy was the movement of the rat and surely the scritching sound she could hear was the rodent creeping up behind her ready to pounce on her ankles her fears came to nothing though when she mounted the porch she saw that her effort at trapping the critter had been successful the trap held the rats broken body willow shuddered when she saw it and hardly registered the fact that the rodent looked somewhat surprised to find his neck broken right when he was helping himself to breakfast she wanted scott there to help her then but realizing that he needed his sleep shed come prepared shed carried with her a shovel and a garbage bag in the hope that her first venture in vermin extermination would have been successful she knocked on the door to let anfisa telyegin know what she was doing but as before there was no answer as she turned to face her task with the rat though she saw the venetian blinds move a fraction she called out miss telyegin ive put a trap down for the rat ive got him you dont need to worry about it and she felt a bit put out that her neighbor didnt open the front door and thank her she steeled herself to the job before hershed never liked coming across dead animals and this occasion was no different from finding roadkill adhering to the treads of her tiresand she scooped the rat up with the shovel she was just about to deposit the stiffened body into the garbage sack when a susurration of the ivy leaves distracted her followed by a skittering that she recognized at once she whirled two rats were on the edge of the porch eyes glittering tails swishing against the wood willow mckenna dropped the shovel with a clatter she made a wild dash for the street two more ava downey sounded doubtful she rattled the ice in her glass and her husband beau took it for the signal it was and went to refresh her gin and tonic darlin you sure youre not sufferin from somethin i know what i saw willow told her neighbor i let leslie know and now im telling you i killed one but i saw two more and i swear to god they knew what i was doing intelligent rats then ava downey asked my lord what a perplexin situation she pronounced it perplexing in her southern drawl miss north carolina come to live among the mortals its a neighborhood problem willow said rats carry disease they breed like well they breed like rats beau downey said he gave his wife her drink and joined the ladies in ava downeys wellappointed living room ava was an interior decorator by avocation if not by career and everything she touched was instantly transformed into a suitable vignette for architectural digest very amusin darlin ava said to her husband without smiling my oh my married all these years and i had no idea you have such a quick wit willow said theyre going to infest the neighborhood ive tried to talk to anfisa about it but shes not answering the phone or shes not at home except therere lights on so i think shes home and look we need to do something therere children to consider willow hadnt thought of the children till earlier that afternoon after scott had risen from his daily five hours shed been in the backyard in her vegetable garden picking the last of the autumn squash shed reached for one and in doing so had dug her fingers into a pile of animal droppings shed recoiled from the sensation and pulled the squash out hastily from the tangle of its vine the vegetable she saw had been scarred with tooth marks the droppings and tooth marks had told the tale there werent just rats in the yard next door there were rats on the move every yard was vulnerable children played in those yards families held their summer barbecues there teenagers sunned themselves there in the summer and men smoked cigars on warm spring nights these yards werent meant to be shared with rodents rodents were dangerous to everyones health the problems not rats beau downey said the problems the woman willow she probably thinks having rats is normal hell shes from russia what dyou want what willow wanted was peace of mind she wanted to know that her children were safe that she could let blytheorcooper crawl on the lawn without having to worry that a rator rats droppingswould be out there call an exterminator scott told her burn a cross on her lawn beau downey advised she phoned home safety exterminators and in short order a professional came to call he verified the evidence in willows vegetable plot and for good measure he paid a call on the gilberts on the other side of and did much the same there this at least got leslie off the sofa she dragged a set of kitchen steps to the fence and peered over at s backyard aside from a path to the chicken coop ivy grew everywhere even up the trunks of the fastgrowing trees this home safety exterminator pronounced is a real problem lady the ivys got to go but the rats have to go first lets do it willow said but there was a problem as things turned out home safety exterminators could trap rats on the mckennas property they could trap rats in the gilberts yard they could walk down the street and see to the downeys and even cross over and deal with the harts but they couldnt enter a yard without permission without contracts being signed and agreements reached and that couldnt happen unless and until someone made contact with anfisa telyegin the only way to manage this was to waylay the woman when she left one night to teach one of her classes at the local college willow appointed herself neighborhood liaison and she took up watch at her kitchen window feeding her family takeout chinese and pizzas for several days so as not to miss the moment when the russian woman set off for the bus stop at the end of napier lane when that finally happened willow grabbed her parka and dashed out after her she caught up to her in front of the downeys house which as always was already ablaze with christmas lights despite the fact that thanksgiving had not yet arrived in the glow from the santa and reindeer on the roof willow explained the situation anfisas back was to the light so willow couldnt see her reaction indeed she couldnt see the russian womans face at all so shrouded was she in a head scarf and a widebrimmed hat it seemed reasonable enough to willow to assume that a passing along of information would be all that the unpleasant situation required but she was surprised there are no rats in the yard anfisa telyegin said with considerable dignity all things considered i fear you are mistaken mrs mckenna oh no willow contradicted her im not miss telyegin truly im not not only did i see one when i brought you those brownies did you get them by the way theyre my specialty but when i set a trap i actually caught it and then i saw two more and then when i found the droppings in my yard and called the exterminator and he looked around well there you have it anfisa said the problem is with your yard not mine but i must be on my way and so she walked off with nothing settled between them when willow shared this information with scott he decided a neighborhood war council was called for which was another term for a poker night at which poker wasnt played and to which wives were invited willow found herself overwrought at the idea of what might happen once the neighborhood became involved in the problem she didnt like trouble but by the same token she wanted her children to be safe from vermin she spent most of the meeting anxiously chewing on her nails every position taken on the situation was a turn of the prism that is human nature scott wanted to go the legal route in keeping with his bythebook personality start with the health department bring in the police if that didnt work turn to lawyers subsequently but owen gilbert didnt like this idea at all he didnt like anfisa telyegin for reasons having more to do with her refusal to let him do her income taxes than with the rodents that were invading his property and he wanted to call the fbi and the irs and have them deal with her surely she was involved in something everything from tax dodging to espionage was possible mention of the irs brought the ins into beau downeys mind which was more than enough to enflame him he was of the persuasion that immigrants are the ruination of america and since the legal system and the government clearly werent about to do a damn thing to keep the borders closed to the invading hordes beau said they should at least do something to close their neighborhood to them lets let this gal know she aint welcome here he said to which suggestion his wife ava rolled her eyes she never made a secret of the fact that she considered beau good for mixing her drinks servicing her sexual needs and not much more how dyou suggest we do that darlin ava asked paint a swastika on her front door hell we need a family in there anyway billy hart said chugging his beer it was his seventh and his wife had been counting them as had willow who wondered why rose didnt stop him from making a fool of himself every time he went out in public instead of just sitting there with an agonized expression on her face we need a couple our own age people with kids maybe even a teenage daughter one with decent tits he grinned and gave willow a look she didnt like her own breastsnormally the size of teacupswere swelling with her pregnancy and he fixed his eyes to them and winked at her with so many opinions being expressed is there any doubt that nothing was settled the only thing that occurred was passions being enflamed and willow felt responsible for having enflamed them perhaps she thought there was another way to deal with the situation but wrack her brains though she did for the next several days she could come up with no approach to the problem it was when a letter went misdelivered to her house that willow came up with what seemed a likely plan of action for stuck within a collection of catalogues and bills was a manila envelope forwarded to anfisa telyegin from an address in port terryton a small village on the weldy river some ninetyfive miles north of napier lane perhaps willow thought someone in anfisas former neighborhood could help her present neighbors learn how best to approach her so on a crisp morning when the children were in school and scott was tucked away for his wellearned five hours willow got out her state atlas and plotted a route that would take her to port terryton before noon leslie gilbert went too despite having to miss her daily intake of dysfunction on the television set both of the ladies had heard of port terryton it was a picturesque village some three hundred years old set amidst an oldgrowth deciduous forest that flourished right to the banks of the weldy river money lived in port terryton old money new money stock market money dot com money inherited money mansions built in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries served as display pieces for inordinate wealth there were inferior areas in the village as well streets of visually pleasing cottages where the day help and the lesser souls lived leslie and willow found anfisas former residence in one of these areas a charming and wellpainted gray and white saltbox structure shaded by a copperleafed maple with a clipped front lawn and flowerbeds planted with a riot of pansies so whatre we trying to find out exactly leslie asked as willow pulled to a stop by the curb leslie had brought along a box of glazed donuts and shed spent most of the drive gorging herself upon them she licked her fingers as she asked the question bending down to squint through the window at anfisas former house i dont know willow said something that could help owens idea was the best leslie said loyally call in the feds and hand her over theres got to be something less well less brutal than that we dont want to destroy her life were talking about a yard full of rats leslie reminded her a yard of rats that she denies exists i know but maybe theres a reason why she doesnt know theyre there or why she cant face admitting theyre there we need to be able to help her confront this leslie blew out a breath and said whatever sweetie theyd come to port terryton without much of a plan of what theyd do once they got there but as they looked fairly harmlessone of them just beginning to show a pregnancy and the other placid enough to inspire trustthey decided to knock on a few doors the third house they tried was the one that provided them with the insight theyd been looking for it was however not an insight that willow would have liked to unearth from barbie townsend across the street from anfisa telyegins home they received cups of tea with lemon chocolate chip cookies and a wealth of information barbie had even kept a scrapbook of the rat lady affair as the port terryton newspaper had come to call it leslie and willow hardly spoke on the drive home theyd planned to have lunch in port terryton but neither of them had an appetite once they were finished talking to barbie townsend they were both intent upon getting back to napier lane and informing their husbands of what theyd learned husbands after all were intended to deal with this sort of situation what else were they for they were supposed to be the protectors wives were the nurturers thats the way it was they were everywhere willow told her husband interrupting him in the midst of a phone call to a prospective client scott the newspaper even had pictures of them rats leslie informed her owen she went directly to his office and barged right in trailing her paisley shawl behind her like a security blanket the yard was infested shed planted ivy just like here the health department and the police and the courts all got involved the neighbors sued owen it took five years willow told scott my god five years jasmine will be twelve in five years max will be ten and well have blytheorcooper as well and probably two more maybe three and if we havent solved this problem by then she began to cry so afraid for her children was she becoming it cost them a fortune in lawyers fees leslie gilbert told owen because every time the court ordered her to do something she countered with a lawsuit herself or she appealed we dont have the kind of money they have in port terryton whatre we going to do shes sick in some way willow said to scott i know that and i dont want to hurt her but still shes got to be made to see only how can we make her see if she denies theres a problem in the first place how willow wanted to go the mental health route while the napier lane menfolk gathered nightly to come up with a plan of action that would take care of the problem posthaste willow did some research on the internet what she learned opened her heart to the russian woman who she realized clearly wasnt responsible in full for the infestation of her property read this willow said to her husband its a sickness scott its a mental disorder its like you know when people have too many cats women usually older women you can take all their cats away but if you dont deal with the mental problem they just go out and get more cats youre saying she collects rats scott asked her i dont think so willow if you want to take the psychological viewpoint then lets call this what it is denial she cant admit that shes got rats because of what rats imply the men agreed with scott especially beau downey who pointed out that as a foreigneror furinner as he pronounced itanfisa telyegin probably didnt know a damn thing about hygiene personal or otherwise god only knew what the inside of her house was like had any of them seen it no well then he rested his case they ought to just set up a little accident over at a fire say started by bad wiring or maybe by gas leaking at the side of the house scott wouldnt hear of that and owen gilbert began making noises to distance himself from the whole situation rose hart who lived across the street and didnt have as much invested in the situationpointed out that they didnt really know how many rats there were so perhaps they were getting too excited about what was really a simple situation willow only saw three the one she trapped and two others it could be were getting too riled up it could be this is a simpler problem than we think but in port terryton it was an infestation willow cried wringing her hands and even if therere only two more if we dont get rid of them therell soon be twenty we cant ignore this scott tell them several women exchanged knowing glances willow mckenna had never been able to stand on her own two feet even now it was ava downeywho would have believed itwho offered a potential solution if shes in denial as you suggest scott darlin ava said why dont we simply do somethin to make her fantasy world real what would that be leslie gilbert asked she didnt like ava whom she saw as being after every womans husband and she generally avoided speaking to her but the circumstances were dire enough that she was willing to put her aversion aside and listen to anything that promised to solve the problem quickly she had after all just that morning tried to start her car only to find that wires in the engine had been chewed up by vermin lets get rid of the creatures for her ava said two or three or twenty lets just get rid of them billy hart gulped down what was the last of his ninth beer of the evening and pointed out that no exterminator would take on the job even if the neighbors paid to have it done not without anfisa telyegins cooperation owen concurred as did scott and beau didnt ava remember what the agent from home safety exterminators had told leslie and willow course i remember ava said but what im suggestin is that we take on the work ourselves its her property scott said she might call in the cops and have us arrested if we go settin traps all around her yard honey beau downey added then well have to do it when shes not home but shell see the traps willow said shell see the dead rats in them shell know youre misunderstandin me darlin ava purred im not suggestin we use traps at all everyone living near knew everyone elses habits what time billy hart staggered out for the morning paper for example or how long beau downey revved up the motor of his suv before he finally blasted off for work each day this was part of being on friendly terms with one another so no one felt compelled to remark upon the fact that willow mckenna could say to the minute exactly when anfisa telyegin went to work at the community college each evening and when she returned home the plan was simple after owen gilbert obtained the appropriate footwear for them allno man wanted to traipse through what might be ratinfested ivy in his loafersthey would make their move eight routersas they called themselveswould form a shouldertoshoulder line and move slowly through the ivycovered front yard in heavy rubber boots this line would drive the rats toward the house where the terminators would be waiting for them as they emerged from the ivy on the run from the rubber boots and the terminators would be armed with bats with shovels and with anything else that would eliminate the nasty creatures it seems to me its the only way ava downey pointed out because while no one truly wanted anfisa telyegin to have to find her property littered with rats killed by traps so also did no one want to find rats in their own yard where the creatures might manage to stagger before succumbing to a crawloffanddiesomewhereelse poison if thats the route the neighbors chose so handtorodent combat appeared to be the only answer and as ava downey put it in her inimitable fashion i dont expect you fine big strong men mind gettin a little blood on your hands not in a cause good as this what were they to say to such a challenge to their masculinity a few feet shuffled and someone murmured i dont know about this but ava countered with i just dont see any other way to do it course im willin to listen to any other suggestions there were no others so a date was chosen and everyone set about preparing himself three nights later all the children gathered at the harts house to keep them out of the way and out of sight of what was going to happen at no one wanted their offspring to hear or see the destruction that was planned children are sensitive to this sort of thing the wives informed their husbands after a morningcoffee agreement to stand as one the less they knew about what their daddies were up to the better for them all the women said no bad memories and no bad dreams the men among them who didnt like blood violence or death bolstered themselves with two thoughts first they considered their childrens health and safety second they dwelt upon the higher good one or two of them reminded himself that a yard of rats wouldnt go over well with the wingate courier nor would it get napier lane very far toward achieving perfect place to live status others just kept telling themselves that it was only two rats they were talking about two rats and nearly ten times that in men well those were odds that anyone could live with thirty minutes after anfisa telyegin left and headed for the bus stop and the ride to the community college and her russian literature class the men made their move in the darkness and much was the relief of the faintatheart when the routers managed to drive only four rats into the waiting line of terminators beau downey was among this latter group and he was happy to dispatch all four rats himself yelling gimme some light over here scare the hell out of em as he chased down one rodent after another indeed later it would be said that he took a little too much pleasure in the process he wore his bloodspattered jumpsuit with the distinction of a man whos never fought in a real battle he talked about nailin the little bastards and gave a war whoop as his bat made contact with rat number four because of this he was the one who pointed out that the backyard had to be dealt with too so the same process was gone through there with the net result being five more furry corpses five more bodies in the garbage bag nine rats not so bad after all owen gilbert said with the relief of someone whod made sure up front he was among the routers and consequently forever free of the blood of the innocent that dont seem right to me billy hart pointed out not with the droppings all over the mckennas yard and not with leslies engine wires getting chomped i dont think we got them all whos for crawling under the house i got a smoke bomb or three we could use to scare em out so a smoke bomb was set off and three more rats met the fate of their fellows but a fourth got away from the best of beaus efforts and made a dash for anfisas chicken coop someone shouted get him but no one was fast enough he slithered beneath the shelter and disappeared from view what was odd was that the chickens didnt notice a rat in their midst from inside the coop came not a single rustling wing or protesting squawk it was as if the chickens had been drugged or more ominously eaten by rats clearly someone was going to have to see if the latter was the case but no one leapt to the opportunity the men advanced on the chicken coop leery and those with flashlights found that they could barely hold them steady upon the little structure grab that door and swing it open owen one of the men said lets get that last mother and get out of here owen hesitated unanxious to be confronted by several dozen mutilated chicken corpses and chicken corpses certainly seemed very likely since even with the approach of the men no sound came from within the coop beau downey said hell in disgust when owen didnt move he lurched past him and yanked open the door himself and threw a smoke bomb inside and thats when it happened rats poured through the opening rats by the dozen rats by the hundred small rats large rats obviously wellfed rats they flooded from the chicken coop like boiling oil from a battlement and began to shoot off in every direction the men flailed clubs and bats and shovels at them every which way bones crunched rats squealed and screamed blood spurted in the air flashlights captured the carnage in pools of bright illumination the men didnt speak they merely grunted as one after another the rats were chased down it was like a primitive battle for territory engaged in by two primordial species only one of which was going to survive by the end anfisa telyegins yard was littered with the blood bones and bodies of the enemy any rats that escaped had done so to either the mckennas or the gilberts yard and they would be dealt with there by professionals as to the land that those few remaining rats had left behind in their flight it was like the scene of any other disaster not a place that can be cleaned up quickly and certainly not a place that would soon be forgotten but the men had promised their wives that the job would be done without signs left behind so they did their best to scrape up broken furry bodies and wash the ivy and the outside of the chicken coop free of blood they discovered in doing this that there had never been chickens in the coop in the first place and what this implied about anfisa telyegins daily delivery of corn to the coop indeed what this implied about anfisa telyegin herself it was billy hart who said shes nuts and beau downey who suggested we gotta get her out of the goddamn neighborhood but before either of these comments could be mooted in any way the decrepit front gate of opened and anfisa herself stepped into the yard the plan hadnt been thought out enough to allow for midterm exams that ended class earlier than usual that night it also hadnt been thought out enough to consider what a line of eight men tramping through ivy was likely to do to that greenery so anfisa telyegin took one look at the mess in her yardsufficiently lit by the streetlight in front of her houseand she gave a horrified cry that could be heard all the way to the bus stop she cried out not so much because she loved her ivy and mourned the exfoliation brought about by eight pairs of bootshod feet rather she cried out because she knew intuitively what that troddendown ivy meant my god she keened no my god there was no way out of her yard save through the front so the men emerged one by one they found anfisa kneeling in the midst of the trampled ivy her arms clutched across her body swaying side to side no no she cried and she began to weep you do not understand what you have done the men were not equipped to handle this clubbing rats yes that was right up their alley but offering comfort to a stranger whose suffering made no sense to them that was quite another matter good god theyd done the mad woman a favor hadnt they jesus so theyd mutilated a little bit of ivy in the process ivy grew like weeds especially in this yard it would all be back to normal in a month get willow scott mckenna said as ill get leslie owen gilbert muttered and the rest of them dispersed as quickly as they could with the furtive air of little boys whove had perhaps too much fun doing something for which they will soon be punished willow and leslie came on the run from rose harts house they found anfisa weeping and swaying beating her fists against her breasts can you get her inside scott mckenna asked his wife owen gilbert said to leslie jeez make her see its just ivy les itll grow back and it had to be done willow for whom empathy was actually something of a curse was herself fighting back an onslaught of emotion in the presence of the russian womans anguish she hadnt expected to feel anything other than relief upon the disposal of the rats so the guilt and the sorrow she was experiencing confused her mightily she cleared her throat and said to leslie will you and bent to take anfisas arm miss telyegin she said its all right really itll be all right will you come inside please may we make you some tea with leslie helping she got the sobbing woman to her feet and as the rest of the neighborhood wives began to gather on rose harts front lawn willow and leslie mounted the front steps of and helped anfisa open the door scott followed after what hed seen in the chicken coop he wasnt about to let his wife walk into that house without him god only knew what they would find inside but his imagination had fed him inaccurate images for inside anfisa telyegins house there was not a sign of anything as much as a hair being out of place he saw this felt ashamed of what hed been anticipating and excused himself leaving leslie and willow to comfort anfisa where and how they could leslie put water on to boil willow looked for cups and tea and anfisa sat at the kitchen table shoulders shaking as she sobbed forgive please forgive oh miss telyegin willow murmured these things happen sometimes theres nothing to forgive you trusted me anfisa wept i am so sorry for what i have done i shall sell i shall move i shall find theres no need for that willow said we dont want you to move we just want you to be safe on your property we all want to be safe what ive done to you anfisa cried not once but twice you cannot forgive it was the but twice that caused leslie gilbert to realize uneasily that hard as it was to accept the russian woman and willow mckenna were actually talking at crosspurposes she said hey will in a monitory tone just as anfisa said my dearest little friends all of you gone which was when willow feeling a chill run over her finally climbed aboard the locomotive of comprehension she looked at leslie does she mean yeah will i think she does it was only when anfisa telyegin posted a for sale sign in front of her house on napier lane two weeks later that willow mckenna managed to get the complete story from the immigrant woman shed gone to bearing a plate of christmas cookies as a peace offering and unlike the previous occasion of the dropdead brownies this time anfisa opened the door she beckoned willow inside with a nod of her head she took her into the kitchen and made her tea it seemed that the passage of two weeks had been sufficient to allow the older woman not only time to grieve but also time to decide to bring willow a partial step into her world twenty years she said as they sat at the table i would not become who they wanted me to be and i would not be silent so they sent me away lubyanka first do you know what that is run by kgb yes a dreadful place and from there siberia willow said prison in a whisper youve been in prison prison would be nice concentration camp this was oh ive heard your people laugh about this place siberia to them it is a joke the salt mines in siberia i have heard this but to be there with no one year after year to be forgotten because ones lover was the important voice the voice that counted while until he died one was merely a helpmate never taken seriously by anyone till the authorities took one seriously it was a terrible time you were what did they call it willow tried to remember a dissident a voice they didnt like who would not be still who taught and wrote until they came to fetch her and then it was lubyanka and then it was siberia and there in that cell the little ones came i was afraid at first the filth the disease i drove them off but still they came they came and they watched me and then i saw they wanted very little and they were afraid too so i offered them bits some bread a sliver of meat when i had it and so they stayed and i wasnt alone the rats willow tried to keep the aversion from her voice they were your friends to this day she replied but miss telyegin willow said youre an educated woman youve read youve studied you must know rats carry diseases they were good to me yes i see you believe that but that was then when you were in prison and desperate you dont need rats now let people take their place anfisa telyegin lowered her head invasion and killing she said some things cannot be forgotten but they can be forgiven and no one wants you to leave we know i know you had to leave your home once before in port terryton i know about what happened there the police the lawsuits the courts miss telyegin youve got to see that if you move away and start over again and if you encourage rats to live on your property again dont you see that youll just be back where you started no ones going to let you choose rats over people i will not do that again anfisa said but i cannot stay here not after what has happened just as well darlin ava downey said over her gin and tonic eight months had passed since the night of the rats and anfisa telyegin was gone from their midst the neighborhood had returned to normal and the new occupants of a family called houston with an attorney husband a pediatrician wife a danish au pair and two wellscrubbed children of eight and ten who wore uniforms to their private school and carried their books to and from the car in neat satchelswere finally doing what the local inhabitants had long desired for weeks on end painters wielded their brushes wallpaperers carried rolls into the house wood finishers sanded and stained drapers created masterworks for the windows the chicken coop was carted off and burnt the ivy was removed the picket fence was replaced and a lawn and flowerbeds were planted in front of the house while an english garden was designed for the back and six months after that napier lane was finally designated a perfect place to live by the wingate courier with the house that was chosen to symbolize the beauties of the neighborhood and there was no jealousy over that fact although the downeys were rather cool when the rest of the neighbors offered the houstons their congratulations on having selected by the newspaper as the model of domiciliary perfection after all the downeys had restored their own house first and ava had from the beginning been so kind as to offer her expertise in inte rior design to madeline houston no matter that madeline had chosen to ignore virtually all of those suggestions common courtesy demanded that the houstons decline the pictorial honor presented to them passing it along to the downeys who wereif nothing elsementors to everyone when it came to restoration and interior decoration but the houstons apparently didnt see it that way so they posed happily at the gate of when the newspaper photographers came to call and they framed the subsequent front page of the wingate courier and placed it in their front hallway so everyoneincluding the greeneyed downeys could see it when they came to call so just as well darlin was said with some mixed feelings by ava downey when willow mckenna stopped to chat in the midst of a walk with little cooper snoozing in his stroller ava was sitting in her faux wicker rocking chair on the front porch celebrating a warm spring day with her first outdoor gin and tonic of the season she was referring to the departure of anfisa telyegin from their midst something that willow herself hadnt quite come to terms with despite the advent of the houstons whowith their children their au pair and their commitment to home improvementwere so much more suited to napier lane cn you imagine what wed be goin through right now if we hadnt taken steps to deal with the problem ava asked but if youd seen her that night willow couldnt remove from her mind the image of the russian woman as shed been on her knees weeping in the ivy and then to learn about what the rats meant to her i just feel so extended postpartum ava said thats what this is what you need is a drink beau beau honey you in there darlin fix willow here oh no ive got to get dinner and the kidsre alone and its just i cant stop feeling sad about it all its like we drove her off and i never thought id do something like that ava ava shrugged and rattled her ice cubes all for the best she noted what leslie gilbert said darkly was sure ava would feel that way southerners are used to driving people off their property its one of their sports but she said this mostly because shed watched ava zero in on owen at the new years eve party she hadnt yet forgotten that theyd used their tongues when theyd kissed although owen was still denying that fact willow said but she didnt need to leave id forgiven her hadnt you sure but when someones ashamed whatre they supposed to do ashamed was how willow herself felt ashamed that shed panicked ashamed that shed tracked down anfisas previous residence and ashamed most of all that having tracked down the truth in port terryton she hadnt given the russian woman the chance to rectify matters before the men acted had she done that had she told anfisa what shed unearthed about her surely anfisa would have taken steps to make sure that what had happened in port terryton didnt happen in east wingate i didnt really give her a chance she told scott i should have told her what we intended to do if she wouldnt bring in the exterminators i think i should tell her that now that what we did was right but how we did it was wrong i think ill feel better if i do that scott scott mckenna thought no explanations to anfisa telyegin were necessary but he knew willow she wouldnt rest until shed made whatever peace she felt she needed to make with their erstwhile neighbor he personally considered it a waste of her time but the truth was that he was so caught up in meeting the needs ofpraise godthe twelve clients he had now at mckenna computing designs that he really didnt do more than murmur whatever you thinks right will when his wife at last mentioned going to see anfisa she was in prison willow reminded him in a concentration camp if wed known that at the time im sure we would have done things differently wouldnt we scott was only half listening so he said yeah i guess which willow took for agreement it wasnt difficult to trace anfisa willow did it through the community college where a sympathetic secretary in human resources met her for coffee and slipped across the table to her an address in lower waterford one hundred and fifteen miles away willow didnt take leslie gilbert this time instead she asked if she would babysit cooper for a day since cooper was at the stage where he slept ate eliminated and spent the rest of the time cooing at the mobiles above his crib leslie knew that shed not be distracted from her daily intake of talk shows so she agreed and since shed been looking forward to the topic of the day on her favorite showi had group sex with my sons friendsshe didnt ask willow where she was going why she was going there or if she wanted company this was just as well willow wanted to talk to anfisa telyegin alone she found anfisas new house on rosebloom court in lower waterford and when she saw it she felt a new onslaught of guilt comparing it to her previous homes both in port terryton and on napier lane those houses were both historical properties this was not they had been reflective of the time period during which theyd been built this was reflective of nothing more than a tracthome designers desire to make as much money as he could from as little creative effort as possible it was the sort of place families had moved into in droves after world war ii with stucco walls a concrete driveway with a crack down the middle from which weeds grew and a tarpaper roof willows spirits sank when she saw it she sat in her car and regretted everything but most of all she regretted her propensity to panic if she hadnt panicked when she saw the first rat if she hadnt panicked when she found the droppings in her vegetable garden if she hadnt panicked when she learned about anfisas trouble in port terryton perhaps she wouldnt have condemned the poor woman to life in this dismal culdesac with its barren onetree lawns its warped garage doors that dominated the house fronts and its patchy uneven sidewalks it was her choice darlin ava downey would have said and lets not forget the chicken coop willow she didnt have to encourage rats to take up residence in her yard now did she this last question resonated in willows mind as she sat in front of anfisas house it prompted her to recognize that there was more of a difference between this house and the last house than was described by the structure itself for unlike the house on napier lane this yard had no ivy anywhere indeed it had nothing in which a rat could live all it comprised were flowerbeds neatly planted with neatly trimmed shrubs and a front lawn clipped as smooth as an ice rink perhaps willow thought it had taken two houses and two neighborhoods in an uproar for anfisa telyegin to learn that she couldnt share her property with rats and hope to go unnoticed willow had to make sure that some good had come of what had happened in her neighborhood so she got out of her car and crept quietly up to the backyard fence to have a look a chicken coop doghouse or toolshed would be a very bad sign but a glance over the fence to the patio the lawn and the rosebushes proved that no habitat for rodents had been provided this time around by the russian woman sometimes peopleve got to learn their lessons the hard way willow ava downey would have said and it certainly looked as if anfisa telyegin had learned hard way or not willow felt somewhat redeemed by what she saw but she knew that full absolution wouldnt come until she assured herself that anfisa was doing well in her new environment indeed she hoped that a conversation with her former neighbor would evolve into an expression of gratitude from anfisa to the napier lane residents whod managedhowever dramaticallyto bring her to her senses that would be something that willow could carry home to her husband and her friends and thus redeem herself in their eyes as well for she after all had instigated everything willow knocked at the door which was sunk into a small square entry defined by a single concrete step she felt a twinge of concern when a window curtain on the entry flicked and she called out miss telyegin are you home its willow mckenna with the hope of reassuring the woman her greeting seemed to do the trick the door cracked open three inches revealing a shaft of anfisa telyegin from head to toe willow smiled hello i hope you dont mind my dropping by i was in the area and i wanted to see her voice drifted off anfisa was looking at her with no comprehension at all willow said willow mckenna your nextdoor neighbor on napier lane dyou remember me how are you miss telyegin anfisas lips curved suddenly at this and she stepped away from the door roused by the mention of napier lane willow took this movement for permission to enter so she gave a little push to the door and went inside everything seemed fine the house was as neat as a surgeons brain swept dusted and polished true there was a slightly peculiar odor in the air but willow put that down to the fact that none of the windows were open despite the fine spring day the place had probably been closed up all winter with the heater sealing in everything from cooking odors to cleaning scents how are you willow said to the older woman ive been thinking about you for quite a long time are you working in a college in this area now youre not commuting down to east wingate are you anfisa smiled beatifically i am well she said i am so well will you have tea the relief willow felt at being greeted so warmly was like a down comforter on an icy night she said have you forgiven me anfisa have you been able to truly forgive me what anfisa said in reply couldnt have been more of a comfort had willow written the words herself i learned much on napier lane she murmured i do not live as i lived then oh my gosh said willow i am so glad sit sit anfisa said in here please let me make tea willow was only too happy to draw a chair from the table and watch as anfisa bustled contentedly around the kitchen she chatted as she filled a kettle and pulled teacups and saucers out of a cupboard this was a good place for her to settle anfisa told willow it was a simpler neighborhood she said more suited to someone like herself with simpler needs and simpler tastes the houses and yards were plain like her and people kept mostly to themselves this is better for me anfisa said it is more what i am accustomed to id hate to think you consider napier lane a mistake though willow said i learned much about life in napier lane anfisa told her much more than i have learned anywhere else for that i am grateful to you to everyone i would not be as i am this moment if it were not for napier lane and how she was at this moment was at peace she said not in so many words but in her actions in the expressions of pleasure delight and satisfaction that flickered across her face as she talked she wanted to know about willows family how was her husband her little girl and boy and there was another small one wasnt there and would there be more surely yes there would be more wouldnt there willow blushed at this last question and what it implied about anfisas intuition yes she admitted to the russian there would be more in fact she hadnt told her husband yet but she was fairly certain that she was already pregnant with the fourth mckenna i hadnt intended it to be so soon after cooper willow confessed but now that its happened ive got to say im thrilled i love big families its what i always wanted yes anfisa smiled little ones how they make life good willow returned the smile and felt so gratified by the reception that anfisa was giving her by anfisas every exclamation of pleasure over each piece of news willow imparted that she leaned forward and squeezed the russian womans hand she said i am so glad i came to see you you seem like a different person here i am a different person anfisa said i do not do what i did before you learned willow said thats what life is about life is good anfisa agreed life is very full nothing could be better to hear this is like music to my ears anfisa may i call you that may i call you anfisa is that all right id like to be friends anfisa clasped willows hand much as willow had just clasped hers friends she said yes that would be good willow perhaps you can come to east wingate to visit us willow said and we can come here to visit you we have no family within five hundred miles and wed be thrilled to have you be well like a grandmother to my children if youd be willing in fact thats what i was hoping for when you first moved to napier lane anfisa brightened put a hand on her chest me you thought of me as a grandmother to your little ones she laughed clearly delighted at the prospect i will love to be that i will love it through and through and you she grasped willows hand once moreyou are too young to be a grandmother so you must be the aunt willow said the aunt and she smiled although mystified yes yes anfisa said the aunt to my little ones as i will be the grandmother to yours to yourwillow swallowed she couldnt stop herself from looking around she forced a smile and went on saying you have little ones yourself i didnt know that anfisa come anfisa rose and put her hand on willows shoulder you must meet them without wanting her feet to do what they were doing willow followed anfisa from the kitchen to the living room and from the living room down a narrow hall the odor shed first smelled when shed entered the house was stronger here and stronger still when anfisa opened one of the bedroom doors i keep them in here anfisa said to willow over her shoulder the neighbors dont know and you mustnt tell i learned so very very much from living as i did on napier lane introduction to remember ill always love you this story was one i thought about for a long time a number of years ago a friend of mine related to me a situation in which a man had made a deathbed declaration of love to his wife that in context seemed like nothing that had any resemblance to love at all my initial reaction to the brief tale was outrage my secondary reaction was anger my third reaction was something typical to anyone who is born to write i thought about what a good story it would make the tough part was trying to decide what circumstances in the life of the man and wife in this story would culminate in his final declaration of love for her not to mention the situation in which he made that declaration i considered just about everything i went on a hike in italys cinque terre and thought about placing the story there i did the same in the italian lakes and seriously considered isola di pescatori as a perfect spot to place my tale the only problem was that nothing aside from potential settingswas actually coming to me and you cant exactly write a short story if there is nothing but location to drive it finally in a conversation with my fiancé i arrived at the kernel for this story which was the reason that the husband dies once i had that i was on my way i sent my assistant to the library and the internet to gather some information for me and while she did that i began creating the characters who would people the world of eric and charlotte lawton i soon saw that i didnt need an exotic location for this story at all indeed i saw that the story would sit well right here in southern california in my own backyard when i completed my eleventh novel i finally had the time to write this story so here it is my answer to why that unknown man in a tale told me by one of my girlfriends said remember ill always love you to his wife just before he died remember ill always love you charlie lawton didnt cry at her husbands burial shed done her crying already when it first happened and then at the funeral in the aftermath of his horrible death shed wept buckets and she was all cried out so she just watched the proceedings numbly theyd earlier given her all the graveside options she could have the minister say another prayerthis one briefand then she could depart immediately for a somber reception at which the mourners would be given food and drink and a final chance to murmur inadequate words of comfort to eric lawtons widow or she could remain and watch as the hastily chosen coffin was lowered into the ground she could then pick a flower from the funeral wreath that she herself had purchased only two days earlier from within a fog and through anguishsmeared vision she could toss this flower into the grave which would encourage the other mourners to do likewise and then she could walk off to the waiting limousine or she could remain for every second of the burial right down to the moment when the backhoeparked at a discreet distancerumbled across the lawn to the grave she could stay until the vault was sealed and the soil was packed and the squares of lawn replaced she could even watch them affix the plastic tag to a pole that would mark the site until the gravestone arrived she could read his name eric lawton as if that might help her absorb the fact that he was gone and she could fill in the rest herself eric lawton beloved husband of charlotte eric lawton dead at fortytwo she chose the first option it was easier to turn away than to watch the coffin disappear into forever as for giving the other mourners an opportunity to show a sign of their affection for eric by dropping flowers into his grave she didnt want to do anything that might remind her how few mourners there actually were at the house later grief struck her like a virus she stood at the window her throat tight and hot and she felt as if a fever were coming upon her she looked out at the backyard into whose landscaping she and her husband had put such thought and had maintained with such loving care while behind her the voices were hushed in keeping with both the dolor and the delicacy of the situation tragedy she overheard the whisper fine man was murmured several times fine man in every way was spoken once in every way but one charlie thought she felt an arm slip round her and she leaned into the longtime friendship of bethany franklin whod driven out from hollywood to this soulless suburb of soulless los angeles the very night charlie had phoned her with the news shed shrieked eric bethie oh my god and bethany had come on the run shed said that god damn motorcycle in a voice that told charlie her teeth were clenched round the final word and then im on my way dyou hear me charlie im on my way now she said quietly how you holding up chickadee you want i should show these folks the front door with an effort charlie put her own hand on bethanys where it rested on her shoulder she said everything started when i let him buy the harley beth you didnt let him do anything charles it doesnt work that way hed got a tattoo as well did i tell you that first the tattoo it was only on his arm and i thought well why not its a guy thing isnt it and then the harley what did i do wrong nothing bethany said it wasnt your fault how can you say that this all happened because bethany swung charlie around she said dont do this charles what was the last thing he said to you she already knew of course it was one of the first things charlie had told her once the hysteria had subsided and the subsequent shock had settled in she was asking only so that charlie herself had to hear the words again and had to digest them remember ill always love you she recited he said that for a reason bethany declared then why therere some questions you never get answered in life why is generally one of them bethany hugged her onearmed a squeeze to tell her that she wasnt alone no matter how she felt no matter how it seemed and was going to seem in the big expensive suburban house that theyd bought three years ago because its time for a family char dont you think and no one believes cities are good for kids declared with an infectious smile declared with that spurt of eric energy that had always kept him active curious involved and alive charlie said looking at the assembled guests i cant believe his family didnt come i phoned his exwife i told her what happened i asked her to tell the rest of his familywell to tell his parents who else is there reallybut none of them even sent a message beth not his father not his mother not his own daughter maybe the ex didntwhats her name paula maybe paula didnt pass on the word if the divorce was nastywas it fairly there was another man involved eric fought paula for custody of janie that couldve done the trick it was years ago put the screws to him in death some people can never let go dyou think she might not have told his parents sounds about right bethany said it was the thought that paula in a last stroke of posthumous revenge upon her erstwhile husband might have refused to pass along the news to erics parents that made charlie decide to contact the elder lawtons herself the problem was that eric had long been estranged from his parents a sad fact that hed revealed to charlie during their first holiday season together close to her own family despite the distance that separated them all shed brought up making arrangements for the holidays dyou want to spend them with your family or mine or should we divide them up or have everyone here here at that time was a twobedroom condo in the hollywood hills from which eric ventured forth each day to his job in the distant suburbs while charlie dashed off to her casting calls with the hope that something other than being the momwiththeperfectfamily on wow soap commercials might be in her future a twobedroom condo with an airlinersized kitchen and a single bathroom was not the ideal spot for entertaining mutual families so she had prepared herself for the inevitable division of time between the end of november and the beginning of january thanksgiving in one location christmas eve in another christmas day at a third and new years eve together at home alone in front of the artificial fire with fruit and champagne only that wasnt how the holidays played out because eric told her the painful story of his estrangement from his parents about the hunting accident that had caused the estrangement and what had followed that accident i tripped and the gun went off he confessed one night in the darkness if id known what to i didnt know what to do i had no first aid he bled to death char with me shaking him and yelling his name and crying and telling him begging him to hold on to just hold on im so sorry shed said and shed pulled his head to her breast because his voice had broken and his body trembled and he clung to her and she wasnt used to a man showing emotion your own brother eric what a horrible thing he was eighteen they tried to forgive me but he was brent was like the crown prince to them i couldnt take his place i drifted off eventually just a bit at first then more and more they decided to let me it was best for us all we couldnt get over it we couldnt get past it charlie tried to imagine what it had been like for him growing to adulthood and then toward middle age and always knowing hed shot his own brother theyd been birding out at dawn at the edge of the desert where the doves wintered theyd hunted birds from childhood first with their father and then when brent was old enough to driveon their own and on their second such trip together the worst had happened they probably forgave you years ago shed said to her husband loyally have you tried to contact them i dont want to see it in their eyes the looking at me and trying to seem like theres nothing beneath that look but love well theres not hate beneath it no just sorrow which i put there being dumb being slipshod not holding the gun right not watching my feet you were only fifteen charlie protested i was old enough for what shed wondered but she worked out the answer eventually old enough to disappear they had a right to know that he was dead however so even though charlie had no idea where marilyn and clark lawton lived she determined she would find them and give them the information she knew that eric would want it that way the very fact that he had a virtual gallery of family pictures told her that he had never stopped feeling the aching loss of a place in his parents hearts she went to these pictures the day after his funeral lightheaded and soremuscled after the trauma of the past week the grieving tightness in her throat was still therehad been there since the night eric diedand so was the sickly feverish sensation shed had for days she couldnt remember how it was to feel normal any longer but things had to be done the pictures were in the living room standing like deliberate intrusive thoughts at intervals among the books on either side of the fireplace she knew who every individual was because eric had told her several times but hed identified most of them by first name only which wasnt helpful in the present circumstances aunt marianne at her high school graduation greataunt shirley with greatuncle pat grandma louise on which side of the family eric uncle ross brent at seven mom at ten dad at thirteen mom and dad on their wedding day grandpa and his brothers nana jessielynn but aside from his parents last name she knew no one elses and a look in the phone book told her no lawtons named clark or marilyn lived nearby not that she had expected them to be near shed hoped for that but at the same time shed already realized that hunting trips taken by teenaged boys to the edge of the desert suggested a town not far away from a place even more arid than the la suburb where she and eric had bought their home she got out a map of california and considered beginning her search in the south right at the state border she could call information for every town that sided the slice of land that was highway but she got not much farther than paradise hills before she reconsidered this painstaking approach she went back to the pictures and took them down she carried them into the kitchen and set them carefully on the granite counter they were all old pictures the most recent being brent at seven and some of them were tintypes assiduously preserved still sometimes she knew families made note of the subjects of photographs and the locations where the pictures had been taken as well and if that was the case with erics family pictures there might be a clue as to the current whereabouts of his relatives so she eased off the back of each of the frames and examined the reverse side of the photographs only two provided writing a delicate hand had written brent lawton seven years old yosemite on the back side of the picture of erics brother a spidery pen had placed jessielynn just before merles wedding on the picture of one of the grandmothers in erics life but that was it charlie sighed and began to reassemble the frames and their contents glass photograph cardboard filler and velvetcovered backing when she got to the lawtons wedding picture however she discovered that something besides the glass the photo the filler and the backing had been put into the frame perhaps it was because the more recent the photo the thinner the paper on which it had been printed but the wedding picture had required something extra to fill up the space between it and the backing this something was a folded paper which unfolded turned out to be a blank receipt printed at the top of this was time on my side and an address on front street in temecula california charlie got out her map again a shot of excitement and certainty flashed through her when she found temecula at the edge of the desert sitting alongside another desert freeway as if waiting for her to discover its secrets she didnt go at once she planned to head out the very next day but she awakened to find that the tightness in her throat had become a burning and the soreness in her muscles had metamorphosed into chills it was more than simply exhaustion and grief she realized shed come down with the flu she felt resignation but very little surprise shed been running on nerves alone for days with virtually no food and even less sleep it was no shock to find herself become a breeding ground for illness she forced herself to the drugstore and prowled the length of the coldandflu aisle blearily reading the labels on medicines that promised a quick fix foror at least temporary relief fromthe nasty little bug that had invaded her body she knew the routine lots of liquids and bed rest so she stocked up on cup of soup cup of noodles liptons and top ramen as long as the microwave worked she would be all right she told herself erics family could wait the twentyfour or fortyeight hours it would take for her to regain her strength thus it was two days later when charlie set out for temecula even then she did so in the company of bethany franklin for although she felt somewhat buoyed by the fortyeight hours of bed rest interrupted only by forays to the refrigerator and the microwave she didnt trust herself to drive such a distance without a companion bethany didnt like the idea of her going at all she said bluntly you look like hell when she roared up in her pride and joy a silver bmw sports car you should be in bed not traipsing around the state looking for whore we looking for shed brought a bag of cheetos with herabsolute nectar of the gods she announced waving the sack like a woman flagging down a taxiand she munched them as she followed charlie from the front door into the kitchen there the family pictures stood where charlie had left them charlie took up the photo of erics parents along with the receipt from time on my side she said i want to tell his family what happened i dont know where they are and this is the only clue i have bethany took the picture and the receipt as charlie explained where shed found the latter she said why dont we just phone this place charles theres a number and if erics parents own it what do we say charlie asked we cant just tell them about she felt tears threaten again again remember ill always love you char not on the phone beth it wouldnt be right no youre right we cant do it on the phone but youre in no shape to cruise up and down freeways let me go if youre so set on this im fine im okay im feeling better it was just the flu the compromise was that they would travel with the top up and charlie was to bring with her a thermos of liptons chicken noodle and a carton of orange juice as well which she was to use to minister to herself during the long drive to the southeast in this fashion they made their way to temecula down highway which squeezed a concrete valley through the rockstrewn hills that divided the california desert from the sea here greedy developers had raped the dusty land planting it with the seed of their neighborhoods each identical to the last all colored a uniform shade of dun all unshaded by even a single tree all roofed in a pantiled fashion that had prompted the builder of one site to name the monstrosity ludicrously tuscany hills they arrived in temecula just after one in the afternoon and it was no difficult feat for them to find front street it comprised what the city council euphemistically called the historic district and it announced itself from the freeway some mile and a half before the appropriate exit the historic district turned out to be several city blocks separated from the rest of the townits modern halfby a railroad track the freeway a smallish industrial park and a public storage site these city blocks stretched along a twolane street and they were lined with gift shops restaurants and antique stores with the occasional coffee candy or icecream house thrown in for good measure in short the historic district was another name for tourist attraction it might have once been the center of the town but now it was a magnet for people seeking a days respite from the indistinguishable urban sprawl that oozed out from los angeles in all directions like a profitable oil slick there were wooden sidewalks and structures of adobe stucco or brick there were colorful banners quirky signs and a youarehere billboard posted at the edge of the public parking lot it was disneylands main street without having to pay the exorbitant entrance fee and you ask me why i hate to venture out of la bethany commented as she pulled into a vacant space and gazed around with a shudder this is socal at its best phony history for fun and profit it reminds me of calico ghost town you ever been there chickadee the only ghost town on earth that someones managed to turn into a shopping mall charlie smiled and pointed at the youarehere billboard lets look at that sign they found time on my side listed as one of the shops in the first block of the historic district between them theyd decided on the drive that it was probably an establishment selling clocks but when they got to it they discovered that it waslike so many of its companion businessesan antique shop they went inside a low growl greeted them followed by a mans voice admonishing hey you mugs none of that which was directed to a norwich terrier who was curled on a cushion on an old desk chair this stood next to an ancient rolltop desk at which a man was sitting beneath a bright light studying a porcelain bottle through a jewelers lens he looked over the countertop at bethany and charlie saying sorry some folks take her amiss its just her way of saying hello you go back to sleep mugs the dog apparently understood she sank her head back to her paws and sighed deeply her eyelids began to droop charlie scanned the mans face seeking a likeness hoping to see projected on its elderly features an eric who would never be he was the right age to be erics dad he looked about seventy and he was wiry like eric with erics frank gaze and an eric energy that expressed itself in a foot that tapped restlessly against the rung of his chair make yourself to home the old gentleman said have a spec around you looking for anything special actually charlie said as she and bethany approached the counter im looking for a family my husbands family the man scratched his head he set the porcelain bottle down on his desk and placed the jewelers lens next to it dont sell families he said with a smile this ones called lawton bethany said marilyn and clark lawton charlie added we were well i was hoping that you might are you mr lawton by any chance henry leel he said oh charlie felt deflated more the knowledge that the man wasnt erics father struck her more forcefully than she thought it would she said well it was always only a chance driving out here but i hoped you dont happen to know any family called lawton in town do you henry leel shook his head cant say as i do they antiques people he gestured at the shop around him crowded to a claustrophobic degree with furniture and bricabrac i dont charlie felt a slight dizziness come over her and she reached for the counter bethany took her arm she said here take it easy and to henry leel shes just getting over the flu and her husband he died about a week ago his parents dont know about it and were looking for them they the lawtons henry leel said and when bethany nodded he cast a sympathetic gaze on charlie she looks mighty young to be a widow poor thing she is mighty young to be a widow and like i say shes been sick bring her behind here then and sit her down mugs get off that chair and give it to the lady go on you heard me here let me get the pillow off miss mrs whatd you say the name was lawton charlie said forgive me i havent been feeling well his death it was sudden im sure sorry about that here im making you some tea with a tot of brandy in it itll set you up you stay where you are he locked the front door of the shop and disappeared into the back when he returned with the tea he brought a local telephone directory with him eager to be of help to the ladies but a search through its pages turned up no lawtons in the area charlie quelled her disappointment she drank her tea and felt revived enough to tell henry leel how she and bethany had come to choose this shop in temecula as the jumpingoff point to find erics family when shed completed the story and brought forth the wedding picture of erics parents henry gazed at it long and hard his brow furrowed as if he could force recognition out of his skull but he shook his head after a minute of study he said they look a touch familiar ill give you that but i wouldnt want to say that i know them sides i sell old pictures not much different from this so after a while everyone in a picture looks like someone ive seen somewhere here let me show you he went to a dark far corner of the shop and brought out a small bin that stood on the shelf of a kitchen dresser he carried this back to charlie and bethany saying i dont sell many mostly to tearooms theater groups frame shops wanting to use them for display that sort of thing here have a looksee yourself he plopped the bin on the desk see this here one of yours it fits right in with this last bunch in the bin a little more recent but ive got some that age looks like let me see for a second yep it looks like a fifties shot late fifties maybe early sixties charlie had begun to feel uneasy with the first mention of the photographs she didnt want to look at bethany afraid of what her own face might reveal she fingered through the photographs cooperatively unable to avoid noticing the fact that they represented all styles and all periods of time there were tintypes there were old black and white snapshots there were studio studies there were handtinted portraits some of them had handwriting on the back identifying either the subjects or the places charlie didnt want to think what this meant jessielynn just before merles wedding henry leel said so howd you come to think these lawton folksd be here at this shop in temecula there was a receipt bethany responded charlie show him what you found in that frame charlie handed over the slip of paper as henry leel squinted down at it she said it must have been a coincidence the picture this one of his parents it was a bit loose in the frame and he must have been just using it to fill in the gap i saw it and since i was hoping to track down his family i made a leap that wasnt warranted thats all henry leel pulled thoughtfully at his chin he cocked his head to one side and tapped his index fingerits nail blackened by some sort of fungusagainst the receipt he said thesere numbered see here oneohfiveeight in the top righthand corner just hang on a minute i might be able to help you he rustled within his rolltop desk rousing mugs from her slumber at its side she lifted her head and blinked at him sleepily before pillowing herself once again in her paws her master brought forth a worn black floppycovered book of an official nature and he plopped it onto his desktop saying lets see what we can come up with in here in here turned out to be copies of the sales receipts for merchandise for time on my side within a moment the shop owner had leafed back through them to find what was on either side of had been made out to a barbara fryer with a home address in huntington beach not much help there henry leel said regretfully but he added say now heres what we want when he saw the receipt that preceded it heres who youre looking for you said lawton didnt you well ive got myself a lawton right here he swung the accounts book in charlies direction and she saw what shed anticipated seeingwithout knowing or understanding why she would be seeing itthe moment she began fingering through the old pictures eric lawton was written on receipt number instead of an address anywhere at all there was only a phone number erics work number at the pharmaceutical company where hed been director of sales for the seven years that charlie had known him beneath erics name was a list of purchases charlie read gold locket ct century porcelain box womans diamond ring and japanese fan beneath this last was the number ten and the word pix charlie didnt need to ask what that final notation meant bethany pointed to it saying charles is this charlie cut her off her limbs felt like lead but she moved them anyway turning the account book back to the shop owner and saying no its im looking for clark or marilyn lawton this is someone else henry leel said oh well i spose it wouldnt be this fellah he was too young to be who youre looking for anyway i remember him and he was say fortyish fortyfive i remember because look here he spent near seven hundred dollarsthe ring and the locket were the bigmoney itemsand you dont see that kind of sale every day i said to him some ladys going to get lucky and he winked every ladys lucky when shes my lady he said i remember that cocky i thought but cocky in a good way you know what i mean charlie smiled faintly she got to her feet she said thanks thanks so much for your help sorry i couldntve been more of a one henry leel replied say you want to head off right now youre looking green around the gills ask me you need a straight shot of brandy no no im fine thanks charlie said she gripped bethanys arm and drew her steadily from the shop outside an oldtime hitching rail ran along the wooden sidewalk and charlie clutched onto this looking out into the street she thought about pix and what that meant a family conveniently purchased in temecula california but what did that mean and what did it tell her about her husband she felt bethany come close to her side and she blessed her friend for the gift of her silence it continued while out in the bright street cars cruised by and pedestrians dodged between them to dart into yet another shop when she was finally able to speak charlie said what happened was that i accused him of having an affair not that night a week or so before bethany said voice glum he never gave you that locket i guess or the ring or the porcelain box no he didnt maybe he sent them to janie trying to be a good dad he never said in spite of an attempt to control them charlies tears welled anyway spilling onto her cheeks in a silent trail of misery hed been acting different for about three months at first i thought it was worksales being down or something but there were the phone calls he hung up on when i walked into the room there were the times he came home late he always phoned me but the excuses were beth they were so transparent bethany sighed charles i dont know it looks bad i can see that for myself but it just doesnt seem like eric did a harleydavidson seem like eric a tattoo of a snake crawling up his arm charlie began crying in earnest then and the rest of her fears her suspicions and her covert activities in the final week before erics death spilled out of her for her friends ears hed denied an affair earlier when confronted she told bethany hed denied it with such incredulous outrage that charlie had decided to believe in him but three weeks later he suggested casually that she slow down in her decorating of their house and especially that she hold off on their plans for a nursery since we dont really know how much longer were going to live in this place which set fire to her suspicions again shed hated the part of herself that had doubts about eric but shed not been able to stop herself from dwelling on them they led her to snooping in a despicable fashion she was embarrassed to admit to stooping so low as to even go through his bathroomfor gods sakefor signs that there was another woman who might have been in the house with eric when she herself was gone as she told the tale charlie wiped her eyes and even laughed shakily at her own behavior shed been like a character in an afternoon soap opera a woman whose life goes from bad to worse but all the time at her own hands shed studied telephone bills for strange numbers shed gone through her husbands address book looking for cryptic initials that stood in place of a mistresss name shed examined his dirty laundry for telltale signs of lipstick that was not her own shed rustled through his dresser drawers for mementos receipts letters messages ticket stubs or anything else that might give him away shed picked the lock of his briefcase and read every document inside it as if the convoluted reports from biosyn inc were love letters or diaries written in code shed been forced to confess to all of this however when she sank to the depths of opening up a prescription cough syrup shed found in his bathroomnot even knowing why she was opening itwhat did she expect to find in there a genie who would tell her the truthonly to have it slip from her fingers and smash and spill upon the limestone floor that had served to bring her to her senses that rising sense of frustration at not being able to prove what she believed to be true that muttered aha when she saw the bottle that clutching to her bosom of the medicine itself and unscrewing its top with unsteady hands and watching dumbly as it flew from her fingers and broke on the floor spilling out the syrup in an amber pool when this occurred she had realized how futile her investigation was and how ugly it was making her which was why she finally confessed to her husband it seemed the only way to get herself beyond what was troubling her he listened he was terribly upset and after we talked he just went into himself i thought he was punishing me for what id done and i knew i deserved it what i did was wrong but i thought hed get past it wed both get past it and that would be the end of it only a week later he was dead and now charlie glanced at the door of time on my side we know dont we we know what we just dont know who lets go home beth bethany franklin was reluctant to believe the worst of eric lawton she pointed out to charlie that charlies own search had turned up nothing and that for all she knew eric had been squirreling away christmas presents for her or birthday presents or valentines presents some people buy things when they see them bethany pointed out and just hang on to them till the appropriate day but that hardly explained the pictures charlie said hed bought his family at time on my side and what did that mean that he had another family somewhere she decided beyond his earlier marriage to paula beyond his daughter janie and beyond herself for the next two days charlie fought off a relapse of the flu and used her bed time to sort out who among erics limited number of friends might be able and willing to tell her the truth about her husbands private life she decided that terry stewart would be the man erics attorney his regular tennis partner and his buddy from their days in kindergarten if there was a hidden side to eric lawton terry stewart had to know it before she could phone him and make an arrangement to see him however she received her first hint of what erics second life might be one of his colleagues came to call a woman charlie had never met had never even heard of she was named sharon pasternak no relation she said with a smile when she introduced herself at the front door and she apologized for stopping by without phoning she wondered if she could have a look through erics work papers she said the two of them had been assembling a report for the board of directors and eric had taken most of the paperwork home to put it together in a logical fashion i know its awfully soon after well you know and id wait if i could honestly sharon pasternak said as charlie admitted her into the house but the board meets next month and since ill be putting this together by myself now im really sorry to have to come around but i need to get going on it she looked earnest regretful about having even to say erics name not wishing to cause his widow further grief she made all the right noises on the other hand she also said she was a molecular biologist which prompted charlie to ask herself why one of biosyns scientists and its director of sales would be writing a report together cautiously all her senses on alert charlie showed sharon pasternak to erics study where on his desk his briefcase lay sharon flashed her a smile said may i is it all right if i sit here and put one hand on erics swivel chair it might take a while she gestured around the room hes got so many files sure charlie said as pleasantly as she could take your time i have to go through all of this eventually but you can take whatever relates to she made the pause deliberate to your work sharon flushed and dropped her gaze she said thanks so much and she lifted her head when she went on with im so sorry about everything mrs lawton he was a good man he was such a good man her eyes bored meaningfully into charlies fastening upon her for far too long so this was it charlie thought in reaction this was how it played out when you came facetoface with the object of your husbands secret passion except sharon pasternak wasnt erics type plump a head of nononsense dark hair a smattering of makeup ankles too thick she wasnt his type yet it had to be asked what was eric lawtons type who was his type did his wife even know charlie went to her bedroom and closed the curtains she lay in the darkness and listened to the sounds of erics colleague sifting through whatever she wanted to sift through in the study charlie herself had already been through much of the contents of the room during her frenzy of searching for evidence of her husbands infidelity if sharon indeed was the mystery woman charlie wanted to tell her her secret was safe or at least it had been safe till shed showed up at eric lawtons front door dumb move ms pasternak as in boris bethany asked charlie later thats not exactly a name hanging on every tree did you see her id she couldve given you an alias why if she was erics lover what difference does it make whether i know her name or not she might not be erics lover charles she might be someone else altogether charlie considered this point and all its implications i need to talk to terry stewart she decided terry must know who eric was seeing if he was seeing anyone at all but why do you need to know because icharlie drew a deep breath i need absolution the truth will give me absolution for what for not knowing what to believe theres no sin in that for me there is erics oldest friend so often declared my best friend on earth he didnt desert me he never would terry stewart charlie knew had to be confronted without having had the time to prepare a cover for whatever it was he might be hiding about eric as he was an attorneyerics own lawyer in factshe knew how likely it was that he would be set upon taking his clients secrets to the grave so she didnt want her visit to him to be official which meant she would need to waylay him in a location some distance from his glasstowered office the gym turned out to be that location she saw his car parked in front of it when she was on her way to the tennis courts to check for him and she recognized its vanity plate s nei so she pulled into the lot saw him sweating on the stairmaster through the plateglass windows of the establishment and decided to wait for him to emerge there was a starbucks next door and she went there she was in a window seat sipping a chai latte when terry swung open the door of the gym he headed for his car straightening his tie as he walked he looked freshly showered all damp hair and glowing skin she knocked on the window he swung around saw her stopped and smiled he came in her direction and in short order joined her how are you charlie his face was grave and kind charlie shrugged im okay ive been better but ill survive im sorry i havent phoned im a coward i guess if i talk about it shell cry i told myself and i cant avoid talking about it because if i do itd be like ignoring an alligator in your bathtub but i dont want to make her cry shes cried enough already she might even be feeling better and there id be making her live through everything again he pulled out a chair and sat im sorry he was having an affair wasnt he terry jerked back against his seat apparently startled by this frontal attack eric id thought he was at first then id changed my mind well he convinced me really but now he was having an affair wasnt he no god no what makes you think all the changes terry the harley and the tattoo for starters this countys filled with guys in their forties who spend their weekends riding around on harleys theyve got wives kids cats dogs car payments and mortgages and they wake up one morning and say this is all there is and they want more midlife crisis they want the edge back harleys give it to them thats it there were phone calls late nights he supposedly spent at work and a woman came by the house to look through his things she said she was sharon pasternak a molecular biologist at biosyn she said they were working on a reportshe and eric terry why would eric have been working on a report with a biologist for gods sakeand he had some data she said she needed in order to put the report together by herself now hes gone but when she left she took nothing with her whats that supposed to tell me i dont know i think its obvious enough she was looking for traces of what you know he was seeing someone maybe it was her thats impossible why why is it impossible because god charlie he was crazy about you i mean crazy about you had been since the day you two met then she was looking for something else what charlie jeez take it easy okay you look like shit pardon my french have you been sleeping are you eating have you thought about getting away for a few days he lied to me about his family he had pictures he used them to pretend you saw them terry youve been at our house you saw those pictures and you know his family you grew up with him so you must have known charlie clutched the table as a cramp gripped her stomach her bowels felt loose her palms were wet she was falling apart and she hated the fact and the hate made her raise her voice and cry i want the information i have the right to it tell me what you know terry looked puzzled more than anything else what pictures he asked whatre you talking about charlie told him he listened but he shook his head saying sure i knew erics family but that was just his mom his dad and his brother brent and even if i studied those pictures which i didnt i mean who studies family pictures in other peoples houses you just glance at them when you walk by dont youi wouldnt have recognized anyone erics mom died when we were around eight and even before that she was in bed for five years with a stroke i saw her what maybe once so in a picture no way i wouldnt even know her and i havent set eyes on brent or erics dad for years at least ten maybe more so if there was a picture of either of them or all of them or someone else i wouldnt have known the difference charlie listened through a roar in her ears brent she said in a whisper he died the accident and then erics mother and his father what accident terry asked the shotgun hunting birds the desert eric tripped and brent was she couldnt finish because terrys face was telling her more than she wanted to know she felt her own face crumple oh god oh god terry said jeez jeez charlie awkwardly he patted her hand jeez i dont know what to say tell me what you know tell me why he lied tell me who she is tell me who he was i swear to god she smacked her hand on the table he was your best friend terry glanced over his shoulder to the counter where the starbucks clerk was beginning to show more interest in them than in the lattes she was making he turned back to charlie there was a blowup in his family this was years ago thats all i know he didnt talk about it and i didnt ask so why didnt he tell me that whyd he pretend i dont know maybe it sounded more glamorous or something to have shot your own brother i dont believe that the only reason a man would tell a woman that tale would be to keep her from wondering why he never mentioned a family why he never saw them or heard from them and why would he do that in the first place terry you know as well as i if he had another life that they knew about right thats not the case how do you know look do you know how much planning it would take to have a double life like the kind youre imagining jeez do you know how much plain old cash it would take he didnt have that kind of money charlie all he had was pipe dreams like the rest of us what sort of pipe dreams he talked through his hat you know how he was talked about what i need a cup of coffee terry got up and went to the counter where he placed an order dug out his wallet and waited biding his time charlie thought establishing his story for the first time since erics death she wondered if there was anyone whom she could trust and at this thought she sank back in her seat and felt ill to her soul he talked about barbados grenada the bahamas terry set a cappuccino on the table and tore the top off a packet of sugar he talked about putting his money there having a new life sleeping in a hammock on the beach drinking piña coladas dear god what was going on charlie cried dont you see nothing he was fortytwo thats what was going on he was talking thats all thats what guys do they talk about investments about offshore banking about fast cars and women with big boobs and yachts and racing in the americas cup about hiking in the himalayas and renting a palazzo in venice he was talking charlie thats what guys do when theyre fortytwo do you do that terry colored brightly its a guy thing do you do it not all guys are the same and as he read the despair on her face he hastened on with charlie it was nothing it was going to blow over he felt trapped and hed done something about it no way except something happened to prevent him from going through with what he intended to do and then he was really trapped and then no thats not it what is it then what was it he grasped his cappuccino but he didnt drink it i dont know he said i dont believe you im telling you the truth he gazed at her long hard and earnestly as if his look carried the power to convince and reassure her you need to come to the office he said weve got to go over his will and theres probate to be handled charlie i want to help you through this im devastated too he was my closest friend cant we be there for each other like eric was there for both of us what does that even mean terry he was gone and that was difficult enough for charlie to cope with the manner of his goingthe suddenness and the inexplicable horror of itmade the coping even more difficult but now to have to face the fact that the man shed loved and lost had not even been who shed thought he was it was too much to bear and far too much to assimilate she drove home feeling as if shed been struck by the plague a virulent interloper that was forcing her body to suffer what her mind could not begin to face somatizing somehow she remembered the term from psych all those years ago she couldnt bring herself to embrace the full truth but her body knew what that full truth was and it reacted accordingly she wasnt suffering from the flu at all she was somatizing and now her body was trying to purge her of erics lies because as she drove home she was overcome by a nausea so fierce that she didnt think she would make it into her house without vomiting she didnt once pulled into her driveway she shoved open the door of the car and stumbled out on the pristine front lawn she fell to her knees and spasm after spasm wracked her stomach forcing its meager contents upward and outward in a humiliating and malodorous plume she gagged on the taste and the smell of it and she vomited more until all that was left was the wretched heaving itself which she couldnt bring under control finally she fell onto her side panting sweat heavy on her neck and her eyelids she stared at the house and she felt the vomit slide across the sloping lawn and graze her cheek remember ill always love you she pulled herself up and staggered to the porch thankful that like so many upscale suburban neighborhoods in southern california her own was deserted at this time of day the twoincome families who were her neighbors wouldnt return to their homes before night so she hadnt been seen there was blessing in that she didnt notice anything wrong until she got to her front door there she had her key extended when she saw the deep gouges around what remained of the lock weakly she pushed the door open but she had the presence of mind not to enter from the porch she could see all she needed to see jesus h the policeman muttered fucking mess hed introduced himself to charlie as officer marco doyle and hed arrived within ten minutes of her phone call with his lights flashing and his siren blaring as if thats what she paid her taxes for his partner was a dog called simba a european import that looked like a cross between a german shepherd and the hound of the baskervilles shes on duty doyle had commented as he stepped inside the house dont pet her charlie hadnt considered doing so simba remained on the front porch on the alert as doyle went inside it was from the living room that hed made the comment which charlie clutching at her cell phone like a life preserver heard from just inside the entry doyle said simba come and the dog bounded into the house he directed her to sniff out intruders and while she did sowith doyle on her heels going from room to roomcharlie examined the destruction it was obvious that the intent had been search and not robbery because her possessions were thrown around in a way that suggested someone moving quickly knowing what he was looking for and tossing things over his shoulder to get them out of his way when he did not find what he wanted each room appeared identical in its pattern of chaos everything was moved away from the walls the contents of drawers and closets were dumped into the center pictures had been removed and books had been opened and flung to one side no one here doyle said whoever it was he moved fast therere too many scents for her to pick up anything useful though you have a party lately a party people were here after a funeral my husband charlie lowered herself to a chair her knees going and the rest of her following oh hey im sorry doyle said hell rotten luck anything missing can you tell i dont know i dont think so it seems like i dont know charlie felt so used up that all she could think about was crawling into her bed and sleeping for a year sleeping away the nightmare she thought doyle said that hed be radioing for the crime scene people theyd come and fingerprint and take what evidence they could find charlie would want to phone her insurance company in the meantime though and was there anyone who could help her clean up the mess when the crime scene people were finished yes charlie told him cooperatively she had a friend who would help need me to call her no no charlie said shed place the call no point in doing so till the crime scene people looked for evidence though doyle said this was sensible and he told her hed wait outside with the dog for the crime scene team to show up which they did in an hour pulling up in a white sedan with crime scene investigation printed in subtle gray on the doors while they went through the motions of looking for evidence in the debris that was charlies house charlie herself sat in the backyard staring numbly at the picturesque fountain that she and her husband had two years ago debated removing once the babies come it all seemed so much a part of another life now a life that not only bore no resemblance to her present one but also had been a fabrication wow this guys too good to be true her sister emily had murmured the first time shed met eric and that had apparently been the case when the crime scene people were done with their work they left charlie with the name and phone number of someone who specialized in fixing up after this kind of thing they said you can get her to help you clean up shes reasonable charlie didnt know if they meant her personality or her expense in either case it didnt matter she wanted no other professionals traipsing through the wreckage of her world so she forced herself to deal with the wreckage alone and she began where she knew without wanting to admit it to herself that the intruder had begun in erics study this was owing to sharon pasternak charlie thought as she stood in the doorway slumped against its jamb she would have to be every which way a complete fool not to put together this breakin with sharon pasternaks visit to find some papers failing to find whatever shed been looking for shed called in someone with a little more imagination in the searching arena and here before charlie was the result she stepped over a pile of file folders and went to erics desk she began with the easiest task putting the drawers back in and reassembling their contents and it was in the midst of doing this that she found an indication of whereif not whatthe papers were that sharon pasternak and the intruder who followed her had wanted for dumped alongside erics desk as if theyd been contained in one of its lower drawers was a set of documents that were out of place the deed to the house the pink slips to the cars insurance papers birth certificates and passports all of this belonged in their safedeposit box at the bank not here at home which made charlie wonder what if anything had replaced these documents in that protected vault she didnt go until the following day in the afternoon following a morning in which she lay in bed fighting against an inertia that threatened to keep her there permanently she fumbled her way to the bathroom shuffled through the debris and ran the water in the tub she soaked until the water was cool when she refilled the tub and languidly washed she tried to remember another time when everythingeven the slightest movementhad been such an effort she couldnt it was two oclock when she finally walked into the bank with her key to the safedeposit box in her hand she tapped the bell for assistance and a clerk came to help her a girl who couldnt have been much older than college age with jetblack hair jetblack eyeliner and a name tag identifying her as linda charlie filled out the appropriate card linda read her name and the number of her deposit box and then looked back up from the card to charlies face she said oh youre i mean youve never she stopped herself as if remembering her place its this way mrs lawton she settled on saying the deposit box was one of the large ones on the bottom row charlie inserted her key in its right lock as linda inserted her key in its left a twist and the box slid out of its compartment linda heaved it up and onto the counter she said is there anything else i can do for you mrs lawton and she watched charlie so intently when she asked the question that charlie wondered if the girl was part of erics secret life why do you ask charlie said what why do you ask if theres anything else you can do for me linda backed away as if suddenly aware that she was in the presence of a crazy woman we always ask that were supposed to ask would you like some coffee or tea charlie felt her anxiety dissipate she said no sorry i havent been well i didnt mean ill leave you then linda said and seemed glad to be doing so alone in the vault charlie took a deep breath it was an airless space overheated and silent she felt watched inside and she looked around for cameras but there was nothing she had all the privacy she needed it was time to know what sharon pasternak had wanted in erics study it was time to know why an intruder had broken into her house and torn it apart she eased the top of the deposit box open and she drew in a sharp breath when she saw its contents neatly stacked in rows and bound in their centers by rubber bands thick packets of onehundreddollar bills shot the odor of age use and malefaction into the air charlie whispered oh my god and slammed the lid of the deposit box home she leaned over the counter breathing like a runner and trying to account for what shed just seen the packets looked to be fifty bills thick there were what fifty seventy one hundred packets in the deposit box which meant what it was more money than shed ever seen outside of a motion picture god in heaven who was her husband what had he done a movement at the edge of her vision prompted charlie to turn her head in the crack that existed between the side of the vault and its door the girl linda was watching she moved away quicklybacktobusiness personifiedwhen she saw charlies gaze fall upon her charlie hustled out of the vault and called the girls name linda turned her expression striving for professional indifference she failed at this a deercaughtintheheadlights look in her eyes she said quietly yes mrs lawton is there something else charlie indicated with a motion of her head that she wanted linda to accompany her back into the vault the girl looked around as if for rescue but apparently found none a couple sat at a far desk opening an account with the accounts manager the tellers were occupied at their windows the branch managers office door was closed otherwise the bank was experiencing the typical midday languor that preceded the final rush of the afternoon ive got to linda twisted a ring on her hand it was a diamond engagement or something else charlie wondered i dont imagine youre supposed to spy on customers in the vault charlie said id hate to have to report you to the manager do you want to come back here with me or should i knock on his door linda swallowed she shoved a lock of hair behind her ear she followed charlie the deposit box sat on the counter where charlie had left it lindas glance went to it compulsively she gripped her hands in front of her and waited for whatever charlie would say you knew my husband you recognized his name you as much as said he was in here often i didnt mean you to think tell me what you know about this charlie opened the deposit box because you knew it was here you were watching me you were waiting to see what my reaction was going to be linda said in a rush i shouldnt have watched im sorry i dont want to lose my job its been hard ive got a little girl see erics child charlie braced herself shes only eighteen months old linda continued her dad wont give us anything and my dad wont let us move in with him ive been here a year and im doing pretty good and if i get fired how long had you and my husband how did you know each other know linda looked appalled as she made the connection hes nice is all he well he likes to flirt but thats it i didnt even know he was married till i saw your name on the card one time and really it was nothing hes just sort of cute and he comes and goes and i got curious about him is all so you watched him in the vault only once i swear it once the rest of the timewell when he first came in to make his depositsfor the checking account you knowhed just wait for me hed let other people go past him till i was available he saw the picture of brittany oncethats my little girlthat i keep at my windowright over thereand he asked me about her and thats how we got to know each other he said he had a little girl as well only she was older and they hadnt seen each other in years and he missed her and thats what we talked about he was divorced i knew that because he said my exwife and i thought at first well he made me feel special and i thought wouldnt it be neat if i met someone right here at the bank so i watched him and i was friendly and he didnt seem to mind hes dead dead oh my gosh im sorry i didnt know she gestured to the metal box i was curious about this is all really thats it how long has this been here charlie asked the money i mean i dont reallytwo weeks three linda said it was in between times when he usually came in with his paycheck what happened why did you watch him because he was he was all lit up that day he was high on drugs not like that just happy high flying he had this briefcase with him and he rang the bell just like you did and i went over and he signed the card he said im glad its you linda i wouldnt trust this day to anyone else this day see i didnt know what he meant which is why i watched him and what he did was put the briefcase on the counter he opened the deposit box and took out a slew of papers and he put them in the briefcase and put what was in the briefcase in the box and that was the money and thats what i saw i thought he was well it looked like hed sold drugs or something because why else would he be carrying around so much cash and i couldnt believe it because he seemed so straight and thats all i saw i didnt talk to him when he left and i didnt ever see him again eric selling drugs charlie snatched at the thought drugs yes that was the answer but not the type linda was thinking about the girl pictured eric dealing in those bricklike bags of cocaine one saw on tv or in movies she fancied him pushing marijuana to high school kids outside the local liquor store she thought he was supplying yuppies with heroin ecstasy or some other designer drug but she didnt imagine him stealing from biosynan efficacious immunosuppressant a cuttingedge form of chemotherapy with no side effects an aids vaccine ready to be marketed a viagra for womenwhat was it ericand selling it on the international black market to the highest bidder who would make a fortune manufacturing it terry stewarts words came back to charlie as she stood looking down at the closed deposit box in the airless confines of the banks secure vault pipe dreams charlie thats all they were except they hadnt been not for eric hed been fortytwo years old with the majority of his life behind him hed seen his chance and hed taken it one negotiation one sale and a vast accumulation of cash so many things were beginning to make sense now things hed said things hed done who he had become charlie locked the deposit box and returned it to its space in the vault she felt sick at heart but at least she was uncovering the truth about her husband the only question remaining for her was what had eric stolen from biosyn and the only possible answer seemed to be nothing at all hed taken moneyperhaps a down paymentfor something which he had promised to deliver hed failed to procure what he had sold and as a result hed died with him gone her house had been searched in an attempt to find the drug and that search presaged danger for her as long as the promised substance wasnt placed into the palm of whoever had paid for it charlie knew that she had to get her hands on that drug and hand it over if she wanted her own security to be inviolate that being impossible her only recourse was to track down the person who had paid in the first place and return the money sharon pasternak seemed the likeliest source of information shed been the first person to search erics study after all having made the unexpected discovery of money charlie knew shed be a fool to believe that sharon had come looking for anything unrelated to that money in the safedeposit box she left the bank and headed for the freeway biosyn was located on a stretch of highway called the ortega which snaked over the coastal mountains linking the dreary town of lake elsinore with the more upscale san juan capistrano it was a dusty road that attracted bikers by the thousands on sundays during the week it was a mostly treeless boulderstrewn thoroughfare traveled by men and women who worked in service jobs in the restaurants and highprice hotels on the coast the company itself was some twelve miles into the hills an unwelcoming low building the color of dirt that was separated from the rest of the environment by a high chainlink fence with coils of barbed wire springing from its top charlie had never been to biosyn and she would have missed the turnoff altogether had she not had to brake for a fedex truck that was making a left turn from biosyns concealed entrance into the highway it was an odd place altogether to find a pharmaceutical company charlie thought as she turned into the narrow drive it was an odd place to find any company most of the industry was miles away erupting from unsightly industrial parks and strung like bad teeth along the countys multitude of freeways there was a guard shack some fifty yards up the drive and iron gates closing off entry to anyone unexpected charlie braked there and gave sharon pasternaks name as well as her own she had an anxious minute while the guard phoned into the sprawling building on the hill ahead of her for all she knew sharon pasternak was a phony name which certainly seemed likely if the woman was in on erics deal but that wasnt the case the guard returned to charlies car with a pass saying shell meet you in the lobby park in visitors go straight in hear dont wander around why on earth would she want to wander around charlie wondered as she took the visitors pass the place was a wasteland of dust boulders cactus and chaparral not her idea of a spot for a saunter she pulled in front of the main entrance to the building and went inside it was frigidly cool and a shudder went through her she was momentarily lost blinded by the contrast between the bright light outside and the darkly painted walls someone said yes may i help you from a dim corner before charlies eyes could adjust another voice came from the other side of the room shes here to see me marion this is eric lawtons wife dr lawtons oh im awfully sorry about how dyou do i am sorry he was such a lovely man thanks marion mrs lawton charlie finally began to make out the shapes of things the whitehaired woman behind a mahogany reception desk and reflected in the mirror behind her sharon pasternak whod just come through a heavylooking metalplated door she was wearing a lab coat over black leggings nike running shoes and athletic socks sharon pasternak came to charlies side and put a hand on her arm have you actually found that paperwork we were missing she asked determinedly fixing her eyes on charlie youll be saving my life if you say yes she squeezed charlies arm and it felt like a warning so charlie nodded and forced a smile great sharon said what a relief come on back she doesnt have clearance dr pasternak marion protested its okay mar dont worry ill take her over to the coffee room dr cabot wont its cool sharon said well be less than five minutes time us ill be watching the clock marion warned sharon guided charlie across the lobby not to the heavy door through which she herself had emerged but rather to a less secure door that led to a cafeteriastyle room that was at this time of day deserted she made no preamble when they got inside she said tersely youve figured it out someone must have phoned your house did they leave a name a number i can call someone searched my house charlie said someone tore it apart after you were there what sharon glanced around hastily this is serious trouble we cant talk here then the walls have ears if youll give me the name ill contact them myself its what eric wouldve wanted i dont have any name charlie was feeling hot now and she was growing confused i thought you had it i assumed that because when you came to the house and then left with nothing and then the house was searched again what were you looking for whose name all i have is theshe couldnt bring herself to say it so horrible and low it seemed to her that her husbanda man she had adored and had thought she knew had actually stolen from his employer i want to return the money she said in a rush before she could think of an excuse not to speak sharon said what money ive got to return it because theyre not going to let up if i dont whoever they are theyve searched the house once and theyll be back no one puts out that kind of money without expecting what do you want to call it the goods but thats not how it works sharon said they never pay so if theres money somewhere who are they charlie heard her voice grow louder as her anxiety increased how do i contact them sharon said ssshhhh please look we cant talk here but you came to my house you searched you were looking for their names dont you see i didnt know who eric was talking to he just said that it was cbs but cbs where la new york was it sixty minutes or just the local news charlie stared at her sixty minutes keep your voice down good grief im on the line here about six steps away from losing my job or going to jail or who the hell knows what else and then what good will i be to anyone she looked to the doorway as if expecting a camera crew to come barreling through look youve got to leave not till you tell me ill meet you in an hour in san juan los rios district dyou know it behind the amtrak station theres a tea place there i dont know the name but youll see it when you cross the tracks turn to the right its on the left okay an hour i cant talk here she shoved charlie toward the door of the coffee room and quickly walked her back to reception in the lobby she said heartily youve saved me about ten days of work i cant thank you enough and she strongarmed her right out into the sunlight where she said an hour in a low voice before disappearing back into the building where the door clicked shut behind her charlie stared at the darkened glass feeling her body like an unwieldy weight that she was supposed to propel to her car in some way she tried to assimilate what sharon had saidcbs minutes the local newsand she set the information next to what had happened and what she already knew but none of it made sense she felt like a passenger on the wrong airplane without a passport to show at her destination she stumbled to her car the shivers came upon her there so badly that she couldnt for a moment get the key into the ignition but she finally managed to steady one hand with the other and in this manner she started the engine back down the drive and onto the highway she wove her way in the direction of the coast as she drove she thought about all the things shed heard about this stretch of road in the years shed been in southern california how it was the ideal place for dumping bodies frequented by such notable serial killers as randy kraft how contract killings took place in its pullouts and abandoned vehicles were set fire to in the gullies that bordered its sides how drunks ran off the road and died at cliff bottoms their bodies not to be recovered for months how big rigs crossed the double yellow line and smashed headon to obliterate anything in their paths what did it mean that biosyn inc was located here of all places and what did it mean that eric lawton was talking to someone from cbs charlie had no answers only more questions and the only option available to her was to find the tea house in the los rios district of san juan capistrano and hope that sharon pasternak was as good as her word she was seventyone minutes after charlie left biosyn erics colleague walked into the tea house a building from the early s once the home of a founding family of the town it was a good place for an assignation the least likely spot any individual would choose with surreptitious activity on her mind coyly decorated with lace teapots antiques hat stands and chapeaux for the sartorial entertainment of its customers it offered at exorbitant prices an american version of english afternoon tea sharon pasternak looked over her shoulder as she came into the building where charlie was seated at a table for two just inside the door there was another table occupied in the room a round one at which five women in hats borrowed from the establishment were having a merry birthday tea looking in their anachronistic chapeaux as if alice and the march hare were about to join them we need a different table sharon told charlie without preamble come on she led the way to a second room and from there to a third at the back of the house this was furnished with five small tables but they were all empty and sharon strode to the one that was farthest from the door you cant come to biosyn again she told charlie in a low voice especially if you come asking for me its risky and obvious if youd come to talk to the human resources peopleabout erics retirement package or insurance or somethingyou might have gotten away with it you and i running into each other in the hall or something but this no way marions going to remember and shes going to tell cabot shes worked for him for thirtyfive years since he was just out of grad school if you can believe itand shes more loyal to him than she is to her husband she calls him david all stars in her eyes by now he knows youve put in an appearance and asked for me you said cbs charlie began you said sixty minutes he came to me about exantrum his lab was working on something different but he knew about exantrum everyone in division ii knew everyone knows even if they pretend they dont his lab whose lab erics whatre you talking about what dyou mean why would eric have had a lab he was director of sales he had meetings and business trips all over the country and why would he have a lab he isnt he wasnt sales sharon asked thats what he told you you never knew what hes a molecular biologist a molecularno he was director of sales he told me but what had he told her and what from his behavior and allusions had she merely assumed hes a biologist mrs lawton i mean he was i ought to know since i worked with him and he listen i have to ask this im sorry but i dont know how else to make sure did he die the way they said he died he wasnt i wouldnt put it past cabot to have him snuffed out hes a secrecy freak and even if he werent this stuffs so nasty that if cabot knew eric was taking it to cbs believe me hed do something to stop him to stop him from what contributing to the exposé eric was blowing the whistle on biosyn he was scared shitless to do itwe both were scared shitlessbut hed made up his mind i smuggled out a sample of exantrum one nightand i cant even tell you how freaked out i was to get close to the stuff without a safety suit onand i gave it to eric he was set to meet with the journalists to hand it over so they could get it tested for themselves in atlanta and then this was three weeks ago i guess he mightve met with them but he didnt say and then he was dead there hasnt been even a sign at biosyn that anythings the least bit wrong so i started to think eric never made contact and i wanted to get the name of the journalist myself to find out thats what i was looking for at your house the name of the journalist either that or the exantrum because if he didnt make contact ive got to get that stuff back into a controlled environment fast charlie stared at the woman she couldnt digest the information she was being given quickly enough to make a coherent reply i can see he didnt tell you any of this he mustve wanted to protect you i admire that it was decent of him typical too he was a great guy but i wish hed confided in you because then at least wed know what we were dealing with here we could set our minds at rest as it is either that stuffs out there waiting to wreak havoc on the state of california or its safe at the centers for disease control but in either case i need to know the centers for disease control what is it charlie asked and the words sounded hollow to her ears and dry in her throat i thought biosyn made pharmaceuticals cancer drugs medication for asthma and arthritis maybe sleeping pills and antidepressants sure thats part of it thats division i but division ii is where the real money is where eric and i worked where exantrum is what is it charlie repeated dread rising up in her throat like bile sharon looked around she said we need to order something if we dont and if someone sees us here its going to look suspicious weve got to get a waitresss attention they managed to do so each of them asking for scones and tea which both of them knew they would not touch when their order came sharon poured from the pot and said exantrum is cabots key to immortality its a virus it was discovered in standing water in a cave this was about two years ago a hiker went inside a cave in the blue ridge mountains a hot day he finds a pool of water he splashes himself on the face with it hes dead in twentyone days hemorrhagic fever the doctors in north carolina dont know where the virus came from but it looks enough like ebola to make people freak atlanta gets onto it and everyone starts tracing where this guy has been who hes seen what hes been up to theyre looking at his associates through a microscope theyre looking at his passport to see if hes been out of the country theyre looking at his family to see which of them mightve passed something on from someone else they cant figure it out cabot follows all this but does his own detective work because he thinks this is something different from ebola and what hes wanted from the day he graduated from ucla is to have a name that gets associated with something that changes the world like jonas salk or louis pasteur or alexander fleming hes probably thinking cure at first but the government comes calling once cabot has the stuff isolated and it gets twisted into disease uncle samll pay big bucks for a weapon like exantrum you put it into water you drink it you splash it onto your face and it gets into your eyes you let it touch a hangnail you get it in your nose you have a scratch on your body you step in it you breathe it take your choice it doesnt matter how you come into contact with it because the ends the same you die its for biological warfare for use against the iraqis if they get out of line or the chinese if they start shaking their sabers or the north koreans cabot stands to make a fortune from it and eric was going to let the world know sharon looked at her teacup and turned it in its saucer she finished with he was a really good man a decent good man i only wish id had his courage but the truth of the matter is i dont so i need to get the exantrum back to the lab if eric hadnt made contact with the journalist yet hehe wouldnt have kept it at our house though charlie said because she wanted desperately to believe it not if its as dangerous as you say it is he wouldnt have kept it at home would he hell no thats why when i showed up i was looking for the journalists name not the virus he wouldve put the virus somewhere safe till he had a meeting time and a place to hand it over and if he did put it somewhere safe i need to know where it is or i need to confirm that its in atlanta which i can only do by talking to the journalist that eric was talking to charlie heard the words but she was thinking of other things what terry had said about midlife crisis and what linda had told her about erics last visit to the bank she was thinking of all that money in the vault the search of her house and the expression on her husbands face when she had penitently related her suspicions about the love affair which hed never had especially this last charlie considered and the horrible possibilities it presented how did you smuggle exantrum out of biosyn she asked sharon pasternak steeling herself to hear the answer i put the safe suit on and transferred it into a cough syrup bottle sharon told her it was risky as hell but believe me if id been caught leaving with anything besides that bottle it wouldve been the end of me yes charlie said i do see that and more in fact what she saw with absolute clarity at last was the end of charlie lawton she went to the mission she said to sharon ill go to the bank and check our safedeposit box eric may have put the bottle in there sharon was grateful she said that would be a godsend but if it is there for gods sake dont open it whatever you do try not to touch it even just call me here let me give you my home number and leave a message okay say youre from savon just in case cabots bugged my phone say your medications arrived and ill know what you mean and ill come to your house okay got it yes charlie said faintly savon ive got it good and so they parted sharon zooming off in the direction of dana point and charlie walking not to her car in the city parking structure but rather around the block and down the street to mission san juan capistrano she made her way along the uneven path within the mission walls between the misshapen cacti and the thirsty poppies she wandered mostly not caring about her destination because her destination didnt matter any longer she ended up in the narrow chapel built three centuries earlier by the hands of the california indians and under the direction of that singleminded taskmaster junípero serra the light inside was muted or perhaps she thought it was her vision which might be going to fail her along with the rest of her body now perhaps that was another effect of exposure to exantrumloss of visionor perhaps she had been suffering from that loss from the moment shed begun to believe that her husband was having an affair how clear it all was now how neatly terry stewarts description of male midlife crisis fit in with what eric lawton had done how obvious were the reasons why eric manufactured not only his present but his past how easy it was to understand why hed become estranged from his first wife from his daughter and from the rest of a family who no doubt knew exactly what he did for a living better to pretend one had no family better to act the part of injured party better to anything than to live openly as a scientist who made his salary developing weapons of death and not weapons for war to be used by the military on opposing troops but weapons to decimate innocent civilians or in the hands of someone elsea terrorist for instanceto bring an entire population to its knees charlie knew two things at the end of her conversation with sharon pasternak she knew that ericwho had talked about not living in this area much longer who had talked about fast cars and offshore banking and racing in the americas cuphad not made contact with any journalist and had never intended to do so he had done what shed first thought hed done he had sold a substance from biosyn it just hadnt been the cure for aids or cancer or anything else that shed assumed when shed seen the money whether that made him a bad man a misguided man a greedy man or the devil himself was of no consequence to charlie because eric lawton was also a dead man and she finally knew the reason for that as well she worked her way into one of the hardbacked pews she sat there was a kneeler that she could have used to pray from but she was beyond casting petitions heavenward there was no helpdivine or otherwisefor what ailed her this was something eric had known the moment she confessed to him the depth to which her suspicions about him had taken her and shed had to confesshad felt the need to confessonce hed come home triumphant from the biggest sale in my whole career char waitll you hear about the bonus how does a cruise sound to you for a celebration or even a complete lifestyle change we can have that now we can have it all hell im sorry ive been so out of it lately shed known then that her fears had been groundless that there was no other woman in his life and knowing this and seeking absolution for her sin of doubting him shed told him the truth char god we went through this once already didnt we im not having an affair hed said it all with an earnestness that combined with the joy with which hed told her about his impending good fortune had made it impossible to disbelieve him youre the only one youve always been the only one how could you think anything else i know ive been preoccupied and in and out at weird hours and taking phone calls and disappearing but that all was because of this deal and you cant ever think hell never char youre the reason ive been doing all this so that we can have a better life for us for our kids something more than suburbia you deserve it i deserve it and now that this deal ive been concentrating on at work has gone through i havent wanted to talk about it because i didnt want to jinx it i never thought itd get you all upset come here char hell god im sorry babe and shed known from the sound of his voice that he meant it and from the sound of his voice and the look in his eyes shed drawn the comfort that told her her fears were groundless so shed given herself up to his love that evening and later at dawn shed confessed the rest of her sins she owed him that confession she thought only by telling him how low she had sunk would she be able to forgive herself i finally stopped it all when i spilled medicine all over the floor in your bathroom she laughed at herself and at all of her fears groundless now it was like i regained consciousness all of a sudden standing in a pool of robitussin he smiled and kissed the tips of her fingers robitussin char what were you up to insanity she said i was so sure i thought theres got to be evidence somewhere of something so i was searching through everything even your medicine cabinet i broke that bottle of cough syrup on your bathroom floor im sorry he continued to smile but in charlies minds eyenow in the chapel in san juan capistranoshe could see how fixed that smile had become she could see how hed attempted to clarify what she was telling him there wasnt cough syrup in my bathroom char you mustve been in youve probably forgotten it the label was old its actually just as well it got thrown out dont they say medicine over six months old isnt right to take had his lips looked stiff had that smile stayed fixed he said yeah i think they do say that sorry i broke it though had he averted his eyes then howd you clean it up on my hands and knees doing penance had he laughed weakly or otherwise well i hope you wore rubber gloves at least nope i didnt want anything to get in the way of me and my sin why was it not really cough syrup have you been disguising poison in a medicine bottle just in case you decide to off your wife and shed tickled him to force him to answer and theyd laughed and begun to make love again he hadnt been able to getting old he said everything goes to hell after forty sorry and it had got worse from there hed been gone more hed become preoccupied once againmore than ever this timehed closeted himself away and spent hours on the phone hed invested days it seemed on the internet doing research hed told her when she asked him finally when the phone had rung one evening shed overheard him say look i cant make it tonight all right my wifes not well and shed suffered a rebirth of all her suspicions it was two days later that hed come home from work and found her under a blanket on the sofa dozing off a combination of headache and muscle pain that shed assumed shed brought on herself with a lengthy hike on the slopes of saddleback mountain shed been asleep and hadnt awakened upon his entry only when he dropped to his knees beside the couch did she stir with a start what is it hed asked her was it fear in his voice and not concern as shed thought at the time char whats wrong achy all over she replied too much exercise today got a headache too im going to make you some soup he told her hed gone into the kitchen and banged about ten minutes later he brought a tray into the living room where she lay sweet she murmured but i can get up i can eat with you im not eating he said not right now you stay put and hed lovingly and gently fed tomato soup to her a slow and patient spoonful at a time hed even wiped her mouth with a paper napkin and when shed laughed a little and said really eric im all right he hadnt made a reply because hed known charlie thought the process had begun first the sudden onset marked by headache and muscle pain a slight fever to accompany them chills and an inability to eat hard upon the heels of the fever and after that what shed marked as mourning first and denial second both of them made manifest in her body sore throat dizziness nausea and vomiting but she hadnt been reacting to her husbands death shed been reacting to what hed done in his life or what hed tried to do and what he would have done had she not broken the bottle in which the virus was sealed before he had the chance to give it to its purchaser how torn he must have been she realized there he was caught in the middle of something gone terribly wrong the bestlaid plans come to nothing with nothing to give in exchange for the down payment hed received for the exantrum with a wife fatally exposed to the virus he himself had stolen and knowing that that wife was going to die as surely as he must have known thousandsmillionsof others would have died had fate in the person of charlies jealousy not stepped in to prevent that from occurring hed fed her the soup and studied her face as if such a study would allow him to take the image of her into the grave and beyond when she was finished eating when she could swallow no more he put the spoon in the bowl and the bowl on the tray hed leaned forward and kissed charlie on the forehead hed adjusted the covers up to her chin remember ill always love you hed said whyre you telling me that like that just remember hed taken the tray from the room she heard the sound of it being set on the counter in the kitchen a moment later he returned and sat opposite her in an easy chair with a pillow behind his head do you remember he asked what what i said remember ill always love you char before she could respond he took the revolver from within his jacket he put the barrel in his mouth and he blew off the back of his head so this charlie thought was what it felt like to know you were going to die this sense of drifting no panic as shed once thought she might panic if handed a death sentence like pancreatic cancer but instead a numbness and a going through the motions getting up from the pew in the mission chapel approaching the altar pausing at a statue of a yellowandgreenrobed saint to light a candle then standing deep in the sanctuary and knowing there was nothing to ask god for or about any longer what had eric thought she wondered there he was at fortytwo had he thought this is it this is all there is to my life unless i take this one chance to change it all to have more to be more to ride the wave of opportunity that i see rising in front of me and to discover upon what shore that wave will deposit me if i only take a risk thats all one little risk and really not much of a risk at all if i play it right and figure the angles involve sharon pasternak in scoring the virus so if anyones caught smuggling it out of biosyn itll be sharon and not me play the part of whistleblower so sharon will think ive got a selfless goal in mind make contact with an interested party but make sure i set the whole deal up so that theres a down payment first some lag time second to make my plans to escape should my contact try to eliminate me and then a second meeting to hand over the exantrum followed by a hasty exit and a flight towhere tahiti belize south of france greece it didnt matter what mattered was that the rest of my life would have new meaning to eric more meaning than a harleydavidson motorcycle and a tattoo on his arm had been able to give him eric eric charlie whispered where when and why had he gone so wrong she didnt know she didnt know him she wasnt sure if she even knew herself she left the chapel and made her way back to her car in the city parking structure next to the train station she climbed inside feeling weary now feeling as if the virus inside her were a presence she could actually sense in her veins and it was there she knew that without checking into a hospital or traveling out to biosyn to offer herself to dr cabot as proof that his weapon of war was as efficacious as he had hoped eric had known she was going to die hed known how the virus would work hed known there was no cure for what was going to attack her so hed taken himself away from having to face what evil hed brought down upon them both whats to do she asked herself but she knew the answer write it all out clearly so that no one would take any risks with her body afterwards and then do as eric had done but for an entirely different set of reasons it wasnt the noble solution although it might be seen as such it was the only solution she still had the gun it would create a mess and a mess was dangerous to other people but the note she would writeand would post on the doorway so no one could miss it before they entered the roomwould explain the situation odd she thought she wasnt angry she wasnt afraid she wasnt anything perhaps that was good on the freeway she drove with more care than usual every car that hurtled by her was an obstacle that she had to avoid at any cost it was growing dark and she was having trouble seeing through the glare of oncoming headlights but she made it home without incident and she parked in the driveway and felt a heaviness come over her knowing what deed faced her when she got inside more than anything she just wanted to sleep but there wasnt time for that if she wasted eight hours that would be a third of a day which the virus would have to work in her body who knew what condition she would be in tomorrow if she gave in to exhaustion today she got out of the car she stumbled up the walk the porch light wasnt on so she didnt see the form emerge from the shadows till she was upon it and then she saw a faint glimmer of the streetlight shining on something metallic that he held a gun a knife she couldnt tell he said mrs lawton you have something that belongs to me i think and his accent was as dusky as his complexion and his tone was as black as his hooded eyes she had no fear of him what was there to fear he could do no more to her than exantrum was already doing she said yes i have it but not in the form you were hoping for come inside mr names do not matter i want what im owed yes i know you do so come inside mr names do not matter im only too happy to give it to you shed have to write the letter first she thought but something told her mr names do not matter was desperate enough to be willing to give her the time that writing the letter required introduction to i richard i first developed an affinity for richard iii englands most controversial king when i was a college student taking my first shakespeare course in it we read richard iiiinterestingly titled the tragedy of king richard iiiand through this process i came into contact with a fascinating group of historical figures who have never been far from my imagination since those autumn mornings in when we as a class discussed them i watched my first production of the play at the los gatos shakespeare festival a short time thereafter but it wasnt until i read josephine teys famous novel the daughter of time that i began to see king richard in a light other than that in which shakespeares famous play bathed him after that i became more intrigued with this much maligned king and more reading followed richard iii the road to bosworth field the year of three kings the mystery of the princes richard iii englands black legend the deceivers and royal blood became apermanent part of my library and when i created the continuing characters for my crime novels i decided to make one of them a ricardian apologist the better to have opportunities to take potshots at the man i eventually came to believe was the real black heart at the heart of what happened in henry tudor earl of richmond later henry vii all along i wanted to write my own story of what might have happened to the princes in the tower a story that would exonerate richard and put blame where it rightfully belonged but the problem was that everyone i read had a different take on who the real culprit was some thought it likely that henry tudor had had the boys put to death after ascending the throne himself others thought the duke of buckingham was responsible seeking to grease his own way to accession still others saw the involvement of the stanleys of the bishop of ely of margaret beaufort some claimed the disappearance and death of the boys a conspiracy others declared it the work of a single hand and some remained convinced that the deed was perpetrated by the man upon whom blame had been cast for five hundred years that bunchbacked toad himself richard duke of gloucester later richard iii i knew that i wanted neither to write a historical novel nor to change my career and become a medieval historian but i did want to write a story about people who were like me interested in that period of time and i wanted to call it i richard taking my title from the manner in which documents began that were written by the reigning monarchs of the time the challenge for me was to write a story in the present time that dealt with another story five hundred years old i didnt want to approach it as tey had done using a character in a hospitalbed who is distracted from his condition through the means of being given a mystery to solve at the same time i did want to create a story in which something existedsomething fictional of coursethat proved irrefutably that richard was guiltless of the death of his nephews my first task was to decide what that something was my second task was to decide what kind of modernday story could embrace that something i approached the plot the way i approach every plot i decided to go to the location in which id decided to set my tale so in a frigid february i trekked up to market bosworth in the company of a girlfriend from sweden together we walked the perimeter of the battle site bosworth field where richard iii died as a result of treachery betrayal and greed bosworth field is much the same as it was over five hundred years ago when the armies met in august it hasnt been plowed over for housing estates and walmart hasnt managed to put an unsightly megastore anywhere near it thus it remains a forsaken windswept place marked only by flagpoles that show visitors where the various armies were encamped and by plaques that explain along an established route exactly what happened at each spot it was when i reached a plaque that directed my gaze toward the distant village of sutton cheney where king richard prayed in st james church on the night before the battle that i saw my story take shape and what happened to me as i stood before that plaque was something that had never happened before nor has it happened since it was this i read the words that told me to look for the windmill some mile or so in the distance and to recognize this structure asmarking the village of sutton cheney where king richard had prayed the night before battle and as i lifted my eyes and found that windmill the entire short story that you will read here dropped into my mind all of a piece as simple as that all i had to do was recite the facts of the story into my handheld tape recorder as the wind buffeted me and the temperature challenged me to stay out of doors long enough to do so i came home to california and created the characters who would people the small world of i richard once i did that the story virtually wrote itself the guilt or innocence of the parties in history is lost to all of us pending the discovery of a document whose veracity cannot be disputed indeed i wasnt interested in trying to prove anyone did anything what i was interested in writing about was one mans obsession with a longdead king and the extremes he was willing to go to in order to advance himself under the banner of that defeated white boar i richard malcolm cousins groaned in spite of himself considering his circumstances this was the last sound he wanted to make a sigh of pleasure or a moan of satisfaction would have been more appropriate but the truth was simple and he had to face it no longer was he the performance artist he once had been in the sexual arena time was when he could bonk with the best of them but that time had gone the way of his hair and at fortynine years old he considered himself lucky to be able to get the appliance up and running twice a week he rolled off betsy perryman and thudded onto his back his lower vertebrae were throbbing like drummers in a marching band and the alwaysdubious pleasure hed just taken from betsys corpulent perfumedrenched charms was quickly transformed to a faint memory jesus god he thought with a gasp forget justification altogether was the end even worth the bloody means luckily betsy took the groan and the gasp the way betsy took most everything she heaved herself onto her side propped her head upon her palm and observed him with an expression that was meant to be coy the last thing betsy wanted him to know was how desperate she was for him to be her lifeboat out of her current marriagenumber four this one wasand malcolm was only too happy to accommodate her in the fantasy sometimes it got a bit complicated remembering what he was supposed to know and what he was supposed to be ignorant of but he always found that if betsys suspicions about his sincerity became aroused there was a simple and expedient albeit backtroubling way to assuage her doubts about him she reached for the tangled sheet pulled it up and extended a plump hand she caressed his hairless pate and smiled at him lazily never did it with a baldy before have i told you that malc every single time the two of themas she so poetically stateddid it he recalled he thought of cora the springer spaniel bitch hed adored in childhood and the memory of the dog brought suitable fondness to his face he eased betsys fingers down his cheek and kissed each one of them cant get enough naughty boy she said ive never had a man like you malc cousins she scooted over to his side of the bed closer and closer until her huge bosoms were less than an inch from his face at this proximity her cleavage resembled cheddar gorge and was just about as appealing a sexual object god another goround he thought hed be dead before he was fifty if they went on like this and not a step nearer to his objective he nuzzled within the suffocating depths of her mammaries making the kinds of yearning noises that she wanted to hear he did a bit of sucking and then made much of catching sight of his wristwatch on the bedside table christ he grabbed the watch for a feigned better look jesus betsy its eleven oclock i told those aussie ricardians id meet them at bosworth field at noon ive got to get rolling which was what he did right out of bed before she could protest as he shrugged into his dressing gown she struggled to transform his announcement into something comprehensible her face screwed up and she said those ozzirecordians what the hells that she sat up her blonde hair matted and snarled and most of her makeup smeared from her face not ozzirecordians malcolm said aussie australian australian ricardians i told you about them last week betsy oh that she pouted i thought we could have a picnic lunch today in this weather he headed for the bathroom it wouldnt do to arrive for the tour reeking of sex and shalimar where did you fancy having a picnic in january cant you hear that wind it must be ten below outside a bed picnic she said with honey and cream you said that was your fantasy or dont you remember he paused in the bedroom doorway he didnt much like the tone of her question it made a demand that reminded him of everything he hated about women of course he didnt remember what hed claimed to be his fantasy about honey and cream hed said lots of things over the past two years of their liaison but hed forgotten most of them once it had become apparent that she was seeing him as he wished to be seen still the only course was to play along honey and cream he sighed you brought honey and cream oh christ betsa quick dash back to the bed a tonguely examination of her dental work a frantic clutching between her legs god youre going to drive me mad woman ill be walking round bosworth with my prong like a poker all day serves you right she said pertly and reached for his groin he caught her hand in his you love it he said no moren you he sucked her fingers again later he said ill trot those wretched aussies round the battlefield and if youre still here then you know what happens next itll be too late then bernie thinks ive only gone to the butcher malcolm favoured her with a pained look the better to show that the thought of her hapless and ignorant husbandhis old best friend berniescored his soul then therell be another time therell be hundreds of times with honey and cream with caviar with oysters did i ever tell you what ill do with the oysters what she asked he smiled just you wait he retreated to the bathroom where he turned on the shower as usual an inadequate spray of lukewarm water fizzled out of the pipe malcolm shed his dressing gown shivered and cursed his circumstances twentyfive years in the classroom teaching history to spottyfaced hooligans who had no interest in anything beyond the immediate gratification of their sweatypalmed needs and what did he have to show for it two up and two down in an ancient terraced house down the street from gloucester grammar an ageing vauxhall with no spare tyre a mistress with an agenda for marriage and a taste for kinky sex and a passion for a longdead king thathe was determined would be the wellspring from which would flow his future the means were so close just tantalising centimetres from his eager grasp and once his reputation was secured the book contracts the speaking engagements and the offers of gainful employment would follow shit he bellowed as the shower water went from warm to scalding without a warning damn he fumbled for the taps serves you right betsy said from the doorway youre a naughty boy and naughty boys need punishing he blinked water from his eyes and squinted at her shed put on his best flannel shirtthe very one hed intended to wear on the tour of bosworth field blast the womanand she lounged against the doorjamb in her best attempt at a seductive pose he ignored her and went about his showering he could tell she was determined to have her way and her way was another bonk before he left forget it bets he said to her silently dont push your luck i dont understand you malc cousins she said youre the only man in civilisation whod rather tramp round a soggy pasture with a bunch of tourists than cozy up in bed with the woman he says he loves not says does malcolm said automatically there was a dreary sameness to their postcoital conversations that was beginning to get him decidedly down that so i wouldntve known idve said you fancy whatsisname the king a far sight moren you fancy me well richard was definitely more interesting a character malcolm thought but he said dont be daft its money for our nest egg anyway we dont need a nest egg she said ive told you that about a hundred times weve got the besides he cut in hastily there couldnt be too little said between them on the subject of betsys expectations its good experience once the book is finished therell be interviews personal appearances lectures i need the practice i needthis with a winning smile in her directionmore than an audience of one my darling just think what itll be like bets cambridge oxford harvard the sorbonne will you like massachusetts what about france bernies hearts giving him trouble again malc betsy said running her finger up the doorjamb is it now malcolm said happily poor old bernie poor bloke bets the problem of bernie had to be handled of course but malcolm was confident that betsy perryman was up for the challenge in the afterglow of sex and inexpensive champagne shed told him once that each one of her four marriages had been a step forward and upward from the marriage that had preceded it and it didnt take a hell of a lot of brains to know that moving out of a marriage to a dedicated inebriateno matter how affableinto a relationship with a schoolteacher on his way to unveiling a piece of mediaeval history that would set the country on its ear was a step in the right direction so betsy would definitely handle bernie it was only a matter of time divorce was out of the question of course malcolm had made certain that betsy understood that while he was desperate mad hungry and all the etceteras for a life with her he would no more ask her to come to him in his current impoverished circumstances than would he expect the princess royal to take up life in a bedsit on the south bank of the thames not only would he not ask that of her he wouldnt allow it betsyhis beloveddeserved so much more than he would be able to give her such as he was but when his ship came in darling bets or if god forbid anything should ever happen to bernie this he hoped was enough to light a fire inside the spongy grey mass that went for her brain malcolm felt no guilt at the thought of bernie perrymans demise true theyd known each other in childhood as sons of mothers whod been girlhood friends but theyd parted ways at the end of adolescence when poor bernies failure to pass more than one alevel had doomed him to life on the family farm while malcolm had gone on to university and after that well differing levels of education did take a toll on ones ability to communicate with ones erstwhileand less educatedmates didnt it besides when malcolm returned from university he could see that his old friend had sold his soul to the black bush devil and what would it profit him to renew a friendship with the districts most prominent drunk still malcolm liked to think hed taken a modicum of pity on bernie perryman once a month for years hed gone to the farmhouseunder cover of darkness of courseto play chess with his former friend and to listen to his inebriated musings about their childhood and the whatmighthavebeens which was how he first found out about the legacy as bernie had called it which was what hed spent the last two years bonking bernies wife in order to get his hands on betsy and bernie had no children bernie was the last of his line the legacy was going to come to betsy and betsy was going to give it to malcolm she didnt know that yet but she would soon enough malcolm smiled thinking of what bernies legacy would do to further his career for nearly ten years hed been writing furiously on what hed nicknamed dickon deliveredhis untarnishing of the reputation of richard iiiand once the legacy was in his hands his future was going to be assured as he rolled towards bosworth field and the australian ricardians awaiting him there he recited the first line of the penultimate chapter of his magnum opus it is with the alleged disappearance of edward the lord bastard earl of pembroke and march and richard duke of york that historians have traditionally begun to rely upon sources contaminated by their own selfinterest god it was beautiful writing he thought and better than that it was the truth as well the tour coach was already there when malcolm roared into the car park at bosworth field its occupants had foolishly disembarked all apparently female and of depressingly advanced years they were huddled into a shivering pack looking sheeplike and abandoned in the galeforce winds that were blowing when malcolm heaved himself out of his car one of their number disengaged herself from their midst and strode towards him she was sturdily built and much younger than the rest which gave malcolm hope of being able to grease his way through the moment with some generous dollops of charm but then he noted her short clipped hair elephantine ankles and massive calves not to mention the clipboard that she was smacking into her hand as she walked an unhappy lesbian tour guide out for blood he thought god what a deadly combination nonetheless he beamed a glittering smile in her direction sorry he sang out blasted car trouble see here mate she said in the unmistakable discordant twangall long as becoming long isof a denizen of the antipodes when romance of great britain pays for a tour at noon romance of great britain expects the bleeding tour to begin at noon so whyre you late christ its like siberia out here we could die of exposure jaysus lets just get on with it she turned on her heel and waved her charges over towards the edge of the car park where the footpath carved a trail round the circumference of the battlefield malcolm dashed to catch up his tips hanging in the balance he would have to make up for his tardiness with a dazzling show of expertise yes yes he said with insincere joviality as he reached her side its incredible that you should mention siberia miss sludgecur she said and her expression dared him to react to the name ah yes miss sludgecur of course as i was saying its incredible that you should mention siberia because this bit of england has the highest elevation west of the urals which is why we have these rather muscovian temperatures you can imagine what it might have been like in the fifteenth century when were not here for meteorology she barked get on with it before my ladies freeze their arses off her ladies tittered and clung to one another in the wind they had the driedapple faces of octogenarians and they watched sludgecur with the devotion of children whod seen their parent take on all comers and deck them unceremoniously yes well malcolm said the weathers the principal reason that the battlefields closed in the winter we made an exception for your group because theyre fellow ricardians and when fellow ricardians come calling at bosworth we like to accommodate them its the best way to see that the truth gets carried forward as im sure youll agree what the bloody hell are you yammering about sludgecur asked fellow who fellow what which should have told malcolm that the tour wasnt going to proceed as smoothly as he had hoped ricardians he said and beamed at the elderly women surrounding sludgecur believers in the innocence of richard iii sludgecur looked at him as if hed sprouted wings what this is the romance of great britain youre looking at mate jane bloody eyre mr flaming rochester heathcliff and cathy maxim de winter gabriel oak this is love on the battlefield day and we mean to have our moneys worth all right their money was what it was all about the fact that they were paying was why malcolm was here in the first place but jesus he thought did these seekers of romance even know where they were did they knowmuch less carethat the last king to be killed in armed combat met his fate less than a mile from where they were standing and that hed met that same fate because of sedition treachery and betrayal obviously not they werent here in support of richard they were here because it was part of a package love brooding love hopeless and love devoted had already been checked off the list and now he was somehow supposed to cook up for them a version of love deadly that would make them part with a few quid apiece at the end of the afternoon well all right he could do that much malcolm didnt think about betsy until hed paused at the first marker along the route which showed king richards initial battle position while his charges took snapshots of the white boar standard that was whipping in the icy wind from the flagpole marking the kings encampment malcolm glanced beyond them to the tumbledown buildings of windsong farm visible at the top of the next hill he could see the house and he could see betsys car in the farmyard he could imagineand hope about the rest bernie wouldnt have noticed that it had taken his wife three and a half hours to purchase a package of minced beef in market bosworth it was nearly half past noon after all and doubtless hed be at the kitchen table where he usually was attempting to work on yet another of his formula one models the pieces would be spread out in front of him and he might have managed to glue one onto the car before the shakes came upon him and he had to have a dose of black bush to still them one dose of whiskey would have led to another until he was too soused to handle a tube of glue chances were good that hed already passed out onto the model car it was saturday and he was supposed to work at st james church preparing it for sundays service but poor old bernied have no idea of the day until betsy returned slammed the minced beef onto the table next to his ear and frightened him out of his sodden slumber when his head flew up betsy would see the imprint of the cars name on his flesh and shed be suitably disgusted malcolm fresh in her mind shed feel the injustice of her position you been to the church yet shed ask bernie it was his only job as no perryman had farmed the familys land in at least eight generations father naughtons not like the others bernie hes not about to put up with you just because youre a perryman you know you got the church and the graveyard to see to today and its time you were about it bernie had never been a belligerent drunk and he wouldnt be one now hed say im going sweet mama but i got the most godawful thirst throat feels like a sandpit mama girl hed smile the same affable smile that had won betsys heart in blackpool where theyd met and the smile would remind his wife of her duty despite malcolms ministrations to her earlier but that was fine because the last thing that malcolm cousins wanted was betsy perryman forgetting her duty so shed ask him if hed taken his medicine and since bernie perryman never did anythingsave pour himself a black bush without having been reminded a dozen times the answer would be no so betsy would seek out the pills and shake the dosage into her palm and bernie would take it obediently and then stagger out of the housesans jacket as usualand head to st james church to do his duty betsy would call after him to take his jacket but bernie would wave off the suggestion his wife would shout bernie youll catch your death and then stop herself at the sudden thought that entered her mind bernies death after all was what she needed in order to be with her beloved so her glance would drop to the bottle of pills in her hand and she would read the label digitoxin do not exceed one tablet per day without consulting physician perhaps at that point she would also hear the doctors explanation to her its like digitalis youve heard of that an overdose would kill him mrs perryman so you must be vigilant and see to it that he never takes more than one tablet more than one tablet would ring in her ears her morning bonk with malcolm would live in her memory shed shake a pill from the bottle and examine it shed finally start to think of a way that the future could be massaged into place happily malcolm turned from the farmhouse to his budding ricardians all was going according to plan from this location malcolm told his audience of eager but elderly seekers of love on the battlefield we can see the village of sutton cheney to our northeast all heads swivelled in that direction they may have been freezing their antique pudenda but at least they were a cooperative group save for sludgecur who if she had a pudendum it was no doubt swathed in long underwear her expression challenged him to concoct a romance out of the battle of bosworth very well he thought and picked up the gauntlet hed give them romance hed also give them a piece of history that would change their lives perhaps this group of aussie oldies hadnt been ricardians when theyd arrived at bosworth field but theyd damn well be neophyte ricardians when they left and theyd return down under and tell their grandchildren that it was malcolm cousinsthe malcolm cousins they would saywho had first made them aware of the gross injustice that had been perpetrated upon the memory of a decent king it was there in the village of sutton cheney in st james church that king richard prayed on the night before the battle malcolm told them picture what the night must have been like from there he went onto automatic pilot hed told the story hundreds of times over the years that hed served as special guide for groups at bosworth field all he had to do was to milk it for its romantic qualities which wasnt a problem the kings forces strongwere encamped on the summit of ambion hill where malcolm cousins and his band of shivering neoricardians were standing the king knew that the morrow would decide his fate whether he would continue to reign as richard iii or whether his crown would be taken by conquest and worn by an upstart whod lived most of his life on the continent safely tucked away and coddled by those whose ambitions had long been to destroy the york dynasty the king would have been well aware that his fate rested in the hands of the stanley brothers sir william and thomas lord stanley they had arrived at bosworth with a large army and were encamped to the north not far from the king but alsoand ominouslynot far from the kings pernicious adversary henry tudor earl of richmond who also happened to be lord stanleys stepson to secure the fathers loyalty king richard had taken one of lord stanleys blood sons as a hostage the young mans life being the forfeit if his father betrayed englands anointed king by joining tudors forces in the upcoming battle the stanleys however were a wily lot and had shown themselves dedicated to nothing but their own selfinterest soholding george stanley hostage or notthe king must have known how great was the risk of entrusting the security of his throne to the whimsies of men whose devotion to self was their most notable quality the night before the battle richard would have seen the stanleys camped to the north in the direction of market bosworth he would have sent a messenger to remind them that as george stanley was still being held hostage and as he was being held hostage right there in the kings encampment the wise course would be to throw their lot in with the king on the morrow he would have been restless richard he would have been torn having lost first his son and heir and then his wife during his brief reign having been faced with the treachery of onceclose friends can there be any doubt that he would have wonderedif only fleetinglyhow much longer he was meant to go on and schooled in the religion of his time can there be any doubt that he knew how great a sin was despair and having established this fact can there be any question about what the king would have chosen to do on the night before the battle malcolm glanced over his group yes there was a satisfactorily misty eye or two among them they saw the inherent romance in a widowed king whod lost not only his wife but his heir and was hours away from losing his life as well malcolm directed a victorious glance at sludgecur her expression said dont press your luck it wasnt luck at all malcolm wanted to tell her it was the great romance of hearing the truth the wind had picked up velocity and lost another three or four degrees of temperature but his little band of antique aussies were caught in the thrall of that august night in the night before the battle malcolm told them knowing that if he lost he would die richard would have sought to be shriven history tells us that there were no priests or chaplains available among richards forces so what better place to find a confessor than in st james church the church would have been quiet as richard entered a votive candle or rushlight would have burned in the nave but nothing more the only sound inside the building would have come from richard himself as he moved from the doorway to kneel before the altar the rustle of his fustian doublet satinlined malcolm informed his scholars knowing the importance of detail to the romantic minded the creak of leather from his heavysoled battle shoes and from his scabbard the clank of his sword and dagger as he oh my goodness a romantic neoricardian chirruped what sort of man would take swords and daggers into a church malcolm smiled winsomely he thought a man who had a bloody good use for them just the very things needed for a bloke who wanted to prise loose a stone but what he said was unusual of course one doesnt think of someone carrying weapons into a church does one but this was the night before the battle richards enemies were everywhere he wouldnt have walked into the darkness unprotected whether the king wore his crown that night into the church no one can say malcolm continued but if there was a priest in the church to hear his confession that same priest left richard to his prayers soon after giving him absolution and there in the darkness lit only by the small rushlight in the nave richard made peace with his lord god and prepared to meet the fate that the next days battle promised him malcolm eyed his audience gauging their reactions and their attentiveness they were entirely with him they were he hoped thinking about how much they should tip him for giving a bravura performance in the deadly wind his prayers finished malcolm informed them the king unsheathed his sword and dagger set them on the rough wooden bench and sat next to them and there in the church king richard laid his plans to ruin henry tudor should the upstart be the victor in the morrows battle because richard knew that he heldand had always heldthe whip hand over henry tudor he held it in life as a proven and victorious battle commander he would hold it in death as the single force who could destroy the usurper goodness me someone murmured appreciatively yes malcolms listeners were fully atuned to the romance of the moment thank god richard he told them wasnt oblivious of the scheming that had been going on between henry tudor and elizabeth woodville widow of his brother edward iv and mother of the two young princes whom he had earlier placed in the tower of london the princes in the tower another voice remarked thats the two little boys who the very ones malcolm said solemnly richards own nephews the king would have known that holding true to her propensity for buttering her bread not only on both sides but along the crust as well elizabeth woodville had promised the hand of her eldest daughter to tudor should he obtain the crown of england but should tudor obtain the crown of england on the morrow richard also knew that every man woman and child with a drop of york blood stood in grave danger of being eliminated permanentlyas a claimant to the throne and this included elizabeth woodvilles children he himself ruled by right of succession and by law descended directlyand more important legitimatelyfrom edward iii he had come to the throne after the death of his brother edward iv upon the revelation of the licentious edwards secret pledge of marriage to another woman long before his marriage to elizabeth woodville this pledged contract of marriage had been made before a bishop of the church as such it was as good as a marriage performed with pomp and circumstance before a thousand onlookers and it effectively made edwards later marriage to elizabeth woodville bigamous at the same time as it bastardised all of their children henry tudor would have known that the children had been declared illegitimate by an act of parliament he would also have known that should he be victorious in his confrontation with richard iii his tenuous claim to the throne of england would not be shored up by marriage to the bastard daughter of a dead king so he would have to do something about her illegitimacy king richard would have concluded this once he heard the news that tudor had pledged to marry the girl he would also have known that to legitimatise elizabeth of york was also to legitimatise all her sisters and her brothers one could not declare the eldest child of a dead king legitimate while simultaneously claiming her siblings were not malcolm paused meaningfully in his narrative he waited to see if the eager romantics gathered round him would twig the implication they smiled and nodded and looked at him fondly but no one said anything so malcolm did their twigging for them her brothers he said patiently and slowly to make sure they absorbed each romantic detail if henry tudor legitimatised elizabeth of york prior to marrying her he would have been legitimatising her brothers as well and if he did that the elder of the boys gracious me one of the group sang out he wouldve been the true king once richard died bless you my child malcolm thought that he cried is exactly spot on see here mate sludgecur interrupted some sort of light dawning in the cobwebbed reaches of her brain ive heard this story and richard killed those little blighters himself while they were in the tower another fish biting the tudor bait malcolm realised five hundred years later and that scheming welsh upstart was still successfully reeling them in he could hardly wait until the day when his book came out when his history of richard was heralded as the triumph of truth over tudor casuistry he was patience itself as he explained the princes in the toweredward ivs two sonshad indeed been long reputed by tradition to have been murdered by their uncle richard iii to shore up his position as king but there were no witnesses to any murder and as richard was king through an act of parliament he had no motive to kill them and since he had no direct heir to the thronehis own son having died as you heard moments agowhat better way to ensure the yorks continued possession of the throne of england than to designate the two princes legitimate after his own death such designation could only be made by papal decree at this point but richard had sent two emissaries to rome and why send them such a distance unless it was to arrange for the legitimatising of the very boys whose rights had been wrested from them by their fathers lascivious conduct the boys were indeed rumored to be dead malcolm aimed for kindness in his tone but that rumor interestingly enough never saw the light of day until just before henry tudors invasion of england he wanted to be king but he had no rights to kingship so he had to discredit the reigning monarch could there possibly be a more efficacious way to do it than by spreading the word that the princeswho were gone from the towerwere actually dead but this is the question i pose to you ladies what if they werent an appreciative murmur went through the group malcolm heard one of the ancients commenting lovely eyes he has and he turned them towards the sound of her voice she looked like his grandmother she also looked rich he increased the wattage of his charm what if the two boys had been removed from the tower by richards own hand sent into safekeeping against a possible uprising should henry tudor prevail at bosworth field those two boys would be in grave danger and king richard knew it tudor was pledged to their sister to marry her he had to declare her legitimate declaring her legitimate made them legitimate making them legitimate made one of themyoung edwardthe true and rightful king of england the only way for tudor to prevent this was to get rid of them permanently malcolm waited a moment to let this sink in he noted the collection of grey heads turning towards sutton cheney then towards the north valley where a flagpole flew the seditious stanleys standard then over towards the peak of ambion hill where the unforgiving wind whipped richards white boar briskly then down the slope in the direction of the railway tracks where the tudor mercenaries had once formed their meagre front line vastly outnumbered outgunned and outarmed they would have been waiting for the stanleys to make their move for king richard or against him without the stanleys throwing their lot in with tudors the day would be lost the grey ones were clearly with him malcolm noted but sludgecur was not so easily drawn in how was tudor supposed to kill them if they were gone from the tower shed taken to beating her hands against her arms doubtless wishing she were pummeling his face he didnt kill them malcolm said pleasantly although his machiavellian fingerprints are all over the crime no tudor wasnt directly involved im afraid the situations a little nastier than that shall we walk on and discuss it ladies lovely little bum as well one of the group murmured quite a crumpet that bloke ah they were in his palm malcolm felt himself warm to his own seductive talents he knew that betsy was watching from the farmhouse from the firstfloor bedroom from which she could see the battlefield how could she possibly keep herself from doing so after their morning together shed see malcolm shepherding his little band from site to site shed note that they were hanging onto his every word and shed think about how she herself had hung upon him less than two hours earlier and the contrast between her drunken sot of a husband and her virile lover would be painfully and mightily on her mind this would make her realise how wasted she was on bernie perryman she was she would think forty years old and at the prime of her life she deserved better than bernie she deserved in fact a man who understood gods plan when hed created the first man and woman hed used the mans rib hadnt he in doing that hed illustrated for all time that women and men were bound together women taking their form and substance from their men living their lives in the service of their men for which their reward was to be sheltered and protected by their mens superior strength but bernie perryman only ever saw one half of the manwoman equation shebetsywas to work in his service care for him feed him see to his wellbeing hebernie was to do nothing oh hed make a feeble attempt to give her a length now and again if the mood was upon him and he could keep it up long enough but whiskey had long since robbed him of whatever ability hed once had to be pleasing to a woman and as for understanding her subtler needs and his responsibility in meeting them forget that area of life altogether malcolm liked to think of betsy in these terms up in her barren bedroom in the farmhouse nursing a righteous grievance against her husband she would proceed from that grievance to the realisation that he malcolm cousins was the man shed been intended for and she would see how every other relationship in her life had been but a prologue to the connection she now had with him she and malcolm she would conclude were suited for each other in every way watching him on the battlefield she would recall their initial meeting and the fire that had existed between them from the first day when betsy had begun to work at gloucester grammar as the headmasters secretary shed recall the spark shed felt when malcolm had said bernie perrymans wife and admired her openly old bernies been holding back on me and i thought we shared every secret of our souls she would remember how shed asked you know bernie still in the blush of her newlywed bliss and not yet aware of how bernies drinking was going to impair his ability to care for her and shed well remember malcolms response have done for years we grew up together went to school together spent holidays roaming the countryside we even shared our first womanand shed remember his smileso were practically blood brothers if it comes to that but i can see there might be a decided impediment to our future relationship betsy and his eyes had held hers just long enough for her to realise that her newlywed bliss wasnt nearly as hot as the look he was giving her from that upstairs bedroom shed see that the group malcolm was squiring round the field comprised women and shed begin to worry the distance from the farmhouse to the field would prevent her from seeing that malcolms antiquated audience had one collective foot in the collective grave so her thoughts would turn ineluctably to the possibilities implied by his current circumstances what was to prevent one of those women from becoming captivated by the enchantment he offered these thoughts would lead to her desperation which was what malcolm had been assiduously massaging for months whispering at the most tender of moments oh god if id only known what it was going to be like to have you finally and now to want you completely and then the tears wept into her hair and the revelation of the agonies of guilt and despair he experienced each time he rolled deliciously within the arms of his old friends wife i cant bear to hurt him darling bets if you and he were to divorce how could i ever live with myself if he ever knew how ive betrayed our friendship shed remember this in the farmhouse bedroom with her hot forehead pressed to the cold windowpane theyd been together for three hours that morning but shed realise that it was not enough it would never be enough to sneak round as they were doing to pretend indifference to each other when they met at gloucester grammar until they were a couplelegally as much as they were already a couple spiritually mentally emotionally and physicallyshe could never have peace but bernie stood between her and happiness she would think bernie perryman driven to alcohol by the demon of fear that the congenital abnormality that had taken his grandfather his father and both of his brothers before their fortyfifth birthdays would claim him as well weak heart bernie had doubtless told her since hed used it as an excuse for everything hed doneand not donefor the last thirty years it dont ever pump like it ought just a little flutter when it oughter be a thud got to be careful got to take m pills but if betsy didnt remind her husband to take his pills daily he was likely to forget there were pills altogether let alone a reason for taking them it was almost as if he had a death wish bernie perryman it was almost as if he was only waiting for the appropriate moment to set her free and once she was free betsy would think the legacy would be hers and the legacy was the key to her future with malcolm because with the legacy in hand at last she and malcolm could marry and malcolm could leave his illpaying job at gloucester grammar content with his research his writing and his lecturing he would be filled with gratitude for her having made his new lifestyle possible grateful he would be eager to meet her needs which was she would think certainly how it was meant to be in the plantagenet pub in sutton cheney malcolm counted the tip money from his mornings labour hed given his all but the aussie oldies had proved to be a niggardly lot hed ended up with forty pounds for the tour and lecturewhich was an awesomely cheap price considering the depth of information he impartedand twentyfive pounds in tips thank god for the pound coin he concluded morosely without it the tightfisted old sluts would probably have parted with nothing more than fifty pence apiece he pocketed the money as the pub door opened and a gust of icy air whooshed into the room the flames of the fire next to him bobbled ash from the fireplace blew onto the hearth malcolm looked up bernie perrymanclad only in cowboy boots blue jeans and a tshirt with the words team ferrari printed on itstaggered drunkenly into the pub malcolm tried to shrink out of view but it was impossible after the prolonged exposure to the wind on bosworth field his need for warmth had taken him to the blazing beechwood fire this put him directly in bernies sight line malkie bernie cried out joyfully and went on as he always did whenever they met malkie ol mate how bout a chess game i miss our matches i surely do he shivered and beat his hands against his arms his lips were practically blue shit on toast its blowing a cold one out there pour me a blackie he called out to the publican make it a double and make it doublequick he grinned and dropped onto the stool at malcolms table so hows the book comin malkie gotcher name in lights found a publisher yet he giggled malcolm put aside whatever guilt he may have felt at the fact that he was industriously stuffing this inebriates wife whenever his middleaged body was up to the challenge bernie perryman deserved to be a cuckold his punishment for the torment hed been dishing out to malcolm for the last ten years never got over that last game did you bernie grinned again he was served his black bush which he tossed back in a single gulp he blubbered air out between his lips he said did me right that and called for another now what was the fullon tale again malkie you get to the good part of the story yet course itll be a tough one to prove wont it mate malcolm counted to ten bernie was presented with his second double whiskey it went the way of the first but im givin you a bad time for nothing bernie said suddenly repentant in the way of all drunks you never did me a bad turncept that time with the alevels courseand i shouldnt do you one i wish you the best truly i do its just that things never work out the way theyre sposed to do they which malcolm thought was the whole bloody point thingsas bernie liked to call themhadnt worked out for richard either that fatal morning on bosworth field the earl of northumberland had let him down the stanleys had outandout betrayed him and an untried upstart who had neither the skill nor the courage to face the king personally in decisive combat had won the day so tell bern your theory another time i love the story i do i do i just wished there was a way for you to prove it itd be the making of you that book would how long you been working on the manuscript bernie swiped the interior of his whiskey glass with a dirty finger and licked off the residue he wiped his mouth on the back of his hand he hadnt shaved that morning he hadnt bathed in days for a moment malcolm almost felt sorry for betsy having to live in the same house with the odious man ive come to elizabeth of york malcolm said as pleasantly as he could manage considering the antipathy he was feeling for bernie edward ivs daughter future wife to the king of england bernie smiled showing teeth in serious need of cleaning cor i always forget that bird malkie whys that dyou think because everyone always forgot elizabeth malcolm said silently the eldest daughter of edward iv she was generally consigned to a footnote in history as the oldest sister of the princes in the tower the dutiful daughter of elizabeth woodville a pawn in the political power game the later wife of that tudor usurper henry vii her job was to carry the seed of the dynasty to deliver the heirs and to fade into obscurity but here was a woman who was onehalf woodville with the thick blood of that scheming and ambitious clan coursing through her veins that she wanted to be queen of england like her mother before her had been established in the seventeenth century when sir george buck had writtenin his history of the life and reigne of richard iiiof young elizabeths letter asking the duke of norfolk to be the mediator between herself and king richard on the subject of their marriage telling him that she was the kings in heart and in thought that she was as ruthless as her two parents was made evident in the fact that her letter to norfolk was written prior to the death of richards wife queen anne young elizabeth had been bundled out of london and up to yorkshire ostensibly for safetys sake prior to henry tudors invasion there she resided at sheriff hutton a stronghold deep in the countryside where loyalty to king richard was a constant of life elizabeth would be well protectednot to mention well guardedin yorkshire as would be her siblings you still hot for lizzie bernie asked with a chuckle cor how you used to go on about that girl malcolm suppressed his rage but did not forbid himself from silently cursing the other man into eternal torment bernie had a deep aversion for anyone who tried to make something of his life that sort of person served to remind him of what a waste hed made of his own bernie must have read something on malcolms face because as he called for his third double whiskey he said no no get on with you i as only kidding whats you doing out here today anyway was that you in the battlefield when i drove by bernie knew it was he malcolm realised but mentioning the fact served to remind them both of malcolms passion and the hold that bernie perryman had upon it god how he wanted to stand on the table and shout im bonking this idiots wife twice a week three or four times if i can manage it theyd been married two months when i bonked her the first time six days after we were introduced but losing control like that was exactly what bernie perryman wanted of his old friend malcolm cousins payback time for having once refused to help bernie cheat his way through his alevels the man had an elephantine memory and a grudgebearing spirit but so did malcolm i dont know malkie bernie said shaking his head as he was presented with his whiskey he reached unsteadily for it his bloodless tongue wetting his lower lip dont seem natural that lizzied hand those lads over to be given the chop not her own brothers not even to be queen of england sides they werent even anywheres near her were they all speculation f you ask me all speculation and not a speck of proof never malcolm thought for the thousandth time never tell a drunkard your secrets or your dreams it was elizabeth of york he said again she was ultimately responsible sheriff hutton was not an insurmountable distance from rievaulx jervaulx and fountain abbeys and tucking individuals away in abbeys convents monasteries and priories was a great tradition at that time women were the usual recipients of a oneway ticket to the ascetic life but two young boysdisguised as youthful entrants into a novitiatewould have been safe there from the arm of henry tudor should he take the throne of england by means of conquest tudor would have known the boys were alive malcolm said when he pledged himself to marry elizabeth he would have known the boys were alive bernie nodded poor little tykes he said with factitious sorrow and poor old richard who took the blame howd she get her mitts on them malkie what dyou think think she cooked up a deal with tudor she wanted to be a queen more than she wanted to be merely the sister to a king there was only one way to make that happen and henry had been looking elsewhere for a wife at the same time that he was bargaining with elizabeth woodville the girl would have known that and what it meant bernie nodded solemnly as if he cared a half fig for what had happened more than five hundred years ago on an august night not two hundred yards from the pub in which they sat he shot back his third double whiskey and slapped his stomach like a man at the end of a hearty meal got the church all prettied up for tomorrow he informed malcolm mazing when you think of it malkie perrymans been tinkering round st james church for two hundred years like a family pedigree that dont you think remarkable id say malcolm regarded him evenly utterly remarkable bernie he said ever think how different life mightve been if your dad and granddad and his granddad before him were the ones who tinkered round st james church prhaps id be you and youd be me what dyou think of that what malcolm thought of that couldnt be spoken to the man sitting opposite him at the table die he thought die before i kill you myself do you want to be together darling betsy breathed the question wetly into his ear another saturday another three hours of bonking betsy malcolm wondered how much longer hed have to continue with the charade he wanted to ask her to move overthe woman was capable of inducing claustrophobia with more efficacy than a plastic bagbut at this point in their relationship he knew that a demonstration of postcoital togetherness was as important to his ultimate objective as was a topnotch performance between the sheets and since his age his inclinations and his energy were all combining to take his performances down a degree each time he sank between betsys wellpadded thighs he realised the wisdom of allowing her to cling coo and cuddle for as long as he could endure it without screaming once the primal act was completed between them we are together he said stroking her hair it was wirelike to the touch the result of too much bleaching and even more hair spray unless you mean that you want another go and ill need some recovery time for that he turned his head and pressed his lips to her forehead you take it out of me and thats the truth of it darling bets youre woman enough for a dozen men she giggled you love it not it you love want and cant be without he sometimes pondered where he came up with the nonsense he told her it was as if a primitive part of his brain reserved for female seduction went onto autopilot whenever betsy climbed into his bed she buried her fingers in his ample chest hair he wondered not for the first time why it was that when a man went bald the rest of his body started sprouting hair in quadruple time i mean really be together darling do you want it the two of us like this forever do you want it more than anything on earth the thought alone was like being imprisoned in concrete but he said darling bets by way of answer and he trembled his voice appropriately dont please we cant go through this again and he pulled her roughly to him because he knew that was the move she desired he buried his face in the curve of her shoulder and neck he breathed through his mouth to avoid inhaling the days litre of shalimar that shed doused herself with he made the whimpering noises of a man in extremis god what he wouldnt do for king richard i was on the internet she whispered fingers caressing the back of his neck in the school library all thursday and friday lunch darling he stopped his whimpering sifting through this declaration for deeper meaning were you he temporised by nibbling at her earlobe waiting for more information it came obliquely you do love me dont you malcolm dearest what do you think and you do want me dont you thats obvious isnt it forever and ever whatever it takes he thought and he did his best to prove it to her although his body wasnt up to a full performance afterwards while she was dressing she said i was so surprised to see all the topics you cn look up anything on the internet fancy that malcolm anything at all bernies playing in chess night at the plantagenet dearest tonight that is malcolm furrowed his brow automatically seeking the connection between these apparently unrelated topics she went on he misses your games bernie does he always wishes youd come by on chess night and give it another go with him darling she padded to the chest of drawers where she began repairing her makeup course he doesnt play well just uses chess as an extra excuse to go to the pub malcolm watched her eyes narrowed waiting for a sign she gave it to him i worry about him malcolm dear his poor hearts going to give out someday im going with him tonight perhaps well see you there malcolm dearest do you love me do you want to be together more than anything on earth he saw that she was watching him closely in the mirror even as she repaired the damage hed done to her makeup she was painting her lips into beesting bows she was brushing her cheeks with blusher but all the time she was observing him more than life itself he said and when she smiled he knew hed given her the correct answer that night at the plantagenet pub malcolm joined the sutton cheney chessmen of whose society hed once been a regular member bernie perryman was delighted to see him he deserted his regular opponentseventyyearold angus ferguson who used the excuse of playing chess at the plantagenet to get as sloshed as bernieand pressed malcolm into a game at a table in the smoky corner of the pub betsy was right naturally bernie drank far more than he played and the black bush served to oil the mechanism of his conversation so he also talked incessantly he talked to betsy who was playing the role of serving wench for her husband that evening from half past seven until half past ten she trotted back and forth from the bar bringing bernie one double black bush after another saying youre drinking too much and this is the last one bernie in a monitory fashion but he always managed to talk her into just one more wet one mama girl and he patted her bum winked at malcolm and whispered loudly what he intended to do to her once he got her home malcolm was at the point of thinking hed utterly misunderstood betsys implied message to him in bed that morning when she finally made her move it came at half past ten one hour before george the publican called for last orders the pub was packed and malcolm might have missed her manoeuvre altogether had he not anticipated that something was going to happen that night as bernie nodded over the chessboard contemplating his next move eternally betsy went to the bar for yet another double blackie to do this she had to shoulder her way through the sutton cheney dartsmen the wardens of the church a womens support group from dadlington and a group of teenagers intent upon success with a fruit machine she paused in conversation with a balding woman who seemed to be admiring betsys hair with that sort of artificial enthusiasm women reserve for other women whom they particularly hate and it was while she and the other chatted that malcolm saw her empty the vial into bernies tumbler he was awestruck at the ease with which she did it she must have been practising the move for days he realised she was so adept that she did it with one hand as she chatted slipping the vial out of her sweater sleeve uncapping it dumping it returning it to her sweater she finished her conversation and she continued on her way and no one save malcolm was wise to the fact that shed done something more than merely fetch another whiskey for her husband malcolm eyed her with new respect when she set the glass in front of bernie he was glad he had no intention of hooking himself up with the murderous bitch he knew what was in the glass the results of betsys few hours surfing the internet shed crushed at least ten tablets of digitoxin into a lethal powder an hour after bernie ingested the mixture hed be a dead man ingest it bernie did he drank it down the way he drank down every double black bush he encountered he poured it directly down his throat and wiped his mouth on the back of his hand malcolm had lost count of the number of whiskeys bernie had imbibed that evening but it seemed to him that if the drug didnt kill him the alcohol certainly would bernie betsy said mournfully lets go home cant just yet bernie said got to finish my bit with malkie boy here we havent had us a chessup in years not sincehe smiled at malcolm blearily why i member that night up the farm doanchew malkie ten years back longer was it when we played that last game you and me malcolm didnt want to get onto that subject he said your move bernie or do you want to call it a draw no way joezay bernie swayed on his stool and studied the board bernie betsy said coaxingly he patted her hand which shed laid on his shoulder you gwan bets i cn find my way home malkiell drive me woanchew malkie he dug his car keys out of his pocket and pressed them into his wifes palm but doanchew fall asleep sweet mama we got business together when i get home betsy made a show of reluctance and a secondary show of her concern that malcolm might have had too much to drink himself and thereby be an unsafe driver for her precious bernie to ride along with bernie said f he cant do a straight line in the car park ill walk promise mama cross m heart betsy leveled a meaningful look at malcolm she said see that you keep him safe then malcolm nodded betsy departed and all that was left was the waiting for someone who was supposed to be suffering from congenital heart failure bernie perryman seemed to have the constitution of a mule an hour later malcolm had him in the car and was driving him home and bernie was still talking like a man with a new lease on life he was just itching to get up those farmhouse stairs and rip off his wifes knickers to hear him tell it nothing but the day of judgement was going to stop bernie from showing his sweet mama the time of her life by the time malcolm had taken the longest route possible to get to the farm without raising bernies suspicions hed begun to believe that his paramour hadnt slipped her husband an overdose of his medication at all it was only when bernie got out of the car at the edge of the drive that malcolm had his hopes renewed bernie said feel a bit peaked malkie whew nice lie down thas just the ticket and staggered in the direction of the distant house malcolm watched him until he toppled into the hedgerow at the side of the drive when he didnt move after the fall malcolm knew that the deed had finally been done he drove off happily if bernie hadnt been dead when he hit the ground malcolm knew that hed be dead by the morning wonderful he thought it may have been ages in the execution but his welllaid plan was going to pay off malcolm had worried a bit that betsy might muff her role in the ensuing drama but during the next few days she proved herself to be an actress of formidable talents having awakened in the morning to discover herself alone in the bed shed done what any sensible wifeofadrunk would do she went looking for her husband she didnt find him anywhere in the house or in the other farm buildings so she placed a few phone calls she checked the pub she checked the church she checked with malcolm had malcolm not seen her poison her husband with his own eyes he would have been convinced that on the other end of the line was a woman anxious for the welfare of her man but then she was anxious wasnt she she needed a corpse to prove bernie was dead i dropped him at the end of the drive malcolm told her help and concern personified he was heading up to the house the last i saw him bets so she went out and found bernie exactly where hed fallen on the previous night and her discovery of his body set the necessary events in motion an inquest was called of course but it proved to be a mere formality bernies history of heart problems and his difficulty with the drink as the authorities put it combined with the fiercely inclement weather theyd been having to provide the coroners jury with a most reasonable conclusion bernie perryman was declared dead of exposure having passed out on the coldest night of the year teetering up the lengthy drive to the farmhouse after a full night of drink at the plantagenet pub where sixteen witnesses called to testify had seen him down at least eleven double whiskeys in less than three hours there was no reason to check for toxicity in his blood especially once his doctor said that it was a miracle the man had lived to fortynine considering the medical history of his family not to mention his problem with the drink so bernie was buried at the side of his forebears in the graveyard of st james church where his father and all the fathers before him for at least the past two hundred years had toiled in the cause of a neat and tidy house of worship malcolm soothed what few pangs of guilt he had over bernies passing by ignoring them bernied had a history of heart disease bernie had been a notorious drunk if bernie in his cups had passed out on the driveway a mere fifty yards from his house and died from exposure as a result well who could possibly hold himself responsible and while it was sad that bernie perryman had had to give his life for the cause of malcolms search for the truth it was also the truth that hed brought his premature death upon himself after the funeral malcolm knew that all he needed to employ was patience he hadnt spent the last two years industriously ploughing betsys field only to be thwarted by a display of unseemly haste at the moment of harvest besides betsy was doing enough bit chomping for both of them so he knew it was only a matter of daysperhaps hoursbefore she took herself off to the perrymans longtime solicitor for an accounting of the inheritance that was coming her way malcolm had pictured the moment enough times during his liaison with betsy sometimes picturing the moment when betsy learned the truth was the only fantasy that got him through his interminable lovemaking sessions with the woman howard smythethomas would open his nuneaton office to her and break the news in a suitably funereal fashion no doubt and perhaps at first betsy would think his sombre demeanour was an air adopted for the occasion hed begin by calling her my dear mrs perryman which should give her an idea that bad news was in the offing but she wouldnt have an inkling of how bad the news was until he spelled out the bitter reality for her bernie had no money the farm had been mortgaged three times there were no savings worth speaking of and no investments the contents of the house and the outbuildings were hers of course but only by selling off every possessionand the farm itselfwould betsy be able to avoid bankruptcy and even then it would be touch and go the only reason the bank hadnt foreclosed on the property before now was that the perrymans had been doing business with that same financial institution for more than two hundred years loyalty mr smythethomas would no doubt intone bernard may have had his difficulties mrs perryman but the bank had respect for his lineage when ones father and ones fathers father and his father before him have done business with a banking establishment there is a certain leeway given that might not be given to a personage less well known to that bank which would be legal doublespeak for the fact that since there were no other perrymans at windsong farmand mr smythethomas would be good about gently explaining that a shortterm wife of a longterm alcoholic perryman didnt countthe bank would probably be calling in bernies debts she would be wise to prepare herself for that eventuality but what about the legacy betsy would ask bernie always nattered on about a legacy and she would be stunned to think of the depth of her husbands deception mr smythethomas naturally would know nothing about a legacy and considering the perryman history of neerdowells earning their keep by doing nothing more than working round the church in sutton cheney he would kindly point out that it wasnt very likely that anyone had managed to amass a fortune doing handywork was it it would take some hoursperhaps even daysfor the news to sink into betsys skull shed think at first that there had to be some sort of mistake surely there were jewels hidden somewhere cash tucked away silver or gold or deeds to property heretofore unknown packed in the attic and thinking this she would begin her search which was exactly what malcolm intended her to do search first and come weeping to malcolm second and malcolm himself would take it from there in the meantime he happily worked on his magnum opus the pages to the left of his typewriter piled up satisfactorily as he redeemed the reputation of englands most maligned king many of the righteous fell that morning of august and among them was the duke of norfolk who commanded the vanguard at the front of richards army when the earl of northumberland refused to engage his forces to come to the aid of norfolks leaderless men the psychological tide of the battle shifted those were the days of mass desertions of switching loyalties of outright betrayals on the field of battle and both the king and his tudor foe would have known that which went far to explain why both men simultaneously needed and doubted the stanleys which also went far to explain whyin the midst of the battlehenry tudor made a run for the stanleys who had so far refused to enter the fray outnumbered as he was henry tudors cause would be lost without the stanleys intervention and he wasnt above begging for it which is why he made that desperate ride across the plain towards the stanley forces king richard intercepted him thundering down ambion hill with his knights and esquires of the body the two small forces engaged each other a bare half mile from the stanleys men tudors knights began falling quickly under the kings attack william brandon and the banner of cadwallader plummeted to the ground the enormous sir john cheyney fell beneath the kings own ax it was only a matter of moments before richard might fight his way to henry tudor himself which was what the stanleys realised when they made their decision to attack the kings small force in the ensuing battle king richard was unhorsed and could have fled the field but declaring that he would die king of england he continued to fight even when grievously wounded it took more than one man to bring him down and he died like the royal prince that he was the kings army fled pursued hotly by the earl of oxford whose intent it would have been to kill as many of them as possible they shot off towards the village of stoke golding in the opposite direction from sutton cheney this fact was the crux of the events that followed when ones life is hanging in the balance when one is a blood relative of the defeated king of england ones thoughts turn inexorably towards selfpreservation john de la pole earl of lincoln and nephew to king richard was among the fleeing forces to ride towards sutton cheney would have put him directly into the clutches of the earl of northumberland who had refused to come to the kings aid and would have been only too happy to cement his position in henry tudors affectionssuch as they wereby handing over the dead kings nephew so he rode to the south instead of to the north and in doing so he condemned his uncle to five hundred years of tudor propaganda because history is written by the winners malcolm thought only sometimes history gets to be rewritten and as he rewrote it in the back of his mind was the picture of betsy and her growing desperation in the two weeks following bernies death she hadnt returned to work gloucester grammars headmasterthe sniveling samuel as malcolm liked to call himreported that betsy was prostrate over her husbands sudden death she needed time to deal with and to heal from her grief he told the staff sorrowfully malcolm knew that what she had to deal with was finding something that she could pass off as the legacy so as to bind him to her despite the fact that her expectations of inheritance had come to nothing tearing through the old farmhouse like a wild thing she would probably go through bernies wardrobe one thread at a time in an attempt to unearth some item of value shed shake open books seeking everything from treasure maps to deeds shed sift through the contents of the half dozen trunks in the attic shed knock about the outbuildings with her lips turning blue from the cold and if she was assiduous she would find the key that key would take her to the safedeposit box at that very same bank in which the perrymans had transacted business for two hundred years widow of bernard perryman with his will in one hand and his death certificate in the other she would be given access and there shed come to the end of her hopes malcolm wondered what she would think when she saw the single grubby piece of paper that was the long heralded legacy of the perrymans filled with handwriting so cramped as to be virtually illegible it looked like nothing to the untrained eye and thats what betsy would think she had in her possession when she finally threw herself upon malcolms mercy bernie perryman had known otherwise however on that longago night when hed shown malcolm the letter have a lookit this here malkie bernie had said tell ol bern whatchoo think of this he was in his cups as usual but he wasnt yet blotto and malcolm having just obliterated him at chess was feeling expansive and willing to put up with his childhood friends inebriated ramblings at first he thought that bernie was taking a page from out of a large old bible but he quickly saw that the bible was really an antique leather album of some sort and the page was a document a letter in fact although it had no salutation it was signed at the bottom and next to the signature were the remains of a wax imprint from a signet ring bernie was watching him in that sly way drunks have gauging his reaction so malcolm knew that bernie knew what it was that he had in his possession which made him curious but wary as well the wary part of him glanced at the document saying i dont know bernie i cant make much of it while the curious part of him added whered it come from bernie played coy that ol floor always gave them trouble dint it malkie too low it was stones too rough never a decent job of building but what else cn you expect when a structures donkeys ears old malcolm mined through this non sequitur for meaning the old buildings in the area were gloucester grammar school the plantagenet pub market bosworth hall the timbered cottages in rectory lane st james church in his gaze sharpened first on bernie and then on his document st james church in sutton cheney he thought and he gave the document a closer look which was when he deciphered the first line of iti richardby the grace of god kyng of england and france and lord of irelandwhich was when his glance dropped to the hastily scrawled signature which he also deciphered richard r holy jesus god he thought what had bernie got his drunken little hands on he knew the importance of staying cool one indication of his interest and hed be bernies breakfast so he said cant tell much in this light bernie mind if i have a closer look at home but bernie wasnt about to buy that proposal he said cant let it out of m sight malkie family legacy that been our goods for donkeys ears that has and every one of us swore to keep it safe how did you but malcolm knew better than to ask how bernie had come to have a letter written by richard iii among his family belongings bernie would tell him only what bernie deemed necessary for malcolm to know so he said lets have a look in the kitchen then that all right with you that was just fine with bernie perryman he after all wanted his old mate to see what the document was so they went into the kitchen and sat at the table and malcolm pored over the thick piece of paper the writing was terrible not the neat hand of the professional scribe who would have attended the king and written his correspondence for him but the hand of a man in agitated spirits malcolm had spent nearly twenty years consuming every scrap of information on richard plantagenet duke of gloucester later richard iii called the usurper called englands black legend called the bunchbacked toad and virtually every other obloquy imaginable so he knew how possible it actually was that here in this farmhouse not two hundred yards from bosworth field and little over a mile from st james church he was looking at the genuine article richard had lived his last night in this vicinity richard had fought here richard had died here how unimaginable a circumstance was it that richard had also written a letter somewhere nearby in a building where it lay hidden until malcolm sifted through everything he knew about the areas history he came up with the fact he needed the floor of st james church he said it was raised two hundred years ago wasnt it and one of the countless neerdowell perrymans had been there had probably helped with the work and had found this letter bernie was watching him a sly smile tweaking the corners of his mouth whatchoo think it says malkie he asked think it might be worth a bob or two malcolm wanted to strangle him but instead he studied the priceless document it wasnt long just a few lines that he saw could have altered the course of history and that wouldwhen finally made public through the historical discourse he instantaneously decided to writefinally redeem the king who for five hundred years had been maligned by an accusation of butchery for which there had never been a shred of proof i richard by the grace of god kyng of england and france and lord of ireland on thys daye of august do with thys document hereby enstruct the good fadres of jervaulx to gyve unto the protection of the beerrer edward hytherto called lord bastarde and hys brother richard called duke of yrk possession of thys document wyll suffyce to identyfie the beerrer as john de la pole earl of lyncoln beloved nephew of the kyng wrytten in hast at suton chene richard r two sentences only but enough to redeem a mans reputation when the king had died on the field of battle that of august his two young nephews had been alive malcolm looked at bernie steadily you know what this is dont you bernie he asked his old friend numbskull like me bernie asked him what couldnt even pass his alevels howd i know what that bit of trash is but what dyou think worth something if i flog it you cant sell this bernie malcolm spoke before he thought and much too hastily doing so he inadvertently revealed himself bernie scooped the paper up and manhandled it to his chest malcolm winced god only knew the damage the fool was capable of doing when he was drunk go easy with that malcolm said its fragile bernie like friendship isnt it bernie tottered from the kitchen it would have been shortly after that that bernie had moved the document to another location for malcolm had never seen it again but the knowledge of its existence had festered inside him for years and only with the advent of betsy had he finally seen a way to make that precious piece of paper his and it would be soon just as soon as betsy got up her nerve to phone him with the terrible news that what shed thought was a legacy was onlyto her utterly unschooled eyesa bit of old paper suitable for lining the bottom of a parakeet cage while awaiting her call malcolm put the finishing touches on his the truth about richard and bosworth field ten years in the writing and wanting only a single final and previously unseen historical document to serve as witness to the veracity of his theory about what happened to the two young princes the hours that he spent at his typewriter flew by like leaves blown off the trees in ambion forest where once a marsh had protected richards south flank from attack by henry tudors mercenary army the letter gave credence to malcolms surmise that richard would have told someone of the boys whereabouts should the battle favour henry tudor the princes would be in deadly danger so the night before the battle richard would finally have had to tell someone his most closely guarded secret where the two boys were in that way if the day went to tudor the boys could be fetched from the monastery and spirited out of the country and out of the reach of harm john de la pole earl of lincoln and beloved nephew to richard iii would have been the likeliest candidate he would have been instructed to ride to yorkshire if the king fell to safeguard the lives of the boys who would be made legitimateand hence the biggest threat to the usurperthe moment henry tudor married their sister john de la pole would have known the gravity of the boys danger but despite the fact that his uncle would have told him where the princes were hidden he would never have been given access to them much less had them handed over to him without express direction to the monks from the king himself the letter would have given him that access but hed had to flee to the south instead of to the north so he couldnt pull it from the stones in st james church where his uncle had hidden it the night before the battle and yet the boys disappeared never to be heard of again so who took them there could be only one answer to that question elizabeth of york sister to the princes but also affianced wife of the newlycrownedrightthereonthebattlefield king hearing the news that her uncle had been defeated elizabeth would have seen her options clearly queen of england should henry tudor retain his throne or sister to a mere youthful king should her brother edward claim his own legitimacy the moment henry legitimatised her or suppressed the act by which shed been made illegitimate in the first place thus she could be the matriarch of a royal dynasty or a political pawn to be given in marriage to anyone with whom her brother wished to form an alliance sheriff hutton her temporary residence was no great distance from any of the abbeys ever her uncles favourite niece and knowing his bent for things religious she would have guessedif richard hadnt told her directlywhere hed hidden her brothers and the boys would have gone with her willingly she was their sister after all i am elizabeth of york she would have told the abbot in that imperious voice shed heard used so often by her cunning mother i shall see my brothers alive and well and instantly how easily it would have been accomplished the two young princes seeing their older sister for the first time in who knew how long running to her embracing her eagerly turning to the abbot when she informed them that shed come for them at last and who was the abbot to deny a royal princessclearly recognised by the boys themselvesher own brothers especially in the current situation with king richard dead and sitting on the throne a man whod illustrated his bloodthirst by making one of his first acts as king a declaration of treason against all who had fought on the side of richard at bosworth field tudor wouldnt look kindly on the abbey that was found to be sheltering the two boys god only knew what his revenge would be should he locate them thus it made sense for the abbot to deliver edward the lord bastard and his brother richard the duke of york into the hands of their sister and elizabeth with her brothers in her possession handed them over to someone one of the stanleys the duplicitous earl of northumberland who went on to serve henry tudor in the north sir james tyrell onetime follower of richard who was the recipient of two general pardons from tudor not a year after he took the throne whoever it was once the princes were in his hands their fates were sealed and no one wishing to preserve his life afterwards would have thought about levelling an accusation against the wife of a reigning monarch who had already shown his inclination for attainting subjects and confiscating their land it was malcolm thought such a brilliant plan on elizabeths part she was her mothers own daughter after all she knew the value of placing selfinterest above everything else besides she would have told herself that keeping the boys alive would only prolong a struggle for the throne that had been going on for thirty years she could put an end to the bloodshed by shedding just a little more blood what woman in her position would have done otherwise the fact that it took betsy more than three months to develop the courage to break the sorrowful news to malcolm did cause him a twinge of concern now and then in the timeline hed long ago written in his mind shed have come to him in hysterics not twentyfour hours after discovering that her legacy was a scribbledup scrap of dirty paper shed have thrown herself into his arms and wept and waited for rescue to emphasise the dire straits she was in shed have brought the paper with her to show him how ill bernie perryman had used his loving wife and he malcolmwould have taken the paper from her shaking fingers would have given it a glance would have tossed it to the floor and joined in her weeping mourning the death of their dearly held dreams for she was ruined financially and he on a mere paltry salary from gloucester grammar could not offer her the life she deserved then after a vigorous and memorable round of mattress poker she would leave the scorned bit of paper still lying on the floor and the letter would be his and when his tome was published and the lectures television interviews chat shows and book tours began cluttering up his calendar he would have no time for a bumpkin housewife whod been too dim to know what shed had in her fingers that was the plan malcolm felt the occasional pinch of worry when it didnt come off quickly but he told himself that betsys reluctance to reveal the truth to him was all part of gods great plan this gave him time to complete his manuscript and he used the time well since he and betsy had decided that discretion was in order following bernies death they saw each other only in the corridors of gloucester grammar when she returned to work during this time malcolm phoned her nightly for telesex once he realised that he could keep her oiled and proofread the earlier chapters of his opus simultaneously then finally three months and four days after bernies unfortunate demise betsy whispered a request to him in the corridor just outside the headmasters office could he come to the farm for dinner that night she didnt look as solemnfaced as malcolm would have liked considering her impoverished circumstances and the death of her dreams but he didnt worry much about this betsy had already proved herself a stunning actress she wouldnt want to break down at the school prior to leaving that afternoon swollen with the realisation that his fantasy was about to be realised malcolm handed in his notice to the headmaster samuel montgomery accepted it with a rather disturbing alacrity which malcolm didnt much like and although the headmaster covered his surprise and delight with a spurious show of regret at losing a veritable institution here at gg malcolm could see him savouring the triumph of being rid of someone hed decided was an educational dinosaur so it gave him more satisfaction than he would have thought possible knowing how great his own triumph was going to be when he made his mark upon the face of english history malcolm couldnt have been happier as he drove to windsong farm that evening the long winter of his discontent had segued into a beautiful spring and he was minutes away from being able to right a fivehundredyearold wrong at the same time as he carved a place for himself in the pantheon of the historical greats god is good he thought as he made the turn into the farms long driveway it was unfortunate that bernie perryman had had to die but as his death was in the interests of historical redemption it would have to be said that the end richly justified the means as he got out of the car betsy opened the farmhouse door malcolm blinked at her puzzled at her manner of dress it took him a moment to digest the fact that she was wearing a fulllength fur coat silver mink by the look of it or possibly ermine it wasnt the wisest getup to don in these days of animal rights activists but betsy had never been a woman to think very far beyond her own desires before malcolm had a moment to wonder how betsy had managed to finance the purchase of a fur coat she had thrown it open and was standing in the doorway naked to her toes darling she cried were rich rich rich and youll never guess what i sold to make
