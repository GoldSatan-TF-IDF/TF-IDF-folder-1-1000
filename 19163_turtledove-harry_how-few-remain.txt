harry turtledove how few remain now twenty years have passed away since i here bid farewell to woods and fields and scenes of play and schoolmates loved so well where many were now few remain of old familiar things but seeing these to mind again the lost and absent brings the friends i left that parting day how changed as time has sped young childhood grown strong manhood gray and half of all are dead abraham lincoln my childhood home i see again prelude september outside frederick maryland t he army of northern virginia was breaking camp the lean ragged soldiers their gray uniforms and especially their shoes much the worse for wear began the next long tramp this one north and west toward hagerstown they were profoundly and profanelyglad to be getting away from frederick that bonnie blue flag that aint nothin but a damn pack o lies a corporal announced to anyone who would listen as he slung his haversack over his shoulder youd best believe it is one of the privates in his company agreed pausing in the middle of the agreement to spit a brown stream of tobacco juice from the chaw that bulged out his left cheek this here miserable frederick town it aint nothin but a stinkin city full of damnyankees sons of bitches wouldnt take our money wouldnt open up their stores so as we could get the supplies we needed wouldnt taking a corporals privilege the corporal interrupted you cant even get into that there town without you have a letter in writin from your officer says you can otherwise them lousy provost guards theyd just as soon arrest you as look at you goddamn miserable snoops hear them talk youd think we was the ones in the yankee uniforms hell i am in a yankee uniformyankee trousers anyways the private answered the northern fellow i took em off he didnt need em no more the couriers horse daintily picked its way through the chaos careful where it set its feet the lieutenant aboard the bay gelding didnt blame the animal for that once an army had camped in a field it wasnt a pleasant place any more no matter how pleasant it might have been to start out with they said that once youd been encamped for a while you stopped noticing the stink the lieutenant wrinkled his nose hed never found that to be true every time he breathed in he smelled the slit trenches and the men hadnt been all that careful about using them this was after all yankee country horse manure thousands of bodies that had done a heap of hard marching without baths any time lately and the choking smoke from thousands of little fires the good odors of cooking food coffee and tobacco had to fight hard to make themselves noticed against all that lieutenant somebody called from behind him hey lieutenant the courier paid no particular attention the army of northern virginia wasnt as big as it should have been but it was big enough to have a hell of a lot of lieutenants then the call got more specific you there lieutenant up on the bayhold on will you the courier reined in and looked back over his shoulder you want me noyour cousin back in richmond the corporal whod been grousing about the provost guards grinned impudently up at him getting men to give officers the respect their rank deserved was a battle the army hadnt won yet and wouldnt any time soon the courier was about to tell the infantryman off when the fellow held up a fat white envelope now somewhat stained with mud you dropped this sir good god the courier felt woozy lightheaded give it to me here you go the corporal handed it to him he cocked his head to one side you all right lieutenant you dont mind me sayin so you look white as a ghost you do i believe it the lieutenant clutched the envelope as if he were a drowning man and it a plank do you know whats in here cigars felt like the corporal answered with the casual expertise of a man whod done a good deal of foraging cigars it is the courier opened the envelope and took them out there were three all of them nice and long and thick he handed the corporal the biggest one herethis is for you the next went to the private with whom the fellow had been grumbling and this is for you he stuck the third in his own mouth obliged sir the corporal walked over to the nearest fire stuck a twig in it and got his cigar going he came back pugging happy clouds and leaned close to the private so he could start his then he came up to the courier after hed given him a light he remarked thats good baccy but it dont seem enough to be makin such a much of a much over like you was doin no the lieutenants laugh was the high sweet sound of pure relief do you know what was wrapped around those cigars the corporal shook his head cant say as i do reckon youre gonna tell me though so thats all right oh nothing much the courier said and laughed again only a copy of general lees special order thats all only the orders that say where every division in the army of northern virginias supposed to be going and what its supposed to do when it gets there the private shifted the cigar to the corner of his mouth and spoke up that dont sound like itd be somethin youd want to lose not hardly the lieutenant tried to imagine what would have happened to him if general lee found out hed lost the order appalling as that notion was an even worse one replaced it one so horrific he said it out loud as if to exorcise it if mcclellans men picked up that envelope theyd know exactly what we aimed to do and theyd be able to break us right up damn fine thing we got it back to you then the corporal said you hang on to it from here on out you hear he touched a forefinger to the brim of his black felt hat and i do thank you kindly for the cigar that was right good of you behind him the private nodded im the one who needs to thank you the courier said hells fire gentlemen the confederate states of america might have lost the whole war if you hadnt found that envelope he waved his gratitude once more then used the pressure of his legs and a flick of the reins to get his horse moving the corporal and private looked after him till he disappeared into the midst of the disorderly throng of soldiers lost the whole war the corporal echoed scornfully he dont think much of himself and the papers he carries now does he ahh he wasnt a bad feller the private answered he gave us these here cigars an he didnt have to do that he tilted his head back and blew a ragged smoke ring october near new cumberland pennsylvania long blond hair streaming out behind him captain george armstrong custer came galloping from general mcclellans headquarters to those of general burnside who commanded the army of the potomac s left wing brass napoleons roared their cannonballs tore holes in the ranks of the advancing confederates up ahead up not far enough aheadrifle muskets barked blackpowder smoke drifted in choking clouds smelling of fireworks custer jerked his mount to an abrupt halt by burnsides tent an orderly came over and held the horses head custer sprang down he ran to general burnside who was standing outside the tent a telescope in his hands damn it general custer said running a hand through his hair ive lost my hat burnside shielded his own bald crown from the elements with a tall hat that gave him something of the look of a policeman the whiskers sprouting luxuriantly on his cheeks and upper lip made his round face rounder yet i trust the nation will survive he said what word from general mcclellan sir you are to hold your position at all hazard custer answered i shall do everything in my power burnsides frown deepened the dimple in his cleanshaven chin they are pounding us hard though as if to underscore his words a rebel shell screamed down and exploded perhaps fifty yards from the tent custers horse let out a frightened whinny it tried to rear the orderly wouldnt let it you must hold custer repeated if they get around your left we are ruined also general mcclellan said you must not fall back any farther if jackson s corps is able to bring its artillery to bear on the bridge over the susquehanna our line of retreat is cut off general mcclellan should have considered that before offering battle on this side of the river burnside said tartly this is where we met the confederatesthis is where we fight them for custer that was an axiom of nature burnside stared gloomily at the sun through the clotted smoke it looked red as blood two hours till nightfall perhaps a bit more he said and frowned again very well captain i have my orders and shall essay to carry them out you may assure general mcclellan on that point ill do it custer started back toward his horse he was about to mount when the drumroll of musketry from the battle front suddenly got louder fiercer wait he told the orderly his voice sharp burnside was peering through the shiny brasscased telescope custer had no such aid but did not need one either men in blue were streaming back toward him now and then one of them turned to fire his springfield muzzleloader at the foe but most seemed intent on nothing more than getting away from the fight as fast as they could what in blazes has gone wrong now custer demanded of the smoky air the whole campaign had been a nightmare with lee getting up through maryland and into pennsylvania almost before mcclellan learned hed left virginia never a fast mover little mac had followed as best he couldand been brought to battle here in this less than auspicious place custer vaulted lightly into the saddle he set spurs to his horse and sent it at a fast trot not back toward general mcclellans headquarters but in the direction from which the retreating federals were coming go back sir one of them called to him aint no more we can do here d h hills men are over yellow breeches creek and on the susquehanna theyre arollin us up then we have to drive the sons of bitches back custer snarled libbie bacon his fiancee wanted him to stop swearing he hadnt been able to make himself do it much as he loved libbie he rode forward again a few men cheered and followed more though kept right on back toward that one precious bridge craack a minie ball zipped past him another cut his sleeve so that he wondered if someone had tugged at his arm till he glanced down and saw the tear he yanked an army colt out of his holster and blazed away at the rebels till the sixshooter was empty he wore another piratically thrust into the top of one of the big floppy boots hed taken from a confederate cavalryman hed captured he emptied that pistol too then yanked out his saber the sun sparkled from the glittering steel edge custer urged his mount up into a caracole he felt the perfect picture of martial splendor get out of here you damn fool a grimyfaced corporal yelled you reckon youre gonna slaughter all them rebs with your straight razor there he spat on the ground and trudged north toward the bridge suddenly custer realized how alone he was the horse dropped down onto all fours custer spurred it through and then past the soldiers from burnsides beaten left behind him rebel yells rose like panther screams rebel artillery thundered splashes in the susquehanna said the guns were reaching for that one bridge offering escape from the grayclad barefoot fiends of the army of northern virginia screams from the bridge said some of the guns were finding it as he had in front of burnsides tent so custer leaped down from his horse in front of general mcclellans like general burnside little mac so hopefully called the young napoleon stood outside he pointed south toward burnsides position i hear the fighting building there captain he said i trust you conveyed to general burnside the absolute necessity of holding in place sir general burnside listened but stonewall jackson didnt custer answered the rebs are on the river on this side of yellow breeches creek and im damned if i see anything between there and the bridge to stop em mcclellans handsome face went pale even with that ruddy sunlight shining down on it it is the end then he said in a voice like ashes his shoulders sagged as if he had taken a wound the end i tell you captain with the army of the potomac whipped who can hope to preserve the republic intact were not whipped yet sir even in custers own ears the brave words sounded hollow impossible to believe fire somebody shouted off in the distance jesus god the bridge is on fire the end mcclellan said again the rebs have outnumbered us from the start custer wondered about that but held his peace mcclellan went on we are ruined ruined i tell you after this defeat england and france will surely recognize the southern confederacy as they have been champing at the bit to do not even that buffoon in the white house the jackass who dragged us into this war will be able to pretend any longer that it has any hope of coming to a successful resolution custer a staunch democrat had if anything even less use for abraham lincoln than did mcclellan if that damned black republican hadnt been elected we would still be one nation and at peace he said after the disaster his party has been to the union it will be a long time before another republican is chosen to fill the white house mcclellan said i take some consolation in thatnot much i assure you captain but some nonetheless another of mcclellans officers galloped up from the northwest sir he cried not even dismounting longstreet is pounding our right with everything he has and general hookergeneral hooker sir he wont do anything its as if hes stunned by a near miss from a shell sir but hes not hurt mcclellans mouth twisted in his california days joe hooker was the best poker player the world ever knew he said heavily till it came time to raise fifty dollars then hed flunk if he flunks now as it had on the left a great burst of musketry and cannon fire told its own story general mcclellan sir he just flunked custer said he reloaded his pistolsnot a fast business with ball and loose powder and percussion cap for each chamber of the cylinder after one colt was charged he lost patience by your leave general im going to the fighting before it comes to me go ahead captain mcclellan said his posture said he thought all was lost custer thought all was lost too he didnt care fighting in a lost cause was even more splendid and glorious than battle where victory was assured he sprang onto his horse and rode toward the loudest gunfire he looked back once mcclellan was staring after him shaking his head chapter b uffalo bones littered the prairie south of fort dodge kansas colonel george custer gave them only the briefest glance they seemed as natural a part of the landscape as had the buffalo themselves a decade before custer had killed his share of buffalo and more now he was after more dangerous game he raised the springfield carbine to his shoulder and fired at one of the kiowas fleeing before him the indian one of the rearmost of satantas raiding party did not fall custer loaded another cartridge into the carbines breech and fired again again the shot was useless the kiowa turned on his pony for a parthian shot fire and smoke belched from the muzzle of his rifle the bullet kicked up a puff of dust ten or fifteen yards in front of custer he fired again and so did the kiowa the indians tredegar works carbine a close copy of the british martinihenry had about the same performance as his own weapon both men missed once more the kiowa gave all his attention back to riding bending low over his ponys neck and coaxing from the animal every bit of speed it had theyre gaining on us the blackhearted savages custer shouted to his troopers inhibited in language by the pledge his wife libbie had finally succeeded in extracting from him let me and a couple of the other boys with the fastest horses get out ahead of the troop and make em fight us till the rest of you can catch up his brother suggested no tom wouldnt work im afraid they wouldnt fighttheyd just scatter like a covey of quail damned cowards major tom custer growled he was a younger less flamboyant version of his brother but no less ferocious in the field they bushwhack our farmers then they run if they want to come up into kansas let em fight like men once theyre here they dont much want to fight custer said all they want to do is kill and burn and loot thats easier safer and more profitable too give me the sioux any day up in minnesota and dakota and wyoming tom custer said they fought hard and only a few of them ran away into canada once wed licked them and the canadians disarmed the ones who did custer added ill bedashed if i like the canadians mind you but they play the game the way its supposed to be played its cricket tom said and custer nodded his younger brother pointed south we arent going to catch them on our side of the line autie i can see that george custer scowledat fate not at the family nickname after a moment the scowl became a fierce grin all right by jingo maybe we wont catch them on our side of the line well just have to catch them on theirs tom looked startled are you sure youd best believe im sure the excitement of the pursuit ran through custer in a hot tide whatever consequences came from extending the pursuit hed worry about them later now all he wanted to do was teach the kiowas a lesson even that sneaky old devil satanta wouldnt forget any time soon he shouted over to the regimental bugler blow pursuit sir the bugler said as surprised as tom custer had been then he grinned yes sirl he raised the bugle to his lips the bold and martial notes rang out across the plain the men of the fifth cavalry regiment needed a moment to grasp what that call implied then they howled like wolves some of them waved their broadbrimmed black felt hats in the air from long experience the kiowas understood us horn calls as well as any cavalry trooper their heads went up as if they were game fearing it would be flushed from cover thats what they are all right custer thought as often happened toms thoughts ran in the same track as his own they wont duck back into their lair this time his younger brother said now that the decision was made tom was all for it they pounded past a farmhouse the kiowas had burned in a raid a couple of years earlier custer recognized those ruins they meant he was less than a mile from the border with the indian territory up ahead the kiowas squeezed still more from their ponies custer smiled savagely that might get them over the line but even those tough animals would start wearing down soon and then he told the wind blowing tears from his eyes then theyre mine sure as mcclellan belonged to lee twenty years ago he fired again at the kiowas and shouted in exultation as one of them slid from his horses back and thudded to the ground where after rolling a couple of times he lay still good shot his brother said hell of a good shot weve got em now custer said the first kiowas had to be over the line he didnt care we wont let em get away every last redskin in that band is ours how his men cheered and then all of custers ferocious joy turned to ashes tom pointed off to the east from which direction a squadron of cavalry was approaching at a fast trot all the kiowas were over the line by then they reined in whooping in their incomprehensible language they knew they were safe custer knew it too chasing the kiowas into indian territory punishing them and then riding back into kansas with no one but the indians the wiser was one thing doing it under the watchful eyes of that other cavalry squadron was something else again hating those horsemen hating himself custer held his hand high to halt his men they stopped on the kansas side of the line the approaching cavalrymen wore hats and blouses of a cut not much different from those of custers troopers theirs though were gray not the various shades of blue the us cavalry used and a couple of their officers custer saw were in the new dirtbrown uniforms the confederate states had adopted from the british the limeys called that color khaki to the rebs it was butternut one of those confederate officers rode toward custer waving as he moved forward custer waved back come ahead the rebel captain proved to be a freshfaced fellow in his twenties he would have been wearing short pants during the war of secession seeing him made custer feel every one of his fortyone years good mornin to you colonel the captain drawled nodding in a way that looked friendly enough you werent planning on riding over the international border by any chance were you if i was youll never prove it captain custer tried for cool detachment what came out was a frustrated snarl by the way the confederate cavalryman smiled he heard that frustrationheard it and relished it he bowed in the saddle the rebs were always polite as cats and always ready to claw too im jethro weathers colonel he said and youre rightill never prove it but you and the united states would have been embarrassed if id come along half an hour later and found your men inside the territory of the confederate states he sounded disappointed he and his troopers hadnt caught custer in flagrante delicto custers frustration boiled into fury if your government would keep those murdering redskinned savages on your side of the border we wouldnt want to go over yonderhe waved south into indian territory and give em what they deserve why colonel captain weathers said amusement in his voice i have no proof at all those kiowas ever entered the territory of the united states as far as i can see you were leading an unprovoked punitive expedition into a foreign country richmond would see things the same way im sure so would london so would paris tom custer spoke up theres a dead kiowa maybe half a mile north of here that didnt faze weathers a bit for all i know youve already been into the confederate states murdered the poor fellow and then hauled him back into the usa to justify raiding confederate soil a flush spread up custers face his ears went hot at the sheer effrontery of that youdashed rebs will pay one day for giving the redskins guns and letting them come up and raid white mens farms whenever it strikes their fancy this is our territory colonel captain weathers said amused no more we shall defend it against the incursion of a foreign powerby which i mean the united states and you have no call none sir none whateverto get up on your high horse and tell me what my country ought and ought not to be doing especially since the united states harbor swarms of comanches in new mexico and turn them loose against west texas whenever it strikes your fancy we didnt start that until those outrages in kansas grew too oppressive to ignore custer answered why on this very raidthis raid you have the gall to denythe savages made two white women minister to their animal lusts then cut their throats and worked other dreadful indignities upon their bare and abused bodies you think the comanches dont do that in texas captain weathers returned and the way i heard it colonel they started doing it there first custer scowled we killed off the buffalo to deny the kiowas a livelihood and you gave them cattle to take up the slack the comanches are herding cattle these days too weathers made as if to go back to his troopers who waited inside confederate territory i see no point to continuing this discussion good day sir wait custer said and the confederate captain polite still waited breathing heavily custer went on when our two nations separated i had a great deal of sympathy and friendship for many of the men who found high rank in the army of the confederate states i hoped and believed that even though we were two we could share this continent in peace and so we have jethro weathers said there is no war between my country and yours colonel not now custer agreed not yet but you will force one upon us if you continue with this arrogant policy of yours here in the west the irritations will grow too great and then dont speak to me of arrogance weathers broke in dont speak to me of irritation not when you yankees have finally gone and put another one of those goddamned black republicans in the white house blaines only been in office a month but hes already shown hes not nearly so bad as lincoln was custer answered and hes not your business anyhow any more than longstreets ours blaine talks big the confederate captain answered people who talk big get to thinking they can act big you talked about war colonel if your james g blaine thinks you yankees can lick us now when you couldnt do it twenty years ago hed better think twice and if you think you can ride over the line into indian territory whenever it strikes your fancy youd better think twice too colonel when weathers moved to ride back to his squadron this time custer said not a word he stared after the indians whom weathers timely arrival had saved his right hand folded into a fist inside its leather gauntlet he pounded it down on his thigh hard once twice three times his lips shaped a silent word it might have been dash it might not as the train rattled west through the darkness over the colorado prairie the porter came down the aisle of the pullman car make you bed up sir he asked in english with some foreign accent russian maybe or yiddish abraham lincoln looked up from the speech hed been writing slowly deliberately he capped his pen and put it in his pocket yes thank you he said he rose slowly and deliberately too but his lumbago gave a twinge even so as best he could he ignored the pain it came with being an old man moving with swift efficiency the porter let down the hinged seat back laid a mattress on the bed thus created and made it up in the blink of an eye here you are sir he said drawing the curtain around the berth to give lincoln the chance to change into his nightshirt in something close to privacy i thank you lincoln said and tipped him a dime the porter pocketed it with a polite word of thanks and went on to prepare the next berth looking down at the bed lincoln let out a rueful chuckle the pullman attendant had been too efficient lincoln bent down and undid the sheet and blanket at the foot of the mattress pullman berths werent made for men of his inches he put on his nightclothes got into bed and turned off the gas lamp by which he had been writing the rattling jouncing ride and the thin lumpy mattress bothered him only a little he was used to them and he remembered worse when hed gone from illinois to washington after being elected president pullmans hadnt been invented hed traveled the whole way sitting upright in a hard seat and when four years later the voters had turned him out of office for failing to hold the union together hed gone back to illinois the same way ridden out of town on the rails he thought and laughed a little he twisted trying to find a position somewhere close to comfortable if a spring didnt dig into the small of his back another one poked him in the shoulder that was how life worked if you gained somewhere you lost somewhere else he twisted again therethat was better hed had a lot of experience on the railroads these sixteen years since failing of reelection once you get the taste for politics he murmured in the darkness everything else is tame hed thought he would quietly return to the law career hed left to go to the white house and so he had for a little while but the appetite for struggle at the highest level hed got in washington had stayed with him afterwards legal briefs and pleadings werent enough to satisfy he yawned then grimaced the way the democrats had fawned on the southern confederacy grated on him too and so hed started speechifying all across the country doing what he could to make people see that even if the war was lost the struggle continued i always was good on the stump he muttered i even did some good i daresay some good the united states had eventually emancipated the thousands of slaves still living within their borders the confederate states held their millions in bondage to this day and a lot of republicans nowadays sounded more and more like democrats in their efforts to put the partys sorry past behind them and get themselves elected a lot of republicans these days didnt want the albatross of lincoln around their necks he yawned again twisted one more time and fell asleep only to be rudely awakened half an hour later when the train hissed and screeched to a stop at some tiny prairie town he was used to that too even if he couldnt do anything about it before long he was asleep once more he woke again some time in the middle of the night this time he swung down out of his berth once a man got past his biblical threescoreandten his flesh reminded him of its imperfections more often than it had in his younger days sliding the curtain aside he walked down the aisle of the sleeper car past the snores and grunts coming from behind other curtains to the washroom at the far end of the car he used the necessary then pumped the handle of the tin sink to get himself a glass of water he drank it down wiped his chin on the sleeve of his nightshirt and set the glass by the sink for the next man who would want it up the aisle he came someone was getting down from an upper berth and almost stepped on his toes careful friend lincoln said quietly the mans face went through two separate stages of surprise first that he hadnt seen anyone nearby and then at whose feet hed almost abused damned old black republican fool he said also in a nearwhisper he was polite to his fellow passengers if not to the former president without giving lincoln a chance to reply he stalked down the aisle lincoln shrugged and finished the short journey back to his own berth that sort of thing happened to him at least once on every train he took had he let it bother him he would have had to give up politics and become as much a hermit as robinson crusoe he got back into bed the upper berth above his was empty he sighed as he struggled for comfort again mary had been difficult all the years of their marriage and especially in the years since hed left the white house but he missed her all the same hed got over the typhoid theyd caught in st louis four or five years before she hadnt the next thing he knew daylight was stealing through the curtains his back ached a little but hed had a pretty good nightbetter than most he spent rolling from one town to the next that was certain he got dressed used the necessary again and was back in his berth when the day porter came by and the top o the mornin to you sir he said lincoln had no trouble placing his accent will you be wanting a proper seat the now stead o your bedding and all that i will a natural mimic lincoln needed an effort of will not to copy the porters brogue after he tipped the fellow he asked how much longer until we get into denver nobbut another two three hours the porter answered lincoln sighed he was supposed to have arrived at sunrise not midmorning well no doubt the people waiting for him knew of the distant relationship between scheduled and actual arrival times time enough for breakfast then he said indeed and there is sir and to spare the porter agreed lincoln went back to the dining car he did appreciate the bellows arrangements the railroads were using between carriages these days going from car to car on a jolting train had been a dangerous business even a handful of years before more than a few people had slipped and fallen to their death and a cinder in the eye or a face full of soot was only to be expected after ham and eggs and rolls and coffee the world looked a more cheerful place he was leaving behind the prairie now going up toward the mountains the locomotive laboured over the upgrades and then as if relieved sped down the other side of each rise watching trees and boulders flying past was exhilarating even if lincoln knew how many accidents happened on such downgrades at last nearer three hours late than two the train pulled into denver the depot was small and dilapidated a broad stretch of empty ground on the other side of the tracks would lincoln had heard be a fancy new station one day at the moment and for the foreseeable future it was just empty ground wildflowers and weeds splashed it with color denver the conductor shouted as he had for every hamlet along the way to the biggest city in the heart of the west all out for denver lincoln put his speech in a leather valise got up grabbed his bulky carpetbag and made his way out of the pullman car after a couple of days on the train solid ground felt shaky under his feet as it was said to do for sailors just off their ships he set his stovepipe firmly on his head and looked around amid the usual scenes on a railwaystation platformfamilies greeting loved ones with cries of joy bankers greeting capitalists with louder if perhaps less sincere cries of joylincoln spotted a couple of rugged fellows who had the look of miners dressed up in their best and probably only suits even before they started moving purposefully through the crowd toward him he had them pegged for the men he was to meet mr mcmahan and mr cavanaugh i presume he said setting down the carpetbag so he could extend his right hand thats right mr lincoln said one of them who wore a gingercolored mustache im joe mcmahan you can call cavanaugh here fred his grip was hard and firm long as you dont call me late to supper cavanaugh said agreeably he was a couple of inches taller than mcmahan with a scar on his chin that looked as if it had come from a knife fight both men were altogether unselfconscious about the revolvers on their right hips lincoln had been in the west a good many times and was used to that come on sir mcmahan said here let me take that he picked up the carpetbag well get you to the hotel let you freshen up some and get yourself a tad more shuteye too if thats what you want these here trains theyre all very fine but a body cant hardly sleep on em theyre better than they used to be lincoln said i was thinking that last night when the porter made up my berth but youre righttheyre not all they might be come on then mcmahan repeated amos has the buggy waiting for us as they walked out of the station they passed a beggar a middleaged fellow with a graystreaked beard who had both legs gone above the knee lincoln fumbled in his pockets till he found a quarter which he tossed into the tin cup on the floor beside the man i thank you for your kind the beggar began in a singsong way then his eyeseyes that had seen a lot of pain and by the rheumy look in them a lot of whiskey toowidened as he recognized his benefactor he reached into the cup took out the quarter and threw it at lincoln it hit him in the chest and fell to the ground with a clink god damn you you son of a bitch i dont want any charity from you the legless man snarled wasnt for you id be up and walking not living out my days like this fred cavanaugh took lincoln by the arm and hurried him along dont take no notice of teddy there he said the beggars curses following them he gets some popskull in him he dont know what the hell hes talkin about oh he knows well enough lincoln s mouth was a tight hard line ive heard that tune before many times the men who suffered so much in the war of secession blame me for it they have the right i think i blame myself too though thats little enough consolation for them amos the buggy driver was cut from the same mold as cavanaugh and mcmahan the horses clopped up the street mud kicked up from their hooves and the wheels of the buggy for all the wealth that had come out of the mines nearby denver boasted not a single paved road streams of water ran in the gutters trees shaded the residential blocks most of the housesand the public buildings toowere of either bright red brick or the local yellow stone which gave the town a pleasingly colorful look miners in collarless shirts and bluedyed dungarees mingled on the streets with businessmen who would not have been out of place in chicago or new york no after a moment lincoln revised that opinion some of the businessmen went armed too when he remarked on that joe mcmahans mouth twisted in bitterness a man has moren what he deserves and dont see fit to share it with his pals who aint got so much mr lincoln hes a fool if he dont reckon theyre liable to try and equalize the wealth whether he likes it or not true enough lincoln said so true it may tear our country apart again one day slave labour comes in more forms than that which still persists in the confederate states amos shifted a wad of tobacco into his cheek spat and said damn straight it does thats why we brung you out hereto talk about that i know lincoln went back to watching the street scenes miner merchant bankeryou could tell so much about a mans class and wealth by how he dressed women were sometimes harder to gauge who was poor and who was not gave him no trouble but if a woman dressed as if shed come from the pages of leslies illustrated weekly but painted her face like a strumpet was she a strumpet or the wife of some newly rich mining nabob in denver that was less obvious than it would have been farther east where cosmetics were prima facie evidence a woman was fast the rules were different here and no wonder for a woman could goand several had gonestraight from strumpet to nabobs wife in its ornate pretentiousness the hotel metropole matched anything anywhere in the country here you go mr lincoln fred cavanaugh said youll be right comfortable here get yourself all good and ready for your speech tonight youd best believe a lot of folks want to hear what youve got to say about labour nowadays hear me they shall lincoln said what they do if they hear where im staying though may be something else again are they not liable to take me for one of the exploiters over whom they are concerned mr lincoln you wont find anybody in colorado got a thing to say against living soft cavanaugh answered what riles folks is grinding other mens noses in the dirt to let a few live soft i understand the distinction lincoln said as you remind me the essential point is that so many in the united states like virtually all the whites in the confederacy do not the hotel metropole met every reasonable standard for soft living and most of the unreasonable ones as well after a hot bath in a galvanized tub at the end of the hall after a couple of fried pork chops for lunch lincoln would have been happy enough to stretch out on the bed for a couple of hours even if he would have had to sleep diagonally to keep from kicking the footboard but the speech came first he was still polishing it having altogether forgotten about supper when joe mcmahan knocked on the door come on mr lincoln he said weve got ourselves a full house for you tonight the hall was not so elegant as the opera house near the hotel metropole it was in fact a dance hall with a podium hastily plunked by one wall but as mcmahan had said it was packed from long practice guessing crowds lincoln figured more than a thousand menminers and refinery workers most of them and farmers with here and there a shopkeeper to leaven the mixstood shouldertoshoulder elbowtoelbow to hear what he had to say they cheered loud and long when mcmahan introduced him most of them were young young men thought of him as labours friend in a land where capital was king older men like the beggar in the railway depot still damned him for fighting and most of all for losing the war of secession id have been a hero if i won he thought and id have been a housewife or more likely a homely old maid if id been born a woman so what he put on his spectacles and glanced down at the notes hed written on the train and in the hotel a generation ago he began i said a house divided against itself half slave and half free could not stand and it did not stand though its breaking was not in the manner i should have desired he never made any bones about the past it was there everyone knew it the confederate states continue all slave to this day he said how the financiers in london and paris smile on their plantations their railroads their ironworks how capital floods into their land and how much of it my friends how much drips down from the eaves of the rich mens mansions to water the shacks where the negroes live scarcely better off than the brute beasts beside which they labour in the fields you know the answer as well as i to hell with the damn niggers somebody called from the audience talk about the white man cries of agreement rose lincoln held up a hand i am talking about the white man he said you cannot part nor separate the two not in the southern confederacy for if the white labourer there dare go to his boss and speak the truth which is that he has not got enough to live on the boss will tell him live on it and like it or ill put a negro in your place and you can learn to live on nothing and what of our united states which were if nothing else left all free when the rebels departed from the union lincoln went on are weare youall free now do wedo youenjoy the great and glorious blessings of liberty the founding fathers fondly imagined would be the birthright of every citizen of our republic or are we returning to the unhappy condition in which we found ourselves in the years before the war of secession do not our capitalists in new york in chicago yes and in denver look longingly at their confederate brethren in richmond in atlanta in new and brawling birmingham and wish they could do as do those brethren are we not once more becoming a nation half slave half free my friends does not the capitalist eat bread gained by the sweat of your brows as the slavemaster does by virtueand theres a word turned on its earof the labour of his negroes lincoln had to stop then for the shouts that rose up were fierce and angry you know your state your condition he continued when he could you know i tell you nothing but the truth time was in this country when a man would be hired labour one year his own man the next and hiring labourers to work for him the year after that such days i fear are over and done on the railroads in the mines in the factories one mans a magnate and the rest toil for him if you go to your boss and tell him you have not got enough to live on the boss will tell you live on it and like it or ill put a chinaman or an italian or a jew in your place and you can learn to live on nothing a low murmur came from his audience more frightening in its way than the fury they had shown before fury didnt last now lincoln was making them think thought was slower than anger to flower into action but it was a hardy perennial it did not bloom and die what do we do about it abe shouted a miner still grimy from his long day of labour far below ground what do we do lincoln repeated the democrats had their day and a long day it was from my time up until president blaines inauguration last month did they do a thing a single solitary thing to help the lot of the working man he smiled at the cries of no before going on and blaine too though the good lord knows i wish him well has railroad money in his pockets how much labour can hope for from him i do not know but i know this my friends when the united states were a house divided before they were divided and did divide along lines of geography no such choice avails us now the capitalists cannot secede as the slavemasters did if we are not satisfied with our government and the way it treats its citizens we have the revolutionary right and duty to overthrow it and substitute one that suits us better as our forefathers did in the days of george iii that brought a storm of applause men stomped on the floor so that it shook under lincoln s feet someone fired a pistol in the air deafeningly loud in the closed hall lincoln held up both hands slowly slowly quiet crawled back into it he said i do not advocate revolution i pray it shall not be necessary but if the old order will not yield to justice it shall be swept aside i do not threaten any more than a man who says he sees a tornado coming folks can take shelter from it or they can run out and play in it that is up to them you friends you are a tornado what happens next is up to the capitalists he stepped away from the podium joe mcmahan pumped his hand that was powerful stuff mr lincoln he said powerful stuff yes indeed for which i thank you lincoln said raising his voice to be heard through the storm of noise that went on and on ask you something mr lincoln mcmahan said lincoln nodded mcmahan leaned closer so only the former president would hear you ever come across the writings of a fellow named marx mr lincoln karl marx lincoln smiled as a matter of fact i have sam clay herndon spoke sharply sam youre woolgathering again the devil i am samuel clemens replied though his friends comment did return his attention to the cramped office of the san francisco morning call i was trying to come up with something for tomorrows editorial and im dry as the desert between the great salt lake and virginia city i hate writing editorials do you know that you have mentioned it a time or two now herndons voice was sly that suited the reporters face he looked as if he had a fox for his maternal grandmother his features were sharp and clever his green eyes studied everything and respected nothing and his rusty hair only added to the impression grinning he sank his barb or a hundred times or two still true clemens snapped running a hand through his own unruly mop of redbrown hair do you have any notion of the strain on a mans constitution having to come up with so many column inches every day on demandand always something new regardless of whether theres anything new to write about if i had my tennessee lands herndon rolled his eyes for gods sake sam give me the lecture on editorials if you must but spare me the tennessee lands theyre stale as salt beef shipped round the horn youre a scoffer thats what you arenothing but a scoffer clemens said half amused but still half annoyed too forty thousand acres of fine land with god only knows how much timber and coal and iron and maybe gold and silver too and all of it in my family its in another country these days clay herndon reminded him the confederate states have been a going concern for a long time now yes a long time ago and in another countryand besides the wench is dead clemens said scratching his mustache herndon gave him a quizzical look however clever the reporter was he wouldnt have known marlowe from a marlinspike the way you do go on he said lets us go on over to martins and get some dinner now youre talking clemens rose from his chair with enthusiasm and stuck his hat on his head any excuse not to work is good enough for me werent for thishe patted the battered copy of the american cyclopedia on his desk with a touch as tender as a lovers for his belovedi dont know how id ever manage to come out for something or against something every day of the year as if any man needs so blamed many opinions or has any business holding them wasting my sweetness on the morning air thats what im doing herndon pulled out his pocket watch as of right now youre wasting your sweetness on the afternoon air and you have been for the past ten minutes now lets get moving before we cant find a place to sit down at martins clemens followed his friend out onto the street it was an april midday in san francisco not too warm not too cold the sun shining down from a clear but hazy sky it might as easily have been august or november or february to clemens who had grown up with real seasons always seeming not far from spring remained strange after almost twenty years when he remarked on that herndon snorted you dont like it go down to fresno its always july there and a desert july at that with a lamb chop fried potatoes and a shot of whiskey in front of sam clemens life improved he knocked back the shot and ordered another when it came he knocked it back too with the sour toast heres to hard work every day clay herndon snorted again ive heard that one almost as often as the tennessee lands sam what the devil would you be doing if you werent running the morning calll damned if i know clemens answered writing stories maybe and broke but who has time when the big panic of hit after we lost the war and hung on and on and on the whole world turned upside down i was damn lucky to have any sort of position and i knew it so i hung on like a limpet on a harbor rock if i ever get ahead of the game he laughed about as likely as the mormons giving up their extra wives i expect herndon had a couple of shots of whiskey in him too suppose you werent a newspaperman what would you do then ive tried miningi was almost rich once which is every bit as fine as almost being in loveand i was a mississippi river pilot if i wanted to take that up again id have to take confederate citizenship with it why not herndon said then you could have yourself another go at those tennessee lands no thank you briefly clemens had served in a confederate regiment operatingor rather bunglingin missouri which remained one of the united states not least because most confederate troops there had been similarly inept he didnt admit to that few in the usa who had ever had anything to do with the other side admitted it these days after a moment he went on their record isnt what youd call goodmore like what youd call a skunk at a picnic herndon laughed you do come up with em sam got to hand it to you maybe you ought to try writing yourself a book after all people would buy it i expect maybe clemens said which meant no dont see a lot of authors living off the fat of the land do you besides it may have taken me a while to cipher out what steady work was about but ive got it down solid now i lived on promises when i was a miner i was a boy then pretty much im not a boy any more all right all right herndon held up a placatory hand he looked at his plate as if astonished the beefsteak hed ordered had disappeared his shot glass was empty too you want one more for the road not if i intend to get any work done this afternoon you want to listen to me snore at my desk thats another matter clemens got to his feet he set a quarter and a small shiny gold dollar on the table herndon laid down a dollar and a half they left martinsa splendid place for anyone who could afford to eat thereand walked back to the morning call office edgar leary one of the junior reporters waved a flimsy sheet of telegraph paper in their faces when they got in he was almost hopping with excitement look at this look at this he had crumbs in his sparse black beard he brought his dinner to the morning call in a sack didnt come in five minutes ago or im a chinaman if youll stop fanning me with it i will have a look clemens said when leary still waved the wire around sam snatched it out of his hand give me that dammit he turned it right side up and read it the more he read the higher his bushy eyebrows climbed once hed finished he passed it to clay herndon saying looks like ive got something for the editorial after all herndon quickly skimmed the telegraphic report his lips shaped a soundless whistle this here is more than something to feed you an editorial sam this here could be trouble dont i know it clemens said but i cant do the first thing about the trouble and i can do something about the editorial so ill do that and ill let the rest of the world get into trouble you ever notice how its real good about taking care of that whether anybody wants it to or not he pulled a cigar from a waistcoat pocket bit off the end scraped a match against the sole of his shoe lighted the cigar and tossed the match into a shiny brass cuspidor stained here and there with errant expectorations then he went over to his desk and pulled out the george f cram atlas of the world he flipped through it till he found the page he needed his finger traced a line herndon and leary were looking over his shoulder one to the right the other to the left herndon whistled again this is going to be big trouble he said bigger than i thought thats a fact clemens slammed the atlas closed with a noise like a rifle shot behind him edgar leary jumped hell of a big mess he spoke with somber anticipation but i dont have to worry about what im going to write this afternoon so im as happy as peeping tom in honolulu if half of what they say about the sandwich islands is true he inked a pen and began to write if the wires are not liarsand of course experience has made us all familiar with messrs western and unions solemn vow that only the truth shall be permitted to pass over their telegraphic lines and with the vigilance with which they guard them from every falsehood of course experience has done such a thing we say for under our grand and glorious constitution anyone may say what he pleasesif this is so then it seems that his mexican majesty maximilian has been persuaded to sell his northwestern provinces of chihuahua and sonora to the confederate states for the sum of three millions of dollars this is remarkable news on several counts which is how lawyers speak of indictments first and foremost superficially is the feeling of astonishment arising in the bosoms of those who are familiar in the least with the aforesaid provinces at learning that anyone save possibly old scratch in contemplation of expanding the infernal regions due to present overcrowding should want to purchase them at any price let alone for such a munificent sum but as the fellow said after sitting on a needle there is more to this than meets the eye consider friends mexicos principal export aside from the mexicans whose charm pervades our golden state is not to put too fine a point on itthat being the needles business after alldebt she owes money to britain she owes money to france she owes money to germany she owes money to russiano mean feat thatand she is prevented from owing money to the kingdom of poland only by that kingdoms extinction before she was born being a weak country in debt to a strong oneor to a slew of strong onesis in these enlightened times the quickest recipe known for making gunboats flock like buzzards to ones shores as the turkish khedives will assure maximilian if only he will ask them time was when the united states held up the monroe doctrine to shield the americas from european monarchs bill collectors and other riffraff but the doctrine these days is as dead as its maker shot through the heart in the war of secession so the empire of mexico needs cash on hand if it is to go on being the empire of mexico or at least the abridged edition thereof thus from maximilians point of view the sale of chihuahua and sonora makes a deal of sense but he is apparently going ahead and doing it anyhow the question remaining before the house is why the confederate states would want to buy the two provinces no matter how avidly he might want to sell them owning texas the confederacy would already seem to have in its possession a sufficiencyindeed even an oversupplyof hot worthless land for the next hundred years sonora though has one virtue texas lacksnot that having a virtue texas lacks is in itself any great marvelit touches on the gulf of california while chihuahua connects it to the rest of the csa with these new acquisitions the confederate states would extend like the usa from sea to shining sea and even more to the point run a railroad from the same to the shining same is that worth three millions of dollars pete longstreet seems to think so yet to be seen is how the new administration in washington will view this transaction there can be no doubt that any of the previous governmentsif by that the reader will forgive our stretching a pointwould do no more than passively acquiesce to the sale in much the same manner as the bull acquiesces to the knife that makes him into a steer richmond london paris and ottawa form a formidable stall in which the united states are held but will james g blaine having been elected on a platform that consisted largely of snorting and pawing the ground now have to show the world it was nothing but humbug and hokum even if it was humbug and hokum will he dare admit it knowing that if he should confess to weakness even weakness genuinely and manifestly in existence he will become a laughingstock and an object of contempt not only in foreign capitals but in the eyes of the exasperated millions who sent him to the white house to make america strong and proud again and will with equal avidity send him home with a tin can tie io his tail if he bollixes the job our view of the matter is that caution is likelier to be necessary than to be while our hope is that for once our wellknown editorial omniscience is found wanting sighing clemens set down the pen and shook his wrist to get the cramp out of it i want to buy me one of those typewriting machines theyre starting to sell he said good idea clay herndon said they cant weigh much more than a hundred pounds just the thing to take along to listen to the mayor or to cover a fire thatd be even better theyre the coming thing so you can laugh all you like clemens told him besides if i had one the compositors would be able to read the copy i give em now youre talkingthats a whole different business herndon got up from his desk and ambled over to sam i never have any troublewell never muchreading your writing you were really scratching away there what did you come up with wordlessly clemens passed him the sheets herndon had a lot of political savvy or maybe just a keen eye for where the bodies were buriedassuming those two didnt amount to the same thing if he was thinking along the same lines as clemens he didnt say anything till he was through then with a slow nod he handed the editorial back thats strong stuff he said but youre spot on when i first saw the wire i thought about the ports on the pacific but i didnt worry about the railroad the rebsll need to do anything with the ports they get what about blaine sam asked im with you there too herndon answered if he lies down for this nobody will take him seriously afterwards but im damned if i know how much he can do to stop it what do you thinks going to happen sam me clemens said i think theres going to be a war general thomas jackson left his war department office in mechanics hall mounted his horse and rode east past capitol square toward the presidents residence on shockoe hill some from his generation still thought of it as the confederate white house though younger men tried to forget the csa had ever been connected to the usa richmond brawled around him coaches clattered over cobblestones negro footmen in fancy livery standing stiff as statues at their rear teamsters driving wagons filled with grain or iron or tobacco or cotton cursed the men who drove the coaches for refusing to yield the right of way on the sidewalk lawyers and sawyers and ladies with slaves holding parasols to shield their delicate complexions from the springtime sun danced an elabourate minuet of precedence a middleaged fellow who walked with a limp tipped his homburg in jackson s direction and called out stonewall jackson gravely returned the salutation it rang out again shortly thereafter again he touched a hand to the brim of his own hat somber pride filled him not only his peers but also the common people remembered and appreciated what hed done in the war of secession in a world where memory was fleeting and gratitude even more so that was no small thing an iron fence surrounded the grounds of the presidential mansion at the gateway guards in the fancy new butternut uniforms stiffened to attention general jackson sir they exclaimed in unison their salutes were as identical as if theyd been manufactured in succession at the same stamping mill conscientiously jackson returned the salutes no doubt the guards were good soldiers and would fight bravely if the need ever came when he measured them against the scrawny wildcats hed led during the war of secession though he found them wanting he was honest enough to wonder whether the fault lay in them or in himself hed turned fiftyseven earlier in the year and the past had a way of looking better and the present worse the older he got he rode up to the entrance to the presidents home a couple of slaves hurried forward one of them held his horses head while he dismounted then tied the animal to a castiron hitching post in front of the building jackson tossed him a fivecent piece the slave caught the tiny silver coin out of the air with a word of thanks tied close by was the twohorse team of a landau with which he was not familiar the driver a white man sat in the carriage reading a newspaper and waiting for his master to emerge that he was white gave jackson a clue about who his passenger might be especially when coupled with the unfamiliar carriage and sure enough out of the presidents residence came john hay looking stylish if a little funereal in a black sack suit the new minister from the united states was a strikingly handsome man of about fifty his brown hair and beard frosted with gray his nod was stiff tightly controlled good day general he said voice polite but frosty your excellency jackson said in much the same tones as a young man hay had served as abe lincolns secretary that in itself made him an object of suspicion in the confederate states but it also made him one of the few republicans with any executive experience whatever jackson hoped the latter was the reason us president blaine had appointed him minister to the csa if not the appointment came perilously close to an insult hay had bushy expressive eyebrows they twitched now he said i should not be surprised general jackson if we were seeing president longstreet on the same business oh what business is that jackson thought hay likely right but had no intention of showing it the less the enemyand anyone in richmond who did not think the united states an enemy was a foolknew the better you know perfectly well what business hay returned now with a touch of asperity the business of chihuahua and sonora he was of course correct an enemy he might be and a black republican synonymous terms as far as the confederacy was concerned but not a fool jackson said i cannot sec how a private transaction between the empire of mexico and the confederate states of america becomes a matter about which the united states need concern themselves dont be disingenuous hay said sharply president longstreet spent the last two hours softsoaping me and im tired of it if you dont see how adding several hundred miles to our common border concerns us sir then you dont deserve those wreathed stars on your collar giving jackson no chance to reply he climbed up into the landau the negro who had helped the confederate general undid the horses the driver set down his paper and flicked the reins iron tires clattering the wagon rolled away jackson did not turn his head to watch it go diplomacy was not his concern not directly he dealt only with its failures back straight stride steady he walked up the stairs into the presidential mansion g moxley sorrel longstreets chief of staff greeted him just inside the door good morning general jackson he said his tone almost as wary as hays had been good morning jackson tried to keep all expression from his own voice the president will see you in a moment sorrel put what jackson reckoned undue stress on the second word the chief of staff had served longstreet since the early days of the war of secession and had served through the time when longstreet and jackson as corps commanders under lee were to some degree rivals as well as comrades over the years jackson had seen that longstreet never forgot a rivalryand what longstreet remembered moxley sorrel remembered too having little small talk in him jackson simply stood silent till sorrel led him into president longstreets office mr president jackson said then saluting sit down general sit down please james longstreet waved him into an overstuffed armchair upholstered in flowered maroon velvet despite the soft cushions jackson sat as rigidly erect as if on a stool longstreet was used to that and did not remark on it he did ask shall i have a nigger fetch you some coffee no thank you sir as was his way jackson came straight to the point i met mr hay as i was arriving here if his manner be of any moment the united states will take a hard line toward our new mexican acquisitions i believe you are correct in that longstreet answered he scratched his chin his saltandpepper beard spilled halfway down his chest he was a few years older than jackson though he had put on more flesh than the generalinchief of the confederate states he also remained strong and vigorous the black republicans continue to resent us merely for existing that we thrive is a burr under their tails wish tilden had been reelectedhe would have raised no unseemly fuss but the world is as we find it not as we wish it the world is as god wills jackson declared what was to him obvious of coursebut understanding his will is our province longstreet said that could have been contradiction in the guise of agreement at which the president was adept before jackson could be sure longstreet went on and chihuahua and sonora are our provinces by god and by god we shall keep them whether the united states approve or not very good mr president having no compromise in his own soul jackson admired steadfastness in others i have also sent communications to this effect to our friends in london and paris longstreet said that was excellently done i am sure jackson said their assistance was welcome during the war of secession and i trust they shall be as eager to see the united states taken down a peg now as they were then general their assistance during the war was more than merely necessary longstreet said heavily it was the sine qua non without which the confederate states should not be a free and independent republic today jackson frowned i dont know about that your excellency i am of the opinion that the army of northern virginia had a certain small something to do with that independence he paused a moment a tableau vivant of animated thought the battle of camp hill for some reason comes to mind longstreet smiled at jackson s seldomshown playfulness camp hill was necessary general necessary but i believe not sufficient without the brave work our soldiers did england and france should never have been in position to recognize our independence and force acceptance of that independence on the lincoln regime which is what i said is it not jackson rumbled but the president of the csa shook his head no not quite you will remember sir i had rather more to do with the military commissioners of the united states than did you as we hammered out the terms under which each side should withdraw from the territory of the other yes i remember that jackson said i never claimed to be any sort of diplomatist and general lee was not one to assign a man to a place in which he did not fit jackson saw that as a small barb aimed at longstreet who was so slippery he might have ended up a black republican had he lived in the united states rather than the confederacy being slippery though longstreet probably took it as a compliment jackson asked the next question what of it sir this of it every last yankee officer with whom i spoke swore up and down on a stack of bibles as tall as he was that lincoln never would have given up the fight if hed only been fighting against us longstreet said the man was a fanaticstill is a fanatic going up and down in the usa like satan in the book of job stirring up trouble wherever he travels the only thing that convinced him the united states were lickedthe only thing generalwas the intervention of england and france on our behalf absent that he aimed to keep on no matter what we did he would have done better had he had generals as convinced of the righteousness of his cause as he was himself jackson remarked as well for us he did not as well for us indeed longstreet nodded his big leonine head that however is not the point the point is that the english and french by virtue of the service they rendered us and by virtue of the services they may render us in the future have a strong and definite claim upon our attention wait jackson had not lied when he said he was no diplomat he needed a while to fathom matters that were immediately obvious to a man like longstreet but as in his days of teaching optics acoustics and astronomy at the virginia military institute unrelenting study let him work out what he did not grasp at once you are saying your excellency are you not that we are still beholden to our allies and must take their wishes into account in formulating our policy yes i am saying that i wish i werent but i am longstreet replied jackson started to say something the president held up a hand to stop him now you wait sir until you have answered this question does the prospect of taking on the united states over the mexican provinces alone and unaided have any great appeal to you it could be done jackson said at once i do not deny that for an instant but it is not the question i put to you longstreet said what i asked was has the prospect any great appeal to you would you sooner we war against the usa by ourselves or in the company of two leading european powers the latter certainly jackson admitted the united states have always outweighed us we have more men and far more factories now than i ever dreamt we should but they continue to outweigh us if ever they found leaders and morale to match their resources they would become a formidable foe this is also my view of the situation longstreet drummed his fingers on the desk in front of him and blainc like lincoln has no sense of moderation when it comes to our country if he so chooses as i think he may he can whip them up into a frenzy against us in short order this concerns me what also concerns me is the price london and paris have put on a renewal of their alliance with us the necessity for weighing one of those concerns against the other is the reason i asked to see you here today a price for continued friendship what price could the british and french require for doing what is obviously in their interest anyhow by asking the question he proved his want of diplomacy to longstreet and a moment later to himself oh he said they intend to try to lever us into abandoning our peculiar institution there you have it sure enough longstreet agreed both the british and french ministers make it abundantly clear that their governments shall not aid us in any prospective struggle against the united states unless we agree in advance to undertake emancipation no later than a year after the end of hostilities they are acting in concert on this matter and appear firmly determined to follow their words with deeds or rather with the lack of deeds we should otherwise expect let them jackson growled as angry as if britain and france were enemies not the best friends the confederate states had let them well whip the yankees and after that well do whatever else needs doing too i assure you general i admire your spirit from the bottom of my heart longstreet said if we are assured of success in a conflict against the usa over chihuahua and sonora please tell me so and tell me plainly jackson hesitated and was lost in war your excellency especially war against a larger power nothing is assured as i said before i am confident however that god having given us this land of ours to do with as we will does not intend to withdraw his gift from our hands that i fear is not enough longstreet let out a long sigh you have no conception general to what degree slavery has become an albatross round our necks in all our intercourse diplomatic and commercial with foreign powers the explanations the difficulties the resentments grow worse year by year we and the empire of brazil are the only remaining slaveholding nations and even the brazilians have begun a program of gradual emancipation for the negroes they hold in servitude mr president if we are right what foreigners have to say about us matters not at all and i believe we are right jackson said stubbornly i believe as i have always believed that god himself ordained our system as the best one practicable for the relationship between the white and negro races changing it now at foreigners insistence would be as much a betrayal as changing it at the black republicans insistence twenty years ago i understand this perspective general and believe me i am personally in sympathy with it longstreet said when a politician which was what the president of the csa had long since become said he was personally in sympathy with something jackson had learned he meant the opposite and sure enough longstreet went on other considerations however compel me to take a broader view of the question what circumstances could possibly be more important than acting in accordance with gods will as we understand it jackson demanded being certain we do understand it longstreet answered if we fight the united states alone and are defeated is it not likely that the victors would seek to impose emancipation and even to the degree they can effect it negro dominance upon us to weaken us as much as possible jackson grunted he had never considered the aftermath of a confederate defeat victory was the only consideration that had ever crossed his mind reluctantly he gave president longstreet credit for subtlety longstreet said can we successfully fight the united states without their coasts being blockaded a task far beyond the power of our navy alone can we fight them without pressure from canada to make them divide their forces and efforts instead of concentrating solely against us if you tell me we are as certain or even nearly as certain of success without our friends as with them defying their wishes makes better sense i think as i have said we can win without them jackson said but he was too honest not to add with them though the odds improve my thought exactly longstreet said beaming jollying him toward acquiescence and if we emancipate the negro de jure of our own free will we shall surely be spared the difficulties that would ensue if as the result of some misfortune we were compelled to emancipate him de facto there was some truth perhaps a lot of truthin that jackson had to recognize it longstreet made him think of a fasttalking hoaxer selling florida seaside real estate under water twentytwo hours out of every twentyfour but the president had been elected to make decisions of this sort i am a soldier your excellency jackson said if this be your decision i shall of course conduct myself in conformity to it chapter t heodore roosevelt looked over his ranch with considerable satisfaction ranch was the western word of course borrowed from the spanish back in new york state it would have been a farm he sucked in a deep breath of the sweet pure air of montana territory like wine in the lungs he said no coal smoke no city stinks nothing but pure wholesome delicious oxygen hed been a scrawny weakling when he came out to the west a couple of years before an old man inside though hed scarcely passed his twentieth birthday now though older by the calendar he felt years decadesyounger inside strenuous labour that was the trick one of the hands a grizzled exminer who possessed but did not rejoice in the name of philander snow cocked an eyebrow at that oxywhat boss he asked oxygen phil roosevelt repeated oxygen what we breathe what makes lamps burn what without which life would be impossible i thought that was whiskey or maybe women depending snow said more women in the territory than there used to be and nowadays i cant do as much with em aint that the way it goes he spat a mournful stream of tobacco juice onto the ground roosevelt laughed but quickly sobered his education made him stick out in these parts he had trouble talking with his hands with his fellow ranchers and even with the townsfolk in helena about anything past superficialities sometimes he felt more nearly an exile than an emigrant from his old way of life the closest civilized conversation was down in cheyenne or maybe even denver but then philander snow remarked itll be lambing time any day now and thoughts of the work at hand replaced those having to do with combustion and metabolism off in the distance the sheep cropped the new spring grass the ranch had several hundred head and a couple of hundred cattle to go with them along with the fields of wheat and barley and the vegetable plot near the ranch house roosevelt produced all the food he needed and had a tidy surplus to sell selfsufficiency he declared every mans dreamand by jingo ive got it lord of the manor thats what i am aint nothin wrong with your manners boss snow said spitting again oh you was kind of fancified and dudish when you first got here i reckon but youve done settled in nice as you please for which i do thank you phil most sincerely as he had many times in the past roosevelt reflected that while both he and his hands used english they did not speak the same language this heres a nice spread you got snow said not so small you cant do all sorts of things with it not so big you got to have your own army before you can get any work done down in texas i hear tell they got ranches big as a whole county do nothin on em but raise cows pack of damn foolishness anybody wants to know another stream of brown landed wetly in the dust you get no arguments from me roosevelt looked south as if someone having mentioned texas he could see it from here do you know it broke my fathers heart when the united states lost the war of secession but id say were just as well rid of those rebels theyd bring their ways of doing thingseverything larger than life as you sayup here if we were still part of the same nation theyd bring their niggers too one more expectoration gave philander snows opinion of that far as im concerned the rebs are welcome to em this heres a white mans country nothin else but i agree with you once again roosevelt said the united states are better off without any great presence of the dusky race in our midst were it not for the negro i doubt we and our former compatriots should ever have come to blows likely tell us and the rebs wouldnt have fought a war neither snow observed roosevelt s metal framed spectacles and the mustache he was assiduously cultivating helped keep his face from showing what he thought after a moment the ranch hand went on and now it looks like were goin to fight them sons of bitches again and bully for blaine i say roosevelt clenched his fists lord knows i have no use for the republican party except in that it wants us to take a strong line with our neighbors but that these days is an enormous exception you damn straight it is boss philander snow said with a vehement nod them rebs they been rubbin our noses in the dirt since we lost the war and them easterners they just smile and take it and say thank you meek and mild as you please hope to jesus they get around to lettin montana into the union one day soon so as i can vote for people wholl show a little backbone not even a lot mind youa littled be plenty to make the rebels climb down off their high horse you ask me i think youre dead right phil but the confederates arent the only ones we have to worry about not here in montana theyre not where theodore roosevelt had looked south toward texas he now turned north here near helena were only a couple of hundred miles away from the canadian border ive met me some canucks snow said they aint the worst people youd ever want to know but canada aint free and independent not all the way it aint the limeys they do whatever they please there they certainly do roosevelt agreed and theyre able to do it too since their transcontinental railroad went through about the time i came to montana the only reason they had for building that railroadthe only reason i say philis to shuttle british soldiers along the frontier to those places where they might prove most advantageous and where theyll do the most good too snow said roosevelt smiled his hired hand had no idea what was funny he didnt explain he had no desire to make the older man feel foolish instead he came round to the other subject uppermost on his mind and now the confederates not content with battening on our weakness these past twenty years have sunk their fangs into the empire of mexico as well by what the papers were saying last time you went into town president blaine aint gonna take that layin down snow said hed better not if he does the whole country lies down with him he wasnt elected to play the coward which is what ive been saying resolution crystallized in roosevelt when he made up his mind he made it up in a hurry and all the way harness the team to the handbasket phil im going into town to find out what the latest news is if theres war sure as the sun comes up tomorrow well have hordes of redcoats pouring over the border by jingo i wish the telegraph line reached all the way out here i want to know whats going on out in the bigger world if philander snow cared about the wider world he concealed it very well he might have beenhe probably had beena rough character once but work on the farm and the occasional spree in helena satisfied him now give me just a few minutes boss and ill take care of it he spat and chuckled and spat again youre a hell of a funny fellow boss when you take it in your mind to be roosevelt went back into the ranch house for his winchester the ranch lay about ten miles north of helena in a little valley whose surrounding hills protected it from the worst of the winter blizzards he was more worried about bears than bandits or hostile indians but you never could tell he took a box of caliber cartridges along with the rifle snow brought the buggy out of the barn almost as quickly as hed promised here you go he said climbing down from the drivers bench so roosevelt could get aboard to helena handbasket he said and chuckled again you struck the mother lode when you came up with that one sure as hell glad you like it roosevelt liked it too he stowed the rifle where he could grab it in a hurry if he had to flicked the reins and got the horses going toward helena he reached the territorial capital a couple of hours later farms much like his own covered most of the flat land with stretches of forest between them here and there on the higher ground were shafts and timbers from mines hopeful prospectors had begun most of them were years abandoned most of the prospectors like philander snow were making their living in some different line of work these days helena sat in a valley of its own some of the log cabins of the earliest settlers those whod come just after the end of the war of secession still stood down near the bottom of the valley by the tributary of the prickly pear that had made people pause hereabouts in the first place newer finer homes climbed the hills to either side down on broadway as roosevelt drove the wagon toward the newspaper office he felt himself returned to a cosmopolitan city even if not to a sophisticated one here riding beside him was a bearded prospector leading a pack mule the fellow still hoped to strike it rich as did some of his comrades every once in a while those hopes came true mines near helena and newer ones by wickes to the south and marysville to the west had made millionairesbut only a handful a chinaman in a conical straw hat walked by carrying two crates hanging from a pole over his right shoulder roosevelt approved of chinese industriousness but wouldnt have minded seeing all the celestials gone from the west they dont fit in he thought too different from americans solomon katz ran a drugstore near the office of the helena gazette sam houlihan ran the hardware store next door and otto burmeister the bakery next to that among helena s ten or twelve thousand people there were members of every nation ever to set foot on the north american continent and trotting up the street on their ponies a couple of the original inhabitants of the continent came toward roosevelt one of the sioux wore the buckskin tunic and trousers traditional to his people the other blue denim trousers and a calico shirt idly roosevelt wondered what helenaa mediumsized town at best but a larger assemblage of people than their tribe had ever managedseemed like to them he shrugged in the larger scheme of things their opinion counted for very little as if to take their minds off the defeat the united states had suffered at the hands of the confederacy and also spurred by the sioux uprisings in minnesota the usa had thrown swarms of soldiers across the prairie subduing the aborigines by numbers and firepower even if not with any great military skill these days the indians could only stand and watch as the lands that had been theirs served the purposes of a stronger race roosevelt looked for the indians to head into one of the saloons sprouting like mushrooms along broadway instead they tied up their horses in front of houlihans establishment and went in there roosevelt s head bobbed up and down in approval indians who needed hammers or saw blades or a keg of nails were indians on the way to civilization hed heard the lords prayer had been translated into sioux which he also took for a good sign the gazette had a copy of the front page of the days edition displayed under glass in front of the office a small crowd of people stared at it roosevelt worked his way through the crowd till he could read the headlines rebel intransigence shouted one blaine takes firm line on confederate land grab said another england warns usa not to meddle declared a third england she has no right to make such a warning said one of the men in front of roosevelt he had a guttural accent warning came out varning roosevelt s big head nodded vehementlyeven a german immigrant could see the nose in front of his face he wondered if blaine would see it or back down spineless as the democrats whod run the country since lincoln was so unceremoniously shown the door after the war against secession turned out to be the war of secession by that second headline the president seemed to be doing what the people had elected him to do for which roosevelt thanked god behind roosevelt the crowd parted as if it were the red sea and moses had come but it wasnt moses it was a fiercelooking fellow with a bushy white mustache and chin beard who wore a bankers somber black suit mornin mr cruse a grocer said respectfully good day sir one of the men who worked at the livery stable added tipping his straw hat hows the boy tommy said a miner who matched cruse in years but not in affluence mornin to you all cruse said affable enough and to spare a few years earlier hed been poorer than the miner whod greeted him roosevelt doubted whether any bank in montana territory would have lent him more than fifty dollars but hed made his strike which was rare and hed sold it for every penny it was worth which was rarer these days he didnt need to borrow money from a bank for he owned one he was one of the handful of men throughout the west whod gone at a single bound from prospector to capitalist hed dealt squarely with people when he was poor and he kept on dealing squarely with them now that he was rich had he wanted to be territorial governor he could have been hed never given any sign of being interested in the job like everyone else roosevelt gave way for him it was a gesture of respect for the mans achievement not one of servility roosevelt had money of his own new york money infinitely older and infinitely more stable than that grubbed from the ground here in the wild territories good morning mr roosevelt cruse said nodding to him the selfmade millionaire respected those who gave him his due and no more good morning to you mr cruse roosevelt answered hoping he would be as vigorous as the exminer when he got old he pointed toward the front page of the helena gazette what do you think we ought to do sir about the confederates land grab let me see the latest before i answer unlike so many of his comrades thomas cruse would not leap blind he stood well back from the newspaper under glass studying the headlines the crowd of men who had also been reading them waited silent for his considered opinion once he was done he spoke with due deliberation i think we ought to continue on the course weve taken up till now i see no other we can choose my exact thought mr cruse roosevelt agreed enthusiastically but if the confederates and the britishand the french who prop up maximilianalso continue on their course then we lick em tom cruse said in a loud harsh voice the crowd in front of the newspaper office erupted in cheers theodore roosevelt joined them cruse could speak for all of montana territory the miner turned banker had certainly spoken for him general james ewell brown stuarts way had always been to lead from the front as commander of the confederate states department of the transmississippi he might have made his headquarters in houston or austin as several of his predecessors had done instead ever since being promoted to the position two years earlier hed based himself in the miserable village of el paso as far west as he could go while staying in the csa peering north and west along the rio grande swollen at the moment with spring runoff and very different from the sleepy stream it would be soonjeb stuart looked into the usa that proximity to the rival nation made el paso important as a confederate outpost and was the reason hed brought his headquarters hither but el paso had been a place of significance before an international border sprang up between texas and new mexico territory between csa and usa it and its sister town on the other side of the rio grande paso del norte had stood on opposite sides of the border first between mexico and the usa and then between mexico and the csa the pass the names of the two towns commemorated was one of the lowest and broadest through the rockies a gateway between east and west travelers had been using for centuries stuart looked across the rio grande to paso del norte not quite twenty years earlier the national border between texas and new mexico had gone up it would have gone up farther west and north but the confederate invasion of new mexico mounted without adequate manpower or supplies had failed now as soon as stuart got the telegram for which he was waiting the border on the rio grande would cease to be his aidedecamp a burly major named horatio sellers came walking up to the edge of the river to stand alongside him sweat streaked sellers ruddy face dust didnt scuff up under his boots as it would in a few weeks but the heat was already irksome and gave every promise of becoming appalling sellers peered across into what remained for the moment the territory of the empire of mexico paso del norte was larger than its confederate counterpart but no more prepossessing a couple of cathedrals reared above the mudbrick buildings that made up most of the town the flat roofs of those buildings made the place look as if the sun had pounded it down from greater prominence sellers said were giving maximilian three million in gold and silver for those two provinces three million sir you ask me we ought to get change back from fifty cents nobody asked you major stuart answered nobody asked me either that doesnt matter if were orderedwhen were orderedto take possession of the provinces for the confederacy thats what well do thats all we can do yes sir his aidedecamp answered resignedly look on the bright side stuart said weve got the yankees hopping around like fleas on a hot griddle thats worthwhile all by itself if you ask me he grinned of course longstreet didnt ask me any more than he asked you sellers remained gloomy which was in good accord with his nature two provinces full of desert and indians and mexicans and were supposed to turn them into confederate states sir itll be a lot of work i can tell you that christ negro servitude is illegal south of the border well if the border moves south our laws move with it stuart answered i expect well manage well enough there he chuckled ill bet stonewall wishes he were here instead of me he liked mexico when he fought there for the usa he even learned to speak spanish but hes stuck in richmond and thats about as far from el paso as you can be and still stay in the confederate states sir sellers persisted exactly as if jeb stuart could do something about the situation supposing we do annex sonora and chihuahua how the devil are we supposed to defend them from the usa new mexico territory and california have a lot longer stretch of border with em than texas does and the yankees have a railroad down there so they can ship in troops faster than we can hope to manage it what are we going to do whatever it takes and whatever we have to do stuart said though he recognized the answer as imperfectly satisfactory ill tell you this much major and you can mark my words once those provinces are in our hands we will have a railroad through to the pacific inside of five years we arent like maximilians pack of donothings down in mexico city when the anglosaxon race sets its mind to do something that thing gets done of course sir major sellers was as smugly confident of the superiority of his own people as was stuart after a moment he added well need a railroad more than the greasers would have too well use it for trade the same as they would have done but well use it against the united states too and they never would have bothered with that stuart nodded cant say youre wrong there if mexico ever got into a brawl with the usa first thing shed do would be to pull out of that part of the country and see whether a yankee army was still worth anything once it got done slogging its way through the desert no sir sellers shook his head the first thing maximilian would do would be to scream for us to help the second thing hed do would be to pull out of sonora and chihuahua youre likely to be right about that too stewart said the sound of boots clumping on the dirt made him turn his head an orderly was coming up a telegram clenched in his right fist well well one of stuarts thick eyebrows rose what have we here wire for you sir said the orderly a youngster named withers from richmond i hadnt really expected them to wire me from washington dc stuart answered major sellers snorted withers looked blank he didnt get the joke with a small mental sigh stuart read the telegram that eyebrow climbed higher and higher as he did well well he said again sir sellers said stuart realized well well was something less than informative we are ordered by general jackson to assemble two regiments of cavalry and two batteries of artillery at presidio and also to assemble five regiments of cavalry half a dozen batteries and three regiments of infantry here at el paso the said concentrations to be completed no later than may the date amused him most officers would surely have chosen the fifteenth but that was a sunday and jackson had always been averse to doing anything not vitally necessary on the sabbath sellers whistled softly its going to happen then i would say that appears very likely major stuart agreed presidio is on the road to the town of chihuahua the capital of chihuahua province which we would naturally have to occupy upon annexation and of the larger force to be assembled here i presume some will go to hermosillo the capital of sonora provincewhich i suppose will become sonora territoryand some will defend el paso against whatever moves the united states may make in response to our actions well have to post guards all along the railroad now major sellers looked north the texasnew mexico frontier and the rio grande pinched el paso off at the end of a long narrow neck of confederate territory through which the texas western railroad necessarily ran small parties of raiders could do a lot of damage along that line once the annexation goes through we wont have any trouble moving south of the rio grande well have more depth in which to operate stuart said that was true but it wasnt so useful as it might have been and he knew as much no railroad to el paso ran through chihuahua province movement would have to be by horseback and wagon he sighed folded the telegram and put it in the breast pocket of his butternut tunic he was not a man to wear an oldstyle uniform once the new one had been authorized have to go back to my office and see what i can move and from which places the longer he studied the map the less happy he got to carry out general jacksons orders he would have to pull troops from as far away as arkansas and that would result in weakening a different frontier with the usa he would also have to call down the fifth cavalry and to denude the rest of the garrisons protecting west texas from the comanche raiders who took refuge in new mexico territory if the yankees turned the comanches loose there was liable to be hell to pay among the ranchers and farmers in that part of the country but there would certainly be hell to pay if he did not obey jackson s order in every particular old stonewall had sacked one of his officers during the war for failing to deliver an ordered attack even though the fellow had learned he was outnumbered much worse than jackson thought he was jackson did not would not take no for an answer by the time stuart was done drafting telegrams he had shifted troops all over the landscape he took the text of the wires over to the telegraph office listened to the first couple of them clicking their way east and then went off to watch the cavalry regiment regularly stationed at el paso go through its morning exercises troops began arriving a couple of days later so did cars filled with hardtack cornmeal beans and salt pork for the men and with oats and hay for the horses and other animals every time he looked across the river into chihuahua province he wondered how he could keep his soldiers supplied there he also sent out orders accumulating wagons at el paso if he didnt bring food and munitions with him he suspected hed have none no troop movements on this scale had been seen in the transmississippi since the end of the war not even during the great comanche outbreak of some officers had been rusticating in their fortresses since lincoln abandoned the struggle to keep the confederacy from gaining its independence all things considered they did a good job of shaking off the cobwebs and going from garrison soldiering to something approaching field service by the tenth of may stuart was convinced he would have all his troops in place before the deadline general jackson had sent him on that day a messenger came galloping into el paso sir he said when he came before stuart sir lieutenant colonel foulke has crossed the border from las cruces under flag of truce and wants to speak with you has he stuart thought fast there were any number of places where the yankees could have sneaked an observer over the border to keep an eye on the one railroad into el paso spotting troop trains would have given them a good notion of the force he had at his disposal but what the united states knew and what they officially knew were different things i want his party stopped four or five miles outside of town ill ride out and confer with him there hop to it sergeant i dont want him in el paso yes sir the noncommissioned officer whod brought him the news hurried away to head off the us officer stuart followed at a pace only a little more leisurely accompanied by major sellers and enough troopers to give the idea that he was someone of consequence he rode up the dirt track that led northwest toward new mexico he met lieutenant colonel foulkes party nearer three miles outside el paso than five one of foulkes aides was peering toward the confederate garrison town with a telescope he folded up and put away when stuart and his retinue came into sight he could have done it sooner without stuarts seeing it that hed waited meant he wanted stuart to know the yankees had him under observation wait here stuart told the troopers when they drew close to the us soldiers they didnt come here to start a fight not under flag of truce he and his aidedecamp rode on toward the men in blue lieutenant colonel foulke and the officer whod been using the telescope imitated his practice so that the four leaders met between their small commands a very good morning to you general foulke said politely seeing his babysmooth skin and coalblack mustache reminded stuart he himself would be fifty soon he didnt let himself dwell on that the same to you lieutenant colonel he answered i hope you will not mind my asking the purpose of your visit to the confederacy here by no means sir hearing the polite phrase in foulkes yankee accent new york stuart thoughtwas strange the us officer went on i have been instructed by the secretary of war mr harrison and by the generalinchief of the united states army to inform you personally that the united states will view with great concern any movement of confederate forces into the territory of the empire of mexico i would point out to you sir that when and if the purchase arrangements between mexico and the confederacy are completed the provinces of chihuahua and sonora shall no longer be the territory of the empire of mexico but rather that of the confederate states of america stuarts smile looked ingratiating but was anything but surely bill william foulke said i prefer william william dudley foulke sir at your service beg your pardon william stuart said easily wondering what such a pompous little fellow was doing so far out west as i was saying surely the united states cannot be thinking of forbidding the confederate states from moving their forces from one part of their own territory to another william dudley foulke took a deep breath i am requested and required to inform you general as the government of the united states has informed president longstreet in richmond that the united states consider the sale of sonora and chihuahua to be made under duress and therefore to be invalid and of no consequence oh they do do they stuart had understood that to be the position of the united states but had never heard it explicitly till now the way it was stated william i assure you i mean no offense by this but you talk more like a lawyer than a soldier foulke smiled he was amused not angry i considered a career in the law in my early days general stuart in the aftermath of the war of secession i determined that i could better use my talents in the service of my country as a soldier than as a jurist as i am of quaker stock my family was distressed at my choice but here i am today here you are stuart agreed and since you are here lieutenant colonel foulke i have to tell you that the view of the confederate states is that if the sale of sonora and chihuahua be completed those two provinces become territory belonging to the confederate states of america to be administered and garrisoned at the sole discretion of the government of the csa in plain english sir once theyre ours well do with them as we please in plain english sir the united states do not aim to let themselves be outflanked on the south foulke said the united states do not aim to let the confederacy take advantage of a weak neighbor as you did when you bullied cuba out of spain a few years ago i expect you will wire a report of this meeting back to richmond rest assured that i am telling you nothing different from what minister hay is telling president longstreet there or for that matter what president blaine is telling minister benjamin in washington major horatio sellers spoke up you yankees keep barking that way lieutenant colonel youre going to have to show whether youve got any bite to go with it foulke flushed with his fine fair skin the darkening was quite noticeable but his voice was cool as he replied major if your nation persists in its unwise course you will feel our teeth i assure you the united states have already felt our teeth sir jeb stuart said it has been a while i admit perhaps youve forgotten if you have we are prepared to remind you and i will point out we have good friends which is more than the united states can say lieutenant colonel foulke shrugged sir i have delivered to you the message with which i was charged i personally have no great use for war nor does any man nor any nation of sense but you are to know that the united states are firmly resolved in this matter good day without waiting for a reply he and the captain with him rode back toward their men stuart watched until all the yankees started riding off in the direction of new mexico when hed been foulkes agelord when hed been even youngerhed loved nothing better than riding to war now that he had sons of his own growing to manhood he was no longer so sure he turned to major sellers the next time we see that yankee it will be on the battlefield his aidedecamp gave a sharp short nod good he said colonel alfred von schlieffen had heard that the british government designated diplomatic service in washington dc a hardship position on account of the abominable climate of the capital of the united states he didnt know for a fact that that was true if it wasnt though it should have been the weather had already got hotter and muggier than it ever did in berlin and may was only a bit more than half done kaiser wilhelm is military attache in the united states ran a finger under the tight collar of his blue prussian uniform to try to let in some air that helped little if at all sweating schlieffen stepped onto the black castiron balcony outside his office he startled a pigeon on the rail it flew away wings flapping noisily schlieffen reckoned that a victory of sorts too many pigeon droppings streaked the dark red brick of the german ministry against the humidity and heat though he won nothing no breeze stirred the air it was as hot outside as back in the office horses and buggies and wagons rattled up and down massachusetts avenue the street was paved with bricks so they didnt raise great choking clouds of dust as they might have done but the racket of ironshod hooves and iron tires on the paving was terrible that racket drove whatever thoughts schlieffen had had clean out of his head for a man so intensely intellectual that could not be borne he went back inside closing the french doors behind him as the air was so still he made the office no hotter and since they were almost all glass he hardly made it dimmer above his desk hung three framed portraits a catholic might have thought them images of a secular trinity that had never occurred to schlieffen a devout hutterite to him they were merely the most important men in his life asceticlooking field marshal von moltke whose victories over denmark austria and france had made prussianled germany a nation plump imperious chancellor von bismarck whose diplomacy had made von moltkes victories possible and above them both the kaiser bald now his fringe of hair mustache and fuzzy side whiskers white his chest full of wellearned medals for he had been a formidable soldier in his own right before succeeding his brother as king of prussia whenever schlieffen thought of the kaisers soldierly career he could only marvel for wilhelm had first seen action in the prussian puppet forces that fought under napoleons command when the century was young how many men still living can say that schlieffen murmured and afterwards wilhelm had helped guide prussia s rise to greatness had known when to urge his brother to decline the throne of a united germany after the revolutions of and had known when to accept it himself a generation later from the kaisers portrait schlieffens eyes fell briefly to the small photograph of a pretty young woman on his desk the one bit of sentiment he permitted himself in a room otherwise utterly businesslike anna had been his cousin as well as for four wonderful years his wife in the nine years since her death in childbed hed found it easier to care for the ideal of germany than for any merely human being he inked his pen and wrote the last few sentences of the report hed been working on after scrawling his signature at the bottom he checked his pocket watch a few minutes past ten he had a tenthirty appointment at the war department precise as always he signed the daybook in the front hall noting his departure time to the minute the guards outside the door saluted as he left the embassy he punctiliously returned the courtesy he walked half a block southeast on massachusetts then turned right onto vermont which cut diagonally across washington s square grid and led straight toward the white house and the war department building just west of it civilians waved to him mistaking his light blue uniform for one belonging to the us army hed had us soldiers make the same mistake and salute him he ignored the misdirected greetings as he ignored most human contact then a fat man on a pony that didnt seem up to bearing his weight recognized the uniform for what it was hurrah for the kaiser the fellow called and tipped his hat schlieffen acknowledged that with a polite nod the kaiser was popular in the united states not least because his army had beaten the french newsboys hawked papers on every corner headlines screamed of coming war schlieffens glance lifted toward the arlington heights on the far side of the potomac buildings screened most of his view of them but he knew they were there he also knew the confederate states had guns mounted on them and on other high ground along the southern bank of the river if war came washington would suffer more soldiers were on the streets than usual but not many more unlike germany the united states had no conscription law relying instead on volunteers to fill out the relatively small professional army once war was declared that struck schlieffen as the next thing to insane even if the confederacy used the same system mobs he thought scornfully mobs with rifles thats what theyll be the war department was a fourstory brick building with a twostory entranceway fronted by half a dozen columns to schlieffens way of thinking it would have been adequate for a provincial town but hardly for a national capital the americans had talked for years of building something finer talked but spent no money still the soldiers on duty at the entrance were almost as well drilled as the guards in front of the german embassy yes colonel one of them said the general is expecting you so you just follow willie here hell take you to him thank you schlieffen said the soldier named willie led him up to the thirdfloor office where the generalinchief of the us army carried out his duties guten tag heir oberst said the generals adjutant a bright young captain named saul berryman guten tag schlieffen answered and then as he usually did fell back into english how are you today captain ganz gut danke und sie berryman kept up the german for the same reason schlieffen spoke englishneither was so fluent speaking the others language as he would have liked and both enjoyed the chance to practice der general wird sie sofort sehen i am glad he will see me at once schlieffen said he must be very busy with the crisis in your country ja er ist just then the general opened the door to the outer room where berryman worked seeing him his adjutant returned to english himself go ahead colonel yes always good to see you colonel major general william rosecrans echoed come right in thank you schlieffen said and took a chair across the desk from rosecrans the military attaches nostrils twitched hed smelled whiskey on rosecrans before but surely at a time like thishe gave a mental shrug good to see you rosecrans repeated as if hed forgotten hed said it the first time he was somewhere in his early sixties with graying hair a fairly neat graying beard and a nose with a formidable hook in it his color was very good but the whiskey might have had something to do with that he looked shrewd but schlieffen judged wasnt truly intelligent he owed his position mostly to having come out of the war of secession less disgraced than any other prominent us commander general i am here to present my respects and also to convey to you the friendly good wishes of my sovereign the kaiser schlieffen said of your suffering kaiser rosecrans said i hope he gets better with all my heart i do germany has always been a country friendly to us and were damned glad of that believe me considering the way so many of the other countries in europe treat us schlieffen gave him a sharp look or as sharp a look as could come from the military attaches nondescript rather pinched features rosecrans showed not the slightest hint of embarrassment nor even that he noticed the glare schlieffen concluded the fault lay in his own accented english which rosecrans must have innocently misunderstood having concluded that the colonel dismissed the matter from his mind if no insult had been offered he could not take offense i would be grateful general if you could make arrangements so that in the event of war between the united states and the confederate states you might transport me to one of your armies so that i can observe the fighting and report on it to my government he said well if the wars not over and done with before you catch up to it i expect well be able to do that rosecrans said youll have to move sharp though because we ought to lick the rebs in jig time or bobs your uncle although schlieffen knew he was missing some of thatthe english spoken in the united states at times seemed only distantly related to what hed learned back in germany the root meaning remained pretty clear you believe you will win so quickly and easily then he did his best to keep the surprise he felt out of his voice dont you rosecrans made no effort to hide his own amazement very few americans as far as schlieffen could see had even the least skill in disguising their thoughts and feelings indeed they took an odd sort of pride in wearing them on their sleeves when schlieffen didnt answer right away rosecrans repeated dont you sir the plain fact of the matter is theyre afraid its plain in everything they do i am nothing more than an ignorant stranger in your country schlieffen said a stratagem that had often given him good results would you be so kind as to explain to me why you think this is so rosecrans swelled with selfimportance it strikes me as an obvious fact colonel the government of the united states told richmond in no uncertain terms that there would be hell to pay if a single confederate soldier crossed over the rio grande not a one of em has done it qed is it not possible that the confederate soldiers have not yet moved only because their own preparations remain incomplete schlieffen asked possible but not likely rosecrans said they put a large force of regulars into el paso a couple of weeks agothat was before we warned em we wouldnt stand for any funny business in chihuahua and sonora and since that day colonel since that day not a one of the stinking sons of bitches has dared stir his nose out of their barracks if that doesnt say theyre afraid of us id like to know what it does say schlieffen thought hed already told general rosecrans what it said to the american evidently preparations meant nothing more than moving troops from one place to another schlieffen wondered if his own english was at fault again he didnt think so the problem lay in the way rosecransand presumably president blainesaw the world if you fight the confederate states general will you fight them alone schlieffen tried to put the concept in a new way since the first one had met no success of course well fight em alone rosecrans exclaimed theyre the ones who suck up to foreigners not us that he was speaking with a foreigner did not cross his mind his voice took on a petulant tone almost a whine that schlieffen had heard before from other us officers if england and france hadnt stabbed us in the back during the war of secession wedve licked the confederates then and we wouldnt have to be worrying about this nonsense now that may be true schlieffen felt something close to despair rosecrans was not a stupid man schlieffen had seen as much but it was hard to tell whether he was more naive than ignorant or the other way round could your diplomacy not try to keep great britain and france from doing in this war what they did in the last or even more than they did in the last thats not my department rosecrans said flatly if they stay out they stay out if they come in i suppose well deal with em stabbed in the back he muttered again you have i trust made plans for fighting the confederate states by themselves for fighting them and great britain for fighting them and france and for fighting them and both great britain and france schlieffen said rosecrans gaped at him after coughing a couple of times the american generalinchief said well hit the rebs a couple of hard licks then well chase em depending on where they try to run whatever they try themselves well beat that back and are you all right colonel yes thank you schlieffen answered after a moment he was briefly ashamed of his own coughing fitwas he an american to reveal everything that was in his mind but rosecrans apparently saw nothing more than that hed swallowed wrong as gently as he could schlieffen went on we have developed in advance more elabourate plans of battle general they served us well against the austrians and later against the french i did enjoy watching the froggies get their ears pinned back rosecrans agreed but colonel you dont understand he spoke with great earnestness americans werent always right any more than anyone else was but they were always sure of themselves cant just go and plan things here the way you do on your side of the atlantic the lands too big here and there arent enough people to fill it up too much room to manoeuvre if you know what i mean and thats hell on plans he had a pointno he had part of a point we face the same difficulty when we think of war with russia schlieffen said there is in russia even more space than you have here though i admit russia has also more men but this does not keep us from developing plans if we can force the foe to respond to what our forces do the game is ours maybe rosecrans said and maybe youre smarter than the russians youd be fighting too the next general whos smarter than stonewall jackson hasnt come down the pike yet seems to me i do not follow this schlieffen said but then all at once he did his own ancestors must have gone off to fight napoleon with that same mixture of arrogance and dread comparing a backwoods confederate general to the great bonaparte though struck him as absurduntil he considered that rosecrans and his ilk were hardly a match for scharnhorst gneisenau and bliicher but we will lick em suddenly rosecrans was full of bluff confidence again we outweigh em two to one near enough and thats plenty to make any general look smarter than he really iseven an old neerdowell like me the grin he sent schlieffen had a selfdeprecating charm to which the german military attache could not help responding and rosecrans was right an army with twice the men and guns of its foe went into a war with an enormous advantage as voltaire had said god was always for the big battalions even frederick the great facing odds like those had been at the end of his tether during the seven years war till the opportune death of the tsarina and her abrupt replacement by a successor who favored the prussian king made russia drop out of the war i repeat the question i asked before schlieffen said again what will you do if england or france or both of them at once should enter the war on the side of the confederate states the best we can rosecrans answered brave schlieffen thought but not helpful but then the american army commander looked sly between you me and the wall colonel i dont think its going to happen the reports were getting from london and paris say both governments over there are sick to death of the confederacy keeping niggers as slaves and they wont lift a finger unless the rebs say theyll turn cm loose now i ask you sir what are the odds of that biggest reason they fought the war was on account of they were afraid the united states government would make em do something like that if they wouldnt do it for their own kith and kin why do you think the stubborn bastardsll do it for a pack of foreigners this may be an important point schlieffen said it was at any rate a point interesting enough for him to take it up with minister von schlozer when he got back to the brick pile on massachusetts avenue he concerned himself with politics as little as he could political considerations could of course affect military ones but the latter were all that fell within his purview civilians set policy he made sure the armed forces could do what the leaders required of them rosecrans said if youll excuse me colonel i do have a deal to see to here just on the off chance the confederates get frisky after all i understand schlieffen rose so did rosecrans who came around the desk to shake hands with him again one more question general the attache asked in case of war you are rather vulnerable to the foe while here in washington what would the signal be for shifting your headquarters up to philadelphia which is less likely to come under attack it had better not rosecrans exclaimed soon as the first shell falls we all pack up stakes and head north everything will go smooth as clockwork i promise you we arent fools colonel we know the rebs will shell this place very good schlieffen said as he left the war department he wondered whether both of rosecrans last two sentences were true black smokeand showers of sparkspouring from her twin stacks the liberty bell steamed down the mississippi toward st louis when hed boarded the sternwheeler in clinton illinois frederick douglass had taken her name as a good omen with every mile closer to the confederate states he drew though his doubts increased he stood on the upper deck watching farms and little towns flow past he was the only negro on the upper deck the deck that housed cabin passengers that did not surprise him but for one of the men who fed wood to the fire under the liberty bell s boiler he was the only negro aboard the steamboat he was used to that too over the years since the war of secession hed grown very used to being alone look somebody not far away said look at the nigger in the fancy suit douglass turned he was he knew an impressive man with handsome features whose leonine aspect was enhanced by his silvery beard and mane of hair that silver and his slow deliberate motions told of his age he thought he was sixtyfour but might as easily have been sixtythree or sixtyfive having been born into slavery on maryland s eastern shore he had to put it mildly not been encouraged to enquire into the details of his arrival on the scene two young white men both dressed like drummers or cheap confidence men there sometimes being little difference between the two trades were gaping at him their pale eyes wide may i help you gentlemen he asked letting only a little irony seep into his deep rich voice despite his formidable presence despite the rumbles of oratorical thunder audible in even his briefest most commonplace utterances the whites were unabashed its all right its all right one of them said as if soothing a restive childor a restive horse dick here and me were from st paul and aint neither one of us ever got a good look at a nigger before i can sec as much douglass said i also discern that you have never had occasion to learn how to speak to a negro either that went right past the two men from st paul they kept on staring as if he were a caged monkey in a zoo hed had that feeling too many times in his life already seeing they would be rude no matter how unintentionally he turned his back set both hands on the rail and peered out over the mississippi once more ain t neither one of us ever got a good look at a nigger before his fingers clamped down on the whitepainted cast iron with painful force hed heard that or variations on it hundreds of times since the war he let out a long sigh punctuated by a couple of short coughs before the southern states left the union to form their own nation he had been a spokesman for one man in eight in the united states now ninety percent of the negroes on the north american continent resided in a foreign country and most of the white citizens of the usa were just as glad it was so they might have been gladder yet had the figure been one hundred percent as often as not they blamed the relative handful of blacks left in the united states for the breakup of the nation and if a negro tormented beyond endurance tried to flee from say confederate kentucky across the ohio into the united states and freedom how was he greeted with congratulations for his love of liberty and a hearty welcome to a better land douglass laugh was sour if a us navy gunboat didnt sink his little skiff or raft in midstream white men with guns and dogs would hunt him down and ship him back over the river to the csa why not as an inhabitant of a different nation he had no claim on the united states douglass laughed againbetter that than weeping before the war the fugitive slave act had been a stench in the nostrils of most northerners now though the law was no longer on the book slavery having at last become extinct in the usa fugitive slaves found less sympathy than they had a generation earlier did calling them foreigners make such a difference evidently not wanting to know whether the two white men had finished their examination of him or whether others equally curious and equally rude had taken their place douglass looked ahead the dark cloud of smoke and haze blowing west across the mississippi was not a reflection of his mood it was a reflection of the soft coal st louis like so many western cities burned to heat its homes cook its food and power the engines of its factories the liberty bell would be landing before long past the northern suburb of baden steamed the stcrnwheeler over there black roustabouts carried cargo off barges and small steamers douglass warmed to see men of his own color once more even if those men were doing labour of a sort their brethren still in bondage might have performed at lonely little landing stations along the confederateheld reaches of the southern mississippi then across the water came the ingenious curses of the white men who bossed those roustabouts douglass mouth tightened into a thin hard line hed had curses like those fall on his own head back in the days when he was property before he became a human being of his own hed also known the lash then that at least these bosses unlike the overseers still plying their trade in the csa were forbidden perhaps the prohibition made their curses sharper other negroes floated on the mississippi in rowboats douglass watched one of them draw a fish into his boat the days supper or part of it blacks and whites both plied larger skiffs in which they went after the driftwood that always fouled the river they would not make much money from their gleanings but none of them it was likely would ever make or expect to make much money till the end of his days st louis sprawled for miles along the riverbank the riverbank had long been its raison detre on the mississippi close to the joining of that river with the missouri and not too far above the joining with the ohio it was at the center of a commerce stretching from minnesota to new orleans from the appalachians to the rockies railroads had only added to its importance smoke belching from the stack of its locomotive a loaded train chugged north the engineer blew a long blast on his whistle apparently from nothing more than high spirits not even the rupture of the union had for long interrupted st louis riverine commerce many of the steamers chained up at the landingstages along the stonefronted leveeno regular wharves here not with the mississippis level liable to fluctuate so drasticallywere confederate boats with names like vicksburg belle new orleans lightning and albert sidney johnston the stars and bars fluttered proudly at their sterns as they had in the days before the war they carried tobacco and cotton and rice and indigo up the river trading them sometimes for wheat and corn sometimes for iron ore and sometimes for the products into which that ore was eventually made the confederate states had their own factories these days some of them to douglass unending mortification with negro slaves as labour but their demand remained greater than their own industry could meet names were not the only way to tell confederate steamboats from their us counterparts none of the boats from the united states posted armed guards on deck to keep parts of their crews from escaping the welcome newly fled blacks would receive in st louis was no warmer than anywhere else in the united states but that did not keep some from trying their luck to douglass mingled pride and chagrin the liberty bell pulled in alongside one of those confederate boats an immense sidewheeler emblazoned with the name nb forrest the escaped slave wondered how his brethren still trapped felt about sailing in a vessel named for a dealer in human flesh who had also proved a successful officer in the war one of the guards aboard the forrest looking over to watch the liberty bell tie up at the landingstage saw douglass standing at the upperdeck rail he gaped at the spectacle of a colored man there rather than on the main deck where the poor and the engine crew spread their blankets douglass sent an unpleasant smile his way the guard was close enough to recognize it as unpleasant he scowled back then spat a brown stream of tobacco juice into the equally brown mississippi berthed on the opposite side of the liberty bell from the confederate steamboat was the uss shiloh one of a number of river monitors that made st louis their home port the gunboats dark iron armor plating and starkly functional design made a sharp contrast to the nb forrests gaudy paint and gilding and gloriously rococo woodwork among the crowd waiting at the top of the gently sloping levee for the liberty bell to disembark her passengers was a small knot of black men in clothes much like douglass undoubtedly the clergymen he was to meet he hurried back to his cabin to retrieve his carpet bags he carried them to the gangplank himself though portersimmigrants from eastern europe many of themwere eager enough to assist the whites traveling with him they were more often than not reluctant to serve a negro how quickly they learn the ways of the land to which they came seeking freedom douglas thought with a bitterness now dull with scar tissue but no less true and real on account of that the ministers by contrast were eager to relieve him of his burdens thank you deacon younger he said as he shook hands with them thank you mr towler good to see you gentlemenand you too of course mr bass i dont mean to forget youagain its been four or five years since i last had the pleasure has it not fo years mistuh douglass deacon daniel younger answered it sho enough is a pleasure to set eyes on you again suh i tell you truthfully like his colleagues younger was a man of education he wrote well as douglas knew his grammar and vocabulary were first rate but he like towler and bass retained most of the intonations of slavery in his speech douglass own negro accent was much less pronounced as a boy hed learned white ways of speaking from his masters daughter over the years he had seen many times how that made people both white and black take him more seriously he found it useful and unfortunate at the same time come on to the carriage wid us washington towler said well take you over to the planters hotel on foth street they know youre acomin and they will be ready fo you by that he meant the hotel wouldnt make a fuss about having a negro use one of its rooms for a few days douglass of course was not just any negro either but as close to a famous negro as the united states boasted the reverend henry bass drove the buggy he was younger than his two colleagues both of whom were not far from douglass age he said dont know what all the excitement of the past few weeks will do to your crowds mistuh douglass what has yo experience been in the other towns where you were it would be hard to state a general rule douglass answered some peopleby which i mean white people of course oh of course bass said he and the other two ministers rolled their eyes at the neverending indignities of living on sufferance some people i say douglass resumed take the threat of renewed war as a chance to punish the confederate states which works to our advantage others though continue to make the negro the scapegoat for the dissolution of the union and because of that discount every word i say you will see a deal o dat last here i am afraid deacon daniel youngers broad shouldersthe man was built like a barrelmoved up and down as he sighed during the war there were plenty who foughthe pronounced it fit as did many black and white in the west and in the csato make missouri a confederate state they have made up their minds to be part o de union now but they are still not easy about it i remember how kentucky fell after lincoln pulled troops easttoo little too lateto try to halt lees army douglass said remember the talk about partitioning missouri too on the order of what was done with virginia and west virginia i thank god you were preserved entire for the united states we praise him every day washington towler said without his help we should still be slaves ourselves henry bass pulled up in front of the planters hotel towler pointed to the entrance they bought and sold us mr douglass right there even in the days after the war till emancipation finally became dc law of de land the planters hotel had a southern look to it even now its arches were of a style oldfashioned in the usa incised into the fagade rather than raised in relief from it some of the men going in and out wore the white linen suiting common in the warm muggy south too and spoke with drawls traders up from new orleans and memphis douglass supposed they stared at his companions and him as if a nightmare had come to life before their eyesand so douglass hoped one had he took his bags and went into the hotel as he had on the steamboat he carried them himself maybe the white porters assumed that despite his clothes he was a servant or maybe and more likely they just refused to lower themselves as they saw it by serving one of the negroes who had served their kind for so many long sorrowful years i am frederick douglass he said when he reached the front desk a room has been reserved in my name he waited for the clerk to shuffle through papers the fellow lifted up his eyes now and again to stare at douglass dark countenance what followed was as inevitable as night following day im sorry s the clerk could not bring himself to say sir to a negro he started again im sorry but i dont find that reservation young man douglass said coldly if you do not find it by the time i count ten i promise you this hotel will be a stench in the nostrils of the entire united states by a week from tuesday when my next newspaper column goes out over the wires your superiors will not thank you for that commence one two three how the clerk stared and how quickly the missing reservation appeared as if by magic thoroughly cowed the clerk even browbeat a white bellboy into taking douglass carpetbags from him and carrying them to the room it was one of the smaller darker rooms in the hotel but douglass had expected nothing better than that daniel younger and his friends had probably been able to book no better after supperwhich he ate at a table surrounded by empty oneshenry bass came by to take him to the merchants exchange where he would speak st louis was a handsome city of gray limestone and a sandstone almost as red as brick though soot dimmed its color on many buildings the merchants exchange proved to take up the whole block between chestnut and pine on third street weve got plenty of room for a good house mr douglass bass said president tilden was nominated in the grand hall back in he was but when douglass went into the hall he was sadly disappointed plainly every negro in and around st louis who could afford a ticket was there sombersuited black men and their wives in fancy dresses filled to overflowing the seats allotted to them douglass had long prided himself though on his reputation for being able to speak to whites as well as blacks tonight it failed him the bright gaslights shone down on great empty rows of chairs with here and there a clump of people he went ahead with his address as a professional he had no other choice he sounded his familiar themes tolerance education enlightenment progress the appropriateness of giving all their due for what they could do not for the color of their skins he drew rapturous applause from the negroes in the hall and got a polite hearing from the whites it could have been worse he knew that hed started riots with his speeches now and again sometimes meaning to sometimes not tonight he would have welcomed a riot in place of the nearindifference his white audience showed him when us whites had nothing else on their minds they were sometimes willing to listen to tales of the negros plight and ways by which it might be alleviated when they were distracted they might as well have forgotten the usa still held any negroes once it was finally over he stood down from the podium to his surprise one of the people who came up to speak with him was a graybearded white man a former army officer whom douglass after a bit recognized from years gone by you must not take it to heart sir he said with touching sincerity do remember our present concern over the confederate states is also in its way concern for your people douglass smelled liquor on his breath no wonder he is so sincere the negro thought and no wonder he is a soldier no more despite having won a couple of battles against the rebels by his rather worn suit the fellow had made no great success of civilian life liquor again but he had done his best to be kind on a dismal evening and he did have a point of sorts exercising forbearance douglass said thank you general grant chapter s alt lake city the conductor shouted all out for salt lake city the train gave a convulsive jerk like a man letting out his last breath abraham lincoln thoughtand came to a stop wearily lincoln heaved himself up out of his seat and grabbed his valise and carpetbag after speaking in denver and colorado springs in greeley and pueblo in canon city and grand junction leaving colorado and coming into utah territory was almost like entering a foreign country that impression was strengthened when he got out of the pullman car an eastbound train was loading as his was unloading most of the men filing aboard wore the blue tunics and trousers and black felt hats of the us army and were burdened with the impedimenta of the soldiers trade as the crisis with the confederate states worsened the regulars were being called to the threatened frontiers a crowd of men women and children cheered the soldiers departure at most train stations as lincoln had seen during the war the soldiers would have responded waving their hats and calling out to the pretty girls not here not now every cheer they heard seemed to make them glummer or perhaps cheerful in a different way jesus one of them said loudly to a friend will i be glad to get out of this goddamned place sad isnt it said a little man who appeared at lincoln s elbow while the former president was watching the troops embark they arent cheering to wish the men good luck if they have to fight the rebs theyre cheering because those fellows arc getting out of here and they hope they wont come back i had the same impression myself mister lincoln hesitated im the chap whos supposed to meet you here mr lincoln gabriel hamilton at your service despite his small size lincoln towered over him hamilton had a jaunty manner and a way of raising one eyebrow just a little to suggest he was hard to impress after shaking hands he went on call me gabe if you please sir all my gentile friends do yourgentile friends lincoln wondered if hed heard correctly his ears these days werent what they had been gabe hamilton had neither a hebraic name nor hebraic features the little man laughed out loud if youre not a mormon in salt lake city mr lincoln youre a gentile aaron rothman runs a drygoods shop down the street from me here hes a gentile and what is his opinion of his unusual status lincoln asked he thinks its funny as blazes matter of fact hamilton answered hes a pretty good egg rothman is but presbyterians like me catholics baptists jews what have youin utah territory were all outsiders looking in we hang together better than we would if that werent so i expect if you dont hang together you will hang separately lincoln suggested hamilton took that for his wit rather than ben franklins and laughed again uproariously this time youre a sharp man mr lincoln im glad weve got you out here for a fact i am youll buck up the miners and the other working folks and youll make the bosses think twice about what theyre doing and those are both good things come on back to my buggy sir and ill take you to your hotel thank you lincoln followed his guide away from the train soldiers were still boarding the one bound for the east the local crowd was still applauding their departure too those would be mormons i suppose that they would now gabriel hamilton sounded more than a little grim i tell you frankly mr lincoln the rest of us in town are nervous about it without soldiers here god only knows whats liable to happen god and john taylor i suppose the mormons think thats the same thing gentiles though will tell you different youre referring to brigham youngs successor lincoln said as hamilton took his luggage from him and loaded it onto the buggy young was an uncrowned king here during my administration and up till the day he died four years ago hamilton agreed and do you know what i think he loved every minute of it he untied the horses from the rail and clambered into the carriage nimble as a monkey mr taylors got the same power but not the same bulge if you know what i mean i do indeed law and politics had both shown lincoln that of two men with the same nominal authority one was liable to be able to do much more than the other if their force of character differed so taylor is king log instead of king stork eh wouldnt go so far as that hes quieter about what he does thats all you settled there at lincoln s nod hamilton clucked to the horses flicked the reins and got the carriage going after a little while he continued the mormons still listen to him ill tell you that he sounded mournful a man relating a fact he wished a falsehood you wont have many of them coming to your speech tomorrow night im afraid thats a pity lincoln said from what ive read of utah and from what youve told me they are the ones who most need to hear it as in denver the streets in salt lake city were all of dirt dust rose from the horses hooves and from the wheels of the carriage though traffic was not heavy a lot of dust hung in the air but the water that ran over the pebbles in the gutter looked bright and clean enough to drink and lincoln saw a couple of women in calico dresses and sunbonnets dipping it up in pails so he supposed it was used for that purpose treespoplar mulberry locust maplegrew alongside those gutters and their branches green and leafy with the fresh growth of spring spread above the streets shielding them from the full force of the sun the prospect was attractive especially when compared to either the flat dull towns of the prairie or the stony gulches in which most rocky mountain cities were set wheres the great salt lake lincoln asked suddenly realizing he could not see the natural feature for which the city was named hamilton pointed west its almost twenty miles from here theres a little excursion train thatll take you there if you want to see it dont drink the water if you do go itll burn you up from the inside out ive seen if from the train several times on my way out to california lincoln said i have no desire for a closer acquaintanceits only that i havent been in as opposed to through salt lake city till now and so missed it a few of the houses were log cabins that took lincoln back to the longvanished days of his own youth more were of creamy graybrown adobe bricks some stuccoed over and whitewashed or painted others left their natural shade newer homes might have been transplanted straight from the east almost all of themcabins low adobes and modern clapboards and tiredbrick houseswere surrounded by riots of trees and shrubs and climbing vines and flowers making a spectacle all the more impressive when measured against the bleak brown wasatch mountains just east of town some of those adobe houses despite being of a single story nevertheless had a great many rooms with several wings spreading out from what had begun as small simple dwellings pointing to one of those gabe hamilton said you see a place like that mr lincoln and you can bet a polygamist lives there hell take the center for himself and give each wife and her brats a wing how many mormons are polygamists truly lincoln asked they write all sorts of things in the eastern papers they say all sorts of things here too hamilton answered the truth is devilish hard to find and they dont keep any public records of marriages past the first which makes it harder yet id say its about one in ten if that but the polygamists have influence beyond their numbers if youre going to support more than one wife and family you need more than the common run of money you see oh yes lincoln said a case similar to that of slaveholders in the confederate states and those not in the elite group will some of them aspire to join it over the course of time and thus support it even without presently enjoying its benefits benefits gabe hamilton let out a derisive guffaw have you ever seen most of these mormon women mr lincoln you ask me not that anybody didtaking em is an act of charity like the residential blocks the central business district of salt lake city boasted avenues lined with trees the buildings back of those trees were modern enough and included several finelooking hotels ahead loomed what looked like an enormous gothic cathedral about three fourths of the way to completion that would be the famous mormon temple lincoln asked pointing thats right hamilton nodded and that long dome there the one thatd look handsomer if the wall and the trees didnt hide its linesthats the tabernacle where they worship they dont think small do they no lincoln allowed many things may be said of them but not thinking small from the window of his hotel room lincoln could look out at the tabernacle and the temple on scaffolding that seemed hardly thicker than cobwebs men tiny as ants against the granite bulk of the latter laboured to bring brigham youngs grandiose vision one day closer to completion lincoln had just finished unpacking when someone knocked on the door when he opened it he found a handsome young man in a dignified suit standing in the hallway mr lincoln president taylor presents his compliments and hopes you will be free to take supper with him this evening at seven oclock the youngster said if that is convenient to you sir i will come by with a carriage at about half past six to convey you to his home president taylor for a moment the only president by that name who came to lincoln s mind was zachary now thirty years dead then he remembered where he was the head of your church you mean yes sir of course the emissary had probably learned of zachary taylor in school but john taylor was the living reality for him tell him i thank him for the invitation and i shall be pleased to see him at the hour he named for the life of him lincoln could not see why the spiritual leader of the latterday saints wanted to meet with him but what he did not show to the young messenger that worthy would not guess and his own ignorance and curiosity would be relieved soon enough as promised the bright young man came by the hotel in a handsome buggy at sixthirty the journey to john taylors home took a little less than half an hour the home itself or at least the central portion of it would not have looked out of place in chicago or pittsburgh it was a twostory building brilliantly whitewashed with a slate roof added to that central portion though were enough wings for several butterflies each no doubt housing a separate portion of the mormon presidents extended and extensive family poplars maples and grape vines surrounded the house and ivy climbed up the front wall when lincoln knocked at the front door a man of about his own age opened it come in sir he said in an accent that showed hed been born in england i am john taylor it is a pleasure to meet you his hair his eyebrows and the beard growing along the angle of his jaw and under his chin were all snowy white he habitually pursed his lips which made his mouth look narrow and bloodless his deepset eyes very blue seemed to have seen more sorrows than joys lincoln understood that he would have said the same of himself he looked around with no small curiosity the central portion of the house seemed no more unusual within than without the furniture was comfortable without being lavish bookshelves lined many walls the knickknacks and gewgaws on tables the pictures on the walls were the sort any minister might have had nor was the dining room in any way strange as lincoln sat down taylor said i fear i can offer you only water or milk with your meal for i have no tea or coffee or liquor in the house water will do lincoln said they talked of small things during supper taylor did not offer to introduce the girlshe was about sixteenwho brought bread and butter and beefsteaks and potatoes and squash in from the kitchen maybe she was a servant maybe she was a daughter she didnt look much like him but she might have favored her mother maybe she was a wife lincoln did his best to put that unappealing thought not that the girl herself was unappealing in spite of what gabe hamilton had said about mormon women out of his mind after she had cleared away the last of the dishes the mormon president said when you next communicate with president blaine sir i hope you will convey to him that the line the us government has taken here makes it more difficult than it might otherwise be for us to support that government with our full power in the event of a collision with the confederate states i have no notion when i shall be in touch with mr blaine again lincoln answered truthfully john taylor coughed please sir i know you may not love the faith i follow but that i follow it docs not make me a child or a fool can it be a coincidence that the one former republican president of the united states comes to deseretutah if youd ratherat the same time as the present republican president is leading the country toward war with the csa for what other purpose could you be here than to examine our loyalty in the event of a conflict i was invited here to speak to the working men of this territory on ways in which they can hope to better their lot lincoln said again truthfully a plausible pretext i dont deny taylor said seeming intent on finding deviousness whether it was there or not the timing however makes me doubt it conveys the whole story of your visit be that as it may do please tell president blaine that since he seems to be continuing the longstanding us policy of attempting to suppress our institutions some of our number wonder if continued allegiance to the united states be worth the cost all we have ever sought is to be left alone to practice our own ways as we think best if you will recall president taylor that was also the rallying cry of the confederate states during the war lincoln answered your people were loyal thenconspicuously loyal i note also whether you care to believe it or not that i have no influence to speak of on president blaine once again that was true blaine did his best not to remember that he and lincoln were members of the same party come come having dismissed the truth with two words taylor went back to the point he had been making before unlike the case of the confederacy our practices have the consent of all those involved in them we seek to impose them on no one but the united states have continually laboured to subvert them the more so since the railroads have brought such an influx of gentiles into our homeland do you wonder at our resentment sir lincoln thought again of that young girl could she have been a wife taylor s public face was the image of decorum what did he do in private in this great rambling boardinghouse of a home that question and others like it echoed through the minds of ordinary americans when they thought of mormonism he shrugged in any case it was an irrelevance if you like president taylor i shall pass on to president blaine what you say i fear i cannot promise that he will take any special notice of it as i told you i am not a man he is in the habit of heeding he would be well advised to do so in this instance john taylor said we left the united states once to come here to utah the borders of the usa then followed us west we cannot emigrate again not physically yet we must be able to practice our religion unimpeded the light from the kerosene lamps filled his face with harsh shadows i very much hope that is not a threat sir lincoln said the sockets of taylor s eyes were shrouded in darkness so do i he said so do i general stuart general stuart telegram from richmond general stuart at a dead run a messenger came from the telegraph office waving the flimsy sheet of paper that bore the message thank you bryce from the runners tone stuart guessed what the telegram said before he read it when he did he nodded to himself the day had come later than it should have but was at last at hand major horatio sellers came up to stuart is it what weve been hoping it will be sir he asked eagerly thats exactly what it is major stuart answered we are to enter and occupy the mexican provinces of chihuahua and sonora the movement to proceed on the outline already at hand and to commence at sunrise on tuesday the fourteenth of june three days from now his aidedecamp said his voice thoughtful a satisfied expression made his heavy features seem almost benignant well have no trouble meeting that deadline since weve been ready to go for most of the past month anyone wants to know my view of the matter we should have moved the day we had the troops in place stuart said weve wasted all this time trying to keep the damnyankees sweet about what were doing but when you come right down to it what we do in our own territorywhich this is nowand in our relations with the empire of mexico is our business and nobody elses sellers looked north and west toward las cruces across the international border in new mexico territory what do you suppose lieutenant colonel foulke would have to say about that he said and then changed verb tenses what do you suppose lieutenant colonel foulkc will have to say about that did i not make myself clear major stuart said i dont care what foulke or any other yankee has to say about what we do on our territory and if the united states choose to resent our actions with weapons in hand they are welcome to make the effort but i doubt they will have a friendly reception here or anywhere else along our common frontier sir do you really think they would be stupid enough to fight a war with us over this sellers asked dont they know we could lick em by ourselves but odds are we wont have to we walked away from the united states the last time they put a black republican in the white house and they fought to try to hold us to an allegiance we could stand no more stuart answered now they have another republican president and theres every sign theyre feeling frisky again i hope they act sensibly having seen one war i dont care to see another one but their politicians havent seen the elephantall theyve done is talk about it theyd be wiser if they knew more he shrugged be that as it may we have our orders and we are going to carry them out go issue the commands that will get the occupation forces ready to commence their movements at the required time and also the orders for the infantry and artillery that will stay behind to defend el paso in case the united states do decide to be foolish yes sir sellers started to hurry away wait stuart said his aidedecamp paused and looked back the commander of the military district of the transmississippi grinned at him however this works out major its going to be fun sunday evening stuart was summoned to the bridge spanning the rio grande at its midpoint precisely at the border between the confederate states and the empire of mexico stood colonel enrique gutierrez commander of the mexican garrison in paso del norte his uniform of the french pattern maximilians men favored was far brighter and shinier than the plain butternut stuart wore gutierrez a lean saturnine man spoke good english which was fortunate because stuart had only a handful of words of spanish have just received word general that the arrangements long under discussion are now complete the mexican colonel said accordingly on the day following tomorrow my men shall withdraw from these provinces that is when we intend to enter chihuahua and sonora yes stuart said i am glad the news has reached you from mexico city we do not want to come as invaders the confederate states are pleased at the good relations we enjoy with the empire of mexico given the muddle in which maximilians government commonly found itself for gutierrez to have been only thirtysix hours late in getting the word showed uncommon efficiency i am glad of this gutierrez said politely he didnt show whatever he was thinking he was stuart knew a pretty fair soldier and couldnt have been happy to serve a regime so feckless that it had to sell off pieces of the country to pay its bills after a moment he went on i have a question as we move back toward territory that will remain under our control shall we also take with us the city guards who maintain order in the streets no stuart said my orders are to class them as policeas officers of the civilian governmentnot as soldiers they will go right on doing their jobs until and unless our own government makes changes hereabouts muy bien gutierrez nodded he took a deep breath speaking for myself general stuart and as a man i will say that i would sooner see these provinces pass to the confederate states which paid before occupying them than to the united states which invaded my country and only then paid stuart thought it wiser not to mention that stonewall jackson and some other veterans in confederate service had fought for the usa during the mexican war thank you seemed safer colonel gutierrez snapped off a salute spun on his heel and walked back toward the fort he would control for another day and a half that tuesday morning like most june days in el paso dawned bright and clear and hot as soon as the sun rose jeb stuart led his infantry and cavalry and rumbling cannons toward and then onto the bridge he did not stop at the midpoint but kept going till his horses hooves thudded on the graybrown dirt at the southern end chihuahua was now as much confederate soil as was texas a red white and green mexican flag still flew on a pole at the southern end of the bridge colonel gutierrez waited there with a last squad of soldiers in ornate uniforms politely stuart took off his hat and saluted the mexican flag honor satisfied gutierrez barked orders in spanish two of his men ran the flag down the pole for the last time and reverently folded it at stuarts command a couple of confederate soldiers raised the stars and bars over paso del norte and by extension over all of chihuahua and sonora polite as a priest colonel gutierrez saluted the new flag as general stuart had saluted the old if the mexican colonels eyes were unusually bright and moist stuart had no intention of remarking on it from paso del norte the road ran almost due west bending only slightly toward the south as it took advantage of the break in the mountains that meant it stayed close to the border with the united states stuart didnt care for the course the geography dictated neither did major sellers all i can say sir he remarked is that its a good thing new mexico territory is just about as empty as chihuahua here i agree major stuart said the logistics are poor for both sides in this part of the world as he had when first learning he would have to move troops into this newly confederate territory he sighed if general sibley had been able to keep his men in food and munitions during the war new mexico would be ours now and our worries would be goneor at least farther north the country west of the mountains was even more unabashedly desert than that to the east saguaro cactuses stood close by the road and far away their cigarshaped bodies and angular sometimes upthrust arms putting stuart in mind of giant green men surprised by bandits the fifth cavalry regiment seemed peculiarly at home in that harsh terrain even if it did have to travel a bit apart from the rest it was most often known as the fifth camelry being mounted on ships of the desert rather than horses jefferson davis had introduced camels to the southwest as us secretary of war before the war of secession the fifth at first stocked with beasts captured wild in the desert had done good work against the comanches showing up in places its troopers could never have reached on horseback here and there wherever there was water tiny towns punctuated the route janos agua prieta right across the border from the equally sleepy hamlet of douglas new mexico cananea imuris at imuris stuart detached one regiment of infantry and one of cavalry and ordered them south to hermosillo to the cavalry commander colonel l tiernan brien who was senior to the infantry regiments colonel he said the occupation being peaceful thus far i am not sending so large a force to the interior of this province as originally contemplated i expect you to split off what part of it you deem necessary for garrisoning guaymas on the coast and send that portion of your forces there yes sir brien said he had served under stuart since the war having led a regiment of state troops in the pennsylvania campaign if the mexicans do choose to give us trouble though we probably wont be able to do much about it especially if youre keeping all the artillery for yourself i understand that colonel stuart answered it is i believe a good gamble colonel gutierrez may not have loved what his government did but he accepted it like a soldier and a man by all the signs the same will hold true in hermosillo and guaymas as well the mexicans in these little villages havent tried to resist us in any way all theyve done is stare well the camels likely have something to do with that but its true enough heaven knows brien said he waved out over the barren landscape if you keep most of your men so far forward sir will you be able to provision them i certainly hope so stuart said im given to understand hermosillo is in the center of a farming district whatever supplies you can send north will be welcome the more so if the route west from el paso is interrupted yes sir tiernan brien said again most of two decades of garrison duty had laid a heavy patina of routine over the dashing young trooper hed once been but like a lot of the other veteran officers in stuarts force he was starting to shine up once more by your dispositions sir you really do think the yankees will try to make good on their bluster no colonel truth to tell i dont stuart answered but i am going to act as if i did if the united states are foolish enough to contest this annexation my judgment is that they pose a greater threat to us than any disaffected mexicans that being so i intend to keep the bulk of my forces where they can best respond to any moves by the usa he grinned my dispositions reflect my disposition which is cautious colonel brien smiled showing teeth stained brown by the plug of tobacco that swelled one cheek beg your pardon sir but weve been soldiering together for a long time and i dont reckon cautious is a word id put together with your name up till now maybe im getting old stuart said then he grinned again and barked a couple of times or maybe im learning a new trick now youre talking sir tiernan brien said enthusiastically wake up sam alexandra clemens nudged her husband then nudged him harder when he didnt move its half past seven reluctantly samuel clemens pried his eyes open his nostrils twitched youre an angel in human form my dear i say that you understand only because youve already got the coffee boiling youd throw me in the street if i didnt alexandra ownedand honeda wit that could rival her husbands and wasnt shy about using it it was all the more effective because she looked so mild and innocent wide fair face blue eyes mild as milk till the devil came out in them golden hair that let down for the night spilled over her shoulders and onto her white nightdress so that but for wings she really did have something of an angelic aspect at the moment when sam still in his own nightshirt came downstairs for that coffee his son orion leaped into his lap and almost made the cup and contents end up there too not a thing angelic about orion sometimes all that kept sam from strangling him was remembering hed been even worse at the same age why arent you busy getting ready for school sam demanded orion withered him with a glance cause its closed for the summer he said triumphantly i know that his father answered but if you were youd be out of my hair with sixyearold gusto orion stuck out his tongue ophelia who was four came into the dining room a little later of the family she was fondest of sleeping late she looked like her mother with a childs sweetness thrown in for good measure walking up to her father she took his big hands in her little ones and said hello you old goat hello yourself sam said gravely however much ophelia looked like alexandra she behaved more like orion which horrified her mother andmost of the timeamused her father if you live youll go far my dear sam tousled her golden curls then added in meditative tones of course the penitentiary is pretty far from here ophelia for once missed the joke so did orion alexandra who didnt sent her husband a severe look he ignored sometimes getting out of the house on turk street and heading over to the morning call offices on market felt more like escape than anything else despite going uphill and down sam enjoyed the walk going uphill was harder work for heavily laden horses teamsters whips cracked over and sometimes on the backs of the straining beasts then brakes squealing on the wagons they pulled the horses had to ease the loads downhill fifteen minutes after kissing his wife goodbye clemens walked into the office when he got there clay herndon leaped at him with almost as much terrifying enthusiasm as orion had shown herndon though had an excuse any newspaperman would have forgiven the telegram he waved in clemens face youve got to see this he shouted how can i argue with logic like that sam took the thin sheet of paper and rapidly read through it when he was done he nodded a couple of times then said a lot of people must be surprised today everybody who didnt think blaine knew a foursyllable word for instance if he only knows one he picked the right one to know retorted herndon a resolute republican id say it gives us the headline for the next edition wouldnt you ultimatum clemens said now that you mention it yes if ever a word screamed for seventytwopoint type thats the one he took off his derby and hung it on the hat tree just inside the door as soon as he got to his desk he slid off his jacket and draped it over the back of his chair then he removed the studs from his cuffs put them in a vest pocket and rolled up his sleeves ready to give it a go are you herndon said his tone was mildly mocking but sam ignored that you bet i am he said give me that wire again will you i want to make sure i have everything right he paused to light a cigar then reread the telegram always a good day when the editorial comes up and whimpers in your face begging to be set at liberty if you say so sam herndon replied makes me glad im nothing but a humble scribe get over to city hall scribe clemens said get the mayors reaction in other words give me the statement that goes with this he donned an expression somewhere between dumbfoundment and congenital idiocy the san francisco morning call did not love mayor adolph sutro it was mutual herndon struck a pose that might have been a politician on the stump or a man waiting with concentrated urgency to use the privy t am opposed with every fiber of my being to the war that may come and i expect us to gain great and glorious triumph in it he declaimed there now i dont need to make the trip sam blew cigar smoke at him go on get out of here his honor might have got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning and if he did hell say hes all for the war but calculates well take a licking god forbid we should misquote him he wouldnt notice since he cant remember on tuesday what he said the friday beforefigures thats the papers jobbut some of his friendswell cronies a creature like thats not likely to have friendsjust might snickering herndon grabbed his hat slung his jacket over his shoulderit was another of those seasonless san francisco days not quite warm not quite cooland departed clemens drew on the cigar again absentmindedly tapped its ash into a brass tray and set it back in the corner of his mouth he knew he was liable to forget about it once he started writing pen scraped across paper president blaine has told the nation and the world that if the confederate states do not withdraw their soldierssoldiers they deployed without the consent of the united states and against the express wishes of the samefrom the provinces of chihuahua and sonora within ten days he will ask congress to declare a state of war in existence between the united states and the confederate states he fails to include the empire of mexico in his ultimatum which is no doubt only an oversight on his part after all leaving the disputed provinces out of the bargain the united states do still abut maximilians dominions where our upper california touches his lower whose cactuses arc every bit as dire a threat to the united states as any now sprouted in sonora as noted before in this space acquiring sonora and chihuahua representsor at least may represent in the futurea new access of strength for the confederate sates as did their purchase of cuba a few years ago a purchase to which the united states consented without a murmur but we were then under a democratic administration and a congress likewise democratic a party whose attitude toward the confederacy has always been that the blamed thing would not be there if anybody had listened to them in the beginning and patted the thensouthern states on the head and told them what good boys they were until they eventually believed it and went to sleep in place of seceding and has dealt with them since the war of secession as if they were so many percussion caps filled with fulminate and liable to explode if stepped on or dropped by contrast the confederate states are to the republican partythe phrase a nigger in the woodpile is tempting but no we shall refrainan illegitimate child in the family of nations and so to be deprived of plum pudding every christmas eve well the illegitimate child is now above eighteen years of age and a dd big bd now suddenly the bigger by two provinces gulped down in lieu of the plums once denied it no wonder then that president blaine is in the way of seeing things red the question before the house however isor rather ought to be the failure to understand the difference between the two being one of the chief causes of boiler explosions marital discord and drawing in the hope of filling an inside straightnot whether the united states have the right to be displeased at the transaction just concluded between the confederacy and mexico but whether the transaction presents them with a legitimate casus belli this we beg leave to doubt the suspicion lingers that had the united states offered a brass spittoon and a couple of candles value above the price the confederacy agreed to pay him the stars and stripes would now be flying above chihuahua and sonoraand maybe even above the dangerous cacti of lower california as welland there would be a great wailing and gnashing of teeth from richmond with every politician in washington sitting back as sleek and contented as the dog that stole the leg of lamb out of the roasting pan for better or worsemore like for better and worsemaximilians sale of sonora and chihuahua strikes us as having been peaceful and voluntary enough to keep anyone sniffing around the deal from gagging at the smell which in todays diplomacy marks it as something of a prodigy we find it dashed uncomfortable to share a continent with a people who did not care to share a country with us but we had best get used to it because the confederate states show no signs of packing up and moving to the mountains of thibet while we may regret the sale we have not the right to seek to reverse it by force of arms we may have been outsmarted but we were not insulted and being outsmarted is not reason enough to go to warif it were the poor suffering world should never have known its few brieftoo briefmoments when the bullets were not flying somewhere he had hardly laid down his pen before clay herndon came back into the office slamming the door behind him sam have you got whatever youre going to say ready to set in type he demanded news of the ultimatum is already on the street if we dont get into print in a hurry itll outstrip us the ba ha califomian is beating the war drum loud as it can he threw himself into his chair and began to write furiously yes im ready clemens exhibited the sheets hed just finished what did the mayor say sutro herndon didnt look up from his scribbles the way he talks well be in richmond tomorrow atlanta the day after and new orleans the day after that huzzah for our side he sounded imperfectly delighted with the mayors view of the world you were a blaine man last november clay sam reminded him why arent you over at the californian banging the war drum yourself me id love to take the rebs down a peg herndon said but blaines going at it like a bull in a china shop trying to make up for eighteen years in a couple of months there he threw down the pen and thrust paper at clemens heres mine lets see what you wrote sam scrawled a few changes on herndons copy herndon used adverbs the way a bad cook used spiceson the theory that if a few were good more were better in spite of that he said good story it convicted sutro of being a pompous fool with his own words the best way to do it thanks you could have said a plague on both your houses and let it go at that herndon said im glad you didnt though this is more fun the door flew open edgar leary rushed in somebody had knocked a big dent in his hat which he hadnt noticed yet theyre hanging longstreet in effigy at the corner of market and geary the youngster said breathlessly then he took off the derby and exclaimed in dismay the whole towns going crazy he held out the hat as if it were evidence write the piece write it fast sam said he took the pages of his editorial back from herndon sounds like theyre not going to listen to me again he sighed why am i not surprised outside somebody emptied a sixshooter the cartridges going off in quick succession sam hoped whoever it was was shooting in the air newsboys on richmond street corners waved copies of the whig and the examiner the dispatch and the enquirer and the sentinel in the air they were doing a roaring trade lawyers and mechanics ministers and farmers drummers and teamsters and even the occasional colored man who had his letters crowded round them and shoved pennies at them whichever paper the boy on any one corner touted the main headline was the same ultimatum runs out today after that imagination ran riot p resident longstreet to answer latest yankee outrage navy said ready to put to sea navy said to be already at sea troop movements in kentucky yankees said to be concentrating in missouri and one word like a drumbeat war war war general thomas jackson whose business was war rode through the clamor as if through rain or snow or shellfire or any other minor distraction well whip em wont we stonewall a fat man in a butchers bloodstained apron shouted to him we are not at war with the united states nor have the united states declared war against us jackson answered hed said the same thing any number of times since leaving the war department for yet another journey to the presidential residence i hope they do not peace is too precious to be casually discarded like an outgrown suit of clothes that wasnt what the butcher wanted to hear well whip em jackson guided his horse past the fat man without saying anything more he got asked the same question or a variant upon it three more times in the next half block he gave the same answer each time and began to wish he hadnt started answering at all the crush of people thinned as he rode up shockoe hill away from capitol square and the center of town jackson let out a small involuntary sigh of relief he did not care for being trapped in crowds and was often happiest when most solitary duty however came above happiness duty came above everything one of the sentries who saluted him said reckon well lick them damn yankecs goodaint that right sir to a soldier jackson spoke a bit more openly than to a civilian on the street who might for all he knew have been a us spy if we have to fight them corporal rest assured we shall beat them us minister john hays landau was tied up in front of the residence hay these days visited longstreet as often as jackson did and on related business if the ministers talks with the confederate president succeeded longstreet and jackson would no longer need to confer so much hays driver sat waiting patiently for his principal reading a copy of the richmond whig he nodded to jackson then went back to the paper moxley sorrel escorted jackson to the waiting room outside longstreets office mr hay has come to obtain the presidents reply to the ultimatum the chief of staff said in a near whisper there can be only one response to that piece of impertinence jackson growled sorrel nodded the two men did not love each other but both saw the interests of the confederate states in the same light jackson started to say something more but the door to president longstreets office came open out stalked john hay his handsome face set and hard jackson rose politely to greet him hay gave a cold half bow sir i am forced to the conclusion that your president is more inclined to hear your counsel than mine moxley sorrel came over to lead him out to the door he shook off the chief of staff no thank you sir i can find my own way off he went had he owned a tail it would have bristled come in general president longstreet called through the open door thank you your excellency jackson said he closed the door after himself then sat down stiff as usual in the chair to which longstreet waved him by that sir am i to gather that you have told the united states they have no business meddling in our internal affairs james longstreet nodded he looked pleased with himself you are to gather precisely that general had i told him anything else i have no doubt i should be impeached convicted and removed from office by this time next weekand i would vote for my own conviction too and i in turn gather that we are in full readiness to meet any emergency that may arise he asked the same question every time he saw jackson as always the generalinchief of the confederate army nodded yes mr president all regular units arc deployed close to the us frontier save those engaged in occupying our new provinces and general stuart has done more than anticipate along those lines himself he briefly summarized stuarts deployment for longstreet who nodded and then continued and we are ready to accept clothe arm train and deploy volunteers as that may become necessary i fear it will come to that longstreet said i do not fear the result you understand only its being required of us yes your excellency i understand jackson glanced toward the map on the wall to his right as soon as the wires inform our forces that the united states have been so misguided as to declare war on us we shall strike them a blow that wait president longstreet said and jackson obediently halted longstreet looked over at the map too general i must make one thing clear beyond any possibility of misunderstanding regardless of the existence of a declaration of war on the part of the united states they not we must strike the first blow in the ensuing conflict must i say sir must jackson s eyebrows shot upwards mr president do i have to remind you how rash it is to yield the enemy the initiative even for a moment had general lee been content to stand on the defensive i fear we should have been defeated in the war of secession to cap his point he essayed a small joke were this one of the united states sir you might even find yourself a republican these days from which fate god deliver me longstreet said general jackson i do not deny for a moment the general applicability of the rule you state but other factors militate against it in this particular instance do you remember how artfully abe lincoln manoeuvreed us into firing the first shots at fort sumter thereby putting us in the wrong in the eyes of the world it came right in the end jackson said so it did but it made our task more difficult longstreet plucked at his beard i want us to appear unmistakably as the wronged party in the eyes of the world over this affair general is that sufficiently clear or must i explain myself further instead of asking for further explanation jackson went into one of his intense studies he was unsure how long he remained in it not too long for president longstreet didnt seem annoyed i believe i understand sir you particularly desire us to appear the wronged party in the eyes of britain and france just so longstreet nodded we must show them we have done everything in our power to remain at peace with the united states and that the united states thrust war on us nonetheless jackson made a sour face this despite britain s having sent soldiers to canada to reinforce the dominions own army this despite france s having pledged support for maximilian who is her creature this despite both nations having moved naval forces in both the atlantic and pacific to stations from which they might more readily confront the united states this despite its being in the obvious interest of both britain and france to take the usa down a peg this despite most of the money maximilian receives from the sale of chihuahua and sonora s going straight to the bankers in london and paris all these things are true and yet we are still required not merely to show ourselves wronged but to show ourselves blatantly wronged forgive me your excellency but i have trouble seeing any justice there objectively speaking general so do i longstreet said the problem we faceand an all but insuperable problem it has shown itself to beis that britain and france do not and cannot view support for us as objectively as we should like if they can find a reason not to move in concert with us they will find it and take advantage of it they are our allies jackson said they have been our allies they gain by remaining our allies why would they be so foolish longstreet looked at him without replying it was almost a pitying look the sort of look a mathematics instructor gave a scholar who could not for the life of him prove the pythagorean theorem it was a look that said this is why i am the president of the confederate states and you remain nothing more than a soldier jackson had never wanted to be anything more than a soldier as a soldier he could remain an honest man and a godly one he was unsure how much either word applied to james longstreet these days longstreet odds were would die wealthy what would become of him after that was another question and getting that sort of look from anyone godly or not rankled the look said all the pieces lay in front of him if only he would see them after a moment he did they deprecate property in negro slaves to that great a degree sir they do longstreet said they have my pledge to move an amendment to the constitution requiring manumission and to support the amendment and as far as possible to anticipate it through legislative and executive actionand still they hesitate not believing i can accomplish what i have promised jackson who did not think it should be accomplished said i do not see you manumitting your own slaves mr president now longstreets look was a frank and unmistakable glare jackson bore up under it as he had borne up under worse and from men he reckoned better he realized belatedly that he had been less than diplomatic that did not bother him either he was less than diplomatic but then longstreet said general on the successful conclusion of this war i intend to set at liberty all of the negroes now my property i shall at that time urge other members of the executive branch of the government as a whole to do likewise and hope my example will be emulated by private citizens as well you are in earnest in this matter sir jackson said in no small surprise am longstreet said i can look ahead and see the twentieth century with machines performing much of the labour now done by swarms of niggers what will those swarms do then work in factories at no wages and depress the wages of white men become a drain on their present owners purses if we do not keep abreast of the times they will smash us into the dust and yet i see you have trouble believing me and so do the illustrious ministers and governments of our allies thus our need to be irrefutably in the right in our dispute with the usa very well sir jackson said you have made both the issues involved here and your own resolve pertaining to them clearer in my mind than had previously been the case it shall of course be as you say until the yankees are the first to cry haro we shall not let slip the dogs of war by godfrey general i didnt know they had you teaching english literature there at the virginia military institute longstreet exclaimed both men laughed more at ease with each other than they usually were jackson rose to go longstreet rose with him came round the desk and clapped him on the shoulder wait the president told him wait until the yankees hit us firstand then hit em hard jackson s pale eyes glowed yes sir on the parade ground at fort dodge kansas colonel george custer walked curiously around the two newfangled weapons that had just arrived ive heard of these gatling guns before he remarked to his brother but ive never set eyes on one till now the way i hear it gatling invented them about the time the dashed rebs were getting up into pennsylvania and hes been trying to sell them to the army ever since i wonder if i ought to be glad he finally turned the trick major tom custer was giving the guns a dubious onceover too looks like a springfield was unfaithful with a cannon and then went and had sextuplets i thought i was the writer in the family custer said with jealousy mostly mock the description fit six riflecaliber barrels were mounted in a long brass body on a carriage that could have carried a field piece a separate ammunition limber like that which went with a field piece accompanied the gatling too a crew of five served the weapons custer rounded on the artillery sergeant in charge of one gun how many rounds a minute do you say this thing can spit buckley sir when everything is going the way it ought to about two hundred the sergeant answered when everything is going the way it ought to custer echoed and how often is that he didnt really want an answer scowling he went on too many gadgets in the world already if anyone wants to know we should still be fighting with sabersthen we could tell who the real men are his brother pointed to the blockhouses at each corner of the fort if we mount these opposite each other autie we could rake the plain around the fort if the kiowas come callingor if the confederates do maybe custer said fort dodge was on highest alert awaiting a report that president blaines declaration of war on the csa had passed both houses of congress custer scowled wouldnt put it past either the redskins or the rebs to sneak up here and do us dirt while were still supposed to be at peace sergeant buckley said sir give me good horses for my teams and ill keep up with any cavalry you like thats what these guns are for ill believe it when i see it custer said careless of wounding the gatling gunners pride for now well leave these white elephants right where they are maybe well come up with a notion for getting some good out of them by the way he spoke he didnt believe it for a minute sentries paced the walkways on the walls of fort dodge dull routine most days but vitally urgent now they stared out over the prairie in all four directions if those on the southfacing wall were particularly alert custer did not sec how he could blame them he worried though he did his best not to show it against the kiowas the fort would stand forever what a battery of confederate horse artillery might do to the walls though was something else again he stalked back toward his quarters he had a suite of rooms in fort dodge where his troopers made do with a footlocker and a straw tick on an iron bed with wooden slats in the barracks from the walls of his parlors the heads of a buffalo two antelopes and a coyote stared at him with glass eyes hed shot all the animals and mounted all the heads too practice had made him a fine taxidermist a raccoon stared at him from the back of the sofa it was holding an egg in its handlike paws the cook a redheaded irish girl named sal came running in from the kitchen and glared first at the animal and then at custer that is the thievingest creature ive ever seen and why you keep it cannot be guessing she snapped stonewall hes a fine fellow custers voice held more indulgence then he commonly showed his men hed raised the raccoon from an orphaned pup and it had been with him longer than sal he couldnt keep cooks they kept marrying soldiers or local civiliansand if they were pretty as sal was libbie made a point of introducing them to every male around custer was friendly toward women other than his wife libbie sometimes thought he was too friendly drawn by sals complaint about the coon she came out of the bedroom a short plump darkeyed woman close to custers age no matter how friendly he was to other womenand he was as friendly as he could get away withhe loved her unreservedly now she advanced on the raccoon give me the egg stonewall she said in tones that might have sent a regiment into battle she was as firm of will as her husband he sometimes wondered uneasily if she wasnt the smarter of the two of them stonewall however instead of surrendering the egg devoured it sal cursed the animal with fury and fluency custer laughed at the raccoon and at the cook both libbie scowled impartially at beast servant and husband she did not care to have her will thwarted even by a raccoon get back to work sal she snapped still muttering the irish girl returned to the kitchen custer watched her hips work as she walked libbie watched him watching have to find her a man she muttered whats that dear custer asked recalled to himself nothing at all autie his wife answered sweetly what do you think of those new guns that came in earlier this morning not much he said and was about to go into detaillibbie loved details of any sortwhen an orderly burst into his quarters and thrust a telegram at him he unfolded it and read it out loud as of this date state of war exists between united states confederate states prosecute with all vigor victory shall be ours rosecrans he let out a war whoop a kiowa would have been proud to claim then ran out into the parade ground shouting for the trumpeters to blow assembly the men rushed to form up from their drills and fatigues excitement on their facesmost of them guessed what the unusual summons meant when custer read the telegram to the assembled force the men cheered loudest were the shouts from the officers and the veteran sergeants and corporals men who remembered the war of secession and wanted revenge for it well kick the rebs from here to the rio grande tom custer yelled then he remembered the annexation of sonora and chihuahua that had brought on the war and after that well kick em another fifty miles thats right custer said nobody casts scorn on the united states of america nobody do you hear me ive waited almost twenty years for this moment to come and at last its here his voice quivered with emotion more cheers rose for now dismissed soon we start getting our own back buzzing with talk the men returned to their duties tom walked up to his brother autie he said ive got an idea how to get some real use out of those gatling guns if its war all the better custer sent the weapons a mistrustful look i dont think theyre good for much myself if you want to try to convince me im wrong go ahead tom talked for ten minutes straight illustrating his scheme with gestures and with sketches in the dust of the parade ground finishing he said and of course ill command the party its my notion my neck is the one that should be on the line he spoke altogether matteroffactly george custer as brave a man as any recognized a braver in his brother he said no ill lead it i wont send someone out with an untried weapon while i stay home safe lieutenant colonel crowninshield will do a perfectly fine job commanding the regiment while im gone well leave at sunrise tomorrow tom custers grin was enormous yes sir autie sir pick a dozen men to go with us custer said oh and make certain those guns have good horses pulling them and the limbers too well see how they do as they head down toward the border if they cant keep up theyre useless he briefed casper crowninshield on the patrols he wanted set out while he was away the regiments secondincommand looked horrified when he outlined what he would be doing but said very little either custer would come back trailing clouds of glory or he wouldnt come back at all no matter which carping wouldnt matter custer his brother a dozen picked cavalry troopers and the two gatling guns and their crews rode out of fort dodge before the sun was up as the fort shrank behind him custer laughed for joy no need to worry about that blasted international border not any more he said thats right his brother said exuberantly only thing we need to worry about is running into a rebel patrol coming to kick us in the slats before we can get down into indian territory custer and one of the troopers rode out ahead as scouts to make sure that didnt happen without false modesty custer was sure he could outride any of his companions except perhaps his brother when they thought he couldnt hear the men of the regiment called him hard ass it didnt anger him it made him proud he glanced back over his shoulder at the gatling guns they were slowing the party but not by much sergeant buckley had had a good notion of what he was talking about on over the kansas prairie he rode here and there farmhouses poked up from the flat terrain some were dugouts with only chimneys and stovepipes above ground some were of sod blocks some of wood somethe most prosperousof brick sod or wood or brick all had something of a fortress look to themsquat and low with small windows in country vulnerable to indian raids that was safe and smart they camped on the prairie that night boiling coffee frying salt pork and then frying soaked hardtack biscuits sprinkled with brown sugar in the grease from the meat an occasional firefly winked to light then out off in the distance an owl hooted custer rolled himself in his blanket stared up at the stars sprinkled like powdered sugar across the sky and fell asleep almost at once it was still dark when he woke but twilight was turning the eastern horizon gray he shook his brother wake up lazybones tom groaned and thrashed custer laughed hed scored himself a point they passed into indian territory into confederate territorya little before noon custer let sergeant buckley and the gatling guns catch up to him you pick your spot he said you best know the requirements and capabilities of your weapons the artillery sergeant nodded custer hoped the gatlings were capable toward evening buckley chose a gently rising little hillock with a commanding view in all directions the party camped there for the night when morning came the gatling crews stayed behind custer his brother and the cavalry troopers went out looking for streams and for the kiowas villages they were likely to were hoping to find along such waterways they found cattle first the indians herded cattle these days instead of hunting the nearly vanished buffalo at them custer shouted at them they went whooping and waving their hats and shooting their carbines in the air the cattle bellowed in terror and stampeded custer whooped again in sheer smallboy delight at having made an enormous confused mess a bullet made dirt spurt up not too far from him it hadnt come from any of his own men but from one of the kiowas whod been tending the herd custer fired back and missedgood shooting from horseback was next to impossible he waved his men forward against the indian herders the outnumbered kiowas fled their ponies tails bound up in bright cloth bounded over the prairie custer knew they were leading him and his cavalrymen toward more of their comrades he followed as eagerly as the indians could have wanted if he didnt stir up the hornets nest he wasnt doing his job his brother pointed off to the northwest there down by the bed of a creek stood the big village to which the herders belonged tom custer rode straight for it hard as he could go the rest of the cavalrymen george custer among them pounded after him stay away from the horses custer shouted we dont want to stampede the horses if they stampeded the horses the kiowas wouldnt be able to come after them that was the idea custer hoped it was a good idea one way or the other the gatlings would answer that tom custer rode right down what did duty for the villages main street past dogs and children and squaws who all ran like the devil to get out of the way again custer followed his brother past hide teepees painted with bears and bear tracks past screaming women past an old man who fired a pistol at him and missed from a range where he shouldnt have missed a mouse let alone a man out the other side of the village galloped the cavalrymen custer knew theyd just done a very indian sort of thing a wild dash that couldnt help but singe the kiowas pride behind him warriors were rushing to their ponies he fired a couple of rounds at them so they wouldnt get the idea they were doing exactly what he wanted he waved his little troop back to the cast toward the hill on which the gatlings waited if he couldnt retrace his way across the plain he and his men were dead somewhere between fifty and a hundred kiowas were on their trail the indians had fresher horses and thanks to the confederates rifles as good as his own this is the one part of the business i dont fancy tom custer said i dont like running even for pretend in the chase one of the cavalrymen slid out of the saddle another troopers horse went down which meant the soldier was a dead man shortly thereafter the cavalrymen firing over their shoulders hit two or three indians and two or three horses after a couple of hours of hard riding one of the troopers pointed northeast there sir sure enough there atop the little hill waited the two gatling guns and their crews custer spurred toward them the kiowas came on after his men shouting in high excitement they saw the soldiers on the low hillock too but they also saw they still greatly outnumbered their foes the artillerymen at the gatlings waved the troopers on at the crest of the hill dismount as if for a last stand custer called to his riders maybe it would be a last stand the kiowas were close behind up the hill thundered the horses custer did his best to stay out of the gatlings line of fire in case they opened up too soon he reined his blowing lathered mount to a halt and sprang down a bullet snapped past him he shouted to the gunners its your show now boys sergeant buckley and the crew chief of the other gatling sergeant neufeld swung the guns so they bore on the kiowas then they began working the cranks at the rear of the weapons the barrels revolved as each one fired it went around till another cartridge from the brass drum magazine atop the gatling gun was chambered and discharged the noise was astonishing like an enormous sheet of sailcloth being torn in two the smoke from the blackpowder rounds built a fogbank around the top of the hill as a magazine went dry the gun crews took it off and replaced it with a full one when a barrel jammed that gun went silent for a moment to clear a cartridge or clean away the worst of the fouling but for the most part buckley and neufeld cranked and cranked and cranked custer peered through the drifted smoke the kiowas might have run headlong into a stone fence theyd been in easy range before the gatlings opened up and they hadnt had a prayer more than half their band more than half the horses lay still and dead in front of the two guns the rest were riding off as fast as they could go they were brave but they hadnt been ready for what theyd just come up against god bless my soul custer said softly sergeant neufeld was also looking out through the smoke but to the east sir he called to custer more riders they look like rebs not indians let em come sergeant custers voice was gay from no confidence in the gatlings hed swung to the other extreme plenty for everyone isnt there and the confederates came in their shoes custer would have done likewise they had a companys worth of men a couple of dozen yankees on a noaccount hilltop get rid of em and start the war in style if the rebels noticed the dead kiowas they paid them no heed they should have as they came galloping toward custers little detachment the gatlings began their deadly ripping noise again troopers and horses went down as if scythed custer and his companions added the fire of their carbines to the mechanical murder the gatling guns dealt out like the kiowas the confederates meeting weapons they hadnt imagined broke and ran custer walked over to neufeld and slapped him on the back then he did the same with buckley this may not be sporting he said but its no humbug chapter a lfred von schlieffen rode toward the long bridge the most important bridge from washington dc down into confederate virginia he had no trouble making his way south from the german ministry many though far from all of washingtons civilians had fled north when war broke out and so traffic was less oppressive than it would have been before the crisis boys still hawked newspapers on the street from their frantic shouts some us officer named custardschlieffen didnt think that could be right but it was what he kept hearinghad singlehandedly massacred a division of confederates and a whole tribe of indians somewhere out beyond the mississippi in a leap of logic that escaped the german military attache the war was as a result supposed to be as good as won as yet the war had not made an appearance around washington the confederate states could have pounded the capital of the united states to bits but had not fired a shot hereabouts neither had local us forces despite big talk president blaine was proving more circumspect when it came to action but the confederates had let it be known they were sending an officer across the long bridge under flag of truce at noon today schlieffen noticed he was not the only military attache heading toward the bridge he nodded to major ferdinand foch his french opposite number the frenchman coolly returned the courtesy like schlieffen he had fought in the francoprussian war schlieffen wondered how long foch would be welcome here the british military attache was not in evidence but before long his assistant a captain still on the eager side of thirty rode up alongside major foch and began trying to converse with him in french unfortunately the englishman knew less of the language than he thought the pauses in the conversation grew longer and longer get out of our country you damned redcoat somebody shouted at the assistant military attache who was indeed decked out in his dress reds he tipped his hat to the heckler schlieffen nodded slightly admiring his panache if not his skill with languages almost but not quite in a groupschlieffen hung backthe three foreign officers rode south through the agricultural grounds west of the smithsonian institute then west along maryland avenue toward the long bridge now schlieffen could see the positions of the confederate guns trained on the capital of the united states he had also seen in amongst the trees us guns ready to reply more us guns were positioned on the high ground north and west of the city and elsewhere around it if the confederates tried to seize washington those guns could make it an expensive business at the us end of the long bridge waited captain saul berrymangeneral rosecrans adjutanta few soldiers and hannibal hamlin the us secretary of state in his black suit the jacket unbuttoned in the humid heat to expose a large expanse of white shirtfront hamlin resembled nothing so much as a rolypoly old penguin captain bcrryman nodded to schlieffen as he dismounted he did his best to pretend the british and french military representatives servants of unfriendly powers did not exist they took up positions where they could see and remain inconspicuous church bells on both sides of the potomac began announcing noon as they did so a confederate officer on a black horse rode north over the long bridge carrying a small white flag as he drew near schlieffen saw by the red trim on his uniform that he was an artilleryman i am colonel william elliott he announced and i bear a proposal from president longstreet and general jackson seeking to avoid the needless effusion of blood captain berryman and secretary hamlin introduced themselves hamlin said say what you will colonel the united states do not and shall not condemn unheard any such proposal hamlins accent was different from elliotts almost as different as a bavarians from a berliners like president blaine the secretary of state came from maine as far from the border of the confederacy as any place in the eastern usa thank you sir elliott said believing it obvious then that the united states cannot hope to defend washington dc against the sanguinary bombardment the confederate states have it within their power to unleash at any time the president and the generalinchief ask in the name of humanity that you declare washington an open city and permit its peaceable occupation by confederate forces otherwise they cannot answer for what will ensue i can speak to that captain berryman said quickly almost treading on the heels of elliotts last words general rosecrans has ordered me to reject categorically any such proposal if you want washington colonel you arc going to have to fight for it and thats flat i am sorry to hear you say that captain colonel elliott said i had hoped to be able to avoid visiting destruction on this lovely city youd hoped to get it for nothing berryman replied im sorry to disappoint you but thats not going to happen colonel the british captain said do please remember that legations of powers friendly to your nation are located within this city with his upperclass accent he swallowed more syllables than the us secretary of state and the confederate colonel put together we shall make every effort to strike only military targets elliott said hannibal hamlin said in any case this is irrelevant due to the outrageous and unacceptable nature of the notes president blaine received this morning from the ministers of great britain and france the government of the united states is declaring all diplomatic personnel of those two nations to be personae non gratae in this country arrangements to return the lot of you to your own nations are already under way as a neutral power the german empire may be well suited to arrange those transfers in both directions schlieffen said thank you sir hamlin answered i believe one of my assistants has an appointment with the german minister to discuss that very arrangement schlieffen inclined his head he had exceeded his authority by making the suggestion but you never could tell what the americans might overlook this is your final reply captain william elliott asked when berryman nodded the confederate artillery officer rode back toward his own country as soon as he was off the long bridge berryman walked over to a telegraph clicker schlieffen hadnt noticed and rapidly tapped out a message a couple of minutes later an explosion smote the air flame and a great cloud of black smoke sprang from the us half of the long bridge which crashed down into the potomac moments after that other explosions rang out to the east and west no doubt severing the rest of the bridges linking the usa and csa weve already burned our bridges behind us captain berryman said with a jaunty smile now were blowing them up in front of us captain majorhe spoke to the british and french officersi request and require you to return to your ministries at once that you may be evacuated with your fellow nationals my men will accompany you to see that this is done colonel schlieffen i impose no such order on you but you might be wise to return to the german ministry anyhow surely the confederates will not make it a target no doubt you are right schlieffen said he clambered up onto his horse and rode back toward the red brick building on massachusetts avenue the prussian army had shelled and starved paris into submission then he had been on the giving end of the bombardment now he might learn what he had given out a column of wagons heading east along g street held him up us cavalrymen guarding them made sure they had the right of way general rosecrans rode in a buggy near the head of the column heading for the train station no doubt had the confederate gunners chosen that moment to open up they could have beheaded the us army whether or not that would have made it stupider than it was already schlieffen was not prepared to say a couple of blocks after that as he was about to urge his horse up into a canter a little girl of six or seven darted into the street in front of him he brought the horse to a halt before any harm was done the girls mother hauled her back and spanked her saying be careful nellie watch where youre going im sorry ma the girl blubbered schlieffen sympathized with hershe reminded him of his own daughters back in germany but only to a point she had to learn discipline as soon as he did get back to the ministry he asked to see kurd von schlozer the minister had served in washington since germany united under wilhelm i and understood the united states far better than schlieffen did very unfortunate schlozer said now running a hand over his glistening bald pate the americans have a gift for antagonizing all their neighbors and they have chosen this moment to exercise it i urged restraint on them but they would not listen they never listen i have seen the same thing schlieffen answered as you say unfortunate not the slightest notion of forethought and because they are so stubborn they find themselves encircled the german minister said they do not have a bismarck who has kept french jealousy from wrapping germany in similar cords captain berryman this morning spoke of notes from england and france to the government of the united states schlieffen said have they declared war not in so many words schlozer told him they demanded the united states cease all military action against the confederate states within twelve hours on pain of war schlieffen weighed in his mind the forces on either side the united states might be wiser to accede to this demand they will not sadly schlozer shook his head president blaine sees that the united states are larger and richer than the confederate states and that is all he sees no european powers have fought in north america since england and the united states had a brush during the napoleonic wars blaine i fear does not fully understand what he is getting into i think you are right your excellency schlieffen said general rosecrans called the notes outrageous and rosecrans himself when i spoke with him before had made no preparations for war against britain and france even knowing such was not only possible but likely americans insist on improvising as if the spur of the moment will itself impel them to find the right answer kurd von schlozer sighed like a judge about to pronounce sentence and a harsh sentence at that on a likable rogue until they learn to think before they act they will not be taken seriously on the stage of the world please furnish me by tonight with a written report on what you saw and heard at the long bridge so that i may cable it to berlin yes your excellency schlieffen went up to his stuffy office and drafted the report after giving it to the ministers secretary he went back up and studied for a while the confederate general lees move up into pennsylvania the stroke that had won the war of secession for the csa lee had faced inferior opposition no doubt of that but the move an indirect rather than a direct threat to washington showed considerable strategic insight the north americans were raw but not all of them were stupid schlieffen expected the confederate guns to open up on washington at any moment but they stayed quiet inefficient he thought but then checked himself maybe the confederate states were waiting for their allies formally to join the war before commencing offensive action of their own again not the worst strategic notion he went to bed still wondering and did so with a perfectly clear conscience if anything happened he would know about it dawn was breaking when the bombardment began schlieffen sprang out of bed threw on his uniform and hurried up to the roof of the ministry other buildings around it were of similar height impeding his view but he saw more there than he could have anywhere elseand his ears told him some of what he could not sec great clouds of smoke rose from the south and the southwest from the confederate batteries on the arlington heights and elsewhere along the potomac us guns were answering too not only the big cannon in the fortresses that had surrounded washington since the war of secession but also field guns in the city itself and down by the river shells made freighttrain noises through the air he judged the weight of fire to be about equal if anything the usa might have held a slight edge so his ears said at any rate but what did it matter the us guns could chew up confederate emplacements in virginia but nothing more meanwhile though the confederate cannon still in the fight were wrecking the capital of the united states he heard only artillery no rifle fire that meant the confederate states werent trying to throw infantry across the potomac had he been in charge in richmond he would have held back too with the small professional army that was all the confederates had in the field at the moment they would have taken casualties they could not afford shelling washington was in any case a largely symbolic act for which artillery more than sufficed it was also a destructive act schlieffen watched confederate shells exploding around some of the fortresses in the hills back of the city he also heard them landing to the south and the southeast around the white house with the war department next door to it and the us capitol smoke rose from both directions schlieffen went downstairs for a moment returning with a pair of field glasses peering southeast through them he nodded to himself not all of those shells over there were coming down near the capitol others farther away pounded the navy yard by the eastern branch of the potomac in the streets panic reigned people who hadnt fled the city were all trying to leave at once now schlieffen hoped the little girl his horse had almost run over was safe a tire engine bell clanging did its valiant best to force its way through the crush its valiant best wasnt nearly good enough an errant confederate shell landed less than a block away from the german ministry it started a tire the fire engine could not get to that one either the firemen cursed as their big horses went forward by inches schlieffen breathed in gunpowder smoke like a man gauging the bouquet of a new bottle of wine after a moment he shrugged too soon to judge the quality of the vintage yet but it was a war the queen of the ohio steamed up the river for which she had been named frederick douglass impatiently paced her deck shed had a disgracefully long layover in evansville taking on wood and shed been bucking the current ever since cairo he didnt want to be late for his speaking engagement in cincinnati i should have taken the train he muttered but he shook his massive head whenever he traveled to a city on the northern bank of the ohio he went by steamboat that way standing by the port or starboard raildepending on whether he was going downstream or uphe could look into confederate kentucky the green gently rolling land looked no different from that on the ohio side of the river the shadow lying over it unlike the one over smoky st louis was not real to douglass that made the shadow no less palpable no less oppressive on the southern bank of the river millions of his brethren suffered in bondageand most of his own countrymen did their best to pretend those suffering millions did not exist not far away from douglass a white man and his wife were staring into kentucky too he warmed to the worried expressions on their faces not all us whites ignored the plight of the negro in the confederate states then the woman said jack are you sure its safe to travel on the ohio with the war on safe as houses sweetheart jack said reassuringly and patted the womans hand he was wearing a flashy brownandwhite checked suit and a derby with a feather in the hatband someone who wanted to impress the ignorant with an importance he didnt really possess douglass guessed he was certainly doing his best to impress his wife in a loud pompous voice he went on if the rebs were going to make a real fight theyd have done it by now you ask me they dont have the stomach for it last night we got past louisville all right didnt we and look how that custer chewed them up out west was it texas or the indian territory i misremember they had got past louisville and the falls of the ohio without trouble true enough one reason theyd got past without trouble was that theyd used the canal on the indiana side of the river the one painfully excavated through solid rock after the war not the louisville and portland canal in confederate kentucky douglass understood that even if jack didnt the queen of the ohio rounded a bend in the river just past madison indiana jacks wife pointed to the riverbank on the kentucky side those are guns she said guns they were indeed douglass recognized them four twelvepounder napoleons leftovers from the war as guns went these days they werent anything special neither were the troops who manned them by their illfitting gray uniforms they were kentucky militiamen not confederate regulars at all antique cannon amateur soldiersan armored gunboat would have slaughtered the men and wrecked the guns in a matter of minutes the queen of the ohio was anything but a gunboat you yankee boat surrender one of the kentuckians shouted across the water the sidewheeler flew a large us flag come aground on this here bank we got to search you to make sure you aint carrying troops and then youre a prize of war frederick douglass quickly went down to the main deck and toward the steamboats bow if he had to swim for it he didnt want to have to swim around the boat before striking out for the northern bank of the ohio nothing could have induced him to stay aboard if the boat grounded itself in confederate territory if those militiamen caught him they would sell him into slavery hed been free for more than forty years all his adult life he was ready to die trying to stay free before going back into bondage surrender the militiaman shouted again when the queen of the ohio kept steaming along the fellow turned to his battery and waved the gun crews had been standing around watching the sidewheeler now one crew sprang into action are they going to shoot at us an unshaven deck passenger in dirty overalls asked they cant his equally grubby female companion answered they wouldnt the napoleon roared flame and smoke belched from its muzzle the cannonball splashed into the river in front of the steamboat the gun rolled backwards with the recoil the artillerymen began reloading the other three crews were serving their pieces too that one was a warning the kentuckian shouted to the queen of the ohio surrender or we blow yall out of the water passengers cried out in alarm and dismay from the pilothouse up above came an order delivered with such furious vehemence that it cut through the rising din tie down the safety valves and pour on the ether get us the hell out of here an order like that meant the steamboat was liable to explode even if the boiler didnt take a hit from the confederate guns douglass couldnt have cared less he clapped his hands together applauding the captains good sense surrender for him was unthinkable the sooner they got out of range of those napoleons the better the rest of the battery opened up on the sidewheeler in earnest this time one ball whizzed over her a clean miss another went into the river just short of her throwing water up onto douglass and the other passengers standing nearby the third carried away the top couple of feet of one smokestack the rebels jumped up and down as if theyd sunk the queen of the ohio their commanders furious yells set them to swabbing out and reloading again my god jacks groans from above reached douglass ears what do we do i think wed better get down onto the main deck his wife answeredshe evidently had sense enough for both of them if the boat catches fire well have to go into the river passengers by the score flooded out of the steamboats cabins and salons down the stairs and onto the main deck some went to starboard to stare across the river at the militiamen shooting at them some ran to port as if they were assured of safety because they couldnt see the confederate guns from there those guns proved any such safety illusory a moment later a ball slammed into the queen of the ohio superstructure and tore through the boats timbers as if they were made of pasteboard a fusillade of screamssome womens some mensfrom the port side said the ball had torn through one of the passengers too dear sweet jesus somebody shouted if we take a hit in the boiler this whole damn boatll go up like it was filled with powder that had already occurred to douglass he wondered if it had occurred to the confederate gunners too maybe to them it was all good fun like boys gigging frogs but the frogs died in earnest and so would a couple of hundred civilians if the rebs chanced to make a lucky or rather an unlucky shot or if in their exertions to flee the battery the crew overstrained the boiler and it went up without being hit on the heels of that thought came another even worse how many guns await us around the next bend of the river the negro orator asked the heavens shut your mouth you damn nigger snapped a white woman who looked like somebodys maiden aunt douglass fell silent but that didnt matter if one battery of guns was out along the ohio scores would be us guns as well as cs he supposed but the confederate cannon were the ones that worried him boom wham a cannonball slammed into the steamboats starboard paddlewheel wood splinters flew one of them stabbed a man who shrieked like a damned soul the wheel kept turning though now it put douglass in mind of a man smiling with a missing tooth under his feet the queen of the ohio quivered like a racehorse suddenly given the whip she fairly leaped forward in the water great gouts of smoke and sparks poured from her newly uneven stacks the riverbank seemed almost a blur such was the sidewheelers speed but the boats fastest clip was a pathetic creep when measured against the speed of a twelvepound iron ball more splashes around the queen of the ohio said the crews firing at her were not masters of their trade but more crashes and screams said they didnt need to be masters to score hits have we got a doctor on board somebody shouted then another shout rose far more terrible fire not all the smoke shrouding the steamboat was coming from the stacks not any more she was built of wood and bore many coats of paint one of those hits from hot iron might have ignited her or a cannonball might have spilled the coals from a stove in the galley or broken a kerosene lamp or when he thought about it douglass realized how many unpleasant possibilities there were buckets somebody shouted the pump someone else yelled douglass hadnt known the boat carried a pump but it was irrelevant anyhow peering back he saw the whole stern of the queen of the ohio engulfed in flames a glance told him no one would be able to put out that fire a glance must have told the steamboat captain the same thing the queen of the ohio turned hard to port making straight for the us bank of the river a steward shouted brace yourselves folks were going to ground and were going to ground hard soon as we do everybody off by the bow gentlemen help the ladies please he might have been talking about dance figures not a matter of life and death the queen of the ohio ran aground with force surely great enough to tear the bottom out of hernot that that mattered at the moment douglass had been grasping a pillar the impact tore his grip loose he landed on one hand hard scrambling to his feet he struggled toward the rail a drop of about ten feet separated the deck from the muddy riverbank may i assist you maam he asked the woman closest to him the sour spinster whod cursed him for daring to suggest the confederates might have more guns along the ohio than this one battery she climbed over the rail nimble despite her long skirt and petticoats and jumped down on her own without even bothering to give him a no a woman of strong convictions he thought others were not so fussy about letting him take their pale hands in his dark ones and letting him put his black arms around their waists to help them down to safety some of them even thanked him after a while the white man next to him said well sambo i reckon its about time we light out for the tall timber ourselves douglass didnt think the fellow intended to offend he likely would have called someone from the emerald isle mick or a jew abe in the same way classification not insult whatever the case there he was right despite the best efforts of the men fighting the flames they were racing forward the crackling roar dinned in douglass ears he could feel the heat on his skin and through his clothes a hot cinder landed on the back of his hand with an oath he brushed it away he looked around to make sure no women were left on the sidewheeler he saw none when he looked back the man whod called him sambo had already gone over the rail other men shoved forward intent on doing the same douglass decided he could honorably leave he swung over the rail sat on the very edge of the bow and jumped he landed heavily in the mud going down to one knee and fetching up against someone whod abandoned the queen of the ohio a moment before i beg your pardon sir he said picking up his hat dont mention it the man said god damn those cursed rebels to hell as if to punctuate his words another cannonball screamed past a man landed right behind douglass staggered and trod on his toes he didnt bother to excuse himself douglass said perhaps we should get clear of this vicinity to let those escaping the steamboat more readily descend in safety no one argued with him which was a pleasant novelty limping a little he walked away from the sidewheeler he didnt look back all he had left here were the clothes on his back and they were muddy and torn hed had no more when he fled his master and then hed had nothing more anywhere now he was comfortably well off and only a telegram away from being able to draw on his resources rebs mustve thought the boat was a troopship somebody not far from him said that made a certain amount of sense the us and the cs both moved soldiers by steamboat maybe theyre just a filthy pack of stinking bastards somebody else said savagely to douglass that made sense too a lot of sense he was always ready to believe the worst of the confederate states whatever they are the whole ohio s gonna be shut down as tight as a mans bowels with an opium plug up his ass the first man said that was crude but true without any doubt whatsoever if one side started shooting at steamboats the other surely would and one other thing was also true without any doubt whatsoever he was going to be very very late to cincinnati the handbasket rattled toward helena get up there theodore roosevelt called to the horses they snorted resentfully as he flicked the reins and cracked the whip above their backs not only was he making them go faster than they usually did on a trip to town they were pulling a heavier load from the back of the wagon esau hunt said easy boss easy slow down well get there quick enough any which way the other five farmhands who sprawled in the back with him loudly agreed only philander snow had chosen to stay back at the ranch and hed already seen the elephant the rest of the hands like hunt like roosevelt himself were young men one and all im not going to slow down for anythingnot for one single thing do you hear me roosevelt declared our country needs us and i intend to meet the call and to meet it as quickly as i possibly can cant meet it if you drive us off the road into a ditch said charlie dunnigan another hand roosevelt didnt answer he didnt slow down either when he conceived in his own mind that something needed doing he went and did it and he didnt waste time about it either he came up on another wagon heading toward helena but not fast enough to suit him he didnt have much room between the road and the trees alongside it there but he pulled out and passed leaving the other driver to cat his dust the fellow shouted angrily roosevelt waved his hat in a derisive salute thats showing him boss hunt exclaimed roosevelt grinned though he didnt turn back to show the hand he was pleased straightforward action that was the ticket people who accomplished anything in this world grabbed with both hands if you didnt you got left behind with your face dusty this time roosevelt steered away from the gazette office when he got into helena heading toward the territorial capitol farther south and cast i only hope they still have slots open for us he said for about the dozenth time since setting out then he went on again for the dozenth time by thunder if they havent got any well make our own thats what well do doesnt look packed to the rafters anyway dunnigan remarked sure enough roosevelt had no trouble hitching the buggy close to the capitol he saw no line snaking out of the small stone building either is patriotism dead everywhere in the country save my ranch alone he demanded not of the farmhands but perhaps of god he leaped out of the wagon tied up the horses and led his men toward the capitol as they charged up the steps a man he knew came out jeremiah paxton a neighbor i know what youre here for roosevelt he said the same thing i was or im a chinaman you aint gonna have any better luckn i did neither what do you mean roosevelt asked all paxton said after that was youll find out he spat into the dirt then strode over to his horse untied it from the rail swung up onto it and rode back toward his ranch his stiff back radiated disgust with the world follow me theodore roosevelt said he led his men up the steps to the capitol as if they were charging to the crest of an enemyheld hill stopping the first person he saw inside who looked as if he belonged there he asked where in blue blazes do i find the volunteer office hereabouts third door on the lefthand side the man answered but i have to tell you roosevelt pushed past him as hed pushed past the slow wagon he opened the third door on the lefthand side which was indeed emblazoned us militia with an obviously new addition below amp vol unteers inside the little office sat two clerks the brass namcplatc on the closer ones desk proclaimed him to be jasper st john good day to you mr st john roosevelt boomed these gentlemen and i are here to offer our services to the us volunteers high time we taught our highhanded neighbors not to get gay with the united states of america jasper st john did not look like a clerk except for spectacles much like roosevelt s he looked like a barroom brawler his voice was a bass rumble we arent accepting applications right now what roosevelt dug a finger in his ear as if to assure himself he was hearing correctly youre not taking volunteers why the devil arent you we havent got any orders to do it st john returned stolidly good god in the foothills now roosevelt clapped a dramatic hand to his forehead were at war with the confederate statesby what ive heard theyre shooting up everything that moves on the riverswere at war with england and france and for good measure were at war with the dominion of canada have we declared war on ourselves too is that why we dont want volunteers in the montana territory volunteers are only being accepted at us army posts jasper st john said this is by order of the secretary of war as received here when war was declared against the confederate states roosevelt felt ready to explode but there arent any forts within fifty miles of helena he shouted i understand that st john was as unmoving as a hilltop fortress i can only follow the orders i was given you are not the first patriotic citizen ive had to turn away believe me mr st john sir use your reason roosevelt said doing his best to keep a rein on his temper that order may possibly have made some sense when we were at war with only the confederate states i do not say it did i deny it did but it is a point on which reasonable men might differ i understand that we are a long way from the southern confederacy here in montana but good god in the foothills mr st johnhe was shouting again not for the life of him could he keep from shouting againthats canada right up over the border there has anyone back in washington bothered to look at a map since england and the dominion declared war on us if they put a proper army over the border the handful of regular troops we have in the territory wont be able to stop them theyll hardly be able to slow them down let us suppose for the sake of argument that i accept you and your friends here as us volunteers mister st john paused roosevelt theodore roosevelt now youre talking sir roosevelt said enthusiastically but the clerk shook his head no not yet he said im just beginning if i do that you still will not be us volunteers because i have no authority to make you such and as soon as the people above me find out i have done it they will give me the sack for exceeding what authority i do have you will be no better off and i will be worse do you see my trouble now i see it all right roosevelt said breathing hard the trouble is youre one hidebound papershuffler in a regime full of petty papershufflers if your sort is the best this nation can afford to send out to the territories we deserve to lose this war a stronger and more able race will supplant us here as surely as we have supplanted the savage red man roosevelt s farmhands burst into cheers jasper st john remained unmoved thats very pretty mr roosevelt he said and paused to spit almost accurately at the cuspidor next to the desk of the other clerk who with his papers seemed oblivious to the argument its very pretty st john repeated you could run for the territorial legislature on it no two ways about that but it cuts no ice with me i have not the power to do what you want good day he inked the pen that had been lying on his desk ready to go back to his own bureaucratic minutiae god damn it you stupid fool i am trying to help my country roosevelt yelled slowly st john put down the pen slowly he got to his feet he was half a head taller than roosevelt and looked half again as wide through the shoulders and i he said pointedly am tired of being shouted at no matter how much you want to help your country i am not authorized to help you do it regardless of his size roosevelt was about to punch him in the nose he would have felt the same had he been in the office alone that he had his men with him never entered his mind but something else did so the punch remained unthrown then ill raise my own troops he exclaimed roosevelt s unauthorized regiment thats what ill call em his men pounded him on the back and shouted themselves hoarse do whatever you please jasper st john said do it somewhere else come on boys roosevelt said well show him not everybody in montana territory is stuck in the mud as they left the territorial capitol roosevelt s mind whirled with plans if he was going to recruit the unauthorized regiment he would have to wire back to new york for money the ranch though profitable didnt make nearly enough to support a project of that size he didnt think he would have to arm the men he raised not with winchesters as common as weeds out here a winchester didnt have the range or stopping power of an army springfield but with their tubular magazines winchesters put more bullets in the air than singleshot springfields the regiment could take its chances there he would have to feed and shelter the men till such time as the unauthorized regiment really did pass under us control and not men alonewell be a cavalry regiment of course he said as if hed known as much all along no use pounding along wearing out boot leather thats it boss esau hunt said first class all the way thats how the unauthorized regiment goes the nucleus and at the moment the entire membership of roosevelts unauthorized regiment piled into roosevelt s ranch wagon he was he knew thinking in capital letters he drove over to the gazette office more sedately now than before the horses hadnt had a chance to cool down fully during his brief unfortunate visit to the capitol at the newspaper he bought a large advertisement seeking recruits for the unit he was forming roosevelt s unauthorized regiment said the printer who took down the text he dictated i know they arent accepting volunteersi triedbut this here may light a fire under them roosevelt interrupted and even if it doesnt ill still have the troops to present to the us army ill also want you to print up some handbills with the same information as goes into this advertisement can you hire someone to paste them up here in town sure can the printer said but itll cost you two dollars extra per five hundred ill take a thousand roosevelt declared i dont want a man to be able to walk down any street in helena without seeing one of them a thousand should do it the man in the inkstained apron said nodding thatll be ten dollars for the advertisement eight for the handbillswell print from the same type so ill cut you a break on that would be ten otherwiseand four more to paper the town with em comes to twentytwo altogether colonel roosevelt had already tossed a double eagle and two big silver cartwheels onto the counter when that registered by jingo he said softly if he was raising the regiment he would be its colonel that was how things had worked in the war of secession and the rules hadnt changed since he stood straighter and pushed out his chest though hed never fired a shot at anything more dangerous than a coyote suddenly he felt as one with washington and napoleon and zachary taylor a leader of men a conqueror this was what he was meant to do with his life he could feel it in his marrow hed already felt a couple of other callingswriter rancherin his marrow during his twentytwo years on earth but so what hed obviously been mistaken then he wasnt mistaken now he couldnt be mistaken now lets find a saloon boys he said in helena that was harder than finding air to breathe but not much he had his choice only a few doors away from the gazette he and the farmhands strode into the silver spoon drinks on me he yelled which made him friends in a hurry let me tell you about roosevelt s unauthorized regiment gents if youll be so kind his new friends listened why not he was buying up in front royal virginia far to the northwest of richmond general thomas jackson felt like a man released from prison once real fighting started hed taken advantage of it to escape from the capitol to the front line president longstreet hadnt liked that decision not even a little jackson smiled at the memory of how disingenuous hed been but your excellency hed said surely the telegraph can bring me the same intelligence in the field as it can far behind the lines here it can also convey to me any instructions you have as to the prosecution of the war and i shall gain the important advantage of viewing some segments of the action at first hand you dont fool me a bit longstreet had answered you want to get out from under my thumb and you want to get back into a camp having been a garrison soldier for more years than he cared to recall jackson had picked up a certain measure of guile mr president my desires whatever they may behe was not about to admit that longstreet had hit the nail on the headare of no importance all that matters is the countrys need can you deny my proposal possesses military merit try as he would old pete longstreet hadnt been able to deny it and so jackson was encamped just north of front royal in charge of a confederate force that had fallen back in the face of the larger yankee army that had come out of west virginia and maryland and was now occupying winchester near the head of the shenandoah valley more than the confederate defenders had fallen back half the civilian populationhalf the white civilian population at any ratehad fled winchester before the invaders their tents and leantos were scattered promiscuously over the ground around the neat rows of gray and butternut canvas that marked the confederate bivouac jackson did not like having to deal with civilians they clogged the roads and they were eating up a good part of the supplies that should have gone to his men and they possessed not the slightest clue about discipline or order he feared lest they infect his troops with their chaotic stridency he also did not like his position front royal sat at the confluence of two branches of the shenandoah an enterprising us commander could move artillery to the high ground on either side of the town much as jackson himself had done against the united states during the war of secession fortunately the yankees seemed so impressed with having taken winchester as to have no notion of trying anything more at the moment that let jackson enjoy the luxury of sitting on the top rail of a fence outside front royal and sucking on a lemon while he contemplated ways and means of doing unto the yankees before they did unto him it also let a plump middleaged civilian in a cutaway coat and a stovepipe hata gentleman who if he was half so important as he thought himself to be was a very important fellow indeedcome up to him and say see here general you simply must do something about the outrageous illegal and immoral way the damnyankees are confiscating our property the first thing they did sir the very first thing on marching into our fair city was to proclaim the liberation of every last nigger in winchester outrageous i say i agree with you jackson said they werent so blatant about it in the last war but we had much property stolen then in the fashion you describe well sir what do you propose to do about it the refugee from winchester demanded ive lost thousands thanks to their thieving ways thousands i tell you how much do you suppose the nation has lost jackson asked the importantor at least selfimportantman stared at him as the general had thought concern for the nation had never entered his mind he cared only for himself jackson went on the best remedy can conceive sir is retaking winchester from the united states then their actions are no longer of any consequence to us that wasnt strictly true as he knew negroes who had been told they were free would believe it they might try to escape to the usa though the yankees were anything but eager to have them there if returned to bondage they would surely prove fractious and unruly president longstreet jackson reflected unhappily might well have known what he was about when he proposed manumission what the devil are you doing perched there chawing on that damn thingthe man in the stovepipe hat pointed to the lemon jackson was holdingwhen you could be liberating the city contemplating the best way to liberate it deliberately jackson began sucking on the lemon again the plump man went right on expostulating jackson used the lemon as an excuse not to say another word he looked through the fellow from winchester not at him the man took a long time to get the message but finally did he went away muttering dark things under his breath an orderly trotted up jackson did acknowledge his existence telegram for you sir the soldier said and handed him the sheet jackson rapidly read through it a brigade of volunteer infantry on its way up here eh he said that would better than double his force he liked what hed seen of the volunteer regiments in richmond before leaving for the action they had a solid leavening of men in their late thirties and early forties war of secession veterans to help show the younger men what soldiering was about thats good thats very good then abruptly he stared through the orderlynot with intentional rudeness as he had with the plump man but because his mind was for the moment elsewhere still clutching the telegram he went back to the twostory brick house that served him as headquarters and also as home for his family his son jonathan was outside playing with a dog at fifteen jonathan was just too young to go to war and wild with frustration because of it whats up sir he called jackson did not answer him jackson hardly heard him jonathan shrugged and threw the stick again hed seen his father like that many times before the general went inside several young officers in the parlor sprang to stiff attention they were not studying the map spread over the table there they had been chatting with his pretty daughter julia who waswhere did the time goheading toward nineteen under his gaze the officers soon found urgent reasons to go elsewhere father julia said reproachfully she enjoyed the attention she got no more answer than had her brother and flounced off in some dudgeon jackson never noticed he studied the map for a while traced a railroad line with his finger and finally grunted in satisfaction his wife had come into the parlor to sec why julia had left so abruptly he walked past anna without seeing her either only when he got to the telegraphy office did he recover the power of speech send a wire at once to rectorstown he told the operator before whom he stood the troops en route hither must disembark from their trains there on the eastern side of the blue ridge mountains he continued with a detailed stream of orders which the telegrapher wrote down at last he finished the utmost celerity must be employed to reach point named by time required now read that back to me young man if youd be so kind yes sir the telegrapher said and did jackson nodded his thanks and left the headquarters of colonel skidmore harris who had been in command in the northern shenandoah valley till jackson arrived were next door harris was a stringy middleaged georgian who had commanded a regiment in longstreets corps during the war without preamble jackson told him colonel i have taken away from this army the brigade of volunteer troops bound this way from richmond harris pipe sent up smoke signals im sure you have good reason for doing that sir he said his tone suggesting longstreet would hear about it in a redhot minute if anything went wrong i do jackson went over to the map harris had nailed up to a wall and did some explaining when he was through he asked is everything now perfectly clear to you colonel yes sir harris puffed on the pipe if the yankees dont take the bait though then the bait will take them jackson said we shall advance at first light tomorrow colonel prepare your troops for it i desire divine services to be held in each regiment this evening that the men may assure themselves the almighty favors our just cause have you any questions on what is required of you no sir in meditative tones colonel harris went on now we get to see how the new looseorder tactics work out in action yes jackson was curious about that himself firing lines with men standing elbow to elbow and blazing away at their foes had taken gruesome casualties from the rifled muzzleloaders of the war of secession against breechloaders which fired so much faster and against improved artillery they looked to be suicidal on paper the system the confederate army had developed to replace closeorder drill in the face of the enemy looked good jackson knew wars were not fought on paper had they been general mcclellan would have been the greatest commander of all time dawn tomorrow the general in chief reminded skidmore harris he left before the colonel could reply that evening as the soldiers prayed with their chaplains jackson prayed with his family lord he declared on bended knee into thy hands i commend myself absolutely trusting that thou grantest victory to those who find favor in thine eyes thy will be done he murmured a favorite hymn show pity lord oh lord forgive he slept in his uniform as had been his habit during the war of secession anna woke him at halfpast three gracias senora he said his wife smiled in the darkness he put on the oversized boots he favored jammed on his slouch hat and went off to war without another word long columns of men in new butternut uniforms and oldfashioned gray ones were already on the move north before the sun crawled over the blue ridge mountains winchester was about twenty miles from front royal the yankee lines a few miles south of the town theyd taken if not for those lines he could have been in winchester before sundown he hoped to be there by then despite them one advantage of the early start was getting as far as possible before the full muggy heat of the day developed even on horseback jackson felt it sweat cut rills through the dust on the faces of the marching men dust hung in the air too it made gray uniforms look brown but also let the yankees if they were alert know his forces were advancing on them the men rested for ten minutes every hour their weapons stacked otherwise they marched field guns and their ammunition limbers rattled along between infantry companies at a little past twelve the soldiers paused to eat salt pork and corn bread and to fill their canteens from the small streams near which they rested after precisely an hour they headed north again just after theyd moved out a messenger galloped up to jackson from front royal and pressed a telegram into his hand he read it permitted himself a rare smile and then rode over to colonel skidmore harris the volunteers colonel arc threatening winchester from the east by way of both ashbys gap and snickers gap he said they report considerable and increasing resistance in their front which means the us commander in winchester has surely pulled men from in front of us in order to contest their advance having done that he will find some difficulty in also contesting ours colonel harris tilted back his head and blew a large excellent smoke ring id say thats about right sir they dont have all that many more men than this army doesnot enough to turn two ways at once and take on two forces our size had jackson been in winchester with a force not greatly inferior to the one attacking him he would not have retreated in the first place but that was water over the dam now onward he said us forces had dug a line of firing pits about half a mile south of kernstown a few miles below winchester jackson smiled again this time savagely in the war of secession the yankees had thrown him back from kernstown hed waited more than nineteen years to pay them back but the hour was at hand their guns opened on his troops at a range of better than a mile and a half his artillery swung off the roads and went into battery in the fields to reply at the same time his infantry deployed from column into line moving with the drilled smoothness that showed how many times the regulars had bored themselves carrying out the manoeuvre on the practice field the line wasnt much thicker than a skirmish line had been during the war of secession to a veteran of that war it looked gossamer thinuntil one noticed how many rounds the men were firing as they advanced and how thick the blackpowder smoke swirled around them a division of soldiers in the earlier war would have shown no more firepower than this light brigade but the yankees had breechloaders too their springfields were a match for the confederate tredegars their commanding officer had left no more than a regiment and a half behind even so jackson feared for the first few minutes of the fight that the yankees with the advantages of position and cover the defender enjoyed would beat him at kernstown again his men had less practice at advancing by rushes and supporting one another with fire than at closeorder drill and at shifting into the looser formations from which they could attack the galling enemy resistance served to concentrate their minds on the task at hand better than weeks of exercises might have done after close to an hours fighting the first confederate soldiers leaped down into the yankee field works off to jackson s left that let them pour enfilading fire along the length of the us line once the position began to unravel it soon disintegrated us soldiers in dark blue emerged from their trenches and fled back toward kernstown confederate small arms and artillery took a heavy toll on them more yankees threw down their rifles and threw up their hands in surrender guarded by jubilant rebels they shambled back toward the rear we have a victory sir colonel harris said jackson fixed him with a coldly burning gaze we have the beginnings of a victory colonel i want the pursuit pressed to the limit i want those yankees chased out of kernstown out of winchester and back to harpers ferry and martinsburg i want them chased across the potomacthat part of west virginia should never have been allowed to leave the state of virginiabut am not certain we can bring that off in this assault still if we put enough fear in the us forces they will skedaddle well see how far they run harris stared at him you dont want to just lick the damnyankees sir he said as if a lamp had suddenly been lighted in his head you want to wipe em clean off the slate why of course jackson stared back astonished the other officer should aim at anything less if they face us the volunteer brigade will take them in the flank if they face the volunteers we shall take them in the flank if they seek to face both forces at once we shall defeat them in detail now let the thing be pressed pressed it was the us troops retreated straight through kernstown the locals clapped their hands when jackson rode through the hamlet the yankees tried to make a stand at winchester but pulled out just before sunset the racket of rifle fire coming from the east said the volunteers were at hand their commander a bespectacled fellow named jenkins rode up to jackson in the middle of a wildly cheering crowd in winchester though jackson saw not a single colored person on the streets what do you want us to do now sir he asked weve about marched our legs off but your men wont fall over yet jackson said we head north as long as there is light as soon as it grows light in the morning we go on our task is to drive the foe from our soil and i do not intend to rest until that is accomplished he drew his sword and pointed with it dramatic gestures were all swords were good for these days but dramatic gestures were not to be despised jenkins looked as astonished as colonel harris had south of kernstown and then as exalted he turned to his troops and cried you hear that boys you see that old stonewall wants us to help him run the damnyankees clean out of virginia i know youre worn down to nubs but are you game the volunteers howled like catamounts the veterans of the war of secession had already taught their younger comrades the fierce notes of the rebel yell jackson waved his hat to thank the men for their show of spirit then pointed with the sword once more through the shrill yells he spoke one word onward there were abraham lincoln reflected undoubtedly worse places in which to be stranded than salt lake city technically stranded was the wrong word hed had several speaking engagements canceled because of the outbreak of war and had decided to stay where he was till more came along the mormons who made up the majority of the population were unfailingly polite and considerate to him whatever he thought of their religious beliefs they were decent enough and to spare even so he felt more at home among the gentiles the miners and merchants and bureaucrats who leavened the town and surrounding countryside most of them especially the officials were democrats but that still left them closer to his way of looking at the world than were the mormons who thought in terms of religion first and politics only afterwards they wish wed all go away gabe hamilton said at breakfast one morning at his hotel they wish wed never come in the first place matter of fact he popped a piece of bacon into his mouth then turned to the waiter whom he knew isnt that right heber im sorry mr hamilton i wasnt listening heber said blandly can i get you and mr lincoln more coffee yes thanks hamilton told him whereupon he went away sighing the sharp little gentile spoke to lincoln what do you want to lay that every word he wasnt listening to goes straight into john taylors ear before the clocks chime noon i dont know what mr taylor is in the habit of doing of a morning lincoln answered that aside id say youre likely right or which of his wives hes in the habit of doing it to do you mean hamilton said winking mormon polygamy roused some people to moral outrage it roused others to dirty jokes so far as lincoln could tell it left no one not a member of the church of jesus christ of the latterday saints indifferent he said i am glad to have had the chance and taken the opportunity to have learned more about other aspects of the mormons way of life while here i did not know for instance that they formerly practiced what might be described as a communistic system during their earlier years in utah you mean the deseret store hamilton waited for lincoln to nod then went on id call it syndicalism myself people brought their tithes to the store and it sold what they brought to whoever needed it the churchand that meant the governmentkept some of the profit too brigham young didnt die poor mr lincoln ill tell you that i expect youve seen the lion house the long long building where he housed his wives one could hardly come to salt lake city and not see it lincoln paused to eat a couple of bites of tasty ham i do thank you by the way mr hamilton for arranging lectures hereabouts to tide me over and help keep me going until other engagements come through think nothing of it sir nothing at all hamilton replied youre educating the workers about labour and capital and youre educating everybody else about the war i cant think of anybody whod know more about it who doesnt wear stars on his shoulders the proper relation of labour to capital has concerned me since before the war of secession lincoln said nor has defining and if need be regulating it grown less urgent since the war the mormons seem to employ the strictures of religion to lessen its harshness but i do not think that a solution capable of wider application the mormons are the godly pious folk we profess ourselves to be thats a fact gabe hamiltons eyes twinkled they wont skin each other exploit each other the way capitalists door the way they do with gentiles come to that what they skin each other out of is wives he couldnt leave that alone few of the gentiles who lived in utah territory could leave it alone from what lincoln had seen that was why utah had several times failed of admission to the union as a state although the book of mormon spoke against it the latterday saints would not renounce polygamy while those outside their church could not countenance it after looking around to make sure heber the waiter was out of earshot hamilton said im just glad the confederates have even less use for the mormons than we do if they didnt utah would rise up right in the middle of this war and thats a fact remembering some of the things john taylor had said at their supper meeting lincoln replied dont be too sure they wont rise up on their own taking advantage of our distraction with the csa and with the european powers i think president blaine was shortsighted to pull the soldiers out of fort douglas here he didnt care whether or not heber took his words to john taylor he rather hoped the waiter would to let the mormon president know someone wondered about his intentions he did not mention that he also found blaine shortsighted for involving the usa with england and france in his administration hed done everything he could to keep the european powers out of the struggle against the confederacy everything he could had not included enough victories to keep the confederate states from bludgeoning their way to independence id be glad to have some bluecoats around myself ill tell you that gabc hamilton said sometimes i thought they were the only thing keeping the mormons from riding roughshod over us theyve behaved themselves well thus far lincoln said laternot much laterhe would remember the optimistic sound of that so they have hamilton said grudgingly as if he were talking about a spell of good weather in late fall something pleasant but unlikely to last remembering brigham youngs loyalty during the war of secession lincoln dared hope the gentile was worrying over nothing after breakfast lincoln said mr hamilton would you be kind enough to drive me to the western union office i want to send my son a wire id be happy to sir hamilton said whats your son do if you dont mind my asking robert hes a lawyer in chicago a lawyer for the pullman company as a matter of fact lincoln s long lugubrious face got longer and glummer and he doesnt approve of his old pas politics not even a little he doesnt his expression lightened just a bit we dont let that come between us though not for family things we arent so foolish as usa and csa you see hamilton chuckled appreciatively i like thatthough the rebs wouldnt to hear them talk theyre as old as we are and the only tie is that they decided to stay in the same house with us for a while before they moved on to a place of their own i prefer to think of it as knocking down half our house and using its floors and walls to build their own a rueful smile creased lincoln s face of course the confederate states dont care what i think as he rose from the table he stuck up a forefinger in selfcorrection no thats not quite so really gabriel hamilton raised an eyebrow i didnt reckon youd have to qualify that statement in any way shape form color or size color is the proper term lincoln said i have heard that certain of my writings are popular with the handful of educated negroes in the confederacy their races labour being exploited even more ruthlesslyor perhaps just more openlythan any in the united states isnt that interesting hamilton said how do they get hold of your speeches and articles and books do you suppose unofficially lincoln answered picking up his stovepipe hat and going outside i am given to understand that my works are on the index expurgatorum for negroes in the csa along with those of marx and engels and other european socialists i hope you will forgive my taking a certain amount of pride in the company in which they place me he climbed up into hamilton s carriage you deserve to be there hamilton unhitched the horses and got into the carriage himself wont be but a couple of minutes he said flicking the reins were just four or five blocks away lincoln coughed a couple of times at the dust the carriageand all the other buggies and wagons and horses on the streetkicked up it tasted of alkali on his tongue dust was the biggest nuisance salt lake city had you can drop me off if you want to go on about your own business he told hamilton when they got to the telegraph office i expect i can find my way back to the hotel without too much trouble its no bother for me mr lincoln hamilton guided the horses toward a hitching post as he got down to tie them he frowned the doors to the office should be open maybe theyve got them shut to try and keep the dust out but thats a fight they lose before its started is that a notice tacked to the door frame lincoln walked over to the western union office and read the handwritten words all lines out of utah territory are down at the present time we hope to be able to start sending telegrams to the rest of the usa again soon we regret any inconvenience this may cause the former president took off his hat and scratched his head what in the dickens could make all the telegraph lines from herenorth south east and westgo haywire at the same time not what mr lincoln gabriel hamilton sounded thoroughly grim the right question is who who could make all those telegraph lines go haywire at the same time he looked around as he had back in the hotel dining room as if expecting to find hebcr the waiter lurking behind a cottonwood tree as for what the right answer is i give you one guess lincoln turned his head in the direction of the enormous granite bulk of the rising temple why would john taylorwhy would the mormonswant to shut down telegraphy between utah and the rest of the country because theyre up to something that wont stand the light of day hamilton suggested at once i couldnt begin to tell you what that might be but ill bet its nothing i want theyd be very foolish to try that lincoln said the united states may be distracted by this war but not so distracted as to be incapable of dealing with a rebellion here he clicked his tongue between his teeth like south carolina utah is too large to be an insane asylum and too small to make a nation and unlike south carolina lacks other nearby states full of zanies to join her in her madness a man on a horse came trotting up he dismounted and hurried toward the closed door in front of which lincoln was standing sorry pal gabe hamilton called to him office is closed you cant send a wire but i have to the man exclaimed i was supposed to be on the train for san francisco and it couldnt leave the station theres some sort of break in the tracks west of hereand from what i heard people talking about theres one to the east too uhhuh hamilton said as if the fellow had proved an obscure point and one to the north and one to the south somewhere too what a surprise eh mr lincoln all at once lincoln didnt feel stranded in salt lake city any more he felt trapped chapter j eb stuart led his troopers north out of sonora and into new mexico territory now that the united states and confederate states were at war his opinion was that the best way to keep the usa from invading the new confederate acquisitions was to make us forces defend their own land hed managed to stay in touch with richmond through a spiderweb of telegraph wires across the sonoran and chihuahuan desert back to texas he reckoned that a mixed blessing as it deprived him of fully independent command but he had heard not a word of reproof from the war department on his plan to move into the united states not likely that you would is it sir major horatio sellers said with stonewall jackson heading up the army do you mean stuart said with a grin youre right about that major no doubt about it stonewall will never quarrel with a man who goes toward the enemy thats what i meant all right stuarts aidedecamp checked his map sir are we going to strike tombstone or contention city contention city stuart said at once thats where the stamping mills and refineries are for the ore and thats what we want where the mines are doesnt matter what comes out of them is what counts you think we wont get a pat on the back if we bring home a few tons of refined gold and silver ore just might sellers said dryly it wasnt might both men knew as much the confederate states were shorter than they cared to be on precious metals the united states had far more in the way of mineral wealth which helped keep their currency sound the csa relied on commerce to bring in most of their gold and silver well this was commerce too commerce of a different and ancient sort a scout came galloping back to stuart sir looks like the damnyankees have some soldiers in that there contention city he reported cant rightly tell how manydont look like a whole lot but they wont be showin all the cards theyve got neither the way he spoke gave stuart an idea he turned to his aidedecamp major sellers will you be so kind as to ride into contention city under flag of truce and ask the yankee commander to ride back here for a parley with me you wont get back before nightfall i expect but thats all right its better than all right as a matter of fact tell him i desire to prevent any useless bloodshed on his part and so will not fall upon him with the overwhelming force at my disposal yes sir ill tell him major sellers said obediently he looked around at the cavalry riding with stuart theyd left the infantry behind for the dash up into the united states begging your pardon if hes got more than a couple of companies entrenched around that town this isnt an overwhelming force not now it isnt stuarts voice was light and gay it will be by tonight when everyone joins us just you make certain you dont bring the yankee commander back here till after full dark ten oclock will be perfect yes sir sellers said again still obedient but very puzzled he knew as well as stuartmaybe better than stuartno other confederate soldiers would or could join them not for the next several days he was scratching his head as he rode north after the scout stuart shouted orders to his trumpeter who blew halt the cavalry troopers reined in as bemused as major sellers theyd been pushing hard toward their goal and couldnt imagine why their commander was stopping them in the middle of this godforsaken desert their confusion only increased when stuart said well make camp here boys he gave more orders after that by the time he was through the troopers confused no more fell to with a will one of them said any day we get to knock off early is a good day by me as the work progressed they discovered they hadnt knocked off early after all they kept at it though fired by the same enthusiasm as had filled stuart when the idea came to him he sent scouts out well in front of his force so they could intercept major sellers and the us commander if he chose to come if he didnt a lot of work was being wasted well before they reached the camp instead of pitching his own tent near the center of the encampment as he usually did he had it set at the northern edge and made sure the scouts knew as much as the sun went down the men lighted their fires sagebrush and greasewood the staples of campfires farther north werent so common here but the troopers had scoured the desert roundabout for what they could find and had also cut down a good many of the cottonwoods and mesquite trees growing alongside the san pedro river at this season of the year the san pedro was as thin and lethargic a stream as the rio grande but it kept the trees alive firelight gleamed off cannons reflected palely from tent canvas and showed row on row of tethered horses and camels the latter being closer to stuarts shelter men lined up to get their tin plates filled from the pots hanging over cookfires and carried beans and salt pork and hardtack back toward their tents with every sign of satisfaction halting in midafternoon had let the cooks do a proper job of boiling the beans instead of serving them up as hard little bullets as they so often did at five past ten a scout led major horatio sellers and an officer dressed in the dark blue wool of the us army up to jeb stuart general sellers said allow me to present to you lieutenant colonel theron winship commander of the us forces in contention city very pleased to make your acquaintance stuart said politely shaking hands with the us officer a sunbrowned fellow in his early forties with a neat blond beard stuart waved to the fires and tents behind him i have no doubt of the courage of your soldiers sir but as you see we are present in such force as to make any resistance on your part not only foolish but suicidal winship turned and stared not far away a camel brayed a hideous almost unearthly sound winships eyes swung to the beast and fixed on it for close to half a minute then he surveyed the camp again general he said at last his voice hoarse had anyone told me you had even a brigade here id have called him a liar to his face how the devil you managed to move a whole goddamn division so far and so fast is beyond me my hats off to you sir fitting action to word he removed the broadbrimmed black felt from his head i wouldnt have believed it myself major sellers said solemnly stuart was about to kick him in the shins when he redeemed himself by adding but the general can do just about anything he sets his mind to ive seen that winship said his voice gloomy i was in the army of the potomac when he rode all the way around us during the seven days turning to stuart he asked what are your terms for the surrender of my force sir about what youd expect men to stack arms and yield up all ammunition you and your officers may keep your sidearms very well theron winship looked at the acres of campfires at the men moving from one to another at the rows of tents at the rows of animalswith another lingering glance of disbelief at the camelsand at the ranked field guns stretching back toward and into the night under the circumstances thats generous enough accept excellent stuart said briskly major sellers will accompany you back to contention city to make sure you are complying with the terms well see you by eight tomorrow morning be ready to travel then they shook hands again horatio sellers looked back toward stuart stuart kept his face bland as grits without butter with a grunt sellers and lieutenant colonel winship rode north toward the yankee garrison when stuart announced to his men that the us officer had surrendered their cheers and rebel yells split the night as soon as it was light enough to travel they rode up the san pedro to contention city they reached the refining town before stuart had said they would he was glad to see the yankee troops hadnt burned any of the stamping mills or refineries he hadnt mentioned that when discussing the surrender with lieutenant colonel winship for fear of putting ideas in his head winship had his men drawn up in formation waiting for the confederates he had eight companies of infantry there and a battery of field guns fighting from cover he could have put up a formidable resistance when stuart came up to him the us officer looked puzzled where are the rest of your men sir he asked have you detached them for duty elsewhere having obtained my capitulation stuart knew he should have answered yes to that to increase winships confusion but he couldnt resist the temptation to tell the truth lieutenant colonel this is my entire force winship needed a moment to take that in when he did he went purple under his coat of tan why you goddamned son of a bitch he shouted which made his own men stare at him you hoaxed me if id known this was all the men you had idve foughtand idve whipped you too i doubt it stuart said on the whole truthfully winship could have hurt him but he didnt think the us officer could have kept him out of contention city if he had a mind to break in he grinned at the furious winship it doesnt matter anyhow not now it doesnt youre under my guns sir you hoaxed me winship repeated as if ruses of war were not permitted let me unstack my guns general and fight it out fair is fair and this isnt you got my surrender under false pretenses yes and im going to keep it too stuart said cheerfully my men worked long and hard to set up that camp and all those fires last night if you think im going to waste what they did lieutenant colonel you can think again it isnt right winship insisted he kept staring at the confederate soldiers who were taking charge of his men as if still convinced there should have been five times as many of them as there were his company officers on the other hand were looking at him jeb stuart would not have been happy were he on the receiving end of those looks more of his troopers including a couple who knew a good deal about mining went into the refining works they came out with enormous smiles on their faces general were going to make us a hell of a lot of money on this little visit one of them called to stuart load up some wagons then stuart answered he detailed guards to try to make sure the profits accrued to the confederate states rather than to individual soldiers what are you going to do with us theron winship asked it was a good question most of the defenders of contention city were infantrymen they would have as hard a time keeping up with his troopers as his own foot soldiers would have done reluctantly he decided he had to take them down into sonora even so if i parole you youll still be able to fight indians and free up other men to fight us he told winship youll come along south with us and probably sit out the rest of the war in hermosillo if that prospect appealed to the us officer he concealed it very well general youve just made a hash of my military career he said bitterly thats too bad stuart answered if things had gone the other way though you would have made a hash of mine since those are my only two choices i know which one id pick if i had my druthers and since i do since he did his soldiers methodically plundered the mineral wealth of contention city then set fire to the stamping mills and refineries with great clouds of black smoke rising behind them they started south down the san pedro river toward the border between new mexico territory and sonora they didnt push the pace now not with prisoners marching on foot and the sun blazing down from the sky even as things were men and animals suffered from the heat it wasnt nearly so humid as it would have been back in new orleans or richmond but it was fifteen degrees or so hotter than it would have been back east which rendered the advantage meaningless to stuarts disappointment they didnt reach the deceitfully oversized camp with which hed fooled theron winship before darkness forced a halt to the days travel the confederate commander was proud of his work and wanted to show it to winship in detail whether the man hed gulled would have appreciated it never crossed his mind stuart had already fallen asleep when major sellers came into his tent and shook him back to consciousness sorry to bother you sir he said while stuart groaned and sat up on his folding bed but theres some indians out there want to have a powwow with you scouts bring cm in stuart asked pulling on his boots uh no sir his aidedecamp answered one second they werent anywhere around next thing anybody knew they were right in front of your tent they could have come in if theyd had a mind to they said theyve been watching us all day and we never set eyes on them once theyre good at that stuart remarked he stepped out into the night sure enough half a dozen indians stood there waiting some with us springfields the rest carrying winchesters the oldest of them a stocky fellow in his late fifties or early sixties let loose with a stream of spanish stuart unfortunately knew none one of the younger indians who had a look of the older saw that and translated my father likes the way you tricked the bluecoats he wants to fight the bluecoats at your side he has been fighting them alone too long more talk from the old man this time in his own gurgling tongue again the younger one spoke for him he wantssanctuary is that the wordfor his band of the dineh the apaches you would say in sonora like the confederacy gives to the tribes in the indian territory who right against the usa when sonora belonged to mexico the bluecoats would chase us over the border the confederate states are strong and will not let that happen we will fight for you because of this does he stuart said will you whoever the old indian was he had an astute understanding of the way the confederacy dealt with the indian tribes along the us border if he had any power he might make a useful ally even if he was only a bandit chief his men would make useful scouts stuart spoke carefully to the younger indian tell your father i thank him tell him that because i am new in this country i do not recognize him by sight no matter how famous he may be but perhaps i will know his name if he gives it to me the younger indian spoke in apache when he fell silent his father nodded to stuart then pointed to his own chest geronimo he said riding over the prairie somewhere between wichita and the border with the indian territory and the confederacy colonel george custer was in a foul mood i have the thanks of congress back in my quarters at fort dodge he said to his brother there up on the wall where everyone can see it and what is it for i ask you he answered his own question for going after the enemy and hitting him a good lick it was your idea i know but im the one with the eagles on my shoulders so the scroll came to me dont fret yourself about that autie tom custer said he was not and never had been jealous of his older brother plenty of chances for glory to come our way not when were doing what were doing custer ground out the rebs poked at wichita once so we have to gallop back and forth to make sure they dont do it again i tell you it makes us look like a prizefighter covering up where he got hit last instead of doing any punching himself and for what for wichita he clapped a hand to his forehead in florid disbelief its not much of a town tom agreed not much of a town custer said not much of a town if it werent on the railroad it wouldnt have any reason for existing oh the rebs shipped a few cows through there ten years ago when they were still pretending to be nice fellows but they gave that up a good while ago now it just sits there bleaching in the sun like any old bones and we have to defend it he rolled his eyes we have to defend the railroad line and the telegraph too tom said custer sighed his brother had advanced the one irrefutable argument without the railroads and the talking wire travel and information in the united states would move as slowly as they had in the days of the roman empire even bereft of the confederate states the united states were too vast to let roman methods work trouble is custer said if we try to defend the whole line of the railroad that ties up so many men we cant do much else in these parts i know tom answered if its any consolation to you autie the rebs have exactly the same problem in texas the only way i want the rebs to have my problems is for them to have problems i give em custer said which made his brother laugh i dont want any problems myself and theyre welcome to as many i dont have as they like he waved back toward the two gatling guns which werent having any trouble keeping up with his troopers the men werent going flat out of course and hed taken pains to make sure the gatlings had fine horses pulling them tom understood his gesture perfectly saying yes thats the kind of problem the rebels should have all right those guns mowed them down same as they did to the kiowas one of custers men let out a yell the colonels first glance was to the southwere they about to collide with the confederates he looked around for a rise on which to site the gatling guns what had worked once would probably work twice but he saw no rebel horsemen nor indians either more troopers were calling out now and some of them pointing north custer spied a courier riding hard for the regiment he waved to the bugler who blew halt the men reined in a couple of them took advantage of the stop by getting out their tobacco pouches and rolling cigarettes bringing his lathered horse to a halt the courier thrust an envelope at custer urgent sir he said saluting from brigadier general pope up at fort catton custer stared at him good god he said thats all the way up in nebraska the troopers close enough to have heard him started buzzing with speculation he didnt blame them why the devil was general pope reaching down to the border with the csa only one way to find out custer tore the envelope open and read the orders it contained when he was done he read them again they still said the same thing no matter how hard a time he had believing it whats the news autie tom custer demanded impatiently we the whole regiment including the gatlings are ordered to report to fort catton as expeditiously as possible custer knew he sounded numb he couldnt help it in the slang of the war of secession this was a big thing and no mistake a regiment of volunteer cavalry will take over patrolling here in southern kansas fort catton on the platte tom sounded as bewildered as his brother felt its a couple of hundred miles from here and a couple of hundred miles from any fighting too why dont they send the volunteers there i dont know it says well get further orders when we arrive custer pointed to the courier you there corporal do you know anything more about this no sir the horseman answered a simple but uninformative reply what in the blue blazes does general pope want with me custer muttered he wondered if it dated back to his service on mcclellans staff during the war of secession pope and little mac had been fierce rivals then after lee whipped pope at second manassas lincoln had relegated pope to fighting indians in the west and hed been here ever since of course a little later on lee had whipped mcclellan even worse up at camp hill that relegated the whole war to the ash heap so pope was in a sense already vindicated well have to find out when we get there thats all tom said he worried less about army politics than his brother did if it was a legal order he would obey it and that was that and it was a legal order no questions there custer muttered again this time something libbie would not have approved of but libbie was in fort dodge who could guess when he would have the pleasure of sleeping in the same bed with her again he raised his voice and called out to his troopers we are ordered to fort catton men and to leave the defense of the plains to others through the surprised exclamations the horsemen sent up he went on we are ordered to reach the fort as quickly as we can by the speed with which we arrive i want to show general pope what sort of men he is getting when he calls upon the fifth regiment the troopers raised a cheer and set out to the north with a will not all of them were disappointed to ride away from the dangers of combat fort catton lay by the confluence of the north platte and south platte across the river from the union pacific tracks from southern kansas custer and his command reached it in a week the pace told on the menand even more on the horses had custer had to go much farther he could not have pressed so hard but the surprise the sentries at the fort showed when he and the regiment arrived made up for a lot of weariness and discomfort he found himself ushered immediately into brigadier general popes office pope was a handsome man of about sixty who wore his hair longthough not so long as custer did and had a fine silver beard i am altogether delighted to see you here so promptly colonel he said in a deep rumbling voice hed had a reputation for bombast during the war of secession and hadnt changed since reporting as ordered sir custer said the orders you sent me said i would receiver further information on coming here and so you shall pope declared colonel president blaine has named me military governor of utah territory the mormons there are this far this far colonelhe held thumb and forefinger together so they almost touchedfrom open revolt against the authority of the united states they have cut off rail service through the territory and telegraphy as well i am charged with restoring them to their allegiance to the usa by any means necessary and i intend to do exactly that yes sir i see sir custer hadnt heard anything about what the mormons were up to but hed been in the field and then on a forced march trying to take advantage of our being busy elsewhere are they a cowards trick sir if you care anything for my opinion that is my precise view of the situation colonel pope said beaming i aim to bring them to heel and to keep them from perpetrating any such outrage in the future weve tolerated their evil sensuality far too long and what is our reward disloyalty well thanks to it they have placed themselves beyond the pale i am assured on highest authority that whatever i do will be accepted as long as they are reduced to obedience very good sir custer breathed a silent sigh of relief that arguments left over from the war of secession were not what had brought him here now to find out what had how does my regiment fit into your plan sir i am assembling an army with which to occupy the territory especially the essential rail lines pope said custer remembered his own recent thoughts on the importance of railroads pope went on you and your men have already shown you can do good work and as regulars are more reliable than volunteer units and i have noted your success with the gatling gun i aim to overawe the mormons to demonstrate how futile any resistance to my might must be many of them no doubt have rifles but they have no artillery to speak of and they have no gatlings once they see the destructive power of these weapons they will be less inclined to try anything rash and more likely to suffer if they do yes sir custer said enthusiastically he hesitated then asked and if they persist in their foolishness sir if they attempt to resist us by force of arms if they are so stupid colonel then we wipe them off the face of the earth pope sounded as if he looked forward to such a result thats what weve done with the savages who presumed to challenge our expansion over the western plains and thats what well do with the mormons if they resist us they deserve destruction even more than the redskins for they are not primitive by nature but rather men of our own stock corrupted by a wicked perverse and licentious doctrine yes sir custer said again having come out of mcclellans camp with the natural bias of little macs staff officers against the young napoleons rivals he had never imagined john pope to be a man of such obvious and evident good sense if they transgress against the moral code universally recognized as correct and legitimate on their heads be it well said pope was studying custer with some of the same surprise with which custer had eyed him after coughing once or twice the brigadier general said i hope you will forgive my saying this colonel but i had not expected us to see so many things in so nearly the same light if the general will pardon me sir neither had i custer answered i suspect we are both bound by the prejudices of the past impulsively custer thrust out his hand pope clasped it custer went on the only enemies i recognize as suchthe only enemies i have ever recognized as suchare the enemies of the united states of america i think we shall work very well together then for my attitude is the same in every particular pope said his smile which showed a couple of missing teeth was not altogether pleasant do you know who happens to be in salt lake city at the moment colonel when custer shook his head pope took no small pleasure in enlightening him abraham lincoln i have it on good authority from the war department is he by thunder custer said well theres the first good reason ive heard yet for letting the mormons go their own way john pope stared at him then threw back his head and roared jovian laughter thats good colonel thats very good indeed it hadnt occurred to me but i suppose its true that those who were of general mcclellans party have as much cause to deprecate the capacity of our former chief executive as i do myself plainly hed forgotten nothing over the years neither his rivalry with mcclellan nor his humiliation at being so ignominiously sent to the sidelines after failing against lee and jackson custer said sir i dont know of any us officer serving during the war of secession who does not have good cause to deprecate the capacity of honest abe such as it is i do know that the only good thing ive had to say about the republican party in all the years since is that theyve finally given us the chance to have another go at the confederate statesand now the mormons are trying to interfere with that this time pope reached out to shake custers hand colonel whatever hard feelings may have existed between us in the past i am suddenly certain we shall work together very well indeed custer beamed at him he was suddenly certain of the same thing pope took a bottle and a couple of glasses from a desk drawer he poured amber liquid into the glasses then passed one to custer down with the mormons and with abe lincoln too im normally teetotal general but how can i resist a toast like that custer drank the whiskey it burned his throat hed drunk hardly at all since the war of secession manfully he didnt cough in his stomach it was warm philadelphia struck alfred von schlieffen as being a real city a city with past present and future washington dc had always given him the impression of existing in a world of its own slightly skewed from the rest of the planet because it had sprung ex nihilo from the wilderness by government fiat it lacked many of the irregularities and imperfections that made cities interesting and different from one another and existing as it had for a generation under the guns of the confederate states washington had also felt impermanent as if it was liable to be smashed to bits at any moment and so it has been schlieffen murmured some of the staff of the german ministry remained behind in washington the confederates had not tried to occupy it and their bombardment was desultory these days schlieffen and kurd von schlozer had come north though the military attache to maintain his connections in the war department the minister to offer whatever services in the cause of peace he could to president blaine and to represent the interests of great britain though not those of france with the us government grudgingly schlieffen conceded that the war departments move from washington up to philadelphia had gone more smoothly than hed expected but he said to the german minister after the two of them had settled into offices at the headquarters of the german consul in philadelphia a prominent sausage merchant but i say your excellency they were madmenmadmen i tell youto delay so long one wellplaced confederate shell and the united states would have had no war department left i am not saying you are mistaken colonel schlieffen schlozer paused to make a production of lighting a large smelly cigar the larger and smellier the cigar the better he liked it i am asking whether it would have made much difference in the way the united states arc conducting the war if they were suddenly bereft of this department seeing general rosecrans leaving washington schlieffen had wondered the same thing now he considered the question objectively as he had been trained to do while serving on the general staff do you know your excellency it is very possible that you are right the generalinchief has not the competence to serve in his capacity that is your judgment to make colonel but it is not precisely what i meant in any case kurd von schlozer blew a meditative and rather lopsided smoke ring the individual american or the small group of americans has far more ingenuity and initiative than the individual german or small group of germans but we are much better at harnessing many small groups to work together for a common purpose the americans might be better off without anyone trying to impose order on them for they do not take to it well you have said several things on this order schlieffen replied thoughtfully if you are correct this country must be doomed to anarchy before too long i would call that a pity the americans situation on this continent having so much in common with our own in europe if they would set their house in order they might make valuable allies schlozer agreed they might make allies of sorts in any case but they would be worth more if they regimented themselves better this is true of anyone schlieffen said as if quoting gods law from deuteronomy trying to be charitable he went on even we prussians needed to put our house in order after napoleon defeated us defeat is often a salutary lesson schlozer said nodding of course a generation ago the united states were defeated in the war of secession and seem to have learned little from that they made an even greater point of antagonizing britain and france this time than in the previous war i wonder what the confederate states have learned schlieffen said they are full of americans too they have learned at least one thing the united states have not the german minister replied he waited for schlieffen to make a polite interrogative noise then went on they have learned to make alliances and to make those alliances last the folk of the united states are so crossgrained this seems not to have occurred to them and that the confederate states can do it is certainly part of the resentment the united states bear against them foolishness schlieffen said like a man judging the antics of a neighbor who while a good enough fellow could not keep from getting drunk three nights a week if the united states are not strong enough to do as they desire by themselves they need allies of their own the last allies they had were france and spain in their war of rebellion against britain schlozer said since then they have lost the knack for making them they lived alone behind the atlantic and like a woodcutter alone in the forest forgot how to make friends with others now with the confederate states bringing alliances to the american continent the united states need to relearn the arts of diplomacy he sighed they have not yet taken this lesson to heart if they learn the lessons of war well enough the lessons of diplomacy matter less schlieffen said one corner of his mouth twitched a gesture of irony as dramatic as any he permitted himself they have unfortunately shown no great aptitude for the lessons of war either it is a pity kurd von schlozer said also a pity that i have not yet been permitted to observe any of the war save the confederate bombardment of washington and that observation was not thanks to the good offices of the government of the united states schlieffen said as you requested colonel i have laid on the carriage for you today so that you may go down to the war department and protest once more schlozer said for this i thank you very much schlieffen said it is important that i do observe and report my findings to the fatherland weapons have advanced considerably since we fought the french as with the late war between the russians and the turks what we learn here will apply to any future conflicts of ours the russians and turks were less than strategically astute i must say and so are the usa and csa but still i have in the past heard you speak well of confederate strategy and tactics schlozer said compared to those of the united states yes schlieffen said compared to ours no and then because he was a judicious man he added on the whole no some of what they do shows a certain amount of insight i admit he took his leave of the german minister of the united states and went downstairs where the carriage was indeed waiting for him gustav kleinvogels sausage factory and therefore the german consulate and therefore for the time being the german ministry were in the appropriately named germantown district north of philadelphia s city center it was also appropriate schlieffen thought as he got into the carriage for politics and sausage making to be so inextricably mixed as bismarck had observed in neither did it pay to examine too closely the ingredients that went into the final product washington s reason for being was or perhaps had beengovernment philadelphia had been a thriving port and industrial center for many years before the results of the war of secession forced big chunks of the government of the united states to move north away from the muzzles of confederate cannon factories belched black smoke into the air so did the stacks of steamships and trains bringing raw materials into the city and taking away finished goods schlieffen looked on the smoke with approval as a sign of modernity in philadelphia the war department operated out of a building of muddybrown brick northwest of franklin square it was schlieffen thought an even homelier edifice than the one next to the white house in washington he was of the opinion that the military should have the finest headquarters possible to hearten the men who protected the nation the view of the united states seemed to be that the military like any other arm of the government rated only the cheapest headquarters possible the sentries at the entrance were not so well trained as those with whom he had dealt in washington that his uniform was close to the shade of theirs convinced them he was no confederate but they had not the slightest clue as to what a military attache was what he did or what his privileges were he had to grow quite severe before one of them would take a message announcing his presence up to general rosecrans office the fellow returning looking flabbergasted at bearing the news that rosecrans would sec schlieffen at once a different sentry escorted him up to the office of the generalinchief in the outer office he traded english for captain berrymans german he listened to the bright young adjutant with only half an car for in the inner office general rosecrans was bellowing yes mr president ill try and take care of it your excellency yes of course that left schlieffen puzzled for he could not hear president blaine at all and the chief executive of the united states did not have a reputation for being softspokenon the contrary presently rosecrans came out into the antechamber looking harassed he said captain i am convinced the telephone is an invention of the devil inflicted upon us poor soldiers so politicians can harangue us at any hour of the day or night without even the pause for thought sending a telegram affords that off his chest he deigned to notice schlieffen come in colonel come in he said invitingly standing aside from the doorway believe me it will be a pleasure to talk with a man who knows what hes talking about have you got telephones in germany colonel i believe we are beginning to use them yes schlieffen said eyeing with interest the wooden box and small attached speaking trumpet bolted to the wall by rosecrans desk invention of the devil rosecrans repeated nothing but trouble he waved his visitor to a chair then asked and what can i do for you today besides complain about inventors who should have been strangled in the cradle bell s a canadian which probably explains a good deal it explained nothing to schlieffen since it didnt he came straight to the point as i asked in washington general i should like to get a close view of the fighting in this war perhaps you will be so kind as to authorize my travel for this purpose to the headquarters of one of your armies in the field very well colonel can do that rosecrans had made promises before schlieffen was about to ask him to be more specific when he did so unasked we are going to take louisville away from the rebs how would you like to watch us while were doing that schlieffen glanced at the map hanging by the telephone you will send me to the province of indiana the state i should sayexcuse me you plan on crossing the ohio river to make your assault yes i should be most interested in seeing that if france ever mounted an invasion of germany she would have to cross the rhine seeing how the united states attempted a river crossing in the face of opposition would tell schlieffen something of what the french might try seeing how the confederates defended the provinceno the stateof kentucky would also be informative well thats easy enough isnt it rosecrans reached into his desk for stationery and with his own hand wrote the authorization schlieffen needed nice to know something is easy by thunder the rebs arentim finding that out but you hang onto that sheet there and ill send a telegram letting em know youre on the way thank you very much schlieffen said and then sympathetically a pity your arms did not have better luck in virginia rosecrans flushed they have stonewall dammit he muttered he had an ugly expression on his face to go with the ugly color hed turned austrian generals and prussian generals too must have talked that way about bonaparte austrian generalsand french generals too must have talked that way about moltke sympathetically still schlieffen said as you have said to me your land is wide general jackson cannot be everywhere at once cannot take charge of all the battles your two countries are fighting thank god for that rosecrans said the telephone on the wall clanged like a trolley using its bell to warn traffic at a corner rosecrans went over to it he listened then shouted hello again mr president that hunted look came back onto his face schlieffen left before the general had to order him out as he walked down the hall toward the stairs he heard rosecrans still shouting behind him all at once he hoped the general staff back home in berlin did without this newfangled invention come on samuel clemens fussed like a mother hen come on everyone weve no time to waste not a single solitary minute alexandra clemens set her hands on her hips sam if youll look around youll see that youre the only one here who isnt ready for the picnic well what has that got to do with the price of persimmons sam demanded pshaw if you hadnt stolen my jacket id have it on by now his wife didnt know anything about persimmons she was that rarity a native san franciscan having been born a little more than a year after the gold rush started americans flooding into california she did however know where his jacket was its hanging on the chair behind you there sam where you put it when you looked under the bed for your shoes and i found them too didnt i clemens said as if in triumph he put on the white linen jacket jammed a hat down over his ears and handed alexandra a sunbonnet there all ready now wed better see what mischief the children have got into since you started hiding things from me ignoring that sally alexandra clemens said they are being quiet downstairs arent they she swept out of the bedroom in a rustle of skirts what are they doing sam hurried after her the quiet broke even as they hurriedbroke into shouts from both orion and ophelia a growl from sutro the dog and a series of yowls and hisses from virginia the cat virginia shot by at a speed that would have done credit to a nevada jackrabbit then vanished under the sofa in lieu of diving into a hole in the ground she scratched me ophelia said bad kitty sam examined the damage which was superficial the next question before the house young lady is why she scratched you ophelia stood mute orion either more naive or less sure of how much his parents had seen said we werent really trying to feed ginny to sutro pa it just looked that way honest injun did it sam said departure for the picnic was briefly delayed for reasons having nothing to do with missing clothes when orion and ophelia climbed up into the family buggy they took their seats with considerable caution above their heads sam and alexandra looked into each others eyes that might have been a mistake they both had all they could do to keep from laughing the horse went down a couple of blocks to fulton and then west to golden gate park a narrow rectangle of land south of the richmond district much of it was sand dunes and scrubby grass here and there where irrigation and better soil had been brought in real grass grew and young hopeful trees sprouted sam tethered the horse to an oak that had advanced further beyond saplinghood than most he gave it a long lead so it could crop the grass and thus distracted not interfere with the familys enjoyment of a sunday afternoon having explained this to his wife he added dont you wish we could do the same with the children not more than half a dozen times a day alexandra answered not usually anyhow she spread a blanket on the grass then set the picnic hamper upon it ham sandwiches and fried shrimp from a chinese cafe and hardboiled eggsnot the elderly sort the chinese esteemedand a homemade peach pie and cream puffs from an italian bakery and lemonade were enough to keep the children from running wild for a while and gave them sufficient ballast once they were through to slow them down for a while ha first match sam said proudly once he got his cigar going that proved what a fine mild day it was the wind blew off the pacific as it almost always did but only gently its not strong enough to lift sand today let alone dogs trees houses or one of mayor sutros public proclamations he added of course they call that kind of wind a cyclone i call that kind of wind an editorial alexandra said which made him mime being cut to the quick other picnicking families dotted the grass of the park children ran and played and got into fights boys barked their bare knees somebody whod brought a bottle of something that wasnt lemonade started singing loudly and badly sam lay back watched the gulls wheeling through the blue sky and declared i refuse to let myself despair on account of gods creation being imperfect to the extent of one noisy drunk alexandra reached out and ruffled his hair im sure he could have done a much better job if only hed listened to you its so nice to know my dear that we can stay together when they start burning freethinkers he said quite without irony and to think that if id left san francisco i never would have met you i didnt intend to settle down here not for good he started another cigar also on the first match but it has turned out to be good id say before alexandra could answerif she was going to answer with anything more than a smilethe breeze brought a thin scries of cries from the west hut hut hut hut hut hear that orion said to ophelia who nodded you know what it is she shook her head he was jumping up and down with excitement thats soldiers thats what it is he ran off legs pumping his little sister followed a moment later slower both because she was younger and because her dress dragged the ground but determined even so samuel clemens got to his feet those are soldiers of sorts he said he knew the sounds of drill when he heard them id forgotten they were teaching the volunteers to walki beg your pardon to marchin the park i think ill have a look at them myself after all they may be protecting us one day soonand if that notion doesnt frighten you for heavens sake why not go ahead alexandra said ill stay here and make sure things dont take a mind to wander off by themselves only a couple of low swells of ground had hidden the volunteer troops from sam there on the grass surrounded by admirers a company raggedly marched and countermarched seeing them took clemens back across the years to his own brief service as a confederate volunteer they looked just the way his comrades had like men who wanted to be soldiers but didnt have it down yet about half of them wore army blouses about half wore army trousers only a few wore both the rest of the clothes were a motley mixture of civilian styles a few carried army springfields rather more had winchesters probably their own weapons many still shouldered boards in place of rifles left shouted the sergeant drilling them a grizzled veteran no doubt from the presidio a majority of them did start out with the left foot he cursed the rest with fury enough to make women flee small boys cheer and clemens smile reminiscently no sergeants hadnt changed a bit somebody called what the devil good are you people if you cant get to where the shootings at because the mormons have the railroad blocked one of the volunteers took the board off his shoulder and thrust with it as if it were a bayoneted springfield we aint afraid o no mormons he declared nor their wives neither they send us east well clean them bastards out and then go on and slaughter the rebs spectators burst into applause the drill sergeant was less impressed pay attention to what i tell you henry you goddamn stupid jackass he bellowed forget about these these these civilians he could have cursed for a day and a half without venting more scorn than he packed into the single word still in stentorian tones he went on how do you know that nosy bastard isnt a confederate spy i am not the man so described said indignantly im sorry sergeant henry said i didnt think of course you didnt think the sergeant snarled youve got your brains in your backside and you blow em out every time you go to the latrine and youre not sorry yet you havent even started being sorry yet but you will be oh yes you will he spoke in somber anticipation of disaster still ahead for the unfortunate volunteer private hut hut hut hut hut a small hand tugged at sams trouser leg face shining orion looked up at him i wanna be a soldier pa and have a gun can i be a soldier when i get big before clemens could answer that ophelia whod tagged after her brother shook her head so vehemently that golden curls flew out from under the edge of her bonnet not me she said and folded her arms across her chest as if things were already settled i want to be a sergeant sam threw back his head and shouted laughter he picked up ophelia spun her through the air till she squealed then set her back on the ground think youll do it too little oneeither that or wife which is the same job except you dont get to wear stripes on your sleeve what about me pa orion jumped up and down pa what about me well what about you clemens spun his son around and around too by the time he put orion down the boy was too dizzy to walk and had had all thoughts of soldiering whirled out of his head sam hoped they wouldnt come back having been a small boy himself he knew what a forlorn hope that was when orion was steady on his pins sam took both children back to alexandra as if by magic she produced two more cream puffs that partially reconciled ophelia and orion to going home alexandra was putting the picnic hamper back in the buggy and sam folding the blanket so he could lay it on top of the hamper when a great roar like a rifle shot magnified a hundredfold smote the air even the gulls in the sky went silent for a moment then screeched their anger at being frightened so ophelia squealed orion jumped good heavens alexandra said what was that one of the big guns up at the presidio sam answered theyve had guns there since this place belonged to spain never mind mexico i dont think any of them have ever shot at anything another roar identical to the first disturbed the tranquility of golden gate park and of the rest of san francisco and no doubt of a good stretch of surrounding landscape as well sam thoughtfully peered northward sounds like theyre getting ready to though doesnt it golly orion said itd be fun to shoot one of those this time ophelia agreed with her brother how much fun do you think it would be to have somebody shooting one at you sam asked his children stared at him that side of war meant nothing to them it seldom meant anything to anyone till the first bullet flew past him the coastdefense guns kept firing as sam drove home by the sound of them alexandra said they think were going to be attacked tomorrow whatever else may happen in this curious world of ours my dear i dont expect the confederate navy to come steaming into san francisco bay tomorrow flags flying and guns blazing sam winked at his wife nor the day after either well no alexandra said hardly another gun boomed i suppose they have to practice the same as the soldiers you were watching if theyre no better at their jobs than those poor lugs the indians could paddle a fleet of birchbark canoes into the bay and devastate the city sam held up a forefinger i exaggerate a flotilla of canoes that made alexandra laugh which was what hed had in mind when they got back to the house on turk street ophelia and orion ran themselves and the pets ragged watching them listening to them sam wondered where they came by the energy even though theyd torn up golden gate park all afternoon they were still going strong but by the time he and alexandra went through the house lighting the gas lamps the children were fading they went to bed with much less fuss than they usually put up and fell asleep almost at once ophelia snored but then ophelia always snored once things had been quiet for a while alexandra said shall we go to bed too by her tone of voice she didnt mean shall we go to sleep yes lets sam sounded casual or thought he sounded casual but the alacrity with which he leaped up and turned off the lamps theyd lighted not long before surely gave him away he turned off the bedroom lamp too before he and his wife undressed and lay down together a thin stripe of moonlight came in through the window just enough to make alexandras body warm and soft in his arms a more perfect mystery than complete darkness would have done she sighed and murmured when he kissed her when he fondled her breasts and brought his mouth down to them when his hand found the dampness at the joining of her thighs as always her excitement excited and embarrassed him at the same time doctors swore on a stack of bibles that most women knew little or nothing of sexual pleasure and did not care to make its acquaintance but then considering the track record doctors had elsewhere how much did that prove with alexandra it proved very little come on sam she whispered after a while and took him in hand to leave no doubt as to her meaning her legs drifted farther apart he poised himself between them and guided himself into her her breath sighed out when their lips met she kissed him as she did at no other time she worked with him while their pleasure built and moaned and gasped and called his name when she reached the peak her nails were claws in his back urging him on till he exploded a moment later when he would have flopped limply down onto her as if she were a feather bed she poked him in the ribs terrible woman he said and rolled off it was mostly but not entirely a joke the delight he took with her sometimes seemed scandalous married though they were if she felt any similar compunctions shed never once shown it they used the chamber pot under the bed and got into their nightclothes in the dark good night dear alexandra said her voice blurry good night sam answered and kissed her work tomorrow in its own way that was a curse as vile as any the foulmouthed sergeant had used in golden gate park reveille blared from the buglers horn theodore roosevelt bounded out of his cot and groped for the spectacles on the stool next to it half past five he exclaimed as he threw on his uniform an obliging tailor in helena had fitted him out what a wonderful time to be alive he rushed from his tent into the cool sunshine of early morning the ranch house stood comfortable and reassuring less than a hundred feet away roosevelt was glad to have an excuse to avoid comfort were comfort all he wanted he could have stayed in new york state when the men of roosevelt s unauthorized regiment lived under canvas their equally unauthorized colonel would not sleep in an ordinary bed with a roof over his head the men of the unauthorized regiment lived under a great variety of canvas some slept in tents that dated back to the war of secession some prospectors whod heard of the regiment when they came into helena or another nearby town had brought the tents in which theyd sheltered out in the wilderness there were even a few who shared buffalohide teepees that might easily have belonged to the sioux they came tumbling out now routed by the strident notes of the morning call the only thing uniform about their shirts and trousers and hats was a lack of uniformity some of them had one article or another of military clothing some were veterans while others had acquired the gear from soldiers either leaving the service or selling it on the sly most though wore civilian clothes of varying degrees of quality and decrepitude the variety in hats was particularly astonishing whatever else the men had on though each of them wore a red bandanna tied around his left upper arm that was the mark of the unauthorized regiment and the men had already made it a mark to respect in every saloon within a days ride of roosevelt s ranch several loudmouths were nursing injuries of various sorts for having failed to respect it no one was dead because of that and by now odds were no one would be roughnecks had learned the men of the regiment looked after one another like brothers and that a challenge to one was a challenge to all fall in by troops for roll call roosevelt shouted the men were already doing precisely that theyd picked up the routine of military life in a hurry some of course had known it before either half a lifetime earlier in the war of secession or in the more recent campaigns against the plains indians their example rubbed off on the new volunteersand on roosevelt who had everything he knew about running a regiment from tactical manuals by hardec even if he was a rebel and upton fall in for roll call he yelled again listen to the old man one of the unauthorized troopers said to a friend who laughed and nodded roosevelt grinned from ear to ear both men were close to twice his age that they granted him an informal title of respect usually given to an officer who was well up in years showed hed won their respect as a commander so he assured himself anyhow troop officers and noncomselected by their comrades as had been done in volunteer regiments during the war of secessionwent through the men they brought roosevelt the returns half a dozen sick three absent without leave theyre probably hung over in helena sir one of the captains said so they are roosevelt said grimly theyll be even sorrier than that when they turn up wagging their tails behind them too the manuals stressed an officers need to be strict in the way he dealt with his men the manuals of course were written for regulars volunteers needed a lighter touch roosevelts own inclination was to keep a light rein on his troopers as long as they went in the direction in which he wanted to guide them but to land on them hard when they strayed from the straight and narrow after roll call the bracing smell of brewing coffee filled the air as the men lined up for mess call along with the coffee the cooks served up beans and salt pork hardtack bread and rolls and oatmeal the road between helena and roosevelt s ranch was getting deep new ruts in it from supply wagons rattling back and forth his bank account back in new york was getting deep new ruts in it too he noted that without worrying about it unduly the country came first from breakfast the troopers went to tend their horses along with beans and other provender for men those wagons brought in hay by the ton and oats to go with it no one within a couple of miles downwind of the ranch could have had the slightest doubt that a great many horses were dwelling there flies got bad when the weather warmed up but they hadnt started buzzing yet philander snow came up to roosevelt to roosevelt s disappointment he still showed no interest in joining the regiment working in the fields and with the livestockwhat the troopers hadnt eaten of itcontented him pausing now to spit he observed one things plain as day bossyou aint gonna need to go out and buy manure for about the next hundred years thats a fact phil roosevelt allowed a regiments worth of horses leaves a lot on the ground dont they a regiments worth of cavalrymen left a lot on the ground too theyd already had to dig a couple of new sets of slit trenches roosevelt didnt want those too close to the creek or the well that way lay sickness the roman legionaries had known as much if typhoidor worse cholera broke out hed be down to half a regiment in nothing flat the first wagon of the day came rattling up from helena a little past eight in the morning roosevelt s quartermaster sergeant a skinny little fellow name shadrach perkins who was a storekeeper down in wickes took charge of the sacks of beans and crates of hardtack it contained the teamster whod driven the wagon to the ranch handed roosevelt a copy of the helena gazette hot off the press colonel he said good roosevelt answered and tossed him a tencent tip since the supply wagons had started coming up from helena every day he was far less cut off from the world than he had been before now instead of waiting a week or two between looks at a newspaper he got word of what was going on as fast as the telegraph brought it into town and the typesetters turned it into words on paper what roosevelt read now made him paw the ground like one stallion challenging another over a mare he felt that full of rage too richardson he roared get your damn bugle richardson he fumed until the trumpeter came dashing up horn in hand then snapped blow assembly all right colonel richardson answered whats up and gone south on us now roosevelt glared at him till he raised the bugle to his lips and blasted out the call men came running a summons during morning fatigues was out of the ordinary and therefore a good bet to be interesting and maybe even important the troopers buzzed with talk until roosevelt strode out before them helena gazette clenched in his left fist do you men knowdo you men have any ideawhat the confederate states the english and the french have had the infernal impudence to do he demanded reckon youre gonna tell us aint you colonel a trooper said roosevelt ignored the distraction which for a man of his temperament wasnt easy but fury still consumed him they have had the gall the nerve to declare a blockade against the coasts and harbors of the united states of america against our coasts and harbors gentlemen saying we have not got the right to conduct our own commerce he squeezed the gazette in his fist and waved it about as if it were the criminal rather than the messenger shall this great nation let such an insult stand no shouted the cavalry troopers who were about as far from any coast as men in the united states could be youre right boys roosevelt agreed we wont let it stand by jingo we cant let it stand these vile foreign dogs will see theyre barking at the wrong hound if they think they can impose themselves on the united states that way well lick em back to their kennels with their tails between their legs by the time he was done whipping up the men they were ready to ride for the canadian border and shoot everybody they could catch who followed queen victoria instead of president blaine by the time he was done whipping himself up he was ready to lead them over the border he needed a distinct effort of will to remember his regiment was still unauthorized if they went over the border it wouldnt be war it would be a filibustering expedition and the enemy would be within his rights to treat them as bandits he sighed he hated having to remember such fine distinctions lets ride he shouted to horse and lets ride we cannot fight the backstabbing englishman and complacent canuck not yet not until we are formally invested with the mantle of the government of the united states but we can ready ourselves so that when the investiture comesas it certainly shallwell be ready to do our all for the land we hold dear it wasnt what hed planned to do with the day it also wasnt the first time his impetuosity had run away with him he knew himself well enough to be sure it wouldnt be the last time his impetuosity ran away with him the tide of cheers the men unleashed made breaking routine seem worthwhile almost as fast as he would have liked roosevelt s unauthorized regiment was mounted and pounding north along the road in a long sinewy column of fours they thundered past wagons and buggies and lone horsemen who stared and stared at the power roosevelt had assembled and now controlled those stares left him happier than the whiskey that flowed like water in the montana mining towns anyone could get a drink of whiskey only a few men special men great men attracted the awe the regiment gained for him heavens above this is bully he cried in a great voice just then he would gladly have kept riding all the way to canada he would gladly have kept riding all the way through canada with the men he had at his back he was sure he could do it prudence prevailed though montana territory was as yet thinly settled finding open land on which the regiment could practice its evolutions was only a matter of riding out past the little farms and herds of livestock that clung close to running water once out on the prairie the horsemen went through the tedious but vital business of shifting from column into line of moving by the left flank and the right and also much to roosevelt s delight of charging straight at an unfortunately imaginary enemy but because roosevelt had read the latest tactical manuals the unauthorized regiment also practiced fighting as dragoons mounted infantry with some of their number left behind to hold horses the rest tramped in skirmish lines through the grass and brush the troops captains had to rotate the job of horseholder through their units because everyone wanted to go forward and no one was keen to be left behind as the afternoon wore along roosevelt came to another of his snap decisions well sleep here in the open tonight men he announced we need to be hardened to ready ourselves against the rigors of the field some of the menthe lazy ones who hadnt bothered packing hardtack and salt pork in their knapsacks unless roosevelt missed his guessgrumbled at that but their comrades jeers squelched them the soldiers so roosevelt insisted on thinking of them though they remained unauthorized despite telegrams to the war department in philadelphia were getting the idea that they had to be prepared when they took the field you never know what may happen roosevelt said you simply never know he was looking north toward canada chapter a nna douglass shook her finger at her husband you aint never gonna ride on no steamboats no more she said severely as if to an errant child never do you hear me yes dear i do frederick douglass answered his voice dutiful i am not traveling anywhere for the time being ill stay here in rochester with you thats not what i mean his wife said in tones that brooked no argument sooner or later out youll go againbut not by steamboat promise me frederick as one christian to another i promise douglass said these days he refused anna nothing she asked her health was visibly failing while he remained robust he let out a small sigh hed never meant to eclipse her to have her live her life in his shadow but that was how things had happened in the beginning shed been above him when they first came to know each other back in baltimore almost half a century earlier she had been free while he still toiled in bondage after his escape hed sent for her and shed come in all the years since then shed given him a comfortable home from which he was too much absent and a fine family hed had too small a part in raising and now she got feebler by the day he sighed again there was nothing he could say nothing he could do it was yearsdecadestoo late to say or do anything dont you worry about me she said picking a thought from his mind as a cunning thief might pick a wallet from a pocket ill be fine whatever happens the lord will provide but whatever happens i dont want you ridin on no steamboats i already promised once douglass said the vow will not be made twice as strong by my repeating it you just remember thats all anna said and hobbled back toward the kitchen leaning heavily on her stick rheumatism made her joints ache douglass knew he should have been writing transmuting his few minutes of fear aboard the queen of the ohio into prose that would galvanize men both black and white to the effort needed to overthrow the confederate states and thereby ameliorate the plight of the millions of negroes still enslaved his first pieces which had talked of his own fear of reenslavement if the steamboat went aground on confederate soil had won wide notice and praise the newspapers and magazines eagerly awaited more and had made it plain they would pay well but at the moment the urge to write was not upon him he shook his head and grimaced wryly as a veteran newspaperman he knew you wrote when you had to write not when the muse sprinkled fairy dust in your hair and tapped you with a magic wand he also knew he didnt have to write quite yet instead of going upstairs to his study he walked outside out on the street the grandson of one of his neighbors was trying to stay upright on an ordinary the huge front wheel of the bicycle was almost as tall as its rider as he pedaled along on a wavering course he waved proudly to douglass douglass waved back hed lived in rochester for almost thirtyfive years long enough for most people to have come to take him for granted in spite of his color these days the city did not separate negroes by race on trolleys or omnibuses or in places accommodating the public it hadnt been that way when douglass first came to upstate new york he knew no small pride in having had a lot to do with the changes over the years look out daniel he called just too late the ordinary went into a pothole and fell over dashing its rider to the street from a considerable height the boy picked himself up picked up the bicycle and sturdily clambered aboard once more you fall down till you do it right douglass thought with an approving nod thats the only way to learn aside from a couple of church steeples the biggest buildings on the skyline were boxy flour mills grain came into rochester from all the surrounding countryside the genesee valley held some of the finest farmland in the united states and went out again by way of the erie canal the railroads and the great lakes from his home which stood near the crest of a small hill douglass could look out across the city to the grayblue waters of lake ontario but for those waters being fresh he might have been looking out at the sea as always barges and small steamers glided slowly across the lake pillars of smoke rose from their stacks as they did from the stacks of rochester s factories the air though was far better than that in st louis or other western towns for the coal burned here was of higher grade than what they used along the mississippi several unusually large plumes of smoke out on the lake caught douglass eye the vessels from which those plumes sprang were also unusually large and appeared to be moving together they made rochester seem more like a seaside town than ever when hed been in boston and new york hed often watched flotillas of navy ships steaming into port in tight formation like these no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than fresh clouds of smoke billowed from the ships douglass was seeing them from a long way off for a moment he wondered whether their boilers had burst then the roars which took some little time to cross that distance reached his ears he froze in place the ice of remembered terror shooting up his back hed heard explosions of that sort not long before coming from the southern bank of the ohio dear god he groaned those are naval ships all right but they dont belong to the us navy like foxes in a henhouse the british warships or would they be canadian douglass worried little about such niceties and suspected no one else worried any more having fired warning shots to let the numerous grain and flourhaulers know what they were sent motor launches off to those closest to them one of those steamers instead of receiving the boarding party tried to flee into the harbor the cannon boomed again sounding angry this time the steamer exploded a thunderclap to dwarf the roar of the guns whats that daniel exclaimed awe on his face at the blast of noise douglass wasnt sure the boy was talking to him he answered anyhow that he said in his most impressive and mournful tones that is war a noisea small noisebehind him made him turn frederick what the devil is going on his wife demanded sharply the enemythat covered both england and canada is attacking our shipping in the lake he replied he hung his head close to tears the british people once helped so much in the fight against slavery and now they stand allied to it there are times when i think my lifes struggle has been in vain you can only keep on anna answered that closely paralleled his own thought about daniels effort to master the ordinary so closely that he had to nod but while his intellect agreed his heart misgave him cannon boomed from the shore from the war of to the war of secession the great lakes had seen half a century of peace in the embittered aftermath of the latter war though both the usa and the british and canadians had built up fleets on these waters and fortified their lakeshore towns each side mistrusting the other few people in rochester thought much of its shore defenses the government had not had a lot of money to spend in the tight times after the war and had had so many places to spend it in hardly more than the twinkling of an eye the locals worries proved justified the warships turned their fire against the guns that had presumed to engage them puffs of smoke rose along the shore as their shells smashed into the emplacements of those gunsand against whatever buildings happened to be close by one by one the cannons defending rochester fell silent the guns from the ships kept pounding the waterfront anyhow as if to punish the city for having the effrontery to resist what are they doing anna douglass said her voice not far from a moan beating us her husband answered few here ever truly believed we should have to go to war against the british empire it would appear they took the possibility of war against us rather more seriously what right have they got to shoot at us like this here anna asked we folk here in rochester we never done them any harm the short answer was theyre strong enough to do it trying to be judicious douglass steered clear of the short answer they declared a blockade against our ports he said when they did it no one thought no one here thought certainly that they meant anything beyond our ports on the atlantic and the pacific but this is a port and so are buffalo and cleveland and duluth in a blockade they may close our ports if they can close them here at rochester at least the enemy could the warships methodically pounded the waterfront to bits neither the quays nor the vessels tied up at them could withstand the shells smoke climbed into a sky now rapidly darkening from the great profusion of fumes rising to block the rays of the sun not all of the smoke nor even the greatest part of it came from the gunpowder that propelled the shells and burst inside them douglass could see the fierce yelloworange of fire crawling along piers and over barges a few stubborn guns still fired at the enemy vessels contemptuously the warships ignored them after the first steamer out on lake ontario was blown to bits none of the others tried to make a break for it they sat very still in the water waiting to be boarded then one after another they steamed off a couple of the warships shepherded them on their way northwest frederick douglass said toward toronto i suppose prizes of war he sighed again back before the war of secession as rochester stationmaster for the underground railroad hed sent plenty of escaped negroes to toronto to put them forever beyond the reach of recapture hed even sent on a few after the war though the underground railroad had withered and died in the bitterness following the us defeat and now britain and canada stood against the usa and with the land from which those negroes had escaped and from which so many millions more still longed to escape but only a couple of the warships were departing the rest cruised back and forth either out of range of the few surviving shore guns or still not thinking their fire worth noticing with them out there rochester s harbor was effectually closed they proved that bare minutes later halting an inbound steamer it soon headed off in the direction of toronto likely with a prize crew on board to make sure it got there blockade without a doubt frederick douglass said now we pay the price for not having paid the price since the war of secession terrible thing his wife said now i see for my own self what those rebels did when they shot up your steamboat you are never going to set foot in one of those contraptions again not while i live and breathe you wont you done gave me your promise frederick and i expect you to keep it the gunners whod set the queen of the ohio ablaze were amateurs with obsolete guns real artillerymen with modern breechloading field guns would never have let the sidewheeler escape you know i keep my promises douglass said ill keep this one the same as any other all that day and into the night the rochester wharves burned superficially everything in salt lake city was normal so far as abraham lincoln could divine everything from provo in the south to ogden in the north was superficially normal the mormons went on about their business as they always did pretending to the best of their ability that the world beyond the fertile ground between the wasatch mountains on the one hand and the great salt lake and utah lake on the other did not exist the gentile minority also tried to pretend it was not cut off from the outside world a pretense that grew more nervous as day followed day with no trains going into or out of utah with no telegrams connecting the territory to the rest of the nation of which it was a part as if to emphasize that utah had not followed the confederate states into secession from the usa the stars and stripes still flew from the council house the ugly little building near temple square wherein the territorial legislature and governor did their jobs but the legislature though in session had no quorum the mormons who made up a majority of its membership were staying home the flag still flew above fort douglas too but the only soldiers in the fort were utah volunteers mormons in other words in the mexican war the mormon legion had fought on the american side in what was being called the second mexican war the mormons were playing their cards closer to the vest lincoln these days was a guest in gabriel hamiltons home the bill he was running up at the walker house having grown too steep for hamilton and the other activists whod invited him to salt lake city to go on paying it had he been able to send a wire out of utah he could have drawn on his own funds as things were he depended on the charity of others that galled him at breakfast one morning he said i hope youre keeping a tab for all this gabe because i intend paying you back every penny of it when i get the chance both hamilton and his wife a plump pretty blonde named juliette shook their heads dont you worry about a thing mr lincoln hamilton said none of this here is your fault and you arent liable for it lincoln gave him a severe look ive been paying my own way in the world since i was kneehigh to a grasshopper and since i havent been kneehigh to anything excepting possibly a giraffe for upwards of sixty yearsto show what he meant he rose from his chair and extended himself up to his full angular height towering over gabe and julietteits not a habit i feel easy about breaking think of it as visiting with friends who are glad to have you then hamilton said thats right juliette nodded emphatically have some more griddle cakes well put some meat on those bones of yours yet see if we dont no ones done that my whole life through either lincoln said and expect that means it cant be done but i will have some more because theyre very fine and ill thank you to pass the molasses too my guess is you dont mind my saying so mr lincoln you havent had a holiday since you once started in to work gabriel hamilton said and youre all at sixes and sevens on account of you dont know what to do with yourself when youre not hard at it oh ive had a holiday all right lincoln said stabbing at a piece of ham with unnecessary violence it took me a couple of years to be up and doing after the people turned me out of the white house i wanted nothing to do even with my wife god rest her soul let alone with the world thats not the same thingnot the same thing at all juliette said speaking ahead of her husband no one could blame you for being sad then you did the best you could but it didnt work youre kind to an old man lincoln said juliette hamilton would have been a girl of perhaps ten when the war of secession ended too young to have been consumed by the political passions of the day looking back lincoln thought the whole nation had gone into a funk when the confederate states made good their independence mary had tried to drag him out of his gloom by main force maybe in the end shed even succeeded in the meantime hed never come so close to laying violent hands on a woman you dont act old mr lincoln gabe hamilton said that was a perceptive comment perceptive enough to make the former president incline his head in gratitude most people would thoughtlessly have said you aren t old mr lincoln no matter how obvious a lie it was hamilton went on there arent enough people half your age sir who have such a progressive view of what labour in this country needs to do to make its voice felt i thinkive always thoughtits wrong for one man to say to another you bake the bread by the sweat of your brow and ill eat it lincoln answered thats plain common sense whoever wrote the fable of the little red hen knew as much to his surprise two tears ran down juliettes cheeks that was harriets favorite fairy tale she said dabbing at her eyes with her apron we lost her to diphtheria when she was four and we havent been able to have another a lot of diphtheria in this town gabe hamilton said as if by thinking of the disease he did not have to think of his dead child i wish they knew what causes it yes i grieve with you lincoln had lost his young son tad not long after losing the war of secession one pain piled on the other had been almost too much to bear that isnt what we were talking about though juliette said determined to be gay we were talking about your holiday and how its high time you had a proper one after working so hard for so long well i have it lincoln said i might not have wanted it much but here it is you finally even put me on the little train over to the great salt lake which is an extraordinary place indeed if it will bear up this bony old carcass as it most assuredly did in any proper selfrespecting water i sink like a stone everything in utah is contrary gabe said to which lincoln could only nod he said i expected the other shoe to drop by now and the mormons to declare themselves out of the union if that was what they had in mind when they cut themselves off from the rest of the states that was what i thought theyd do too hamilton said maybe they havent the nerve for it when push comes to shove on brief acquaintance i would say the mormons nerve suffices for almost anything lincoln answered did you see the notice in the bee for the ball tomorrow night at the social hall ten dollars for a gentleman and one wife with all wives after the first in at two dollars a head polygamy had captured his attention in the same way it did the attention of the utah gentiles those affairs were commoner in brigham youngs day than they are now hamilton said and the price is pretty dear there my guess is theyre raising money for guns or lawyers or maybe both i dont think theyll up and secede not now i dont theyve waited too long if im reading john taylor right hes trying for utah s admission as a state on his termshell promise to let the flag fly if washington leaves polygamy alone and lets him keep out the gentiles so they cant ever outvote the mormons here in the united states but not of them you might say they would use the same sorts of laws to keep out certain white men that some states now employ to exclude negroes you mean lincoln said i might almost be tempted to favor their effort along those lines if for no other reason than to see that entire class of legislation which has long outlived its usefulness cast down im only guessing mind you hamilton said do you want me to take you to the tabernacle sunday to hear what the mormon leaders tell their flock id be very interested to hear that and to see it too lincoln answered how easy are they about having gentiles come in and watch them at worship can we do it without causing a ruction wont be any trouble at all gabe assured him anyone can go into the tabernacle they reckon some of the folks who come to watch end up converting and theyre right too when the temple s built now thatll be sacred ground i hear with no gentiles allowed inside if youre sure it would be no trouble then lincoln said i dont want to keep you from your own devotions oh you dont need to fret about that juliette assured him they dont start their services till two in the afternoon to let people come into salt lake city from their farms and from the little towns roundabout well do it gabe hamilton declared as decisive as a railroad president ordaining higher freight rates do it they did lincoln spent that sunday morning by himself reading pilgrims progress though he believed in god and reckoned himself a christian hed been disappointed by too many preachers who smugly accepted things as they were to attend church regularly walking through the wilderness of the world with bunyan suited him better hed known the valley of humiliation and many times had to fight his way out of the slough named despond gabe and juliette came back from church a little before noon and with lincoln ate a hasty dinner of sausage and bread washed down with coffee when they finished gabe asked are you ready sir i reckon i am lincoln said do we need to leave so early he soon discovered they did as juliette had said people came from a long way outside of salt lake city to attend the service a great many people from within the city came to attend the service too the streets around temple square were a sea of carriages wagons horses mules and people on foot the hamiltons had to tie up their buggy a couple of blocks off and with lincoln make their slow way through the press toward the tabernacle in most towns lincoln would have worried more about leaving the horse and carriage so far from where he was going but salt lake city save for a small number of hoodlums seemed an exceptionally lawabiding place lincolns height and familiar face made some people stop and stare and others draw away to give him and his companions room to advance past the granite blocks awaiting inclusion in the temple the net result was that he gabe and juliette got into the tabernacle about as fast as they would have had he been inconspicuous and anonymous the tabernacle seemed large from the outside from the inside with one great hall covered by the overarching whitewashed roof the latter decorated with evergreen and with paper flowers it was truly enormous you could have taken the crowds in both the buildings where i was nominated for president and lost them inside here lincoln said how many does this place hold anyhow twelve thirteen thousand something like that gabe hamilton answered women predominated in the center of the church while men made up the majority in the side aisles hamilton led his wife and lincoln up into the gallery rather than down onto the floor explaining if you like we can sit down front but theyll aim some of the preaching straight at us ive had enough preaching aimed straight at me thanks lincoln said at which hamilton chuckled lincoln went on if you dont mind lets find one seat on the aisle so i can stretch out these long legs of mine once seated he looked around with a lively curiosity the tabernacle seemed to be soaking up people as a thirsty towel soaks up water many paused to drink from the huge cask of water by one door dipping it up with the tin cups provided for the purpose at the front of the tabernacle sat the choir men on one side women on the other when the great organ began to play gabe hamilton took his watch from his pocket thats two oclock on the dot he said adjusting the timepiece a lay brother in a sack suit announced a hymn he stood a long way off but lincoln could hear him clearly the acoustics of the building were very good he prepared to add his own voice to those of the folk around him but the audience did not sing leaving that to the choir hed heard the choir was so fine you could listen to it once and die happy he didnt find it so good but not grand was his mental verdict the organ accompanying the singers was something else againas mighty an instrument and as well played as hed ever heard hymn succeeded hymn all performed by the choir and that formidable organ once they were done another laymanpriesta businessman in everyday life by his clothesoffered a long prayer many of the references presumably drawn from the book of mormon were unfamiliar to lincoln but the prayers moral tone would not have been out of place in any church he had ever visited another choral hymn followed this one longer than any that had gone before while it went on eight bishops of the church cut sliced loaves of bread into morsels for communion attendants took the morsels on trays and passed them out to the audience while they were doing so an elderly man took his place behind the pulpit lincoln did not recognize his appearance not at the distance from which he saw him but stiffened when the man began to speak he knew john taylors voice i wish to read a couple of verses from the twentyfirst chapter of the book of revelations and to talk about them with you taylor said st john the divine begins the chapter as follows i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband my friends my brethren have we not here the new jerusalem have we not been tested in the fire of persecution and assayed as pure metal lincoln found it interesting that he should use a figure drawn from mining he could not linger on it for taylor was continuing has god not given us this land the new jerusalem to use and to shape according to our desire and to his have we not richly adorned our deseret which was empty when we came to it in many churches the congregation would have shouted out agreement here they sat quiet as the communion morsels came to them row by row president taylor went on by the first heaven and the first earth i take john to mean the requirements forced upon us up to this time by the government of the united states requirements violating the freedom of religion guaranteed to all by the first amendment to the constitution these infringements on our liberty shall not stand for now we enter into the new heaven and the new earth the sea of tears which was our lot shall pass away and exist no more as john clearly states in the new heaven and the new earth we are creating we shall be free to worship and to live as we reckon best and most fitting and no one shall have the power to abridge our rights in any way for the united states are undergoing their own apocalypse now if they choose not to treat with us as we deserve they shall be given over to that old serpent call the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world washington is bombarded babylon is fallen is fallen that great city lincoln turned to gabe hamilton it seems you were right he murmured it does doesnt it the activist answered i tell you the truth sir id sooner have been wrong the attendants with the trays of communion bread took a long time to reach the gallery when at last they got to lincoln s row he passed the tray on without taking a morsel he wanted no part of the communion being celebrated in the tabernacle george custer sat up straighter in his seat as the train wheezed to a halt west of the little town of wahsatch utah the satiny plush upholstery and soft padding made sitting straight require an effort of will the leading officers in john popes hastily improvised army rode in the comfort of a deluxe pullman car while the soldiers they commanded were packed like sardines into the cramped and battered confines of cars commandeered from emigrant trains let me see the map would you tom custer said his brother who had the seat on the aisle beside him handed him the folded sheet he unfolded it traced with his finger the route theyd taken thus far and grunted next would be castle rock and then the bridge over echo creek would be is right tom custer said next is the place where the mormons have blocked the tracks he sounded quiveringly eager to go to war even if it was against citizens of his own country as soon as the train had come to a complete stop brigadier general john pope rose from his seat and addressed his officers in the grandiloquent tones he commonly used gentlemen we now have the privilege and the opportunity of restoring the refractory territory of utah to its proper allegiance to the united states of america i suggest that we now disembark to examine the damage and vandalism the mormons have inflicted upon the tracks in their illegal and improper effort to separate themselves from our great country thatll give us the privilege and opportunity of getting shot if the damned mormons decide they dont care to return to their proper allegiance tom custer whispered to his brother but he was one of the first men to rise and head out of the car george custer was on his brothers heels it had been hot and stuffy and close in the pullman car the air so full of tobacco smoke that custer might as well have been puffing a cigar himself outside it was hot and dry gray rocks and roan mixed together the breeze smclled spicily of sagebrush and tasted of alkali colonel john duane the chief army engineer attached to popes command walked along the tracks till there were no more tracks custer trailed along with him the two men had known each other a long time both having served in mcclellans headquarters during the war of secession duane had been thin and scholarly looking then and still was the only difference in him custer could see was that his mustache and the hair at his temples had gone gray after peering west for a couple of minutes he spoke in tones of professional admiration well well they didnt do things by halves did they not a bit of it custer agreed from perhaps a hundred yards west of where the locomotive had stopped the tracks of the union pacific quite simply ceased to exist the rails were gone so were the cross ties that anchored them in place in case that hadnt been enough to get across the impression that the mormons did not want people traveling through utah they had also dug a series of deep ditches across the roadbed to make repairing it as hard as possible john pope came up to examine the damage theyll pay for this he ground out every last pennys worth of it he started walking west paralleling what had been the line of the track where are you going sir custer called i am going to find some mormons general pope replied i am going to tell the first one i do find that if any further destruction of the railroad takes place their heads and the heads of their leaders shall answer for it he stumped on no one had ever impugned his courage not even at mcclellans headquarters custer glanced back over his shoulder his brother and the other regimental officers were already taking charge of getting men and horses off the train and readying them for whatever lay ahead properly he should have supervised the job but danger drew him so did the chance to make an impression on his commanding officer im with you sir he exclaimed and hurried after pope sweat ran down his face when he reached up to wipe it away from his eyes his hand slid across the skin of his forehead as if it had soapsuds on it he nodded to himself the dust was alkaline sure enough pope glanced over to him as he caught up misery loves companyis that it colonel he asked skirting yet another ditch its a nice day for a walk custer answered with a shrug the mormons could have posted sharpshooters anywhere in this boulderstrewn landscape custer looked neither right nor left if they had they had custer and pope strolled along as casually as if they were in new york s central park pointing ahead to a small collection of ramshackle buildings custer said i do believe thats castle rock i do believe youre right pope said with any luck at all well find some mormon bigwigs there if they havent been waiting for me or somebody like me to show up i miss my guess hed missed plenty of guesses against lee and jackson against the mormons he was spot on a small party came out of castle rock behind a flag of truce pope stopped and let them approach custer perforce stopped with him along with the standard bearer the mormon party included a couple of toughlooking youngsters carrying winchesters and an old man whose unkempt white beard spilled halfway down his chest the oldtimer stepped out in front of the others and walked up to pope and custer nodding to them he said gentleman i am orson pratt one of the apostles of the church of jesus christ of the latterday saints i can treat with you i am brigadier general john pope of the united states army mr pratt pope said not offering to shake hands and with me here is colonel custer of the fifth cavalry president blaine has appointed me military governor of the utah territory and charged me with bringing this territory into full obedience to all the laws of the united states that is exactly what i intend to do and that is exactly what i shall do he pointed back toward the train i have with me a force i believe adequate to ensure obedience and can summon more men at need one of the rifletoting young mormons said theyll be sorry if they try it youll be sorrier if you get in our way custer snapped angry at the fellows arrogance pope nodded as if custer had simply got the words out before he could orson pratt held up a hand i would sooner negotiate than quarrel his heavy features turned severe i will note however that your highhanded attitude general is a symptom of the prejudice of the government of the united states that has brought us to this pass obedience to the laws of the united states is not negotiable pope replied as military governor of a territory judged to be in rebellion against us authority i have powers far beyond those of any civil official the fewer of those powers you require me to use the happier you and your people will be remember a great many back east would be as glad to see you wiped off the face of the earth pratts countenance darkened with anger we are not without strength general if you seek to impose yourself upon us by force well do exactly that pope declared you have not the slightest notion of what youre up against mr pratt this would not be a war of bushwhackers against riflemen we have the power to smash your troops and smash your towns sir and the will to use it if provoked talk is cheap pratts bodyguard jeered pope turned on his heel come with me he said you have my word youll be allowed to return here whenever you like if however you judge i am lying about the force at my disposal i feel myself obliged to disabuse you of your misapprehension without looking to see whether he was being followed he started back toward the troop train custer fell in behind him popes bombast had its uses pratt and his companions tagged along as the general must have known they would had custer been in charge of the mormons who had chosen to defy the authority of the united states he would have attacked the troop train with everything he had the minute it came within range of his weapons that the mormons had failed to do so struck him as cowardice and as a confession of their guilty consciences that they might have worried about the consequences of such a precipitate assault never entered his mind as he rarely worried about consequences himself they would not have the chance to attack now infantrymen and custers cavalry had already formed a defensive perimeter the foot soldiers were methodically scraping out firing pits in the rocky ground some of them had trowelshaped bayonets that doubled as entrenching tools the others used conventional bayonets and whatever other tools they happened to have a battery of artillery had come off the freight cars the brccchloading field pieces were drawn up in a line facing south sunlight gleamed from the bright steel of their barrels next to them stood the two gatling guns attached to custers regiment sergeants buckley and neufeld and their crews looked ready and alert orson pratt was a hard man to impress i knew you had soldiers here general he said tartly i didnt have to walk all that way in the hot sun to see as much pope remained unfazed no one who has not seen modern weapons demonstrated has an accurate understanding of their destructive power you say you are prepared to prevent us from advancing to salt lake city perhaps you are in fact less prepared than you fondly believe he raised his voice and spoke to the artillerymen each piece six rounds bearing due south range three thousand yards the soldiers with red trim and chevrons on their uniforms sprang into action inside of two minutes each cannon had roared half a dozen times choking clouds of blackpowder smoke rose through them custer watched three dozen shells slam into the desert hillside almost two miles away they threw up smoke and dust too all of it coming from a surprisingly small area pope had evidently picked his best gunners for the demonstration custer hoped it impressed orson pratt it certainly impressed him artillery played only a small role in indian fighting on the plains the art had come a long way since the war of secession after the guns fell silent general pope said that is by no means their extreme range i could be bombarding castle rock now if i have to fight my way to salt lake city i can bombard it at ranges from which you could not hope to reply pratt looked as if hed just cracked a rotten egg that is an uncivilized way to make war sir he said its also deuced effective pope answered i have been charged with returning utah to obedience by whatever means prove necessary president blaine cares only about results not about methods no one outside utah will care about methods either that made the mormon apostle look even less happy the mouthier of his two bodyguards spoke up you cant knock everything down with your guns there what happens when we come at you mantoman i was hoping someone would ask me that pope said with a nasty smile he turned to custer and gave a half bow colonel the gatlings being under your command would you be so kind as to do the honors my pleasure sir custer replied saluting will two magazines per gun suffice at john popes nod custer raised his voice soldiers positioned in front of the gatling guns please take yourself out of harms way bluecoats in duststreaked uniforms hastily abandoned the pits and trenches theyd dug for themselves custer nodded to the gatlings crew chiefs sergeants two magazines from each weapon if you please buckley and neufeld snapped out orders their commands were tiny but they led them with confidence and skill as each sergeant cranked his weapon the barrels revolved spitting bullets at the astonishing rate in which custer had delighted down in the indian territory the pauses while full magazines replaced empty ones were barely perceptible silence slammed down after each gatling went through its second magazine into it custer addressed the bodyguard with the winchester if you want to charge into that friend make sure you tell your mother and your wives goodbye first john pope nodded to orson pratt in a friendlyseeming way as you see we are fully prepared to crush without mercy any resistance your people may be rash enough to offer and have with us the means to do precisely that he didnt mention that the two gatling guns the mormons had seen were the only two he had with him he did such a good job of not mentioning it custer was glad he didnt play poker against him as if every other freight car were full of gatlings pope went on i will have your answer now mr pratt either that or i shall commence operations against your forces immediately you have returned to them under that beard pratts jaw worked the mormon apostle looked a good deal like an angry prophet he also custer realized with a small chill looked a good deal like an older fleshier version of john brown but where john brown had had no give in him whatever pratts eyes kept sliding to the field guns and especially to the gatlings you drive a hard bargain general he said at last each word dragged from him i am not here to bargain pope drew himself up straight i am here to rule either peacefully yield your usurped authority to me and accept whatever penalties i see fit to impose on your misguided people or chance the hazards of war those are your only choices you would hold our people hostage pratt began you are holding the united states of america hostage pope broke in he drew his sword to custers surprise he found something to do with it besides making a dramatic gesture or rather he found a new sort of dramatic gesture to make he drew a ring around orson pratt in the dirt as the roman told the greek kings envoy say yes or no before you step out of the circle pratt understood the allusion he also understood that like the seleucids when measured against rome s might he had no choice i yield sir he said under compulsion i yield let me go back to castle rock and i will wire president taylor to that effect god will judge you for what you do in utah general pope so will the president pope replied i worry more about him custer clapped his hands together very good sir he said pope beamed custer nodded to himself you couldnt go far wrong praising your commander general thomas jackson paced in the antechamber outside president longstreets office like a wolf confined for too long in a cage too small for it after watching him for a few minutes g moxley sorrel said please be at ease general the president will see you soon i assure you no doubt no doubt jackson didnt sit he didnt even slow down i should not be here at all i should be in the field where i belong being summoned to confer with your chief executive is not an insult sir sorrel said on the contrary it is a signal honor a mark of the presidents confidence in you and in your judgment as far as jackson was concerned longstreet showed confidence in only one persons judgment his own a confidence jackson reckoned exaggerated to the presidents chief of staff he replied i am not insulted mr sorrel i am delayed who knows what the yankees may be doing whilst i fritter my time away in useless consultation the door to longstreets office came open the french minister a dapper little man who looked like a druggist strode out bowed to jackson and hurried away president longstreet followed him you think im wasting your precious time do you he said of course i do your excellency jackson said when asked a direct question he was never one to back away from a direct answer moxley sorrel whose principal function so far as jackson could see was shielding president longstreet from unpleasantness of any sort looked horrified longstreet himself however merely nodded as if hed expected nothing different well come on in general and well talk about it yes mr president jackson said he might have been restive but he understood perfectly well that the president of the confederate states was his superior inside longstreets office he took his usual stiff seat in a chair not really designed to accommodate such a posture longstreet picked up a pen and pointed it at him as if it were the bayonet on the end of a tredegar i know what youre thinking the president said youre thinking what a blasted nuisance it is to have a president whos also a soldier and that i wouldnt be such an interfering old buzzard if i were a civilian your excellency if this was not a thought that crossed your mind a great many times during the administration of president davis i should be astonished jackson said touche longstreet said with a laugh and then you see how having monsieur mclinc here just before you has had its influence on me again jackson was frank to the point of bluntness very little influences you mr president when you do not care to let yourself be influenced longstreet started to reply to that but checked himself setting down the pen he made a steeple of the fingertips of both hands do you know general you can at times be alarmingly perceptive he remarked perhaps it is as well that you never took any great interest in politics as well for me certainly jackson agreed and i have no doubt also for our nation longstreet surprised him by being frank in turn any frankness from longstreet surprised him by the first part of which you mean youd sooner see others do the dirty work so as not to tarnish your own moral perfection he held up a handhe used them expressively as a politician should never mind what im driving at is that you chafe under me for exactly the opposite reason iand so many otherschafed under jeff davis jackson realized he would have to examine and if necessary root out what looked like a stain of hypocrisy on his own soul but that had to wait duty first always duty first i beg your pardon mr president but i do not see the distinction you are drawing no president longstreet sounded amused ill spell it out for you president davis interfered with the way his commanders fought the war of secession because he thought he was a better general than they were i am interfering in the way you fight this war because i think i am a better politician than you are i would not presume to argue that despite your intimations to the contrary a moment ago jackson replied all right then longstreet said believe me general i would constrain you less if i did not have to worry more about keeping our allies satisfied with the manner in which we conduct the war it is war jackson said simply we must conduct so as best and most expeditiously to defeat the enemy how best to defeat the united states and how to defeat them most expeditiously may not be one and the same longstreet said this is one reason i ordered you not to go on and attack harpers ferry after beating the yankees at winchester mr president i do not understand jackson knew no better way to express the frustration he felt at having to abandon an assault he was certain would have been successful i know you dont that is why i called you back to richmond longstreet pointed to the map on the wall suppose we win an overwhelming victory in this war which god grant can we hope to overrun and conquer the united states jackson didnt need to look at the map of course not sir good the president of the csa nodded approval there you have the first point any success we win must of necessity be limited in scope after it we still face united states larger and stronger than ourselves he cocked his head to one side awaiting jackson s response reluctantly jackson nodded in turn the president proceeded like a teacher taking a scholar through the steps of a geometric proof it therefore follows does it not that we should be wise to maintain and cultivate our alliance with the powers whose intervention was essential in securing our independence a generation ago like a scholar who did not grasp the proof jackson said i fail to see how the one follows from the other i thought notanother reason to call you away from the front longstreet seemed willing even eager to go through the proof the long way where the short way had failed the key to your understanding general is that in the eyes of our allies we are engaged in a defensive struggle the united states declared war against us not the other way round the united states first took offensive action sending their cavalry down into the indian territory that justified our responding you dont win a war by merely responding mr president jackson was as unyielding as the stone wall that had given him his lasting nickname we arent merely responding longstreet said general stuart has stung the yankees down in the new mexico territory and our raids into kansas have been effective in keeping the usa off balance thereand the united states have pulled regular troops from that front to bring in mormons in utah back under their thumb ahthe mormons jackson leaned forward had we anything to do with their timely disaffection that sort of inspired chicanery sowing trouble in the yankees rear was what he would have expected from longstreet i despise the mormons general and i thank heaven every day that we have only a handful of them in the confederacy the president said for a moment jackson thought longstreet had denied abetting the unrest in utah territory then he realized the president of the csa had done no such thing he suspected hed got all the answer he was going to get too no point to pursuing it further he returned to the main subject at hand what weve given the united states are pinpricks fleabites we need to hit them hard enough to let them know theyre hurt i will not strike them blows that in my judgment would cause britain and france to conclude they are being used as instruments of our aggrandizement rather than protectors of our legitimate rights longstreet said i will not if that makes the war more difficult so be it my firm view is that in the long run we shall be better for it jackson got to his feet if i cannot prosecute the war to the utmost your excellency i hope you will accept my resignation oh sit down tom dont be a stiffnecked fool longstreet said testily surprised jackson did sit the president went on even if i tie one hand behind your back i need you youre the best ive got thats all the more true because i tie one hand behind your back im not the only one who needs you the country does jackson saw that longstreet deserved his place in the executive mansion the president knew precisely which levers to pull to return a recalcitrant general to obedience maybe that meant he knew which levers to pull to keep britain and france on good terms with the confederate states and maybe it meant he correctly gauged how important the alliance was if all that was so for the sake of the nation we both serve i retract what i just said jackson spoke firmly through his life hed seldom had to backtrack when he found the need he was as unflinching in meeting it as with any other tactical necessity did you say something general longstreet brought a hand to his ear im an old man i must be getting deaf because i didnt hear a word that drew a chuckle from jackson longstreet was smoother than jackson had ever wanted to be and crookeder than jackson ever wanted to be too but hed found a way out of a situation from which the generalinchief would have been too stubborn to retreat unaided he deserved credit for that very well then jackson gave him credit by proceeding from the point of their disagreement as if he had in fact agreed recognizing that we cannot hope to conquer the united states how are we to secure victory over them by demonstrating to them that they cannot hope to conquer us president longstreet answered the way you ran them out of winchester was firstrate general that is how we won the war of secession after all our armies were in pennsylvania when we won the war of secession jackson pointed out true longstreet said but we were compelled to invade their territory then for they had gained several lodgments in ours along the carolina coast in virginia and in the west that is not the case now our navy is far more able to defend our shores than was so then and we have our allies to assist us we stand in firm control on our side of the potomac and have punished washington for the effrontery of the united states and kentucky and the line of the ohio river are now ours where we had to gain that line by force of arms during the previous war the united states have not got the initiative nor shall they gain it hard to be assured of that while we stand on the defensive jackson said longstreet shrugged his broad shoulders modern weaponry favors the defensive at least on land having seen the fighting at first hand do you deny it no sir jackson said harder now to break a strongly held defensive position than it was in the war of secession and it wasnt easy then as my written report states a bare regiment of entrenched yankees fought manfully against my brigade south of kernstown though eventually being overcome by superior force well then longstreet said as if everything were settled is it not more profitable to strike where we and our allies are strong as in the recent bombardments of us towns on the shores of the great lakes and to let the yankees beat their heads against the wall coming at us but the trouble is jackson realized he could not oppose the president of the confederate states with anything resembling a logical argument he gave him an emotional one instead the trouble is your excellency i want to hit them a good lick that should not be impossible even standing on the defensive longstreet looked over to the map again as you no doubt know they appear to be massing troops in indiana opposite louisville would it make you happy if i sent you to kentucky to supervise the defense of the city jackson knew longstreet was offering him a bribe if he did as the president desired he would in essence forfeit the right to express his disagrement with present confederate policy especially as he would be an instrument of making that policy succeed longstreet was a subtle man but not so subtle as to be able to disguise what he was about here understanding what longstreet was about though did not make jackson able to resist the temptation set before him leaning forward in his chair he said yes mr president major horatio sellers came up to jeb stuart while the general commanding the military district of the transmississippi was engaged in the unmilitary but nevertheless important task of making sure no scorpions had crawled into his boots during the night once satisfied on that score stuart said and what can i do for you this morning major sellers heavy features were not made for expressing joy under the best of circumstances since traveling along the border between sonora and new mexico territory was hardly the best of circumstances stuart supposed his aidedecamp could hardly be blamed for looking grim sellers said sir how far are we going to trust these apache devils anyhow i keep having the feeling that one fine morning were going to wake up with our throats cut if you know what i mean i may stuart answered i just may but before i answer that let me ask you a few questions of my own since he was the general the major inclined his head in agreement stuart began are these apache devils the best guides and scouts we could have or not oh yes sir sellers said not a doubt about that they know every cactus in this whole damn desert by its first name they know where the yankees are where they were and where theyll turn up day after tomorrow if i hadnt seen it so often by now i wouldnt believe it its almost uncanny like a nigger grisgris woman down in new orleans if geronimo understood that hed thank you for itfrom everything ive been able to figure out hes as much a medicine man as a chief stuart said its neither here nor there though the general paused to pull on one of his scorpionfree boots before continuing the catechism do these apache devils hate the yankees and the mexicans both i hope to spit they do major sellers exclaimed cant say i much blame em either if you look at things from their side of the mirror the only reason they cant figure out which bunch to hate worse is that the damnyankees and the mexicans have both been doing their damnedest to massacre em which means theyve got good solid reasons to be loyal to the confederate states doesnt it major stuart said when you put it like that yes sir i suppose it does major sellers neither looked nor sounded happy the only thing i hope sir is that we dont end up sorry we ever trusted them jeb stuart was pulling on the other boot when his aidedecamp said that he stopped with it halfway up his calf both eyebrows rose good god major youd have to send me to an idiots asylum if i trusted them once they were out of my sight theyre as dangerous as as scorpions he finished putting on the boot if they werent how could so few of them have given so many us soldiers and so many mexicans so much trouble for so long sir now sellers wore a new expression confusion in that case why have we given them all tredegars so they can shoot them at the yankees of course stuart replied they will do that as you said yourself they have good reason to do that well yes sir major sellers said but once sonora is ours wont they find reasons to shoot them at us i hope not i hope that once sonora is ours theyll go shoot up new mexico when theyre feeling frisky stuart said but its a chance im willing to take for now if they decided to start raiding our supply line instead of working with us life could get lively faster than we really wanted couldnt it he watched sellers think that over he watched sellers look as unhappy as he had while making the same consideration sir we need that railroad from el paso his aidedecamp said so we do stuart said unfortunately its not built yet if the war with the united states isnt over by the time it is built things will have gone a great deal worse than i hope once the war is over and the railroad built i expect well be able to deal with any trouble a few hundred redskins cause until then well use them to our best advantage since thats also to their advantage i dont see how they can fail to make us useful tools for the time being his aidedecamps face cleared well thats all right then major sellers said with some relief as long as youre thinking of them as catspaws and not as genuine allies everythings fine after all sir its not as if theyre white men no its not stuart agreed of course even if we are white men that doesnt stop our allies from using us as catspaws against the usa after all its not as if we were europeans that sailed past horatio sellers sellers was a detail man which made him a devil of an aidedecamp he wasnt so good at fitting details inside the frame of a larger picture some aidesdecamp used their posts at the side of highranking officers to gain high rank themselves sellers would likely be a major till he retired if he lived to retirement every man is good at and good for something stuart thought without major sellers the thin confederate force operating on the us border would have been far less effective than it was without him too stuart would have overlooked any number of things to worry about some of which probably would have proved important if horatio sellers didnt think something was worth worrying about it wasnt stuart pulled aside the tent flap and went outside the day was bright and clear and hot but for occasional storms that blew up from the south every summers day hereabouts was bright and clear and hot stuart thought he could see forever water seemed to shimmer in the middle distance hed warned his men about chasing mirages a roadrunner skittered past with a horned toads tail sticking out of its beak it gave stuart a wary glance as if afraid he might try to steal its breakfast when he just stood there it ran off to where it could dine in privacy geronimo and the young son who translated for him approached stuart good day to you general said the young man whose name was chappo his accent might almost have come from new england stuart didnt know if the sounds of the apache language made it seem that way or if chappo had learned the language from somebody from the northeastern united states either way he found it funny also funny was the spectacle of a couple of indians carrying confederate armyissue tin plates full of beans they carefully picked out the salt pork which they didnt like and tin cups full of coffee both of which except for the pork they thought highly good day to you chappo stuart answered gravely and to your father chappo spoke in the apache language gcronimo answered his voice was on the mushy side for he was missing quite a few teeth which also gave the lower part of his face the pinchedin look often thought of as characteristic of witches stuart wondered if that had helped give him reputation among the apaches that story they told about his making the daylight hold off for two or three hours so they could escape from a raid no christian man would believe it but they did i think you can take tucson if you want it he said now through his son do you if the old indian had been looking for a way to grab stuarts attention hed found one with tucson in confederate hands yankee control over all of western new mexico territory south of it would wither the catch of course was that taking it would be anything but easy keeping it would be harder still since it lay on the southern pacific line stuart had thought it beyond his slender means he studied geronimo with the same sort of cautious gaze the roadrunner had given him geronimo might be a savage but he was a long long way from a fool he might well hope us and cs troops would engage in a struggle that depleted forces from both sides leaving no white soldiers to protect the area from the apaches with something approaching the truth the general commanding the transmississippi said i dont think we are strong enough to do that even with the help of the brave apaches i wish i did but i dont when geronimo had that translated for him he spoke for some time chappo had to hold up a hand so he would stop and let the interpreter do his job my father says he would not tell this plan to any other man he thinks you can make it go though he says that if you fooled the bluecoats so well once you can do it again and he will help tell him to go on stuart did his best to keep his voice and face impassive he could read nothing on geronimos weathered features he might have been back in one of the endless card games with which us army soldiers out west had made time pass before the war of secession how big a bluff was geronimo running stuart realized hed have to see more of the indians hand to tell through chappo the apache chief did go on with these new rifles you gave us we will go on the warpath we will go up toward tucson we will be loud we will be noisy the bluecoats will have to see us stuart had no trouble understanding what that meant the apaches would hit farmers and herders and miners between the international border and tucson livestock would vanish men the indians caught would die women would probably suffer a fate worse than death and then die too hed been talking with major sellers about how good it would be for the redskins to keep the usa too busy chasing them to trouble sonora and chihuahua now he had to contemplate what those coldblooded words meant he hadnt fought like that during the war of secession not even the damnyankees had fought like that then but he hadnt given the apaches bible tracts hed given them guns lots of guns ask your father what happens then he told chappo geronimo answered in detail hed thought this through stuart had seen how the fellow who proposed an idea usually had the edge on the fellow who was hearing it for the first time that still held true he discovered when the fellow doing the proposing was an indian who didnt know how to write his name chappo said my father says we can do one thing or the other thing one thing is when the bluecoats chase us we can go up into the mountains and pretend to be rocks and trees while they look for us you go behind them and into tucson stuart studied geronimo with surprise and considerable admiration had the apache had a proper military education he might have been sitting in general jackson s office in richmond but stuart said for that plan to work we have to depend on the yankees commander in tucson being stupid by now hes probably heard the apaches and the confederates are friends he will not forget about us while he goes chasing after you once chappo translated that geronimo looked at stuart for a moment before going on his expression didnt change but stuart had the strong feeling that hed just impressed geronimo the same way geronimo had impressed him he should have been angry that a savage presumed to judge him in that fashion he wasnt geronimo had earned his respect he was glad hed managed to earn geronimos the apache chieftain said the other plan is we war toward tucson the bluecoats chase us we do not go into the mountains we lead them to an ambush you set with your men and your guns this does not give you tucson it gives you the men who hold tucson is it enough hmm stuart said and then again hmm he hadnt expected a savage to presume to propose a plan of campaign nor had he expected the plan to be so tempting once the savage did presume to propose it geronimo said for a long time i have fought the bluecoats and the mexicans hard even when i had little now you confederates are on my side and with you to help i can strike a great blow all rightwell try it stuart said coming to an abrupt decision even before chappo translated geronimo caught the tone of his answer and smiled the broadest smile stuart had seen from him stuart smiled back and clasped his hand once the damnyankees were licked and the csa got sonora and chihuahua fully under control the confederates would have much and the apaches little one step at a time stuart thought chapter s itting as it did at the corner of larkin and mcallister in yerba buena park the san francisco city hall was only a few blocks from the offices of the morning call samuel clemens looked up from the sentence he was writing level of bungling last seen when lots wife was turned to a pillar of salt and not a single foolish soul thought to carry her along regardless to sell for a shekel the halfpound and spoke to clay herndon mayor sutros giving a speech in half an hour why dont you amble on over there and find out what the old whales spouting this time do i have to sam herndon asked in mournful tones ive covered him the last three times hes shot off his mouth and if four in a row isnt cruel and unusual punishment i dont know what is besides im about threequarters of the way through this story you said you wanted today and its going pretty well i hate to waste a couple of hours listening to his honor gab and then come back and find ive forgotten half the good lines i figured on using which story is that clemens asked there were a couple of them if i recall the one about the defenses of san francisco bay the reporter answered i finally talked colonel sherman into giving me an interview yesterday and i went out to alcatraz and talked with the garrison commander there too so ive got the straight dope all right muzzleloading rifled cannonits almost as bad as she sells sea shells by the seashore isnt it and their shells may be even more dangerous than sea shells not that weve seen any proof of that clemens said well youre righti do want that piece as fast as you can turn it out so i wont inflict our magnificent mayor on you this morning he took another look at the editorial he was working on it was by something approaching a miracle for the day after tomorrow not tomorrow he got up from his desk ill cover the speech myself by the way things are going im bound to have more of our blunders to write about by the time i have to give this to the typesetters i didnt want you to have to go and do that clay herndon exclaimed i just meant for you to send leary or one of the other cubs dont fret yourself about it sam threw on his houndstooth coat as if he were a gentleman of fashion he buttoned only the top button as he set his straw hat at a jaunty angle on his head he went on if i go to city hall im halfway home you cant tell me sutro wont talk till noon or maybe one oclock whenever he finally decides to shut up i can walk over for dinner and surprise alexandra thanks sam herndon said youre a good boss to work for you remember what it was like when you were just an ordinary working fellow yourself get that story about the sea shells on alcatraz done clemens patted his pockets to make sure he had an adequate supply of both pencils and cigars satisfied he grabbed a notebook and headed out the door the weather was fine for wearing a mostly unbuttoned coat the breeze ruffled the flags that in a display of patriotic fervor flew from what seemed like every other building and from every trolley and cablecar stop despite the admission of several territories as new states since the war of secession the flags sported fewer stars than they had before the war president tilden had finally ordered the stars representing states now confederate removed from the banner which was clemens remained convinced one reason blaine beat him sam walked southwest down market to mcallister and then west along the latter street to the city hall a fine building of composite neoclassical style he waved to a couple of other reporters who were also coming to hear mayor sutros latest pronouncement good god in the foothills sam the call must really have its claws out if youre covering this in person said monte jesperson who wrote for the aha californian his paper was as staunchly prosutro as the morning call was anti not quite so bad as that threecard clemens returned regardless of editorial policy newspapermen got on well with one another only reason im here is that clays in the middle of a story he needs to get done quick as he can ah ive got you when jesperson nodded his flabby jowls and several chins bobbed up and down his sack suit had to have been cut from the bones of a great many herrings to fit round his bulk he stood aside to let sam go into city hall ahead of him the doors werent wide enough to let them go in side by side noting the rich furnishings the marble floors the fancy paintings on the walls the general profusion of velvet and gilt and elabourately carved walnut and mahogany sam said i wonder how much stuck to whose pockets when they were running up this place monte jespersons sniff was like that of a bloodhound taking a scent ah thatd be worth knowing wouldnt it he said if there be any bodies buried nobodys ever dug em up thats the truth clemens cocked his head to one side listening to jesperson with a reporters attentive ear so youre one of the ones who still say if there be are you threecard i know the fancy grammarians like it better but if there are has always been good enough for me im an old man jesperson ran a pudgy finger along the gray walrus mustache he wore the things the modern generation does to the english language are a shame and a disgrace nothing less not you samyouve got some bite to you under that cloak of foolishness you like to wearbut a lot of the pups nowadays wouldnt know a subjunctive if it kicked em in the shins comes of not learning latin i expect sams own acquaintance with latin was distinctly of the nodding variety not without relief he let one of mayor sutros flunkies lead him to the hall where sutro stood poised behind a podium ready to give forth with deathless prose it was in clemens opinion deathless because it had never come to life he sometimes thought sutro looked as if hed never come to life either the mayor of san francisco was pale and plump with a brown mustache jespersons could have swallowed whole his eyes dark lumps in a doughy face resolutely refused to show any luster that he wore a suit he might have stolen from an undertaker did not enliven his person along with the reporters clerks and lawyers helped fill the room so did some of adolph sutros friends most of them as dreary as the mayor sutro said thank you for coming here today gentlemen he looked down at the podium on which surely reposed his speech nicely written out having grown up with politicians who memorized twohour addresses and were venomously deadly in repartee clemens found that all the more dismaying i have called and gathered you here together today sutro droned for the purpose of delivering a warning pertaining to spies and to matters relating to espionage i want to warn you about spies sam translated mentally hed edited a lot of bad prose in his time but little to compare to this a cleaver wasnt enough to cut the fat from the mayors speeches a twoman ripsaw might possibly have done the job in particular this morning i address my remarks to the noble gentlemen belonging to the fourth estate irregardless of whether or not they and i have previous to this time been in agreement with each other on the concerns concerning our city and our state and the united states sutro continued he doubtless thought of that irregardless as a polished touch and either hadnt noticed concerns concerning or laboured under the delusion that it improved the product with a distinct effort of will clemens lowered the flame under his critical boiler taking notes on sutros speeches was easier because they were so padded and repetitious the mayor said it is up to you and your responsibility to disseminate to the many who depend on you the vital necessity of being as alert and aware as it is possible to be to the dangers posed by spying and the measures to be taken in order that those dangers are to be reduced to as small an extent as may be now then these dangers areyes mr clemens sams hand had shot into the air he couldnt help himself in his most innocent voice he asked mayor can you please tell me how a danger which is abstract can have an extent which is physical sutro coughed this danger is not abstract it is real perhaps we can hold the rest of the questions until the completion of my address now then as i was saying invincible dunderhead clemens scrawled in his notebook he glanced over at monte jesperson who would not meet his eye no matter what jesperson thought though the alta californian would make mayor sutro sound like a statesman when its next edition came out to sam he sounded like a lunatic his speech went on for as long as the newspaperman had expected it would but furnished only a couple of pages worth of notes the gist of it was that sutro had a bee in his bonnet about spies because confederates canadians and englishmen all spoke englishin the same way and manner that we do ourselves the mayor said sam was confidently certain many of them spoke it better than adolph sutro did not that that made any enormous compliment still mayor sutro has a point sam wrote then he added he was not wearing his hat which let him show the world exactly where he has it the mayors idea was that since enemy spies didnt give themselves away by how they talked everyone should report everything that wasnt quite how he phrased it but it was what he meant to the police and to the military authorities so everybody who said anything could be locked up and the keys either thrown away or filed in the mayors office which made them even more certain never to be seen again when the speech was finally over clemens asked once the entire population of the city is incarcerated your honor from which states do you plan on importing loyal citizens to take its place i doubt it will come to that sutro answered primly next question please sam sighed he should have known better he had known better in fact but hadnt wanted to admit it to himself if us navy ships were armored against shells as the mayor was against sarcasm theyd prove unsinkable sam did find one serious question to ask have you reviewed this plan with the chief of police and with the military authorities why no the mayor said but i have the utmost confidence they will show themselves to be as zealous in the pursuit of the sneaking spies who have done so much damage to our causeanother statement clemens thought that would have been all the better for proofas i am myself and will profit from the assistance of our fine and upstanding vigilant citizens i have the utmost confidence sam said as the reporters headed out of city hall that every lowdown skunk with a grudge against his neighbor is going to call him a rebel spy well catch some real spies thanks to this monte jesperson said faint praise for the speech but praise it made clemens furious oh no doubt we willbut how the devil will we be able to tell which ones they are when weve arrested their bartenders and blacksmiths and druggists along with em and what about the constitution where it says you cant arrest a man on nothing better than somebodys sayso jespersons shoulders moved up and down its wartime you do what you have to do then pick up the pieces afterwards threecard the very first war this country ever fought was against people who said things like that sam answered jesperson only shrugged again instead of staying to make an argument out of it he waddled off toward the alta californians office on california street if he wrote fast enough the last couple of editions of his paper would have a no doubt carefully polished version of mayor sutros speech in them along with an editorial giving half a dozen good reasons for treating san franciscans like confederate slaves or russian peasants because some petty tyrants are tired of being petty clemens muttered under his breath he went back to his house almost at a run hoping alexandra would be able to lift him out of his evil mood part of it lifted at the delighted reception his children gave him he didnt usually come home in the middle of the day his own delight at seeing them was somewhat tempered when his wife told him ophelia had broken a vase not fifteen minutes before it wasnt my fault ophelia said in tones of virtue impugned sam who had heard such tones before raised an eyebrow and waited his daughter went on i never would have done it if orion hadnt ducked when i threw the doll at him is the world ready sam asked alexandra i dont know his wife answered if its not though it had better be along with boiled beef and horseradish that sage comment helped persuade him the world was likely to be able to muddle on a bit longer in spite of mayor sutros aggressive idiocy he was glad to discover alexandra disliked sutros plan as much as he did the dog hearing everyone saying sutro over and over decided people were talking about him he walked up to sam and put his head and front paws on his lap clemens scratched his ears which was what hed had in mind ah you poor pup sam said i thought i was insulting the mayor when i gave you your name and here all the time i was insulting you at the rochester train station frederick douglass embraced his wife and son now dont you worry about me for even a minute he said this will be how i always wanted to enter the confederate states with banners flying and guns blazing and a great army leading the way you make sure you let the army lead the way anna douglass said dont go any place where them rebels can shoot at you seeing that the invasion is not yet launched thats hardly a concern douglass answered i am delighted that general willcox recalled the plight of the colored man and wanted one of our race present to witness the us return to kentucky his son lewis embraced him dont just be a witness father bear witness for the world ill do that ill do exactly that a shouted all aboard from the conductor punctuated douglass promise he climbed up onto the train and took his seat if the white man next to him was dismayed to have a negro traveling companion he was polite enough not to show it more than which douglass could not ask going from rochester to louisville or rather to the indiana towns across the ohio from louisville took two days the polite white man left the train at fort wayne to be replaced by a fellow who stared at douglass in a marked manner and kept sniffing as if to say the negro had not bathed as recently as he might have done since no one in the car was fresh by then and since several people apparently had not bathed since the start of the year douglass felt he was being unduly singled out but as the man from fort wayne took things no further than that douglass ignored him hed known worse new albany clarksville and jeffersonville indiana had been trading partners with louisville theyd sent us manufactured goods into the confederate states in exchange for tobacco and whiskey and fine kentucky horseflesh with the ohio closed to shipping with bridges blown up with cannon barking at one another they could have had the look of western mining towns after the veins that spawned them had run dry instead they boomed as never before the reason was easy to understand tent cities bigger than any of them filled the countryside beyond the reach of confederate guns the us army was there in numbers not seen since the war of secession and bought everything the rebels would have and more besides a driver was supposed to be waiting for douglass when he got off the train he stood on the platform looking around no driver was in evidence and it wasnt likely that the man had gone off with some other elderly colored gentleman by mistake douglass sighed brigadier general willcox or one of his officers had managed to make a hash of things that meant hiring a cab the first driver douglass approached shifted a wad of tobacco deep into his cheek so he could growl i dont take niggers southern indiana had never been territory friendly to the cause of abolition and till the war began the locals had probably associated more with the confederates across the river than with their more enlightened countrymen from other regions of the usa the second cab driver douglass approached dismissed him as curtly as had the first he finally found a man willing to take himfor a tendollar fare thats robbery he burst out thats business the fellow returned uncle aint many folks round here whod drive you for any money douglass had already seen as much uncle was one of the less malicious things whites called blacks not a compliment certainly but an improvement over a lot of choices the driver might have made ten dollars it is the negro said and hoped the man wouldnt try to hold him up for twenty when they got to willcoxs headquarters the cab had to pick its way down little paths that had never been meant to take much traffic but were now choked with wagon trains bringing the army the munitions it would need to fight and the food it needed till such time as it did go into battle the dust was overpowering above the rattle of wagon wheels the driver said by the time we get there pal well be the same color if he was exaggerating he wasnt exaggerating by much was that the solution to the problem of white and black in the usa and for that matter in the csa put everybody behind a dozen wagons on a dusty road on a dry summers day douglass wished things could have been so simple he soon discovered he could tell which regiments were regular army and which volunteers before he saw the banners identifying them the regulars knew what they were doing everything was neat everything just so even the dust around regular regiments seemed less as if it were afraid to come up lest some officer give it fatigue duty for untidiness volunteer encampments straggled more the men themselves straggled more too and slouched more as if some of the iron in regulars backbones had been omitted from theirs they looked like what they were men unsure how to be soldiers but called upon to play the role a lot of them had been called upon their regiments far outnumbered those of the longservice professionals who filled the ranks in time of peace a large part of the volunteer strength of the army was concentrated here for the blow against louisville all right uncle the driver halted the cab ten dollars like i said douglass paid without a murmur relieved hed kept to the price hed set at the station the driver hauled his trunk down from the roof of the cab nodded in a friendly enough way and headed back to town douglass guessed he would have gouged a white man almost as badly that made the orator and writer feel a little better general willcox was supposed to know he was coming when he strode up to the tent with the generals onestar flag flying in front of it he discovered the sentries had not been informed you want to see the general one of them said gray eyes widening he turned to his companion eb this here dusty old nigger wants to see the general both soldiers guffawed eb said yeah but does the general want to see this here dusty old nigger they thought that was funny too i am frederick douglass douglass ground out in icy fury i was asked to come here to write the story of this army and its assault on louisville the story i have in mind to write at the moment will not cast the two of you in the best of light of that you have my assurance his tone worked the wonder his appearance had failed to effect the sentries began to treat him like a man not like a negro the one who wasnt eb disappeared into the tent to return with a spruce young captain mr douglass the officer said with a broad smile so good to meet you im oliver richardson general willcoxs adjutant he shook hands with douglass with every sign of pleasure i trust you had no difficulty finding the headquarters finding themno douglass said whatever else he might have added he kept to himself for all he knew his difficulties might lie at richardson s feet hed met plenty of white men who were friendly to his face and called him a nigger the minute he turned his back let me take you in to see the general mr douglass richardson said im sure the men will carry your trunk there to the tent where you are to be quartered sir there aint no such tent the sentry who wasnt eb said on account of we didnt know this here fellow was acomin set one up then richardson snapped an instant later he was all affability again come with me mr douglass douglass came he found brigadier general orlando willcox slogging down a mountain of papers a scene he remembered from visiting headquarters during the war of secession he wondered how generals ever got to fight they seemed too busy filling out forms and writing reports to have the time for it willcox was a rolypoly man six or eight years younger than douglass with a high forehead that looked higher because his hair had retreated from so much of it mr douglass he exclaimed putting down his pen with every sign of delight god be praised that you have been able to join us before the commencement of the great struggle i had worried about that yes douglass said knowing how celerity is so vital a constituent of the military art we are less hasty than we might have been under other circumstances there being so many volunteers to weave into the fabric of the regular army willcox said but the mingling of warp and weft proceeds well and i still have every confidence that the good lord will grant our arms and our righteous cause the victory they deserve may it be so douglass agreed if however you will forgive my speaking on a matter where i am the rankest amateur and you learned in every aspect much the same sort of talk was heard in general mcclellans headquarters during the war of secession the lord is as the saying has it in the habit of helping them that help themselves captain richardson sent douglass a venomous glance that made him suddenly surer than he had been where his difficulties in making arrangements had arisen general willcox did not see that glance he was answering i forgive you readily as it is my christian duty to do but if you knew how many hours i have spent on my knees in prayer beseeching god to grant me the answers to the riddles of this campaign you would be more certain i am acting rightly douglass had nothing against the power of prayer on the contrary he did wish though that general willcox also spoke of how many hours hed spent studying maps examining the enemys positions on the far side of the ohio and sending over spies to examine them close up the event will prove my strategy willcox declared very well sir douglass replied as hed said he was no soldier himself and orlando willcox was certain to be right one way or the other philander snow leaned out to spit over the side of the handbasket six days on the road he said reckon my backsides as petrified as some of the bones them perfessers dig out of the ground if my hindquarters were that petrified theodore roosevelt said i wouldnt be able to feel them and i most assuredly can but six days of hard riding would have left us just as worn and we can carry more supplies in the wagon besides fort benton cant be much farther not when we passed through great falls day before yesterday if it was much further i expect id be too crippledup to walk a tall by the time we got there snow said if the mountain wont come to mohammed mohammed has to go to the mountain roosevelt said he saw at once that his traveling companion had not the slightest idea what he was talking about suppressing a sigh he made himself what he thought was remorselessly clear if forts are the only places in montana territory where volunteers may be enrolled into the us army then i needs must go to a fort to remove the unfortunate adjective from roosevelts unauthorized regiment yeah and all your toy soldiersll be a real part of the army then too snow said which made roosevelt swallow another sigh the ranch hands were good men honest men true men hed seen as much many times just as many times though hed tried to hold any sort of intelligent conversation with one of them and just as many times hed failed with or without intelligent conversation he and phil snow rattled north east close by the north bank of the missouri river on toward fort benton theyd followed the river all the way from the farm except for enormously overdeveloping the buttocks and every single circumadjacent nerve the trip was easy snow pointed ahead smoke on the horizon boss if that dont mean were about there ill swallow my chaw what would happen if you did roosevelt asked as usual curious about everything id sick my guts up and pretty damn quick too snow said expecto rating for emphasis i done it once when i got throwed off a horse his tone turned mournful it aint somethin you want to do twice as he must have known he didnt have to make good on his promise inside of half an hour the handbasket rolled into fort benton a considerable town had grown up around the fort which lay as far west along the missouri as even the shallowestdraft steamboat could reach the same thing happened around the legionary camps in the days of the roman empire roosevelt thought he glanced over to philander snow and shook his head snows many admirable qualities did not include an interest in ancient history roosevelt kept the thought to himself snow was glancing around too into the back of the wagon you gonna put on your fancy uniform boss he asked hope it aint got too wrinkled from sittin there bundled up this past week i think ill be smarter leaving it bundled up roosevelt answered by what i heard in great falls this henry welton in command of the seventh infantry is only a lieutenant colonel himself i dont want to go in there looking as if im claiming to be his superior officer thats clever thats right clever philander snow shifted the reins to his left hand so he could slap the other down on his thigh you dont mind my sayin so youre wasting your time runnin a ranch you ought to be in politics the thought has crossed my mind roosevelt admitted if i hadnt decided to come out here i might have run for the assembly back in new york ill tell you this muchwe need to see some changes made and thats a fact if the people who are running things now wont make em we need to throw the rascals out and put in some people who will snow brought the wagon to a stop across the street from the timber gate and adobe walls of fort benton perhaps not coincidentally he brought it to a stop directly in front of a saloon you wont need me to go in and talk with this lieutenant colonel whatever his name was will you boss no i dont suppose i will roosevelt stuck out his lower jaw and looked fierce but i will need you in some sort of state to travel when i come out again have a few drinks enjoy yourself but if i have to pour you into the wagon you will regret it and not only on account of your hangover ill be good snow said dont really fancy the notion of heading back toward the ranch with my head poundin like a stamping mill next to that prospect nothing roosevelt threatened could put fear in him but he hurried into the saloon with such alacrity that roosevelt clicked his tongue between his teeth then he shrugged hed see when he came out of fort benton mornin to you the sentry at the gate said when he approached state your business if you please the soldier did not stand aside i wish to speak with lieutenant colonel welton roosevelt answered i have assembled a body of volunteer troops to offer to the us army how big a body of troops the sentry asked unimpressed you got five men ten fifteen even dribs and drabs is what were gettin and theyre hell to put together roosevelt s chest inflated with pride my friend he boomed i have a complete and entire regiment of cavalry ready for action your colonel has only to give us our orders and we shall ride he had the satisfaction of watching the sentry drop his rifle and catch it before it hit the ground he had the further satisfaction of watching everyone within earshotand he hadnt tried to keep his voice down far from itturn and stare at him had the sentry had a plug of tobacco rather than a pipe in his mouth he might have swallowed it as things were he needed a couple of tries before he managed to say youre that roseyfclt fellow down by helena fry me for bacon if you aint heard about you a couplethree days ago but i didnt believe a word of it believe it roosevelt said proudly its true the sentry did bert he called to a soldier within hey you bert come take mr roseyfelt here to the old mans office hes the one thats fitted out a cavalry regiment by his lonesome bert exclaimed in astonishment the sentry now seemed to believe hed invented roosevelt saying its a fact you go right on in mr roseyfelt i cant leave my post but bert therell take care of you thank you roosevelt strode into fort benton he wouldnt have wanted to try bombarding the place the walls had to be thirty feet thick two bastions at diagonal corners further strengthened the fort all the buildings faced inward having the outer wall as their back bert led roosevelt across the parade ground to the regimental commandants office through the window roosevelt saw a man busily wading through paperwork he understood that more vividly than he would have a few weeks before regimental command even of the as yet unauthorized regiment involved more attention to detail and less glory than he would have dreamt when bert announced him lieutenant colonel welton set down his pen and stared in astonishment youre the roosevelt we heard about the officer rose from behind his battered desk good god sir i mean no offense but i believe my son is older than you are its possible lieutenant colonel roosevelt admitted henry welton was about fortyfivetwice his own age more or lesswith redgold hair going gray and a formidable mustache his grip as they shook hands was odd he was missing the last two joints of his right middle finger once the polite greetings were out of the way roosevelt went on no one else down toward helena was doing the job sir so i resolved to undertake it myself thatsmost commendable mr roosevelt a whole regiment by god thats amazing welton still sounded flummoxed please sir sit down his gray gaze speared roosevelt as he grew more alert ill bet you call yourself a colonel too dont you wellyes roosevelt was suddenly very glad hed left the uniform in the wagon the man with whom he was speaking looked to be a veteran of the war of secession and had earned regimental command with years of patient service next to that having the wealth to outfit a unit all at once seemed a tawdry way to gain such a post unwontedly humble roosevelt went on i would not presume to claim rank superior to yours if and when we are accepted into the service of the united states ah that yes welton shook his head i never thought id have to worry about taking in a whole regiment at a gulp youve had em gathered together for a bit now too if what i hear is anywhere close to straight i bet theyre eating you out of house and home as a matter of fact they are roosevelt leaned forward in his chair thats not the reason i ask you to accept them though he pointed north toward canada what lies between this fortress and the canadian border but miles of empty land would you not like to have a regiment of mounted men patrolling that land guarding against attack from the treacherous british empire and perhaps taking the war into canadian soil if the regiment is worth having id like that very much welton answered if theyre a pack of cutthroats or if theyre fairweather soldiers who look pretty on parade but wont fight i want no part of em he leaned forward in turn what precisely have you got down there by helena mr roosevelt for the next hour the regular army officer subjected roosevelt to a searching interrogation on every aspect of the unauthorized regiment from recruitment to sanitation to discipline to weapons to medicine to tactics roosevelt thanked his lucky stars he had done such a careful job of keeping records without them he would never have been able to respond to the barrage of questions why winchesters henry welton snapped at one point two reasons roosevelt answered one i could gain uniformity of weapons for my men with them but not with springfields which are far less common among the volunteers and two mounted men being widely spaced in combat rapidity of fire struck me as a vitally important consideration he waited to see how welton would respond to that the officers next question was about something else altogether which roosevelt hoped meant the reply had satisfied him at last the commander of the seventh infantry set both hands down flat on the desk after staring down at them for a few seconds he said well mr roosevelt i had trouble believing it when i heard about it and i had a damn sight lot more trouble believing it when i saw youre still wet behind the ears but unless youve got p t barnum for your adjutant id say youve done a hell of a joba hell of a job sir i saw damn few volunteer regiments twenty years ago that could hold a candle to yours and youre telling me you had no soldierly experience before you decided to organize this regiment thats right roosevelt said ive always strongly believed though that a man can do whatever he sets his mind to do i already told you once i wouldnt have believed it welton said where did you learn what you need to know about being a colonel from bookswhere else i am a quick study quick study be damned henry welton gave roosevelt a very odd look do you have any notion how rare it is for any man let alone a pup like you to read something and then up and do it just like that he held up the hand with the mutilated finger never mind you dont need to answer that youve answered enough of my questions bring your regimentthe unauthorized regiment amusement glinted in his eyesup here and ill swear em in if theyre half as good as they sound colonel roosevelt uncle sams getting himself a bargain yes sir theodore roosevelt sprang to his feet and saluted as crisply as he knew how as soon as he did it he realized he shouldnt have not while he was wearing civilian clothes he felt ready to burst with pride when the regular army officer returned the salute even if it wasnt proper welton accepted it in the spirit with which it was offered roosevelt hardly remembered the polite words they exchanged in parting he was amazed the soles of his boots kicked up dust as he left fort benton he thought he was walking on air no one had absquatulated with the wagon while he was in the fort talking with lieutenant colonel welton he didnt see philander snows body stretched out on the planks of the sidewalk either bloodied or just stupefied from too much whiskey downed too fast it was in fact in his judgment as near a perfect day as the lord had ever created a woman in a basque so tightfitting it might have been painted on her torso and a cotton skirt thin almost to translucence came strolling up the street twirling a parasol for dramatic effect she paused in front of roosevelt stranger in town she remarked and set the hand that wasnt holding the parasol on her hip lonely stranger he studied the soiled dove she had to be ten years older than he was maybe fifteen the curls under her battered bonnet surely got their color from a henna bottle despite inviting words her face was cold and hard as the snowcovered granite of the rockies roosevelt had broken an understanding of sorts with alice lee when he came out west and was far from immune to animal urges he sometimes slaked them down in helena but tried to pick friendlier partners than this walking cashbox who smelled of sweat and cheap scent besides the exultation filling him now was in its way nearly as satisfying as a thrashing tussle between the sheets as politely as he could he shook his head maybe another time tightwad the harlot sneered and strutted off roosevelt almost called after her to let her know a new cavalry regiment was coming to town that would put fresh fire under her business but no philander snow deserved to know first roosevelt strolled through the swinging doors of the saloon there sat phil still upright but showing a list were authorized roosevelt shouted in a great voice hot damn snow said when the news penetrated which took a bit drinks are on me roosevelt said such openhanded generosity had won him friends in helena and it did the same in fort benton good he thought ill be coming back here soon colonel alfred von schlieffen had hoped that by traveling to jeffersonville indiana to observe the us attack on louisville he would escape the ghastly summer weather of washington and philadelphia in that hope he rapidly discovered he was doomed to disappointment along the eastern seaboard the atlantic exerted at least some small moderating effect on the climate deep in the interior of the continent as schlieffen was now nothing exerted any moderating effect whatever the air simply hung and clung so hot and moist and still that pushing through it required a distinct physical effort his uniform stuck greasily to his body as if someone had taken a bucketful of water from the ohio and splashed it over him almost every house in jeffersonville even the poorest shanty had a porch draped with mosquito netting or metalmesh screen on which people slept in summer to escape the furnace like heat inside the buildings even the porches though offered but small relief all the americans insisted the climate in the confederate states was even hotter and muggier schlieffen wondered if they were pulling his leg as their slang expression put it this side of the amazon or equatorial africa a worse climate seemed unimaginable under canvas in among general willcoxs headquarters staff not that to his mind it was a proper staff for a general the men around willcox were more messengers than the specialists and experts who could have offered him advice worth having schlieffen was as comfortable as he could be he also found himself happy which puzzled him till with characteristic thoroughness he dug out the reason the last time hed been under canvas during the francoprussian war had been the most active most useful stretch in his entire career the time when hed felt most alive he could hardly hope to equal that feeling now but the back of his mind had recalled it before his intellect could accompanied sometimes by captain richardson who like general rosecrans adjutant had a smattering of german he wanted to improve sometimes by another of general willcoxs staff officers schlieffen explored the dispositions of the building us army you have indeed assembled a formidable force he said to richardson as they headed back toward headquarters from another tour i would not have thought it possible not when a large part of your numbers is made upare made upof volunteers is made up richardson helped his english as he helped the americans german danke schon heir oberst he fell back into his own language we fought the war of secession the same way yes schlieffen let it go at that the results of the war did not seem to him to recommend the method but his guide would have found such a comment in poor taste nevertheless the us achievement here was not to be despised kurd von schlozer was right americans had a gift for improvisation he did not think germany could have come so far so fast from nearly a standing start whether the usa should have begun from nearly a standing start was a different question fifty thousand men more or less had been gathered in and around jeffersonville and the towns nearby with the supplies they needed and with a truly impressive concentration of artillery how is the health of the men schlieffen asked the hellish climate hereabouts only added to the problems involved in keeping large armies from dissolving due to disease before they could fight ganz gut richardson waggled a hand back and forth to echo that about what youd expect weve had some typhoid no cholera thank god or wed be in trouble and a lot of the volunteers are country boys they wont have had measles when they were little not living out on farms in the middle of nowhere you come down with measles when youre a man grown youre liable to die of em same goes for smallpox only more so yes schlieffen said this time without any intention of evading the issue the german army faced similar problems he wondered whether relatively more german or american soldiers had been vaccinated against smallpox then he wondered if anyone knew or could know so many things he might have liked to learn were things about which no one else bothered to worry one thing oliver richardson said i know the rebs wont be in any better shape than we are schlieffen nodded that was from everything hed been able to gather a truth of wider application than richardson suspected or would have cared to admit the two american nations rival sections even before the confederacy broke away from the united states thought of themselves as opposites in every way as enemies and rivals were wont to do they might indeed have been head and tail but they were head and tail of the same coin oh christ captain richardson muttered under his breath here comes that damn nigger again the negro walking toward them was an impressive man tall and well made with sternly handsome features accentuated by his graying nearly white beard and head of hair his eyes glittered with intelligence he dressed like a gentleman schlieffen had thought nigger a term of disapproval but perhaps his mediocre english had let him down this is mr douglass yes he asked and richardson nodded you will please introduce me to him certainly richardson replied now that the black man had come within earshot the adjutant was cordial enough mr douglass he said i should like to introduce you to colonel von schlieffen the german military attache to the united states colonel this is mr frederick douglass the famous speaker and journalist i am pleased to make your acquaintance colonel douglass deep rich voice left no doubt why he was a famous speaker he held out his hand schlieffen shook it without hesitation and i am also pleased to meet you he said hed asked captain richardson to introduce him to douglass not the other way round had the captain assumed schlieffen was of higher rank because he was a soldier or because he was a white man on the other side of the ohio in the csa the answer would have been obvious maybe it was obvious on this side of the river too douglass said it is good to see colonel that germany maintains a friendly neutrality with my country despite the affiliation of the other leading european powers with our foes who set freedom at nought and whose very land groans with the clanking chains of oppression germany also remained neutral toward the confederate states a fact schlieffen thought it wiser to pass over in silence instead he asked and when you speak and write of this campaign what will you tell your yourhe paused for a brief colloquy in german with captain richardsonyour readers that is the word what shall i tell them about this campaign douglass repeated the question and so gained time to think a trick schlieffen had seen other practiced orators use his answer when it came surprised the german officer i shall tell them it should have started sooner oliver richardson scowled angrily general willcox will have overwhelming force in place when he strikes the rebels he said and what force will the rebels havewhen he finally strikes them douglass asked which did nothing to improve richardson s temper knowing when to strike is an important part of the art of war schlieffen said in lieu of agreeing out loud with douglass a few sentences from the man had convinced him that negroes of whom he knew little were not necessarily fools as i happen to know the general commanding the army of the ohio has informed mr douglass that he has conceived his own understanding of when that time is captain richardson said and i am willing to presume that a career soldier knows more of such things than one who has never gone to war the united states have refused to let men of my color go to war though we would be their staunchest supporters douglass rumbled his temper rising to match that of willcoxs adjutant then he shook his massive head no i am mistaken the united states permits negroes to serve in the navy but not in the army he held out his hands pale palms up toward schlieffen in appeal colonel can you see the slightest shred of reason or logic in such a policy schlieffen said have not come to the united states to pass judgment on my hosts certainly not in front of my colleagues in us uniform he added to himself what goes back to berlin is another matter when the attack goes in we shall see who had the right of it richardson said after the attack succeeds i trust mr douglass will be generous enough to acknowledge his mistake i have acknowledged my errors many times douglass said which is a good deal more than many of our career soldiers have done judging by the memoirs that have seen print since the war of secession as for career soldiers knowing when to strike was it not president lincoln who said that if general mcclellan was not using the army of the potomac at the moment he would like to borrow it for a while richardson rolled his eyes if youre going to hold up lincoln as a paragon of military brilliance his expression said what he thought of that but hed misjudgedand underestimateddouglass by no means captain the negro took obvious pleasure in demolishing his foes argument but he seemed to have a better notion of when to fight than the career soldier in charge of that army wouldnt you say oliver richardson stared he turned even redder than heat and humidity could have accounted for but when he found his tongue he spoke in chilly tones if you will excuse me mister douglass i am going to take colonel schlieffen back to his accommodations im so sorry captain i didnt mean to keep you douglass tipped his bowler as if to apologize his courtesy was more wounding than spite would have been he tipped the hat to schlieffen too this time the german officer thought with genuine goodwill colonel a pleasure to meet you very interesting also to meet you schlieffen replied they shook hands again douglass went on his way his step jaunty despite age and imposing bulk he knew hed won the exchange so did captain richardson come on colonel he said sharply a moment later he muttered something to himself schleiffen thought it was god damn that nigger but couldnt be sure after a few steps the military attache asked if the united states let blacks into the navy why do they not let them into the army as well in the navy theyre cooks and fuelheavers in the engine room richardson answered patiently mr douglass is glib as all getout i grant you that colonel but you cant expect a negro to have the courage to advance into the fire of the foe with a rifle in his hands if glib meant what schlieffen thought it did it was about the last word he would have applied to frederick douglass richardson s other point perplexed him too why can you not expect this he asked patient still richardson explained because most negroes havent got the necessitiesthe spirit the courageto lay their lives on the line like that i think perhaps the englishmen fighting thezulus i believe to be the name of the tribein the south of africa would about this something different say schlieffen observed richardson gave him the same stony stare hed sent toward douglass general willcoxs adjutant walked along without another word till they came to schlieffens tent here are your quarters colonel he said then and stalked off without a backwards glance as schlieffen ducked his way into the tent he realized he might as well have challenged captain richardsons faith in god as his faith in the inferiority of the negro though coarse canvas hid the land on the other side of the river the german military attache glanced south toward it the men of the confederate states held similar opinions did that make them right or merely similar with his limited experience schlieffen could not say he wanted to get another chance to talk with douglass at supper that evening but the negro must have chosen a different time to eat or eaten away from the headquarters staff if captain richardsons attitude toward him was typical schleiffcn didnt blame him for that after supper he decided not seeing douglass might have been just as well he himself still had to remain in the good graces of the staff or he would not learn everything he wanted to know about the us plan to cross the ohio and invade the csa he wondered if general willcox was coming to regret having chosen to concentrate against louisville rather than say covington farther east bringing invasion barges down to cincinnati would have been easy since the little miami river ran by the town the streams that flowed into the ohio opposite louisville the middle the falling run the silver the millwere small and feeble most of the barges came to them by rail that that could be done impressed schlieffen that it had to be done impressed him in a different way the next morning the confederates started shelling the barges and boats that were being gathered us artillery promptly opened up on the confederate guns schlieffen had already noted how many cannon the united states had brought to support their attack now the usa used the guns to keep the confederates from disrupting it a considerable artillery duel developed the cs gunners had to take on the us cannon bombarding them lest they be put out of action without means to reply that meant they had to stop hammering away at the barges so the us shelling served its purpose schlieffen judged the united states had more guns here than did their foes they did not put the rebels out of action though schlieffen shook his head the confederate states were bringing men and materiel to louisville as the united states were on this side of the river he didnt think the csa had as much but defenders didnt need as much either had willcox struck fast and hard two weeks before even a week before he might have had a better chance of carrying the town by main force that wouldnt be so easy now men and guns and barges kept pouring into jeffersonville and clarksville and new albany though when all else failed numbers worked wonders orlando willcox had numbers on his side if only schlieffen thought he would get around to using them abraham lincoln watched in fascinated wonder as us troops marched into salt lake city from the north the soldiers some mounted others afoot tipped their hats and grinned widely at the flagwaving crowds who cheered their arrival down state street they came under the eagle gate at the corner of state and temple the wooden eagle its wingspan more than twice as broad as a man was tall perched on a beehive supported by curved iron supports mounted on pale stone posts though the latterday saints had erected it and though the beehive was their symbol its fierce beak and talons now seemed to symbolize the power of the united states leaning over toward gabe hamilton who was cheering as loudly as anybody else lincoln asked in all these people on the street do you see a single solitary mormon not a one hamilton answered at once not many gentiles whore missing though ill tell you that surveying the soldiers in their natty blue jackets the metalwork of their rifles bright and shiny the sun glaring off the steel barrels of the field guns that rolled along after a troop of cavalry lincoln was moved to quote byron the assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee gabe hamilton clapped his hands together thats firstrate stuff and remember how it ends and the might of the gentile unsmote by the sword hath melted like snow in the glance of the lord i think thats how it goes i know damn well thats how the mormons hope it goes true enough lincoln said i am of the opinion that they are doomed to disappointment in those hopes however president blaine whatever else may be said of him is not a man to take half measures as we have seen in his recent conduct of foreign affairs having decided not to suffer the semisecession of utah he will aim to make certain such a mischance cannot occur again a tall handsome man with a fine gray beard came riding down the street on a gray gelding that was a splendid piece of horseflesh the fellows coat was endowed with a superabundance of brass buttons as he got closer lincoln saw that each of his shoulder straps bore a single silver star though they had not set eyes on each other for almost twenty years lincoln and brigadier general john pope recognized each other at about the same time pope broke out of the parade and rode over toward lincoln the horses hooves kicking up dust at every step i heard you were in salt lake city sir the general said nodding are you well very well thank you lincoln replied i am glad to see the power of the united states return to utah it has been sorely missed glad to see it even under my command eh pope might not have seen lincoln since the war of secession but his glare made it plain he had forgotten nothing in all that time yes very glad lincoln said simply you shipped me away from the real war pope said you sent me off to fight redskins and gave my men back to the young napoleon that lazy pompous fraudand look how much better than i he did with them no pope hadnt forgotten a thing his sarcasm was meant to wound and it did but my duty is to serve my country in whatever place i am given mr lincoln and i have done that duty and so now i find myself able to liberate you along with the rest of this rebellious territory strange how things come full circle is it not general you made errors during the war of secession i likewise made errors and those far worse than yours else the war should have been won lincoln said if you believe a day has passed from that time to this when those errors were not uppermost in my mind i must tell you sir that you are mistaken pope grunted the soft answer giving him nothing against which to strike seemed to discomfit him well he said at last roughly i aim to make no mistakes here i intend putting the fear of godthe proper christian god mind you the god of wrath and vengeancein these mormons they shall obey me or suffer the consequences no they shall obey me and suffer the consequences he gave a stiff nod then kicked his horse up into a canter so he could resume his place in the military procession well juliette hamilton said in a tone altogether different from general popes did i hear that man call general mcclellan pompous has he looked in a mirror any time lately lincoln smiled at that he thought she spoke to vent her own feelings not to make him feel better paradoxically that did make him feel better his relief however was shortlived a cavalry colonel with long golden locks and a fierce mustache gave him a look that made popes seem mild and benevolent the horseman kept scowling back over his shoulder at lincoln till he was out of sight fellow doesnt seem fond of you gabe hamilton remarked no lincoln said resignedly he went on not many who served during the war of secession are for which who can blame them i cant remember that mans name but he was one of mcclellans staff officers i wonder how he likes serving under mcclellans rival now what are his choices he can like it or lump it hamilton leaned forward like a hunting dog going on point what the devil are those funnylooking things on the gun carriages havent seen anything like them before neither have i they dont look like cannon do they lincoln s curiosity was piqued during the war of secession hed taken a keen interest in military inventions of all sort he was something of an inventor himself and held a riverboat patent though nothing had ever come of it rifle barrels sticking out of a brass case he shrugged my chief hope is that we need not see what destruction they can reap a last company of infantry marched past following them came a mounted sergeant who called out in a great voice brigadier general pope the military governor of utah territory will speak in temple square at three this afternoon everyone should hear him mormons and gentiles alike he rode on a few yards then repeated the announcement military governor is it lincoln thoughtfully clicked his tongue between his teeth no president blaine isnt doing things by half with that title general pope will have the power to bind and to loose sure enough pope was not the first man to whom he would have entrusted such power but president blaine could not have asked his opinion and would not have if he could juliette hamilton said someone needs to bring the mormons into line since that was also true lincoln held his peace he would have gone to temple square alone but gabe hamilton also wanted to hear what pope had to say lincoln hadnt thought the square could be any more crowded than it had been on the sunday when hed gone to the tabernacle but discovered he was wrong both mormons and gentiles were thronging to it to hear john pope lay down the law pope was ready for any trouble the mormons might cause which was likely the best way to keep them from causing trouble he himself stood on one of the granite blocks that would eventually be raised to the mormon temple the men on the temple now were not mormon masons however they were bluecoats with springfields more riflemen were atop the tabernacle behind pope a couple of field guns probably loaded with case shot bore on the crowd in front of him stood one of the unfamiliar brasscased contraptions hamilton took his watch out of his vest pocket and looked at it either it was a little slow or the one pope was using ran fast for it showed a couple of minutes before the hour when the military governor of utah territory held up his hands for silence he got it faster and more completely than he would have anywhere else in the usa except in matters bearing on their faith a large exception lincoln thought the mormons obeyed authority fellow citizens pope boomed the dusty breeze carrying his words out across temple square with my arrival here the government of the united states resumes control over this territory after the illegal and outrageous attempt on the part of the authorities of the church of jesus christ of the latterday saints to extort acquiescence to its immoral creed by impeding the flow of men and goods and messages across the continent no government sensitive to its right could possibly yield in the face of the threats and intimidation proffered by these socalled authorities telling mormons and gentiles apart by looks or dress was usually impossible lincoln had no trouble seeing who was who now gentiles cheered and waved their hats some of them waved the flags with which theyd greeted the soldiers too mormons stood silent listening hardly moving almost as if theyd been turned to stone pope went on fellow citizens we are at war against the confederate states against england and lickspittle canada against france in time of war the leaders of the mormon church through their deliberate actions offered aid and comfort to the enemies of the united states by blocking the rail lines and by cutting the telegraph wires offering aid and comfort to the enemy in time of war is treason nothing less oh my gabe hamilton whispered hes going to hit them hard he surely is lincoln whispered back by order of president blaine pope continued the former civilian government of utah territory is dissolved it having proved unable to maintain the authority of the us constitution in this area utah being a territory in rebellion against the united states and now returned to the authority thereof by military mighthe gestured up at the riflemen and back toward the cannonit is considered to be under military occupation as military governor i am the new dictator hamilton murmured lincoln nodded pope proceeded to prove them both right hereby declare the suspension of the right to obtain a writ of habeas corpus i declare the suspension of the right to trial by jury mormons having corrupted the process by repeated false and outrageous verdicts justice henceforward shall be by military tribunal can he do that hamilton asked legally do you mean maybe the supreme court will say he cantyears from now lincoln answered if this territory is denned as hostile soil under occupation though he may well be able to do as he pleases every male citizen of utah territory shall be required within the next sixty days to take an oath of loyalty to the government of the united states pope declared the oath shall also include a denial that the said male citizen is or shall henceforth be wed to more than one woman at any one time perjury pertaining to this section shall be punished with the utmost severity by the aforesaid military tribunals polygamy within the boundaries of utah territory is from this time forward abolished and prohibited again the gentiles applauded again the mormons revealed themselves by stonelike silence being taller than almost everyone around him lincoln could see a considerable part of the crowd here and there two or three or four women sometimes with children in their arms stood grouped around one man what was going through their minds pope said because of its role in instigating and carrying out the rebellion of utah territory against the united states the church of jesus christ of the latterday saints is declared not to be a religion liable to protection under the first amendment but a political organization subject to sanctions for its acts until further notice construction of the socalled mormon temple is suspended public worship at the mormon tabernacle and other socalled mormon churches is also suspended as are all other public meetings of more than ten persons one last point any resistance to military authority will be crushed without mercy shooting at soldiers and destroying trains tracks telegraph lines or other public necessities of any sort will result in hostages being taken if the guilty parties be not promptly surrendered the hostages shall be hanged by the neck until dead anyone doubting my ability or will to fulfill that promise mistakes me general pope looked out over temple square return peaceably to your homes people of utah obey the legally constituted authority of the military government and all will be well disobey only at your peril as lincoln and hamilton walked back to the carriage in which theyd come to temple square the salt lake city man asked does he mean what he says should not care to try to find out the contrary by experiment lincoln answered john pope had a name as a hard man during the war of secession and ive heard nothing of how he has conducted himself here in the west in the years since to make me believe hes changed that evening lincoln was about to sit down to supper at the hamilton s table when someone knocked on the door gabe hamilton went to open it he called an officer to see you mr lincoln im coming lincoln walked to the door to find himself facing the short energetic blond cavalry officer hed noted in the parade what can i do for you colonel george custer fifth cavalry the man said briskly i am told mr lincoln that you had conversations with mr john taylor the mormons president when lincoln didnt deny it custer went on do you know his present whereabouts no lincoln said if hes not at home or perhaps at the tabernacle i have no idea where he might be why if you dont mind my asking he is to be arrested for treason along with the rest of the mormon leaders custer answered we cant lay hands on him though hes run off god knows wherei was hoping you might too when we catch him general pope aims to hang him higher than haman chapter g eneral thomas jackson peered north across the ohio river through a telescope the onslaught cannot now be long delayed he said to brigadier general peter turney who stood by his side i thank our heavenly father for having given us this much time in which to ready louisville for the storm the yankees were slowcoaches in the last war turney answered his tennessee twang contrasting with jackson s softer virginia accent doesnt look like theyve learned a whole hell of a lot since for which we should also give thanks to god jackson said and turney nodded negro labour gangs in tunics and trousers of coarse undyed cottonalmost the same color as oldstyle confederate uniformswere still busily digging firing pits and building earthworks and abatis throughout louisville but especially down by the waterfront without the slaves the defenses of the city would have been far weaker than they were brigadier general turney asked sir is it true what i hear that president longstreets going to try and manumit the niggers after the war under bushy gray eyebrows his broad earnest face was worried it is true general jackson said and turney grimaced he feels the effort to be necessary for reasons of state reasons of state be damned turney pointed toward a gang marching along with picks and shovels shouldered like rifles without slaves like that bunch there what in blazes are we supposed to do the next time the yankees pick a fight with us i can hope that even if free the negro shall not be equal to the white man and shall be subject to some form of conscription in time of need turn em loose and theyll get uppityyou mark my words turney said then rather to jackson s relief for he agreed with the views the tennessean expressed he changed the subject do you think we knocked out enough of their invasion boats to have held them up i wish i did but i very much doubt it jackson answered artillery is ideally suited for breaking up an attack once launched but i fear the science has not advanced to the point where it can preempt one that day may be coming but has not yet arrived well hurt em when they do comewhenever that is brigadier general turney said we shall do more than hurt them general jackson said we shall smash them and wreck any further hopes for the invasion of our country they may havewe shall do that or i will know the reason why and the men responsible he did not raise his voice or make any histrionic gesture nevertheless before turney quite realized what he was doing he gave back a pace from jackson the brigadier general laughed nervously the men wont dare lose he said theyre more afraid of what youd do to em than they are of the damnyankees jackson considered that is as it should be he said at last and swung up onto his horse leaving turney to stare after him he rode back through louisville to the headquarters hed established south of the city beyond us artillery range even in its present state with most of the civilian population fled louisville struck him as the least distinctively southern city in the confederate states that didnt spring only from its having been the last town to fall into confederate hands many of the people hereabouts were yankees by origin or descent from new york and new england and louisville like covington farther east still looked across the border to the united states in the same way that cincinnati on the other side of the ohio looked south to the confederacy all three were towns that had grown up trading what the north made for that the south did that north and south were now two different countries made trade more complicated but had neither stopped it nor even slowed it much coins jingled in jackson s pocket some had been minted in the usa some in the csa both nations coined to the same standard along the border that was all that mattered yankee greenbacks circulated as readily as the brown banknotes issued in the confederate states a lot of people hereabouts not only didnt much care whether the stars and bars or the stars and stripes flew over them they hardly noticed which flag did fly they will i expect learn the difference in short order jackson said to himself a company of infantry the soldiers in gray the officers in the new butternut uniforms was marching north as he rode south past them the men grinned and whooped and tossed their hats stonewall they shouted abstracted jackson was by them before he raised his own hat to acknowledge the cheers he rode past the university of louisville past the downs where locals told him people were talking about building a racetrack and into a grove of oaks where hed pitched his tent so he could rest under the shade of the trees after giving his horse to an orderly he hunted up his own chief artillerist major general e porter alexander it wont be long he said bluntly good alexander answered high time he was more than ten years younger than jackson with a perpetually amused look on his long handsome face and a pointed brown beard flecked with gray much will depend on your guns general jackson said i shall want as much damage as possible done to the yankees boats while they are in the water and to their installations on the northern bank of the river i understand sir alexander said weve been trying to hurt them before they launch but we unmask ourselves when we bombard them and they have a lot of guns over there trying to knock us out say what you will about the rest of the us army their artillery has always been good he and jackson smiled at each other jackson had begun his military service in the us artillery alexander himself had started out as an engineer switching to big guns not long after choosing the confederate side in the war of secession it is of the most crucial importance that they not gain such a lodgment on the southern shore of the ohio that they drive us beyond rifle range of the river jackson said that would enable them more easily to erect bridges to facilitate the flow of men and equipage into our country and their engineers are not to be despised either he didnt often think to return compliments and was always pleased with himself when he did remember such niceties as long as they dont drive us out of cannon range we can still give them a rough time alexander said and our guns range a deal farther than they did in the last war jackson noted the artillerist did not promise he could put the bridges out of action with his guns one reason he appreciated alexander was that the younger officer never made promises impossible to keep shall rely on your men quite as much as on the infantry jackson said coming from you sir ill take that alexander replied in fact ill let the men know you said it if anything will make them fight harder thatll do it they conferred a while longer jackson went back to his own tent where he spent an hour in prayer he had heard that general willcox the us commander was also a man of thoroughgoing piety that worried him not in the least lord thou shalt surely judge the right he said after a frugal supper of stale bread and roasted beef with salt but no other seasoning a regimen he had followed for many years he checked with the telegraphers to see if president longstreet had sent him any further instructions longstreet hadnt having ordered him to make a defensive fight longstreet seemed content to let his generalinchief handle the details robert e lee god rest his soul had known how to write a discretionary order seeing that longstreet had learned something from the man who had commanded them both was good on returning to his tent jackson reviewed his dispositions he was he decided as ready as he could be he doubted the same held true on the other side of the river taking that as a sign god favored the confederate cause he pulled off his boots knelt beside his ironframed cot for the days last petition to the lord then lay down and fell asleep almost at once whenever he was in the field he had himself roused with the first twilight at latest hed just sat up in bed after the orderly woke him when a great thundering rose from the north none of the artillery duels his forces and general willcoxs had fought were anything close to this it begins he exclaimed as usual all he needed to put on were his boots and his hat that done he rushed out of the tent he almost collided with e porter alexander who emerged from under canvas as fast as he did alexander had shed his tunic for the night and was wearing only shirt and trousers which made him look more like a yankee labourer on a hot afternoon than a confederate general before sunup now we shall see what we shall see alexander said for all the world like a chemistry professor about to drop a bit of sodium into water for the sake of the flame and smoke artillery can do so much more than it could during the last war but we knew much more about sheltering from it too a lesson learned from painful experience jackson said now all at once he wished hed encamped in the open the leafy canopy overhead kept him from having any better notion of what was going on than his ears could bring him and all he could learn from them was that both us and confederate guns were in action every one of them sounding as if it was pounding away as hard as it could an orderly led up jackson s horse at the same time another man dashed up to the generalinchief with a telegram clutched in his fist this just in from general turney sir he said it cuts off halfway dont know if a shell broke the wire or his operator got hit give it to me jackson put on his glasses then took the wire it was hard to read in the stilldim light a soldier brought over a candle by the flickering light jackson read us forces on the river in large numbers resisting with artillery and rifle fire need as the private from the signals office had said it ended there deducing what general turney required though required no great generalship a schoolchild could have done it jackson shouted for a messenger when one appeared he said the two brigades quartered near the gait house are ordered to the waterfront to resist the invaders if their commanders have not sent them forward on their own initiative the messenger saluted and dashed off shouting for a horse jackson gave the identical order to the soldier whod passed him the telegram with the us bombardment i do not know if a wire can get through but make the effort not far away e porter alexander was also giving orders in a calm unhurried voice until we know different well go on the notion that the yankees are doing what we expect that means fire plan one with guns ranged in on the river and on the indiana docks to stick to their assigned targets any changes from the plan are to be reported to me at once when he was done he turned to jackson with a smile on his face a pity isnt it general that battles have grown too large to be commanded from the front if messengers and telegrams dont constantly tell us whats happening across the field how can we direct the fighting in a fight this size we cant and i hate that jackson said leading a brigade against winchester made me feel a young man again i tell you this though general i am going to see the fighting for myself even if only from a distance he mounted the horse the orderly had brought and rode out from under the spreading branches of the oaks toward a nearby hilltop sunrise was near the eastern horizon glowed with pink and gold light the spark that was venus gleaming through it only the brightest stars still shone in the darker sky farther west but the northern quadrant was ablaze with bursting shells jackson might have been watching a fourth of july fireworks display from some distant house by where the smoke was thickest he could tell that the us gunners were giving the wharves of the waterfront a fearful pounding had he led the yankees he would have ordered the same to make the confederate infantrymen keep their heads down and prevent them from bringing too heavy a fire to bear against the invasion boats the smoke kept him from discerning much more than that and with every passing minute though the light got stronger the smoke got worse smoke from the yankees guns on the other side of the ohio smoke from bursting shells and smoke from the cs cannon responding to the enemys fire jackson s frown was venomous he wanted nothing so much as to grab a tredegar and go where the fighting was hottest but major general alexander had the right of it if he did that he could not at the same time command more men were capable of fighting the damnyankees than of leading the entire army against them and had he snatched up a rifle and run off to pretend he was a private soldier he would have been able to see even less of the battlefield than he could from his present vantage point hed already been too long away from his electric eyes and ears and messengers would be getting back to headquarters from the fighting by now too regretfully he used feet and reins to start his horse back toward the tent among the trees no sooner had he dismounted than the first messenger arrived dirtyfaced with a torn and filthy uniform eyes wide and staring from what was surely his first taste of combat he stared at jackson too was that because he was meeting a man legendary in the csa or simply because he was too battered to recall the message he was supposed to deliver then very visibly his wits began to turn as if they were a steamboats paddlewheel general jackson sir he exclaimed the damnyankees have men ashore on our side of the river he gulped lots of em sir even in the predawn stillness southern indiana remained sultry sticky frederick douglass stood in a field just outside the city limits of new albany every couple of minutes he would slap at himself as a mosquito bit him im an old man he said sadly i remember being able to hear the mosquitoes buzzing around so that sometimes could get them before they got me no more not for years now they take me by surprise that amused the us artillerymen standing by their pieces awaiting the word to commence it aint no big loss pop one of them said that goddamn buzzing drives me crazy nothin else but a couple of his comrades spoke up in agreement better to know the enemy than to let him take you by surprise douglass insisted which drew another chuckle from the massachusetts volunteers in the couple of days hed been with them theyd treated him well general willcox had made a good choice in assigning him to their battery when hed asked to watch the bombardment of louisville from among the guns a rider came trotting down the road he halted when he saw the guns big dark shapes in what was otherwise an empty field open fire at four am sharp he called and rode on to give the next battery the word someone struck a match first stepping well away from the guns and limbers to do so the brief flare of light showed the boyish features of captain joseph little the battery commander fifteen minutes he said after checking his pocket watch men well load our pieces now so as to get the first shots off precisely on the mark in darkness just this side of perfect the gun crews handled unscrewing the breech blocks loading in shells and bags of powder after them and sealing the guns once more as smoothly as they might have done at high noon douglass had already seen that the artillery volunteers most of whom were militiamen of long standing were trained to a standard close to that of their regular army counterparts which could not have been said about the volunteer infantry captain little spoke up again mr douglass youll want to make certainhis bay state accent made the word come out as suhtn almost as if he were a rebelyoure not standing right behind a gun when they go off the recoil will send them rolling backwards at a pretty clip douglass made sure he would be out of harms way the quarter of an hour seemed to take forever douglass was beginning to think it would never end when off to the east toward jeffersonville several cannon roared all at once well i like that captain little said indignantly still lacks two minutes of the hour by my watch he must have been staring at it in the faintest early twilight some people think they have to come to the party early if we cant be the first we shant be the last either more guns were going off some of them much closer than the earliest ones had been little raised his voice battery b fire all six guns bellowed at essentially the same instant the noise was a cataclysmic blow against douglass ears great long tongues of yellow flame burst from the muzzles of the cannon illuminating for half a heartbeat the men who served them dense smoke shot from the muzzles too douglass paid that scant heed for the moment as captain little had warned the cannon recoiled sharply a couple of artillerymen had to step lively to keep from being run down by the creaking gun carriages come on lads little yelled get em back in place and give the damn rebs another dose of the same grunting and cursing the crews manhandled the cannon up to the positions from which theyd first fired the breeches were opened swabbed out to make sure no burning fragments of powder bag remained then in went another shell another charge and the loaders screwed the breeches shut the guns bellowed once more not in a single salvo this time but one after another each crew struggling to be faster than those to either side of it the smoke quickly filled the field coughing douglass moved to one side seeking not only cleaner air to breathe but also an unimpeded view of the battlefield as twilight brightened toward day it was as if the curtain lifted on an enormous stage set out before him seeing that panorama he understood for the first time why men spoke of the terrible grandeur of war barges and boats packed with soldiers raced across the ohio so the men they carried could close with the foe shells from the us guns poured down like rain on the waterfront of louisville each one burst with a flash of sullen red fire and a great uplifting cloud of black smoke douglass could not imagine how any confederate soldiers compelled to endure such a cannonading could hope to survive but the enemy not only survived he fought not only did shells burst along the waterfront they also burst in the ohio looking across the river douglass could see flashes from the muzzles of confederate guns cannon similar to those the massachusetts volunteers served their thunder reached his ears too attenuated by distance but still very real tall plumes of water flew up from the shells that splashed into the ohio when douglass noticed those the spectacle before him suddenly seemed less grand his breathing came short his palms got sweaty remembered terror was almost as vivid as the original he did not need to wonder what the blueclad men in the invasion boats were feeling hed felt it himself when the rebel battery shelled the queen of the ohio those confederates had been but a handful with only a single battery of oldfashioned guns to bring to bear on their target the rebels here had modern cannon by the score and targets to match many of them too would be their regular army men the best they had not all their shells then burst in the river some struck the hurrying boats full of us troops douglass groaned when one of those simply broke up and sank throwing its heavily laden soldiers into the water another stricken vessel must have had either its helmsman hit or its rudder jammed for it slewed sharply to one side and collided with its neighbor both boats capsized and as the barges and boats neared the bank the confederates held tiny yellow flashes like faroff fireflies began appearing in the midst of the shellbursts from the us guns confederate riflemen got to work incredible as it seemed to frederick douglass they had not only lived through the bombardment that still continued but also retained enough spirit to fight back strongly loathe their cause though he most sincerely did douglass could not help respecting their courage the first boats began to reach the far bank of the river tiny as blue ants in the distance us soldiers swarmed off them rushing forward to find cover from the galling fire of their foesand also from the fire of their friends which had not shifted its targets despite the landings artillery put douglass in mind of some great ponderous stupid beast liable to step on and crush anyone who came too near it he scrawled his impressions of the fight down in a notebook intending to weave them into a coherent whole back at his tent when he had the leisure he had as yet no idea whether the battle would be won or lost all he could discern at the moment was that both sides were fighting not only with desperate courage but also with all the resources science and industry could give them and then in the twinkling of an eye the battle lost its abstract panoramic quality and the face of war changed for him forever the cs artillery had concentrated on the invasion boats on the ohio and to a lesser degree on the quays where the barges and boats took on their cargo of soldiers every so often though the rebs would lob a few shells at the us guns bombarding them no doubt aiming more to harass than to stop the cannonading by the time the sun came up frederick douglass had grown intimately familiar with the astonishing cacophony emanating from an artillery battery working at full throttle he did not however understand what shrill rising screams in the air meant until three shells burst in swift succession among the massachusetts volunteers whose deeds hed intended chronicling the ground shook under his feet something hissed past his head had it flown a few inches to one side of its actual path any hopes of his chronicling the artillerymens adventures would have died in that instant more screams these from the ground not the air the sounds of agony douglass forgot he was a reporter and remembered he was a man stuffing the notebook into a pocket he ran across the field even now under the stink of gunpowder the grass smclled sweetto give what aid he could oh dear god he stopped short with an involuntary exclamation of horror there lay brave clever captain joseph little who had never by word or deed shown he thought douglass less than himself on account of the color of his skin captain little would never think good or ill of douglass again not in this world one of the confederate shells had burst quite near him now he lay like a broken doll broken quite literally his head had been torn from his body and lay several feet away from the stilltwitching corpse half the top of it had been blown off too red blood pooled on gray brains more red soaked the green grass under him the first flies were already landing captain little of course did not scream the one virtue of his death was that he could have had no notion of what hit him one second he was directing his guns the next gone the fellow down on the ground beside himno by some miracle or insanity sitting up nowwasnt screaming either when the artilleryman sat his intestines spilled out into his lap a shell fragment had laid open his belly as neatly as the slave butcher gutted hogs back in douglass plantation days the massachusetts volunteer looked down at himself isnt that something he said his voice eerily calm douglass had heard of men with dreadful injuries who seemed unaware of pain in stories from railroad accidents and such he hadnt believed them but now he saw they wereor could betrue the artillerymans eyes rolled up in his head he slumped back to the ground dead or unconscious if he was unconscious douglass hoped hed never wake for he had no hope of surviving not with that dreadful wound by one of the hellish freaks of war another soldier had had his guts torn out in almost identical fashion he was not quiet he was not calm he rolled and thrashed and shrieked and wailed spraying blood and fragmented bits of himself in every direction douglass heard one of his teeth break as he clenched his jaws against yet another scream he was perfectly conscious perfectly rational and looked likely to stay that way for hours to come his eyes wide and wild and staring fixed on douglass and held the negros in an unbreakable grip kill me the artilleryman growled his voice rough and ragged and ready to dissolve into yet another howl of anguish for gods sake kill me dont make me go through any more of this he wore a revolver on his belt with what looked like a supreme effort of will he jerked one dripping hand away from his belly long enough to get the pistol out and shove it along the ground toward douglass before douglass knew what hed done he picked up the revolver it was heavy in his hand he knew how to use one hed carried one in the grim days just after the war of secession when whites were liable to blame any negro they saw for the war and perhaps to go from blaming him to hanging him from the nearest lamp post he looked around none of the other artillerymen was paying him the least attention some were tending to less dreadfully wounded comrades others farther away kept on serving their own guns so as to make sure the confederates on the other side of the river got their fair share of death and mutilation and horror and torment shoot me the eviscerated soldier groaned dont stand there with your thumb up your ass damn you to fucking hell for the first twenty years of his life and more douglass had been caught up in the nightmare of slavery now he found another nightmare one that turned men into beastsinto beasts straight from the abattoirin different more abrupt fashion caught in the toils of this new nightmare he pointed the revolver at the artillerymans forehead and with a convulsive motion squeezed the trigger the pistol bucked in his hand a neat blueblack hole appeared above the wounded soldiers left eye the back of his head blew out splashing hair and shattered bits of skull and brains and blood over the grass with a cry of disgust and dismay douglass set down the pistol and rubbed his bloodsmeared palm against a trouser leg again and again as if by that means he could wipe off the mark of cain several artillerymen spun toward him at the sound of the shot most of them seeing what he had done simply went back to what they were doing one though with a sergeants three red stripes on his sleeve walked over toward the distraught negro after looking at the dead gunners ghastly wound for a few seconds he put an arm around douglass shoulder i want to thank you for what you did sir he said noah was my cousin and you put him out of his pain if you hadnt been there i believe id have had to do the job myself and that would have been mighty hard mighty hard indeed it wasthe only thing i could do douglass said slowly so often words like that revealed themselves for the shallow selfjustification they were this once he heard truth in them so did the sergeant noahs cousin thats right he said thats just exactly right and dont you let it trouble your mind again he went back to his cannon leaving douglass who was not a roman catholic fully understanding for the first time in his life the power of absolution alfred von schlieffen paced along the northern bank of the ohio growing more frustrated by the moment a great battle raged a mile away and he could not get to it he could not even do a proper job of observing not from where he was too much smoke hung in the air to let him have more than the vaguest notion of how the fight was going and the us authorities flatly refused to let him board a boat and cross over to the kentucky side of the river im sorry sir said second lieutenant archibald creel who accompanied him today because general willcox had more urgent things for oliver richardson to do the general doesnt want us to have to explain to berlin how we let their military attache go and get himself killed a couple of confederate shells smashed to earth within a hundred yards of schlieffen i am on this side of the river to do that he remarked with some asperity as if to underscore his words more shells screamed in lieutenant creel did not look as if he had been out of west point more than a week he stood firm both against the shelling and against the foreign officer he was required to shepherd i have my orders sir he said he might have been quoting holy writ in a soldierly way he was to the devil with your orders schlieffen muttered but in german which the youngster did not speak he tried again i am a military man i am obliged to take risks for my fatherland no sir creel said and stuck out his chin donnerwetter schlieffen said no doubt about it he was stuck since he was stuck he decided to make the most of it he set off at a brisk walk toward the jcffersonville wharves which as an accomplished map reader he knew to be closer than those of clarksville like a dog on a leashand so he was a watchdogsecond lieutenant creel tagged along men in bluesome in the faded uniforms of the regulars more wearing the dark and almost spotless clothes the volunteers had recently donnedwaited in long stolid lines to board the barges and steamboats that would ferry them over the river so they could fight schlieffen had watched boats get hit in midstream no doubt the soldiers had too they kept moving toward the boats anyhow exactly as germans would have done that took discipline and courage both the combination being especially remarkable for volunteer troops long trenches paralleled the lines that led down to the waterfront when the confederates started sending shells at the men near schlieffen they lost their stolidity in a hurry diving into the trenches to shelter from blast and flying splinters schlieffen stayed upright so did lieutenant creel it was surely the first time hed been under fire he handled himself well as soon as the shells stopped falling the us soldiers scrambled out of the trenches and resumed their places in line as if nothing had happened stretcherbearers carried away a couple of groaning wounded men but only a couple these ditches are a good idea schlieffen said they save casualties that they do archibald creel sounded as proud as if hed thought of them himself so schlieffen thought i have here one small worthwhile thing is this enough for sending me so far is this enough to have gathered from the greatest battle of the war the answer in both cases was painfully obvious with more temper than he usually showed schlieffen rounded on second lieutenant creel you can tell me for a fact that us troops arc at this time fighting in louisville yes sir i can tell you that lieutenant creel said sehr gut you cannot however tell me where in louisville or how in louisville or how well in louisville they are fighting nicht wahr i dont know those things for certain no sir creel said i wish i did he laughed nervously the fog of war his wave encompassed the very real layer of thick gray smoke that blanketed louisville that hung low and close to the ohio and that drifted and swirled in eddies on the us side of the river where will they knowwhere will they have some ideahow goes the fighting in louisville schlieffen demanded one place is over across the river sir creel said where i cannot go where you cant go the young lieutenant agreed the other place would be general willcoxs headquarters he laughed again well confederate headquarters too i suppose but you cant go there either no schlieffen wondered if the german military attache to the confederate states was over there he hoped so having reports from both sides of the line would be useful back in berlin provided he learned enough here to give his report any value be so good then as to conduct me back to general willcoxs tent to go to the front is for me forbidden and here in the middle i might as well be in the middle of the sea take me back yes sir lieutenant creel said i dont know how much the general will let you see with the battle still going hot and heavy but well find out you come along with me sir and ill take you there schlieffen would have got there faster by himself but not much the young us officer had some notion of where he was and a pretty good idea of how to reach headquarters schlieffen who laid a map in his head over the territory it represented as automatically as he breathed had to do some unobtrusive guiding only once or twice to keep creel headed in the right direction creels presence was enough to get schlieffen past the sentries outside general willcoxs tent given the stream of messengers rushing in and out schlieffen suspected he could have got past them without the young lieutenant some of those messengers clutched telegrams in their fists schlieffen noted that though he didnt remark on it for fear the americans would notice him noticing so theyd managed to get an insulated wire across the ohio had they that would help them general willcox would have far more intimate knowledge of what his troops were doing and would be able to send them orders far quicker than if hed had to rely on boat traffic alone getting to see him actually directing the battle though took a bit of doing a staff officer senior to second lieutenant creel halted schlieffen saying this isnt anything we want any foreigners watching i am not an enemy schlieffen said indignantly i am a neutral when general rosecrans let me come here he gave me leave to observe the actions of the army of the ohio you are preventing me from doing my duty to my country when you keep me from observing im doing my duty to my own country the staff officer retorted i protest schlieffen said loudly he was half the size and twice the age of the soldier barring his path if the idiot in blue didnt get out of his way though he was going to do his best to break him in half lieutenant creel saw as much and put a restraining hand on his arm wait a second colonel he said let me get captain richardson hell straighten this out he hurried past the other staff officer who suffered him to enter general willcoxs sanctum sanctorum whats all this about richardson said when he came out i havent got time for any nonsense right now schlieffen and the other us staff officer both started talking at once glaring at each other while they did richardson listened for a little while then threw up his hands yes colonel schlieffen you may observe hickenlooper keep out the rebs and the englishmen germany s friendly and shes likelier to stay that way if you let the attache here do his job danke captain richardson schlieffen said he gave the dejected hickenlooper a severe look as he strode past him as he might have expected the command center of the army of the ohio was more chaotic than that which hed known while serving in the francoprussian war messengers and officers rushed in and out and stood around arguing with one another in a fashion no german general would have tolerated for an instant orlando willcox looked up from the enormous map held flat on a table by a couple of stones a governmentissue tin cup and one bayonet stabbed through the paper and into the wood ah colonel schlieffen he said glad to see you we have our landings on the other side of the river you see schlieffen bent over the map sure enough pins with blue glass heads showed us forces scattered along the kentucky shore of the ohio and controlling the sandy islands in the middle of the river even as the attache watched an aide stuck in another blueheaded pin this one a little farther from the riverbank we have to push them back willcox said we cant bridge the river with snipers picking off our engineers as fast as they get into range artillery is bad enough but confederates say what you will about them produce firstrate sharpshooters and theyll have every stretch of the ohio ranged to the inch too so theyll know precisely how to sight their rifles the need for accurate sighting is the major drawback of the modern military rifle schlieffen agreed to reach longer ranges rifle bullets needed considerable elevation which meant the angle at which they descended was far from insignificant it also meant a minor error in estimating range was almost sure to result in a miss out past a couple of hundred yards willcox pointed to the red pins measling the map of louisville it would appear that the cs commander rather than withdrawing from the city here to engage us on open ground intends to make his fight within louisville itself thereby subjecting it to all the rigors of war such callousness as to its fate and the fate of those civilians remaining there cannot win him favor either with his own people or in the eyes of the lord this may well be so schlieffen said but fighting in a builtup area is a good way to cause the foe many casualties remember the battle the french had to wage to put down the paris commune he granted the communards a good deal of thoughtful respect their ferocity along with some of the fighting napoleon ills army had waged even after its cause was lost in his view gave the lie to those germans who reckoned france too weak and decadent ever to be a menace again fighting like that is uncivilized willcox declared there he had a point european practice had long been for armies to engage away from centers of population both to avoid endangering civilians and to give both sides the greatest possible opportunity to manoeuvre the americans had generally followed the same rules during the war of secession if the confederates were changing those rules now have you learned for certain who the cs commander is willcox looked unhappy rebel prisoners are confirming the rumors we had heard we do face general jackson ach so sehr interessant schlieffen murmured in the war of secession jackson s reputation had come from manoeuvre so relentless his infantry got the name of foot cavalry a man who could change his entire strategic concept was one who demanded to be taken seriously a messenger burst in and said general willcox sir colonel sully says the first minnesota is melting like st paul ice in may theyre pinned down on the waterfront down to a couple of hundred men now the rebs in front of em arc too strong for em to go forward and if they retreat they swim what in heavens name does sully want me to do willcox demanded sir he asks if you could put some artillery on the rebs in his front the messenger answered theyre either behind barricades or fighting from houses and shops and all makes the goddamn sons of bitches twice as hard to kill sir hopin youll pardon my french thou shalt not take the name of the lord in vain willcox said which gave alfred von schlieffen at least a partial understanding of what the idiom meant schlieffen knew french and knew the man had not been speaking it willcox consulted the map then went on the first minnesota is close by second street no sirmore like sixth street the messenger told him somebodys boats next to ours took aa goldanged pounding sir and we had to slide downstream a ways to keep from gettin rammed sixth street willcox snarled as if it were an obscenity ill do what i can soldier i make no promises has colonel sully no other way to escape his predicament sir yes sir the messenger said he told me to tell you if he didnt get some kind of help some kind of way pretty danged quick he was going to have to surrender willcox jerked as if wounded ill do what i can he repeated the messenger saluted and hurried away when the fellow was gone willcox turned to a runner from the signals office a wire across the river colonel sully is to attempt to regain his position as indicated in the plan for the attack that failing he is at minimum to hold his present position at all hazards he is to be informed that i am endeavoring to obtain artillery support for him the runner departed with a scrawled order schlieffen noted that willcox made no effort to give the first minnesota the artillery support hed said he was trying to arrange sometimes when all resources were committed elsewhere that kind of deception was necessary to keep a unit fighting a while longer sometimes it meant only that the commanding officer wasnt doing as much as he should to solve a problem which was it here schlieffen didnt know enough to be certain the army of the ohio had a foothold on the far side of its eponymous river schlieffen would not have given good odds on that before the battle began the next question was what willcox would do with his bridgeheadand what stonewall jackson would do to it edgar leary dumped three telegrams on sam clemens desk here you go the young reporter said more wires on the louisville fighting these arewhat the sixth seventh and eighth today clemens asked leary nodded the editor of the san francisco morning call puffed out smoke like a steamboat almost makes me wish the lines in utah were still down he skimmed through the wires except for some new casualty figures higher than the ones hed seen a couple of days before he didnt see anything he hadnt known already he threw two of the telegrams into the trash keeping the one with the numbers hed been about to start a new editorial they would come in handy war he wrote is a good deal like a meat grinder in that you feed in fresh chunks of whole meat at one end and what comes out the other is fit only for stuffing into frankfurters by all reports general willcox is working the crank for all he is worth in the louisville campaign military meat is different from the ordinary kind because some of the fragments that come out the business end of the grinder are still able to tell you what they were like before they went into the hopper if the figures we have are accurateand god save the soul of the poor devil charged with aggregating the totalthe united states have in the past several days gained anywhere from a quarter of a mile to a mile of land formerly having suffered the great misfortune of flying the confederate flag and have purchased this real estate at a cost of to date young soldiers mutilated and killed that we have here a great bargain can hardly be denied for excuse me mr clemens edgar leary said a couple of gentlemen are here to see you if theyre gentlemen clemens replied without looking up theyll wait till im ready to see them christ edgar you know better than to jog my elbow when im trying to get words down on paper its not a social call clemens a rough unfamiliar voice said angrily sam spun his chair around he discovered he was looking down the barrels of two colt revolvers each held by a burly individual who did not look as if he would have much compunction about pulling the trigger ignoring the guns he said people who use my surname commonly have the courtesy to put mister in front of it as my friend there did the larger of the two menthe one who had spoken before said next rebel spy i hear tell of who deserves to get called misterw be the first rebel spy that sent clemens bouncing to his feet in fury who the devil says i am and how in hell has he got the nerve to say it quick as a striking rattler the smaller ruffian snatched from his desk the editorial on which sam had been working after reading the couple of paragraphs there he said sure as hell sounds like treason to me god damn you clemens shouted give me that back before i punch you in your stupid nose he kept on ignoring the colts leveled at him so did the men holding them if adolph imbecile sutro tries to throw a newspaperman in jail for what he writes hell have every newspaperman in san francisco by this time tomorrow and that includes the heathen chinese there still is such a thing as the first amendment to the constitution which has a thing or two to say on the subject of a free press has either of you blockheads ever heard of it reporters typesetters and printers had been edging through the morning call offices toward the altercation a savage grin stretched across sams face if these hooligans tried hauling him away by force theyd have a battle on their hands newspapermen looked after their own but then the bigger intruder said we aint here on account of what you write mister clemens unexpectedly he had the wit to load that with irony and to add hell nobody reads it anyways were here on account of its done been reported that you are a veteran of the confederate states of america is it so or aint it that you were in the confederate army during the war of secession clemens started to laugh then he got a look at the faces of the men who worked with him at the morning call none of them had ever heard the story of his brief absurd stint as a rebel private in missouri none of them looked interested in hearing it either even before he could answer they started slipping back toward the places where they worked is it or aint it the ruffian repeated not to speak of sam said at last the company i was in never did more than mooch around a bit to impress the girls but you were in were you the big man with the revolver said you come along with us then pal you can do your explaining to the soldiers if they reckon youre on the up and up then they do is all but if they dont theyll put you away where you cant get into any mischief this is an outrage clemens thundered nobody else in the offices said anything at all the smaller ruffian seemed to remember he had a gun he jerked the muzzle in the direction of the doorway with a sigh clemens walked to the door he grabbed his hat off the tree as he went by lets get this over with the sooner we do the sooner i can come back here and let the world know what a pack of damned fools weve got running around loose these days the men with revolvers didnt seem inclined to argue with him as long as he did what they said they didnt care what else he did stacked against a colt what did an insult or two matter they had a buggy tied up outside the building the silence behind sam as he shut the door hurt him worse than his sallies hurt the spyhunters the both of you are plumb loco clemens said as the smaller fellow took up the reins and began to drive if ive been such a grand and dreadful terror to the united states lo these many years what in sweet jesus name was i doing as assistant to the governors secretary in nevada territory even before the blamed war was over that the secretary had been his brother orion after whom his son was named he did not bother mentioning dont know replied the bigger gunman the one with some trace of wit what were you doing there by his tone sam might have been sending a daily telegram to richmond from carson city clemens replied only with dignified silence he also did not ask where they were going as he had intended he judged that would become obvious in short order a judgment vindicated when the little ruffian headed north and west away from the heart of the city the only thing of any consequence in that direction was the presidio the army base charged with defending san francisco no matter how long sam had lived in these parts he never ceased to marvel at the beauty of the view across the golden gate looking north toward sausalito blue sky greenblue sea the wooded headland rising swiftly above it a ferry boat thin black plume of smoke rising from its stack gave a touch of human scale to natures grandeur so did the stone walls of fort point when a sentry came forward to demand the business of the new arrivals the bigger of sams captors said we got a feller here might be a spy like hell i am sam shouted as far as the sentry was concerned he was invisible and inaudible the bluecoat waved the wagon into the fort having reached the garrison commanders waiting room in jig time clemens proceeded to put it to the purpose for which it was named he waited and waited and waited the bravos whod shanghaied him didnt wait with him they had better things to do when he poked his head out of the door to the parade ground through which hed come in a soldier pointed a bayoneted springfield at him and growled you get back in there the colonelll see you in his time not yours fuming sam retreated at last after what had to be closer to two hours than one the door to colonel william t shermans office opened come in mr clemens sherman said lean and erect he wore a closetrimmed beard that had once been red and was now mostly white his mouth was a thin slash his pale eyes did their best to stare through sam harsh lines ran down his pinched cheeks losing themselves in his beard near the corners of that narrow mouth the word that sprang to clemens mind for him was bitter his office presented a stark contrast to the genial clutter that made finding things on sams desk an adventure everything here was obviously just where it belonged sam was sure anything that had the gall to go where it didnt belong even to sidle an inch out of place would end up in the guardhouse to teach it never to get gay again sherman sat he did not invite clemens to sit glancing down at the beginning of the editorial the smaller gunman had purloined and also at a large neatly written sheet of paper on which sam could make out his name he said why dont you tell me why youre here sir clemens normally wisecracked without thinking much as he breathed facing this man he restrained himself i am here colonel because i served something less than a month in the marion rangers a confederate unit of sorts in missouri during the war of secession because of that someone has decided i must be a spy sherman said when louisiana seceded i was teaching at a military academy there i resigned at once and came north to serve my country as best i could how is it that you fought under the stars and bars i never fought under them sam replied i marched a bit and rode a horse a bit but i never once fought governor jackson called for soldiers to repel the us invadersso he named themwhich is how the marion rangers came to be it was a grand and glorious unit colonelthere were fifteen of us all told the one time we got near a farmhouse that some us troops were guarding our captaintom lyman his name wastold us to attack it we told him no to a man we said no the rest of my socalled military career was cut from the same stuff i never fired a shot at a soldier of the united states none of us did before the marion rangers became as one with nineveh and tyre sherman s jaw worked you put this down to youthful indiscretion thenfor you would have been a young man in thats just what i put it down to colonel sam said with an emphatic nod and you did serve the us government in nevada sherman said checking that paper again sam wondered how much of his lifes story was contained thereon in musing tones sherman continued yet these days you speak out strongly in the papers against the war as you have here he let a finger rest on the editorial fragment for a moment what connection if any has the one to the other colonel youve seen real war at first hand which is far more than ever did clemens said what is your opinion of it my opinion hed startled sherman but the officer did not hesitate long sam got the idea he seldom hesitated long about anything war is cruelty and you cannot refine it its glory is all moonshine only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded cry aloud for blood vengeance and desolation war is as close to hell as a merciful god allows upon this earth that was more than sam had bargained for if you can speak so strongly and still defend our country how does questioning the wisdom and conduct of this war make me a confederate agent sherman stroked his chin you might be an agent using such a pretext as concealment his mouth thinned further clemens had not thought it could but i have no evidence to say you arc not a particle what you say of the marion rangers squares with what i have on this sheet herethe men who brought you in were overzcalous we were all quite mad twenty years ago it should never have happened that thin mouth twisted i shall write you a good character mr clemens which you must show to be released from this fortress and may show to anyone seeking to trouble you hereafter he inked a pen and began to write thank you colonel clemens said fervently one thing more sherman looked up from his work sam went on may i beg the use of a horse or buggy the gentlemen who brought me here did not wait upon the outcome of your hearing he said not a word about how long hed waited himself ill see to it sherman said the pen scratched over the paper sam did not mind waiting now not a bit bountiful utah lay about ten miles north of salt lake city on the railroad line george custer had come south past it on the armys triumphal march toward and then into the capital of utah territory hed paid it no special mind then just one more noaccount town among so many now though he wasnt going to pass it by along with the two troops of cavalry at his back he was going to go through it like a man searching his pockets for a fivecent piece with which to buy his sweetheart a sarsaparilla his own sweetheart worse luck was back at fort dodge blast john taylor anyhow he grumbled dash and doubledash him why couldnt the old fraud have stayed in salt lake city so we could snatch him up and stretch his neck and have done dont be such a sourpuss autie his brother tom said if it werent for taylor and the rest of the scoops who ran away wed be stuck with garrison duty instead of doing something halfway useful out here halfway useful is right we ought to be fighting the rebs not sitting on these confounded mormons custer paused and sent tom a quizzical look scoops whats a scoop a mormon heard it the other day his brother answered after removing his hat tom mimed removing the top of his skull in the same way and scooping out a large portion of its contents have to have most of your brain missing to buy what theyre selling dont you think mm youre likely right custer weighed the word scoops i like that he laughed then pointed ahead weve got a whole scoopful of scoops coming up much the biggest building in bountiful was the mormon chapel a woodandadobe structure with five spires that looked as if it might have grown from the ground instead of being built the lands around the chapel were bountiful enough no matter how foolish the mormons religion was in custers eyes he couldnt deny they made skillful diligent farmers people came out into the street from the chapel from the houses and from the barbershop and drygoods store to stare at the soldiers their dogs came out with them the troopers had shot several dogs on the way up from salt lake city theyd probably shoot more here mormons dogs ran from mean to meaner nobody said anything as the troopers rode up custer knew he wasnt loved here he didnt care whatever the mormons loved as far as he was concerned had to have something wrong with it he held up his hand behind him the cavalrymen reined in every one of them carried a loaded carbine across his knees that wasnt just for dogs so far the mormons hadnt given any trouble the best way to make sure they didnt give any trouble was to be ready to smash it down ruthlessly if it arose tom custer said i hate all these staring faces back in salt lake at least the gentiles were on our side out here there arent any gentiles to speak of and nobodys on our side we arc in the right we must never forget it custer declared he raised his voice and called out to the people of bountiful we are searching for john taylor anyone who knows where this fugitive from justice is lurking will be handsomely rewarded he waited no one said a word the wind full of the salty tang of the great salt lake blew up little dust devils in front of his horse hed expected nothing different but the effort had to be made his orders said so the silence from the mormons persisting he moved on to the next step in the program we are going to search the houses and buildings of this town for the person of john taylor and for the persons of other fugitives from justice in this territory you are required to assist and cooperate with the brave soldiers of the united states engaged in this task any resistance will leave the guilty party subject to summary trial and the full rigors of military justice that drew a response from the crowd somebody called wheres your search warrants at custers smile was anything but pleasant we have none we need none utah territory having been declared a region in rebellion against the lawful authority of the government of the united states of america has forfeited the protections enshrined in the constitution you people should have thought more about what would follow from your actions before you attempted to coerce the national government into approving of your hideous practices having willfully flouted the government you will have to earn its good graces once more by showing you are deserving of them he waved to his men who swung down off their horses custer told a squad to follow him to the mormon chapel they searched the grounds finding nothing out of the ordinary and then went inside other than being ornamented with a large portrait in oils of joseph smith the founder of mormonism the interior might have belonged to any church one of the men of bountiful came inside gentlemen mr taylor is not here he said he has not been here who are you and how do you know custer growled im o clifton haight and i have for many years been a lay preacher at this chapel the man replied and i know mr taylor has not been in bountiful because i should have heard of it if he were not if hes lying lowand not if youre just plain lying either custer said haight assumed an indignant expression custer feeling briefly charitable ignored it he waved this church looks nice and fresh and clean as if people had been in it just the other day say or last sunday public worship in mormon churches is forbidden by order of general pope you will recall oh yes of course o clifton haight said you havent by any chance forgotten that order custer said why no of course not haights eyes were wide and candid he was lying custer knew he was lying he undoubtedly knew custer knew he was lying but he also knew custer couldnt do anything about it until pope had enough men to put a permanent garrison into every one of these miserable little towns the mormons would ignore every order they could no one was likely to betray them not when they all conspired together to set at nought the commands of the military governor shaking his head in angry frustration custer stalked out of the chapel his soldiers followed his eyes lighted on a house across the square it was built in a pattern with which hed become all too intimately acquainted in salt lake city a central structure that had undoubtedly been erected first with several whitewashed wings spreading out from it pointing toward the house he asked who lives there thats the sessions place clifton haight answered peregrine sessions was the first settler here better than thirty years ago now that house there that belongs to his brother zedekiah general pope forbade more than public worship to you mormons custer said a certain hard anticipation gleaming in his eyes he also forbade the practice of polygamy which has made you people a stench in the nostrils of decent americans everywhere looking at that house mr haight how many wives would you say uh zedekiah sessions is likely to have i only know of one haight said irma sessions is a pillar of our little community here ill bet she is custer sneered and how many other community pillars carry the name of sessions know of no others haight said custer had heard that in salt lake city too the mormons habitually dissembled about their plural marriages he gathered up his troopers by eye we are going to search that house for john taylor we are also going to search it for any evidence the abhorrent vice of polygamy is being practiced within if by some chances we find such evidence despite the statements of mr haight here we shall take whatever action i deem at the time to be appropriate come along grinning the soldiers followed him as they tramped toward the large rambling house they told lewd jokes custer pretended not to hear them except when a good one made him laugh out loud he walked up to the front door and rapped smartly upon it when it opened standing before him was one of the formidable middleaged women of the sort brigham young had apparently married in battalions broad through the shoulders broader through the hips graying hair pulled straight back from a face that had not approved of anything since the war of secession custer thought how good her head would look stuffed and mounted on the wall back at fort dodge next to a pronghorn or a coyote you are mrs irma sessions he asked i am and you are a united states soldier by her tone that put custer somewhere between a comanche and a polecat my men and i are going to search these premises for the possible presence of the fugitive john taylor custer announced all persons inhabiting this residence must first come forth and if we do not irma sessions inquired custer folded his arms across his broad chest then we shall remove you with whatever force proves needful and bind you over for trial for defying the authority of the united states army he pulled out his pocket watch you have five minutes he watched mrs sessions contemplate calling his bluff he watched her decide with obvious reluctance that he wasnt bluffing he watched her start to slam the door in his face and then with even more obvious reluctance think better of it within the appointed deadline half a dozen women emerged the other five as like irma sessions as peas in a pod along with them came something like two dozen children ranging from babes in arms up to youths old enough to carry a gun and girls well on their way to becoming stolid copies of their mothers where is mr sessions custer asked when the patriarch of the family proved not to be in evidence in salt lake city on business irma sessions replied maybe it was true maybe it wasnt and all six of you are his wives custer persisted oh no one of the other women said i am his widowed cousin another claimed to be his sister still another said she was irmas sister and the last two didnt explain how or why they were living there save to assert that they were not affiliated with zcdekiah sessions in any illegal or immoral manner they were so shrill so insistent custer would not have believed them even had he previously been inclined to do so which he was not in the midst of the womens denials a leering trooper brought custer a photograph in a fancy gilt frame it was a family group a stout bearded man presumably mr sessions surrounded by the six women and their multifarious offspring he displayed it to them they went quiet rudely he wondered if sessions could get the same effect with it for the sake of the mans peace of mind he hoped so i say that this photograph shows me you have been imperfectly truthful here he told them having been too well brought up to call a woman a liar to her face as you must know general pope has commanded that polygamy shall be suppressed in this territory by all available means he turned to the cavalryman any sign of taylor corporal no sir the soldier answered nobody in there now very well put this place to the torch that sin may have no dwelling place to call its own if we needs must cleanse utah with fire and sword that is what we shall do the six wives of zedekiah sessions screamed and wailed as did their female children the boys the older ones cursed custer and his men as vilely as they knew how hed heard worse despite screams and wails and curses the house burned going through the town he and his men found three more homes obviously belonging to polygamists those went up in flames too he wondered if the mormons would shoot at his men for that he almost hoped they would they didnt its not so bountiful any more he said to his brother as they led the two cavalry troops north to the next little town both custers laughed chapter t ubac drowsed under the relentless sun of the western part of new mexico territory it had been a mexican village adobe houses clustered around a catholic church that was also adobe but whitewashed then it had been a mormon settlement one of the many sprouts from the main tree in utah since the war of secession unending raids by apaches and by mexican and white bandits had left it a sad shadow of its former self that left jeb stuart whose army was camped nearby something short of brokenhearted mormons he said to his aidedecamp you ask me the damnyankees are welcome to them major horatio sellers nodded and said yes sir his principal bugbear though was not the mormons of whom only a handful were left hereabouts but the apachesnot those whod raided tubac halfway back to savagery but those now accompanying the confederate forces assuming a distinction could be drawn between those two groups which was by no means obvious after coughing once or twice he said the more time we spend with these indians sir the more i think one of the reasons the empire of mexico sold us sonora and chihuahua was to give us the joy of putting them down it could be so major stuart allowed if there were more of them they would be even worse trouble than they are too damned many of em as is sellers said stubbornly sticking out his chin if there were more he shuddered sir we have good men tough men but these apaches there isnt a one of em cant go through this country on foot faster than a trooper can on horseback come up behind you in the middle of a crowded church cut your throat and be out the window before anybody notices youre dead he was exaggerating only slightly and not at all about the apaches ability to outperform cavalry but they dont want to cut our throats stuart said they want to cut the yankees throats and especially the mexicans now they do sellers said when is it our turn he looked around and lowered his voice almost to a whisper i still say we ought to fill em full of whiskey and get rid of them when theyre too polluted to fight back that will be enough major stuart said sharply that will be more than enough one of the reasons the apaches hate the mexicans so much is that the mexicans would pull that on them again and again it would workthey like popskull no two ways about itbut it made enemies forever out of the braves the mexicans didnt get i want to use these indians against the united states i dont want to give the damnyankees any chance to use them against us yes sir sellers said stuart hid a smile he recognized that tone it was the one a soldier used when he thought a superior was out of his mind he said in the end my guess is that we civilize them major geronimos son chappo nowhes a sharp young fellow and his cousin that batsinas ive had two different blacksmiths tell me hes been after them to teach him their trade hes got only a few words of english and a few more of spanish but one of the men who was showing him things said he picked them up as fast as youd want with a white man major sellers said nothing at all he tried to make his face say nothing at all too he wasnt as good at it as the apaches clear as if he were shouting stuart read his thoughts learning things from white men doesn t civilize indians it only makes them more dangerous cherokees stuart said quietly choctaws they might as well be white themselveswell some of them thats different his aidedecamp answered but when stuart pressed him he couldnt say how it doesnt matter anyway stuart said after looking at his watch weve got to meet with geronimo anyhow get everything in a straight line for his run up to tucson and where well bushwhack the yankees when they come after him actually the meeting hadnt been set for a specific time the indians though they used telescopes most often taken from dead soldiers didnt care about watches but ninethirty was a close enough equivalent to midway through the morning which was how geronimo had put it the apaches approved of the confederateissue tents stuart had given them they were roomier and faster to put up than the hidecovered brush wickiups the indians made for themselves geronimo was sitting crosslegged in front of a little cookfire drinking coffee from a tin cup stamped csa next to him sat chappo whose bronze broadcheekboned face showed what his father had looked like as a young man as stuart came up to geronimo so did the apaches war leaders cochises handsome son naiche whom half the confederates called natchez that having a more familiar sound to their ears a clever old man named nana and hoo a tough veteran only gradually had stuart realized that geronimos influence despite lurid tales to the contrary came more from religion than generalship polite greetings used up some time both the apaches and the confederates were ceremonious folk then through chappo geronimo said our scouts have found the perfect canyon for us we can lead the bluecoats into it and you can be waiting for them with your rifles and your wagons wagons that puzzled stuart he and chappo went back and forth for a couple of minutes before he figured out the indian was talking about artillery the cannon traveled on wheels as far as the apaches were concerned that made them wagons when the misunderstanding was cleared up stuart nodded it is good where is this place let me see the paper with places on it and i will show you geronimo said stuart drew from his pocket a map of new mexico territory and unfolded it hed watched geronimo take in the concept of maps at one big bound the apache had gone from complete incomprehension to rapt admiration when he realized what the line of the southern pacific printed complete with little cross ties represented from that beginning hed made sense of the rest of the symbols in a hurry naiche who could sketch very well himself also understood maps now the apaches werent stupid the more stuart dealt with them the clearer that became he wished they were almost as much as major sellers did it would have made his life easier geronimo drew a knife from his belt to use the tip as a pointer we are here he touched it to tubac with complete confidence he could not read but he knew how to make the map in his head the one a lifetime in these parts had given him match the map on the paper the canyon is here a little more than halfway to tucson he moved the knifepoint if we are to ambush the bluecoats we will have to wait there till you have lured them stuart said is there water in so much of the southwest that was the overriding concern yes geronimo smiled for a moment hed asked the right question two springs close by good water even in summer not much water but enough he waved around at the indian encampment some of us will be with you if it is not as i say they are men you may kill hostages stuart said chappos lips moved as he repeated the word to himself so he could learn it stuart plucked at his beard considering the apaches were short on manpower they thought a raid where they lost a couple of warriors a misfortune because the fighters could not easily be replaced stuart didnt think gcronimo would offer hostages unless he was sincere well try it he said my men can ride this afternoon it is good geronimo said through chappo we most of us will ride north now when you are at the canyon you will see what sort of place it is you will see where to place your men where they can kill the bluecoats without being seen you will see where to place your big rifles on wagons so the bluecoats do not know they are there till too late even though stuart could not understand a word of the apache lingo he paid close attention to geronimos tone the indian sounded as if he was trying to reassure himself that stuart though only an ignorant white man would indeed be able to see these things and do what was required of him the confederate general civilizedly certain of his own expertise smiled at the savages conceit i will see these things he answered gently trying to ease geronimos mind you will bring me the us soldiers and i will kill them that seemed to satisfy the apache geronimo and the war leaders exchanged a few words which chappo did not translate stuart resolved to scare up some interpreters who would be on his side not the indians halfbreeds mexicans one way or another hed manage if his allies let something slip he wanted a chance to know about it geronimo was as good as his word most of the apaches rode out inside the hour about thirty stayed behind under naiche chappo stayed too to translate though naiche and some of the others spoke spanish batsinas also stayed for no better reason stuart could find than that he was fascinated by everything the white men did and wanted to learn from them a lot of the indians though found the confederates more amusing than instructive while the army broke camp horatio sellers came up to stuart shaking his head one of those red devils used a farmer to ask me what id do if i heard a gunshot he said indignantly i told him id go over and see what in blazes had happened of course he thought that was the funniest thing hed heard in all his born days so i asked him what hed do if he was so blasted smart he said hed scout around and find out what was going on without letting anybody ever know he was there looked at me like i was a chuckleheaded nigger and him with a line of yellow paint across his face to show he was on the warpath the damn savage sellers sounded like a man on the warpath himself dont worry about it major stuart said soothingly using much the same tone of voice he had with geronimo well position ourselves in this canyon and lick the stuffing out of the damnyankees that will make the redskins respect us and i dont think anything else will riding to battle stuart felt the same exhilaration hed known during the war of secession somewhere back in kentucky his young son and namesake was going up against the yankees too he hoped jeb jr would be all right the boyno not a boy not if he was fightinghad all of his own impetuous spirit and hardly any years to temper it stuart would have navigated by map and compass the apaches knew the country as well asbetter thanhe knew northern virginia he got the feeling they could have ridden along with their eyes closed and found their way across three hundred or three thousand miles of desert by the way the dust smelled and how the echoes from their horses hoofbeats came back to their ears theyd been here a long time the roadrunners probably talked with them as far as he was concerned they and the damnyankees were welcome to the country if you took it strictly as country rocks and sand and dust and cactus and brush and lizards and rattlesnakes and endless sun pounding down out of the sky so that nearly as reliable as clockwork every hour a confederate would slide from the saddle and plop to the ground most of them recovered after theyd been splashed with precious water and ridden in the wagons for a while but a couple had died running unquenchable fevers that cooked them from the inside out it was in fact country for camels the fifth confederate cavalrys humped livestock flourished here the camels ate cactus thorns and all with every sign of relish they didnt need much water and the succulent pulp gave them a lot of what they did need they were gloriously badtempered reveling in the heat where the horses laboured under it the apaches found them endlessly fascinating the indians admired the animals ability to handle the rugged terrain but thought them the ugliest things theyd ever seen chappo rode up alongside stuart after traveling with the fifth cavalry for a while and said quite seriously the god who made those beasts was trying to shape horses but did not know how stuart started to laugh then checked himself he didnt want to offend geronimos son and it was a better explanation of how camels had got to be the way they were than anything else hed heard they crossed the santa cruz river such as it was not long before nightfall and camped close by the next morning naiche and the rest of the apaches led the confederates into the desert east of the little town that had grown up around the stagecoach station at sahuarita about twenty miles south of tucson about nine oclock the next morning naiche trotted his horse back to stuart with a broad smile on his wide romannosed face aqui estd he said and then to his own obvious delight came up with a word of english here stuart rode ahead with him the farther ahead he went the better the place looked it wasnt one of the narrow valleys down which no pursuers in their right minds would follow fleeing redskins for fear of being bushwhacked but it wasnt so wide as to make an ambush impossible either as gcronimo had said he would he spotted just the place to site his horse artillery too a low rise off to one side with a good view of the track down which the enemy would likely come but not a feature of the landscape that would draw the yankees notice too soon water he asked and made his canteen slosh ah agua si naiche said and agua there was two springs as geronimo had promised stuarts force would have no trouble waiting a couple of days until the apaches who had gone on to raid tucson could bring the damnyankees back here in hot pursuit cestd bien naiche asked he grinned finding another english word good yes si stuart didnt have a dozen words of spanish himself but that was one of them good very good there it is theodore roosevelt swept out his right hand in the sort of dramatic gesture that came so naturally to him there it is straight ahead the promised land probably never before had anyone called fort benton the promised land but it was as dear to roosevelt as the land of israel could ever have been to the hebrews and roosevelt s unauthorized regiment had wandered in the bureaucratic wilderness not for the forty years moses followers had endured true but everything moved faster in the bustling mechanized modern world of the nineteenth century the weeks that had passed before the volunteers were accepted were far too long behind roosevelt the men of the unauthorized regiment raised a cheer many of them like their colonel were delighted at finally becoming us volunteers and others and some of the same men too perhaps were also delighted at the prospect of mustering close by a town with all the pleasures attendant thereto out on roosevelt s ranch theyd been living a life not far removed from the monastic the promised land roosevelt shouted once more and his troopers cheered louder than ever he nodded in enormous satisfaction and spoke again this time more quietly if you want something done by jingo you have to pitch right in and do it yourself soldiers up on the mudbrick wall of fort benton were staring at the oncoming cavalry regiment roosevelt could see their arms outstretched as they pointed to the cloud of dust in which the horsemen traveled he was still too far away to make out the amazement on their faces or to hear their exclamations but his active imagination had no trouble supplying the lack not far from the fort was a stretch of level ground where the seventh infantry was in the habit of practicing its manoeuvres roosevelt led the unauthorized regiment toward it assemble by troops he shouted and the trumpeters amplified the command hed made sure the troopers practiced that evolution every day of the journey along the missouri from the ranch outside of helena to fort benton they performed it flawlessly now he grinned from ear to ear maybe the only uniform they had at the moment was a red bandanna on the sleeve but hed turned them into soldiers not an armed mob if at the age of twentytwo i can bring order to a cavalry regiment he murmured suddenly thoughtful what will i be able to do when i have lieutenant colonel weltons years behind me but those years as yet lay ahead of him he rode toward fort benton to bring the commander of the regular army garrison out to inspect the unauthorized regiment henry welton did him the courtesy of meeting him halfway now roosevelt was wearing his colonels uniform nevertheless he saluted welton firstand as he did so noticed the regular officer had eagles on his shoulder straps too not the silver oak leaves hed worn when they met before congratulations colonel welton roosevelt exclaimed its your fault colonel roosevelt welton answered with a smile returning the salute the war department had to accept you as a colonel in the us volunteers so they gave me the same brevet rank and made me five minutes senior to you while they were about it as i told you when we first met sir that is as it should be roosevelt said id be lying if i told you i thought you were wrong welton said roosevelt nodded he had nothing but approval for a man who knew his own worth welton went on now by thunder lets have a look at the men who stirred up all this fuss with great pleasure sir side by side the two colonels rode out toward the regiment roosevelt had raised they were drawing near when roosevelt unwontedly hesitant said even after our formal incorporation into the us army sir might we continue to style ourselves the unauthorized regiment i believe it would have a salutary effect on the mens morale i dont see why not welton said if you look at things from england s point of view were an unauthorized country wouldnt you say formally what we have here is the first montana volunteer cavalry i cant do anything about that informallywell since it is informal no one will fuss at what you call yourselves plenty of regimentseven companiesin the war of secession had nicknames by which they were better known than by their official titles roosevelt started to say something more but checked himself for welton and he had come up to the troops who as one man saluted them henry welton rode gravely from troop to troop he was not a cavalry officer but his examination struck roosevelt as being as thorough as the grilling to which he himself had been subjected welton had been assessing soldiers for as long as roosevelt had been alive and knew what he was doing he puzzled the commander of the unauthorized regiment for a moment when instead of keeping on the open path between troops he rode through one pausing every now and then to examine one mans winchester anothers saddle the cartridge belt of a third and then enlightenment struck roosevelt almost as abruptly as it had struck paul on the road to damascus colonel welton had you asked i would have told you that i did not place the best men on the outer edges of the troops as a dishonest grocer will place a few pieces of good fruit on top of a great many bad ones had i asked colonel roosevelt im sure you would have told me that whether it was so or not welton softened the words with a disarming grin id sooner see for myself if you possibly can you should always see for yourself if you dont make a habit of that you will be disappointed generally when you can least afford it thank you sir ill remember that doing as much as he could by and for himself was always one of roosevelt s guiding principles having the veteran espouse it only strengthened it in his mind not satisfied with riding through one troop henry welton rode through another that done he gave his verdict these men are not up to the standards of the regular army colonel but they are some of the finest volunteer troops i have ever set eyes on especially for volunteers who have yet to see the elephant if and when they do i believe theyll manage as well as anyone could hope thank you again sir roosevelt said you make me feel my efforts on our beloved countrys behalf have proved worthwhile and so they have welton rode out before the assembled troopers men of roosevelt s unauthorized regiment he began and then had to stop while the cavalrymen yelled themselves hoarse and several of the officers made their mounts caracole men of the unauthorized regiment will you take the oath that makes you into us volunteers yes the men cried one great roar of sound roosevelt shouted as loud as he could but even in his own ears his voice was small and lost amid the others colonel welton administered the oath to them one ringing phrase at a time behind his spectacles roosevelt felt his eyes fill with tears as he spoke the words that took him into the service of the united states reaching this point had proved a greater struggle than it ever should have but unlike moses he having overcome every obstacle was allowed to enter the land of milk and honeyor the us army being what it was at least the land of hardtack salt pork and beans the oath completed he gave henry welton another crisp salute what are your orders sir for now colonel my orders arc going to be very simple very unexciting and i fear very unwelcome welton answered your men are to bivouac by troops here on this plain until such time as my regimental clerks have completed the boring but necessary business of taking down their names and other particulars this will among other things put them on the governments payroll and get them off of yours and will assure pension benefits to their next of kin in the event of their becoming casualties of war roosevelt sighed i do see the necessity sir but must it be done on the instant you have no conception of how i long to strike the british a smart blow nor of how hard it has been to sit by helena knowing i had the men at hand for the task but also knowing i was not legally entitled to use them patience colonel welton chuckled i do feel like im talking to my son i say again patience the british have made no moves against us as yet in this quarter nor even if they do in the next two dayswhich is not likelycan they sweep down on fort benton and catch us unawares in that space of time you shall have your chance i assure you not quite yet though yes sir suddenly and painfully roosevelt realized that coming under the authority of the united states not only meant he could lead his troops against the english and the canucks it also meant he was required to obey orders he did not like then he brightened sir i shall place at your disposal all my regimental records which should help your clerks do their jobs more quickly thank you im sure that will help a great deal colonel welton cocked his head to one side i shouldnt be a bit surprised if what youve got is a good deal more complete than anything im required to keep there are some forms though on which well have to get your mens signatures or witnessed marks everyone talks about the exploits of the army in the field no one mentions the paperwork that makes those exploitsand the survival of the army between them possible but its part of the life too i discovered something of this myself on commencing to recruit the unauthorized regiment roosevelt bared his teeth in what was not quite a smile i should be lying if i said it was the most welcome discovery i ever made yes i believe that welton said this being wartime youll have your chance for action and soon enough even if not so soon as you might wish had you spent as much time in the regular army as i have done you might by now have concluded that for a commanding officer the duty entails paperwork to the exclusion of nearly everything else roosevelt tried to imagine himself on garrison duty at some dusty fort out here in the heart of the west a fort without any hostile indians nearby to give an excuse for action he tried to imagine passing year after year at such duty his conclusion was that were the fort anywhere close to a high cliff he would have been likely to throw himself off it that must have shown on his face colonel welton said well its not a fate you have to worry about now would you like to order your regiment to pitch their tents here or shall i sir why dont you roosevelt answered the sooner the men fully understand they are obliged to take orders from any man of rank superior to theirs the sooner they will become soldiers in every sense of the word very well welton nodded and well reasoned too effortlessly he raised his voice so the entire unauthorized regiment could hear him he did not seem to be shouting either roosevelt wondered if he could learn the trick having given the orders welton watched with interest to see how they were obeyed he chuckled as the troopers pitched their tents a bit of variety in the canvas theyre living under eh colonel a moment later he stopped chuckling and stared good heavens is that a teepee yes sir we have several of them in the regiment they seem to work about as well as anything we white men make that they do colonel ive served enough time on the plains to be convinced of it they caught me by surprise is all henry welton wasnt only watching the soldiers of the unauthorized regiment set up their camp every so often he pulled out his pocket watch to see how fast they were doing it roosevelt wanted to get in there among them to yell and wave his arms and urge them to greater speed he made himself quietly sit on his horse and let them do it on their own if they hadnt learned what hed worked so hard to drill into them his harangues wouldnt help now his gaze flicked from the troopers to colonel welton and back again the men seemed to take forever but when the last tent was up welton put the watch back in his pocket and nodded pleasantly to him not bad colonel once again not bad at all thank you very much sir colonel theodore roosevelt beamed c olonel alfred von schlieffen and second lieutenant archibald creel strode along what had been the waterfront of louisville kentucky instead of his own uniform schlieffen wore the light blue trousers dark blue blouse and cap of a us infantry private the waterfront was in us hands but the confederates had a way of sneaking snipers forward that made being in any way conspicuous a conspicuously bad idea in his trouser pocket schlieffen had one telegram from general rosecrans authorizing general willcox to allow him to cross the ohio to observe the battle at close quarters and another telegram from minister schlozer assuring willcox the fatherland would not hold him responsible if while schlieffen was performing his military duty he was wounded or killed the military attache had needed both wires to get willcox to let him cross lieutenant creel kept staring around in disbelief ive never seen anything like this in my life he would say a few minutes later he would say it again apparently forgetting his earlier words after a bit he rounded on schlieffen have you ever seen anything like this colonel and schlieffen had to shake his head no i do not think i have wherever war went it left a trail of devastation that schlieffen knew that he had seen for himself but he had never seen war visit a goodsized city decide it liked the place and settle in for a long stay as if it were a goodfornothing brotherinlaw never till now stonewall jackson had chosen to make his stand inside louisville to make the united states if they wanted the city so badly pay the greatest possible price for it and to make sure that if they ended up taking it what they took would amount to nothing the confederates had fought in every building they had forced the us to shell whole blocks into rubble and then fought in the rubble until cleared out by rifle and bayonet they had taken horrible casualties but those theyd inflicted were worse schlieffen shook his head as he looked south toward the fighting front which was still only a few hundred yards away he could not see a single untouched building not anywhere every single structure had big chunks bitten out of it from artillery whether us or cs fire had licked through every building too leaving streaks of soot along what battered brickwork remained standing off to schlieffens left a battery of us field guns started barking when the battle for louisville began general willcox hadnt worried overmuch about getting cannon onto the southern bank of the ohio hed realized soon enough thoughprobably as fast as any german general would havethat infantry couldnt do this job by itself the shells would blast some new part of louisville into ruins if they went where they were supposed to go they might help the infantrymen advance a few more yards the air stank of smoke and death how many men lay entombed in the wreckage both sides had created whatever the number it was not small schlieffen had never smelled the battlefield stench so thick some of that was due to the intolerable weather which hastened corruption more sprang from the battles having gone on so long without moving to speak of several pairs of litterbearers came by carrying wounded us soldiers out of the fight a couple of the hurt men lay limp scarlet soaked through bandages on heads and torsos others screamed and thrashed those were the ones who felt worse torment now but they were also liable to be the ones with the better chance of recovering confederate shells screamed in lieutenant creel threw himself to the ground before they burst huddling behind a heap of bricks that had once been part of some fine riverfront office or shop or hotel so did schlieffen no hint of cowardice accrued to sheltering from splinters that killed without the courage of a proper human foe this wasnt his war either he thought the cs gunners were aiming for their us counterparts as happened in war their aim went awry the shells fell closer to the litterbearers fresh screams rose from them some from already injured men crying out as they were dropped others from bearers crying out as they were wounded bastards lieutenant creel said mud streaked his uniform more streaked his face i do not believe this was their purpose to hurt these men schlieffen said bastards anyhow creel answered he did not seem so young now as he had when schlieffen first made his acquaintance not long before he went on id like to see every one of those rebel sons of bitches dead his fury gave schlieffen an opportunity he had not been sure he would have the german military attache a general staff officer to the core had long since planned what to do if that opportunity arose he did not hesitate to put the plan into effect saying let us forward go then to the very front so we have the best chance of seeing the enemy fall creel had courage schlieffen had already seen that now his blood was up too he nodded all right colonel well do that i wish i were carrying a springfield not this blamed revolver on my hip id have a better chance of potting some of them myself being a neutral schlieffen bore no weapon of any sort he did not acutely feel the lack he knew a certain sympathy for the usa over the csa because he was attached to the us forces and another certain sympathy for the united states because the confederate states were allied with france none of that however was enough to make him anxious to go potting confederates himself together he and second lieutenant creel picked their way forward through the cratered rubblestrewn streets shirtsleeved soldiers with picks and shovels laboured to clear the paths so fresh troops and munitions could go forward and wounded men come back craack before schlieffen could react a bullet slapped past his head and buried itself with a slap in some charred timbers archibald creel turned back to him with a wry grin you were the one who wanted to do this remember i remember yes schlieffen said calmly and kept on trenches started well before the front line schlieffen and creel had been passing trench lines ever since they entered louisville in fact but the ones close by the ohio were hard to recognize because shellfire had all but obliterated them shells were falling on these trenches too but they still retained their shape you fellers want to watch yourselves a grimy unshaven soldier said as creel and schlieffen went by the rebs got a sniper in one o them buildings up ahead whos a hell of a shot aint nobody been able to cipher out just where hes at but he done blew the heads off three of our boys already today the closer to the front schlieffen got the deeper the trenches grew that hadnt helped the luckless three the soldier had mentioned but it did offer their comrades some protection the german military attache pondered as he lifted his feet over broken bricks the french could fight for a town tooth and nail in the same way the confederates were doing here if they fought in several towns in a row with this bulldog tenacity how could an army hope to defeat them without tearing itself to ribbons in the process posing the question unfortunately looked easier than answering it i think were here lieutenant creel remarked the only way schlieffen could judge whether the us officer was right was by how alert the riflemen here looked and by the fact that no trenches ran forward from this transverse one where are the confederates schlieffen asked if you stick your head up you can see their line plain as day maybe fifty yards thataway answered another soldier who looked as if hed been here for months not days course if you stick your head up they can see you too and a couple of our fellows herell have to lug you back to the ohio feet first he studied schlieffen youre the oldest damn private i ever did see i am the german military attache here to learn what i can of how you are fighting this war schlieffen explained ah got you the soldier nodded knowingly thats why this here baby lieutenant is taking care of you stead of the other way round no german officer would for an instant have tolerated such insolence even if offered only indirectly all creel did was grin and shrug and look sheepish schlieffen had already seen that standards of discipline were lax in america he had heard that was even more true in the csa than in the usa if that was so he wondered how the confederates could have any standards of discipline whatever he shrugged except as data standards of discipline in american troops us or cs were not his problemunless of course they made the men fight less well for reasons he did not fully grasp that was not the case had it been so the soldiers here would not have performed so steadily and so bravely in a battle waged under conditions more appalling than any he had known in europe and now that he was here at the front to see them fight he discovered that like a man who had wandered down to sit in the first row of seats at a theater he was too close to the action to get a good view of it off to his right the rifle fire which had been intermittent suddenly picked up he couldnt look to see what was going on there not unless he wanted to get killed all he could do was listen i think they drove us back a bit said the soldier whod spoken before hope they paid high for it i think perhaps you are right schlieffen said his ears had given him the same impression but had he wanted to follow the battle with his ears alone he could as well have stayed on the indiana side of the ohio river he turned to lieutenant creel have you any idea how many killed and wounded the confederates have suffered compared to your own no colonel creel answered only person whod know that for certain is stonewall jackson he checked himself no probably not him either for hed know their losses but not ours yes schlieffen hid his amusement second lieutenant creel was naive us papers reported the casualty figures in willcoxs army schlieffen would have bet papers in the csa did the same for those of jackson s army hardheaded officers in philadelphia and richmondand no doubt in london paris berlin vienna st petersburgwould know both sides of the story so would willcox and jackson themselves if the army of the ohio was holding the numbers tight that suggested they were not in its favor the grimy soldier echoed his thoughts saying whoever goes forward in a fight like this gets hurt worse seems like thats why im hoping the rebs took a licking there over yonder schlieffen nodded he had seen in europe that soldiers at the front often developed a keen instinct for how things were going and for which tactics worked and which didnt that looked to be the same on both sides of the atlantic let us go back he said to lieutenant creel i have seen what is here worth seeing stay low and watch out for rebel sharpshooters said the soldier whod been talking with them them bastards know their business heading north toward the river creel dove for cover whenever artillery came near bullets however he ignored striding along with his head held high schlieffen wondered whether to call that courage or bravado he recognized the difference between facing danger and courting it a lot of officers especially young officers didnt for his part schlieffen was not in the least ashamed to duck and hide behind rubble when the rebels started taking potshots at him with the indulgent tolerance of youth creel smiled you dont really need to worry colonel not now he said were almost back to the ohio they couldnt hit an elephant at this distance less than a minute later a wet smacking sound announced that a bullet had struck home second lieutenant archibald creel crumpled to the ground blood gushing from a head wound schlieffen knelt beside him he saw at once he could do nothing creel gave three or four hitching breaths made a noise halfway between a cough and a groan and simply stopped god judge his courage not his sense schlieffen murmured he stayed by the fallen lieutenant until a couple of litter bearers carried the body away abraham lincoln came out of the general store with a cake of shaving soap wrapped in brown paper and string having stayed in salt lake city so much longer than hed planned he kept needing to replenish such small daytoday items with the telegraph back in service hed been able to wire for money and had started staying with the hamiltons as a paying boarder as lincoln started down the sidewalk a closed carriage stopped in the street alongside him the curtains were drawn he could see nothing within the driver spoke to him in a low urgent voice please get in mr lincoln who lincoln paused then stiffened as he recognized the bright young man whod escorted him to john taylors home that home stood no more soldiers had wrecked it giving as their reason the suppression of polygamy where do you propose to take me lincoln asked he supposed he might be worth something as a hostage for radical mormons given his own economic radicalism and the embarrassment hed become to the republican party he had the idea hed be worth less than the mormons thought that might lead to unpleasant personal consequences for him i cant tell you that the driver answered no harm will come to you though by god i swear it he bit his lip if you aim to come sir come now i cannot let soldiers spy me loitering here lincoln got aboard the carriage not since his ignominious passage through baltimore on his way to his inauguration in washington had he let concern for his safety change how he behaved maybe he could do some good here if the mormons hadnt simply snatched him thank you sir the bright young man said as the carriage started to roll lincoln did not think he was the sort who made a habit of wearing false oaths he realized he was betting his life on that the carriage made several turns now right now left the mormon driver had the twohorse team up into a trot their hoof beats and the jolts and rattles lincoln felt said they were going at a fine clip nothing at all prevented him from opening the curtains and seeing where they were going he sat quiet sooner or later general pope or one of his inquisitors would be interrogating him about this ride he was as sure of that as of his own name truthfully being able to claim ignorance looked useful after about threequarters of an hour the carriage pulled into a building of some sort and stopped lincoln thought he was outside salt lake city it had been quiet outside the carriage for some time and the driver had stopped making turns to throw off pursuit or to confuse his passenger in the latter at least he had succeeded lincoln did not know whether he was north or south or east or west of the mormon metropolis you may get out now mr lincoln the driver said climbing down from his own high seat outside someone was closing a door a bar thudded down barn was lincoln s first thought on emerging from the carriage he revised it a moment later no livery stable his nose filled with the good odors of horse and hay and leather but for the carriage the stable was deserted with the door closed it was also twilightgloomy the man who had shut the door was coming toward lincoln though he had expected to meet john taylor he needed a moment to recognize him the fugitive mormon president was dressed like a stablehand in canvas trousers collarless fourbutton work shirt and straw hat he had shaved his beard and was growing a mustache on his formerly bare upper lip thank you for agreeing to see me he said after shaking hands to come with orem here took considerable moral and physical courage i will do what i can for you mr taylor lincoln said for that strikes me as a likely way to bring peace to this territory but i must warn you i do not think i can do much bearing a grudge against me as he does general pope will not be inclined to act favorably upon any request i make you are the former president of the united states taylor exclaimed i told you at our last meeting you exaggerate the influence that gives me i told you also you exaggerated your ability to coerce the government of the united states into doing as you desired events have proved me right in the second instance will you not credit me for knowing whereof i speak in the first also in both you would have done better to leave well enough alone taylor slowly shook his head it was not so much disagreement as disbelief all we wishall we ever wishedis to live our own lives as our conscience dictates we harm no one and what has been our reward treatment that would not be meted out to redskins or negroes do the people condemn the outrages we have suffered no they applaud and pile on more mr taylor from all i have seen in my extended stay in salt lake city the only way you mormons differ in the general run of your behavior from the mass of the american people is that you excel over them lincoln said but of course we do taylor said while the driver orem nodded vigorously lincoln held up a hand i had not finished however fine you may be in the general run of your behavior you have not the slightest chance so long as you condone and practice polygamy of ever gaining the acceptance of the vast majority of your fellow citizens this is most unjust taylor said we cast no aspersions on anyone elses usages in principle none should be cast on ours lincoln sighed if you wish to speak of principle maybe you are right do you not see however that by insisting on principle in this regard you have caused the overthrow of the principle of representative government and the principle of rule under the constitution throughout utah territory is that what you intended when you led your people into rebellion of course not taylor snapped well then lincoln spread his hands the simplest way for your church to make its peace with the rest of the united states would be for it to renounce the doctrines unacceptable to the nation as a whole and to do so in all sincerity that would require a divine revelation the mormon president replied none has been forthcoming nor do i reckon one likely pity lincoln raised one eyebrow a convenient revelation now would save your people enormous heartache enormous grief later on revelations are not born of convenience john taylor said they spring from the will of god he thrust his head forward like a stubborn snapping turtle lincoln realized he meant what he said from the bottom of his heart lawyer and politician lincoln reckoned almost everything negotiable when he had stood foursquare for the principle of the indissolubility of the union rifle musket and cannon had refuted him if you will not change your views in any particular he said what point to asking me to meet with you you give me nothing to take to general pope even assuming the military governor were inclined to accept anything i might take him we have yielded peacefully to the military power of the united states taylor said we might have done otherwise if we continue to be oppressed to be treated as a conquered province we arc liable to do otherwise we are men we can act as men general pope and his cossacks should remember as much mr taylor if you value your faith if you value the lives of your followers i implore you sir do not take this course lincoln had never spoken more earnestly if you rise in arms against the united states they will slaughter you and sow your cities with salt as the romans did to carthage long ago do you not understand that many in the army many in the government and many among the citizenry at large would be delighted to have an excuse to do exactly that we fled here to utah to escape persecution taylor said persecution pursued us should we welcome it with open arms should we bow to it as the israelites bowed to the golden calf you will have to judge the right for yourself as every man must lincoln answered but i tell you that open resistance will bathe utah in blood in a way never before seen upon this continent we left religious war behind in europe we should be well advised not to let it emigrate from that place to our shores what would you do mr lincoln were your faith under attack instead of mine john taylor did not try to hide his bitterness he framed sharp questions he would have been dangerous in a court of law but none of that mattered taylor s failing was his inability to sec that it did not matter lincoln said i believe i should have only two choices one would be to pay the martyrs price the other to accommodate myself to my neighbors usages to the degree i could do so without tearing the living heart from what i believed in no accommodation we can make and still keep to our principles would satisfy our foes taylor said that is why i hoped god in his wisdom might reveal to you a course that would let you do so lincoln said delicately he remained of the opinion that john taylor and the other leaders of the mormon church could produce a revelation if they put their minds to it the promise of peace and reconciliation mightand i can say no more than might hardly being in the confidence of general pope or president blainemight i say persuade the authorities to rescind the harsh sentences passed against you and your colleagues if i must die on the gallows or in hunted exile i am prepared taylor said lincoln believed him having seen the same implacable purpose on the faces of abolitionists and confederate leaders alike with another sigh he said then i fear this meeting had little point i shall take your warning back to general pope but i warn you in the strongest terms not to act upon it do with your own life what you will but spare your people the horrors of a war of extermination harsher than any we ever waged against the sioux he turned to orem you may as well take me back to town my friends will be wondering why i needed so long to buy a cake of shaving soap the bright young mormon held the carriage door open so lincoln could get in then closed it after him he did not ask lincoln not to open the curtains but the former president again left them alone from inside the dark cramped box of the carriage he heard john taylor undo the bar and push the liverystable door open orem clucked to the horses they leaned into their work after the trip back into salt lake city the driver halted the carriage and said if you get out here sir youll have no trouble finding your way to the home where you are staying sure enough lincoln saw he was only a couple of blocks from the hamiltons obliged he said to orem and tipped his tall hat the bright young man returned the courtesy and drove away lincoln supposed he had some secure place where he could go to earth he needed one juliette hamilton looked up from the chicken she was plucking when lincoln came into the kitchen well i never she said in arch mock annoyance i was beginning to think youd come down with a case of valley tan her eyes twinkled my dear lady although i have passed my biblical threescore and ten i am not suddenly taken with the urge to shuffle off this mortal coil lincoln said he and mrs hamilton both laughed and he went on in my view valley tan bears the same relation to proper whiskey as a slap in the face does to a kiss on the cheek both will get your attention but i know which i prefer if youre trying to sweettalk me out of a kiss on the cheek juliette walked over and gave him one then she wagged a finger at him but valley tan is cooked up complete with added sanctity or so the mormons say i have never tasted a better reason for declaring sanctity unconstitutional lincoln answered you are the funniest man juliette hamilton exclaimed why is it that everyone makes you out to be so somber and serious part of it is that no one has ever told my face it has the right to be amused lincoln said and the other part is that i commonly speak of serious things even if not always in a serious manner if you mix some honey with the physic the dose goes down easier juliette said thats so lincoln said and with your kind permission ill borrow the notion in a speech one day seeing how astonished mrs hamilton looked he added i am glad to employ any figure that strikes me as both true and well said and in all my days i have never yet heard a better answer to give to the occasional person who complains of what he calls my unsuitable levity gabe hamilton had just come into the house when someone pounded on the front door who the devils that he said the pounding went on his scowl got darker whoever it is maybe i ought to have a revolver in my hand when i open the door i think that would be most unwise lincoln said hastily he followed hamilton up the entranceway to the door when his host angrily threw it open he was not surprised to find a squad of bluecoated us soldiers outside a young lieutenant began is abraham lincoln and then caught sight of him mr lincoln you are to come with me at once why should he gabe hamilton demanded before lincoln could speak by order of the military governor general pope he is under arrest the lieutenant answered the soldiers behind him aimed their rifles at lincoln ill come quietly he said you may lower those lest someone be injured by mischance he walked out of the house leaving hamilton staring after him the portly graybearded man in the tweed sack suit fourinhand tie and derby did not at first glance seem to belong in an army headquarters full of bustling young men in uniform general thomas jackson would have been just as well pleasedfar better pleasedhad his visitor chosen to remain in richmond i am glad to welcome you to louisville mr president he said and prayed his stern god would forgive the lie thank you general james longstreet said one of the things i found during the war of secession was that military reports however detailed often conveyed a distorted view of an action i also learned that newspaper reports seldom conveyed anything but a distorted view there your excellency we agree completely jackson said if you believe what the reporters write we have by now slain the entire population of the united states in this engagement men women and children alike it is a sanguinary fight sir but not so sanguinary as that i had not thought it would be longstreets voice held a rumble of amusement i came here to see what sort of fight it is having acquired a fairly good notion of the sorts of fight it is not it is as you requested and required a defensive fight mr president jackson s voice had a rumble in it too a rumble of discontent being thus constrained i have endeavored to cause the united states the maximum of harm while yielding to them the minimum of ground that is precisely why i set you in charge here general longstreet said with a courtly dip of his head precisely and you have most handsomely done as i hoped you would papers in the united states are no less given to distortion and exaggeration than our own many of them quite vehemently assert you are indeed intent on slaughtering every damnyankee in creation if general willcox will continue funneling the yankees into louisville i may in fact accomplish that jackson replied it will however take me some little while longstreet laughed and slapped him on the back from under his eyebrows jackson shot the president of the confederate states a suspicious look longstreet restraining him longstreet arguing with him longstreet undercutting himhed grown used to those since his former fellow corps commander was inaugurated longstreet enthusiastic about what he didthat was so unusual he didnt know how to react to it military formality gave him a framework in which to respond just as it gave him a framework for his entire life he said will you come with me your excellency you can examine the map which will give you a good notion of where we are now and what i hope to do in the near future thank you i shall take you up on thatit will do for the time being later i intend to go up to the front to see for myself this new sort of warfare you are inventing here jackson stared no one had ever questioned james longstreets courage jackson had found plenty of fault with longstreets common sense over the years but never for a reason like this mr president i beg you to reconsider he said one lucky sharpshooter one shell landing at the wrong spot would you not be just as well pleased general longstreet said were i to fall i have no doubt my plan for manumission which you have made it unmistakably clear you oppose would fall with me jackson looked down at his scuffed oversized boots usually he was the one who spoke with relentless frankness after coughing a couple of times he said of one thing you have convinced me your excellency that no one in the confederate states but yourself can hope to guide us through the intricacies of our relations with our allies in this time of crisis i think you do vice president lamar a disservice for he has more experience dealing with the europeans than i do myself he has not your deviousness jackson declared longstreet smiled at that flattery will get you nowhere he said roguishly to the maps and then on to the front his smile got wider as he took in jackson s expression i assure you general i am not indispensable to the cause so long as you continue to make louisville and the ohio run red with yankee blood our success is assured we bleed too jackson said as he led the president toward the tent where he devised his strategy and whence he sent orders to his commanders at the battle line longstreet pointed to the telegraphic operators who sat ready to tap out any commands the generalinchief might give them a good notion he said it saves you the time involved in sending a messenger to the signals tent and minutes in such matters can be critical exactly so jackson said he pointed to the big map of louisville as you see mr president forces of the united states unfortunately have despite our best efforts to repel them gained a stretch of ground several miles long and varying in depth from a few hundred yards to nearly a mile i console myself by noting the price they have paid for the acquisition how well have they fought longstreet asked as we saw in the last war they have courage to match our own jackson replied they also have numbers on their side and their artillery is both strong and well handled having said so much i have exhausted the military virtues they display general willcoxs notion of strategy seems to be to send men forward and ram them headlong into the into the stone wall of your defense longstreet interrupted his voice sly jackson went on as if the president had not spoken into the positions we have prepared to repel them one thing this battle has proved once and for all your excellency is the primacy of the defensive when soldiers in field works are provided with repeating rifles so we had surmised based on our own manoeuvres and the recent francoprussian and russoturkish wars longstreet said encouraging to know our pundits were in this instance correct encouraging i would not say so mr president jackson answered the advantages accruing to the defensive make a war of manoeuvre far more difficult than it was in our previous conflict with the united states but general we do not seek to invade and conquer the united states they seek to invade and conquer us the president of the confederate states said gently i profess myself to be in favor of that which makes their work harder and ours easier hmm jackson said there is some truth in what you say longstreet showed a perspective broader than his own from the viewpoint of the confederacy as a whole the ability to conduct a strong punishing defense was vital from the viewpoint of a general with the inclination to attack the ability of the enemy to conduct a strong punishing defense was constipating of course there is in his own way longstreet had a certainty to match jackson s jackson s sprang from faith in the lord longstreets the general judged from faith in himself the confederate president went on now that i have seen the outline of our position in louisville i will sec the position itself he looked as if he expected jackson to argue with him he looked as if he expected to enjoy overruling his generalinchief saluting jackson replied yes sir i look forward to accompanying you what longstreet emphatically shook his head i cannot permit that general you are indispensable your excellency jackson presumed to break in on his commanderinchief i think not the arguments applying to you and mr lamar apply with equal force to me and general alexander you arc insubordinate general longstreet snapped jackson inclined his head as at a compliment longstreet glowered at him then started to laugh very welllet it be as you say jackson put e porter alexander in overall command until he should return then longstreet at his side rode down into louisville toward the sound of the guns he went toward that sound as toward a lover his wife knew of and forgave him his infidelity one of the many reasons he loved her even well behind the fighting line shellfire and flames had taken their toll on louisville s houses and offices and warehouses and manufactories some were burntout skeletons of their former selves while others had had pieces bitten out of them as if caught in the grip of monstrous jaws the air smelled of stale smoke and gunpowder with the sicksweet fetor of death under them longstreet drew in a long breath his mouth tightened i have not smelled that smell since the war of secession but it never escapes the mind does it no sir jackson had his head cocked to one side savoring the sounds of battle at close range for the moment the artillery was fairly quiet after some consideration though he said i do not believe i ever heard such a terrific volume of musketry on any field during the war of secession put that together with the increased power of the guns and no wonder an attack crumples before it is well begun yes longstreet said abstractedly a couple of ambulances rattled past them toward the rear i have not heard the cries and groans of wounded men since the war of secession either but those likewise remain in memory yet green soldiers coming back from the front even the unwounded looked like casualties of war tattered uniforms filthy faces their eyes more full of the horror they had seen than of the debrisstrewn paths down which they walked soldiers going forward especially those who had been in the line before advanced steadily but without the slightest trace of eagerness they knew what awaited them with every block now the wreckage of what had been a splendid city grew worse after a while a corporal held up a hand nobody on horseback past here he declared and then looked foolishly astonished at whom he had presumed to halt corporal you are doing your duty jackson said he and longstreet dismounted and went forward on foot soon moving from one trench to another along zigzags dug into the ground to minimize the damage from any one shellburst and to keep any advancing yankees who gained one end of a trench from laying down a deadly fire along its entire length some of the trench wall was shored up with bricks and timbers from shattered buildings slaves in coarse cotton laboured to strengthen the defenses further jackson made a point of looking at them of speaking with them of urging them on longstreet made a point of taking no notice of jackson up above the trench on bare ground a sharpshooter with a long brass telescope mounted on his tredegar crouched in the military equivalent of a hunters blind rubbish cunningly arranged to conceal him from view from the front and sides while he searched for targets behind the us line jackson wondered how many snipers hed passed without noticing them he also wondered how many similar sharpshooters in yankee blue were peering south looking for unwary confederates in the frontline trenches the soldiers started to raise a cheer for their generalinchief and president officers in butternut frantically shushed them lest the damnyankees getting wind of the arrivals send a torrent of shells down on jackson and longstreet the president walked along examining the trench and pausing now and then to chat with the soldiers defending it jackson followed after a couple of hundred yards longstreet turned to him and asked is it possible that the us army of the ohio may bring in enough in the way of guns and men to drive us out of louisville yes mr president much as it pains me to say so that is possible jackson answered they would pay a fearsome price but it is possible having taken louisville at such a price could they then rapidly overrun the rest of kentucky longstreet inquired jackson laughed out loud which made the president smile but he had another question are the yankees as aware of these facts as we are ourselves i hardly see how it could be otherwise jackson said why do you ask to see if your conclusions march with mine longstreet said which to the generals annoyance was not an answer at all chapter c olonel george custer rode back toward salt lake city in high good humor he had not succeeded in running the elusive john taylor to earth but he was bringing back to us justice george q cannon another eminent leader of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints cannon his hands manacled and his feet tied together under his horse glumly rode along behind custer and his brother in splendid spirits himself custer said to tom did you hear about the mormon bishop who passed away leaving behind nine widows why no autie i cant say as i did tom custer answered why dont you tell me about the poor fellow by his expression he suspected a joke of lurking in there somewhere since he couldnt see where he willingly played straight man it was very sad custer said with a sigh as the preacher put it by the graveside in the midst of wives we are in death both custer brothers laughed so did the other soldiers in earshot tom custer looked over his shoulder at their prisoner and asked how many wives are you in the midst of cannon one the mormon answered tightly he was a roundfaced little man his hair cut close to his head cheeks and upper lip cleanshaven with a short curly tangle of graying beard under his chin why lie custer said with something approaching real curiosity we know better you must know we know better first i am not lying cannon had a precise fussy way of speaking more like a lawyer than a revolutionary second and now speaking purely in a hypothetical sense if the penalty for polygamy be harsher than the penalty for perjury would it not profit one in such a predicament to lie it might if those were the only charges you were up against custer answered next to treason though theyre both small potatoes i am not a traitor george cannon said as hed been saying since custers troopers caught him in a hayloft near farmington i want nothing more for my people than the rights guaranteed them under the constitution of the united states life liberty and the pursuit of wives custer suggested which drew another guffaw from his brother and made the captured mormon fugitive set his jaw and say no more john pope had established his headquarters at fort douglas north and east of the center of salt lake city the fort sat on a bench of land higher than the town from it the artillery pope had brought with himand the guns that had come in since government forces reoccupied utah territorycould direct a devastating fire on any insurrection that broke out custer rode into the fort like a conquering hero another mormon villain captured he cried in a great voice the soldiers manning the gates and up on the stockade raised a cheer custer took off his hat and waved it about that drew another cheer hearing the commotion brigadier general john pope came out of his office to see what was going on ah colonel custer he said and then looked past custer to the prisoner so this is the famous george cannon of whom you telegraphed me is it he doesnt look so much like a wildeyed fanatic as some of the ones we snared before no sir custer agreed close enough for his superiors to hear him he made a point of agreeing with them but without their coldhearted coolheaded comrades egging them on the wildeyed fanatics could not do so much damage that as we have seen here is nothing less than the truth pope said heavily well done colonel get him down from his high horsethe military governor laughed at his own wit and so of course did custerand take him to the stockade in due course we shall try him and in due course i have no doubt we shall hang him by the neck until he is dead politely cannon said i presume you shall be the judge at these proceedings good to know you come into them unbiased you mormons have corrupted courts in utah territory too long pope replied you shall not have the opportunity to do so any more dismounting custer walked over to george cannons horse and cut the ropes that bound his feet he helped the manacled prisoner get down from the animal then started to lead him to the row of cells that had been intended for drunk soldiers who got into brawls but now held as many mormon leaders as the us army had been able to track down after a couple of steps across the parade ground custer stopped dead since he had his arm hooked to cannons the mormon bigwig perforce stopped too custer for the moment entirely forgot the prisoner hed been so proud of capturing pointing across the grounds he growled what in blazes is he doing here john popes gaze swung toward the tall figure walking along at a loosejointed amble in something approaching a purr the military governor answered honest abe hes under arrest for consorting with john taylor and for refusing to tell us the miserable rebels whereabouts is that a fact sir custers eyes glowed can you hang him too heaven knows hes deserved it these past twenty years if it hadnt been for him we wouldnt have had to fight the war of secessionand if it hadnt been for him i think we should have won it by putting it that way he managed to blame lincoln for his treatment of both mcclellan and pope i am forbidden to hang him pope said unhappily i am even forbidden formally to keep him under lock and key though president blaine in his generosity does permit me to retain him in custody here at the fort he muttered something into his beard aloud he added blaine is a republican too republicans custer made the word a venomous oath they get us into wars and then they fight them every wrong way they can find if halfif a quarterof what the wires are saying about the fighting in louisville is true he kicked up a small cloud of dust then rubbed his boot clean on the back of his other trouser leg orlando willcox always was better at praying than he was at fighting pope said that impressed the redskins when he was out here in the west hes not fighting the redskins any more hes fighting stonewall jackson we both know about that custer said with a grimace he abruptly seemed to remember he still had hold of george q cannon come along you he jerked the mormon prisoner forward once he had raced through the formalities of turning cannon over to the warder he hurried out to the parade ground once more he needed only a moment to spot lincoln who was strolling along with as little apparent concern as if in a hotel garden custer trotted over to him how dare you he demanded lincoln looked down at him a long way down because even though beginning to be shrunken by age the former president was still the taller of them by half a foot or more how dare i what he asked now his voice mild take a walk here i didnt know it was private property and im not stepping on the grass to any great degree the parade ground being bare dirt there was no grass on which to step custer scowled at lincoln who bore the glower with the air of a man who had borne a lot of glowers how dare you treat with the mormons without leave he snapped i hoped i might persuade mr taylor to yield in such a way as to make this occupation do as little damage to the constitution as possible lincoln answered in this i fear i was unsuccessful mormons possessing the same aversion to having their necks stretched as any other segment of the populace force is the only lesson the mormons understand custer said he who sows the wind will one day reap the whirlwind lincoln returned the store of hatred the us army builds for itself will come back to haunt it as the confederate states ought now to be reaping the whirlwind whose wind you sowed custer said that got through to lincoln custer smiled to watch him grimace he went on how dare you presume to hide from us john taylors whereabouts to his surprise lincoln laughed at that my dear colonel do you mean to tell me you believe taylor will still be where he was custer felt foolish he covered that with bluster now of course not had you come to the us military authorities directly you returned from this illicit meeting we might have been able to capture the traitor as he would have had only a short head start on our men there you may possibly be correct colonel custer lincoln answered but in his seeking to use me as an intermediary i judgedand judge stillthat mr taylor in effect made me his client and i would be violating my responsibility to him in revealing where we met if you are going to hide behind every jot and tittle of the law to save a criminal and a traitor from his just deserts then in my view you deserve to go up on the gallows with him when we do seize him custer said i have no patience with legalistic folderol and humbug if we do not live by law what shall we live by lincoln asked when the law fails us as it has plainly done in utah territory shall we live by it no matter how dear that may cost us custer returned lincoln sighed there colonel you pose a serious question whether that be your intention or not much of the history of the law in the united states and indeed in the world or what i know of itsprings from the dialectical struggle between your observation and mine the what kind of struggle custer asked never mind lincoln said i would not expect you to be a student of either hegel or marx their works have come late to this side of the atlantic and are not yet appreciated as they should be custer had not heard of either of them that made him feel smugly superior not ignorant weve got no need for a pack of damned foreign liars weve got enough homegrown liars seems to me he glared fiercely up at the former president and if you didnt have a president of your own miserable party to protect you from the consequences of your treason we would see if we could build a gallows tall enough to stretch you on it my legs have always been long enough to reach the ground lincoln said i should prefer that they continue to do so i shouldnt custer said and turned his back on the man he blamed for so many of the countrys misfortunes of the previous generation he strode off although he thought he heard lincoln sigh again behind him he didnt turn around to make certain instead he sought out general pope who was glad enough to see him after his capture of george cannon one by one colonel they fall into our hands pope said and one by one we shall dispose of them yes sir custer replied it is truly a pity we cant dispose of lincoln in the same way or perhaps have him meet with an accident while attempting escape i have been specifically cautioned against letting any such accident befall him though he does not know that pope said its too bad isnt it hiding behind the law to break the law custer muttered lincoln could put whatever fancy name on it he wanted in custers eyes that was what it was just so well weve both known lo these many years the man is a scoundrel so why should one more proof of it surprise us pope started to say something else then caught himself i remember what i wanted to tell you colonel the war department is letting us have another halfdozen gatling guns as youve had experience with the weapons im assigning them to your regiment yes sir custer said lord only knows what ill do with eight of the contraptions but i will say i cant think of anything handier than one of them for making a pack of rioters wish theyd never been born just so pope repeated once we start hanging mormon big shots we may have those rioters i hope not if we should however ill expect you and these fancy coffee mills to play a major part in putting them down sir it will be a pleasure custer said c happo came up to general stuart geronimos young son politely waited to be noticed then said our first men come in the bluecoats are not far behind them they push hard they think they have only us to fight in another hour maybe two you will show them they are wrong yes stuart rubbed his hands together he waited for the action to begin as eagerly as a bridegroom for the night of his wedding day youre sure about the time how can a man be sure chappo asked reasonably if the bluecoats do not scent a trap though that is when they will be here good enough stuart turned to his trumpeter blow prepare for battle as the martial notes rang out chappo said for white men you hide yourselves well you should fool other white men with the precision of youth he revised that you should fool them long enough jeb stuart reminded himself the redskin meant it as praise not as a slight this desert was the apaches country not his own he and his men would never know it as they did that was why they made such useful allies against the damnyankees that was also why while he wouldnt turn on them himself as major sellers kept urging he wouldnt mind seeing a good many apaches killed and wounded in the fight that lay ahead they wouldnt be able to blame that on him if it happened theyd been as ready for this fight with the us soldiers as he was more ready since the fight had been their idea hed sound as sympathetic as an old mammy when they counted up their losses meanwhile he sent messengers to the men whod been sweating in the hot hot sun the past few days all the runners bore the same order dont open fire too soon stuart instructed them wait for the signal wait till the yankees are well into the canyon we dont want to just frighten them we want to ruin them chappo listened to that with approval the only reason to fight is to win he said you see this clear you bet i do stuart answered even with a generals wreathed stars on his collar he carried a tredegar carbine like any other cavalryman some officers felt their duty in battle was to lead and inspire the enlisted men without actually doing any fighting past selfdefense stuart had never seen the sense in that he wanted to hurt the enemy any which way he could waiting came hard as waiting always did when off in the distance to the north he heard rifle fire his head swung that way like a hunting dogs on taking a scent he looked around for chappo the apache had vanished stuart could not have said exactly when one second he was there the next gone no white man was able to move like that here came the apaches some mounted others afoot they retreated steadily through the canyon watching them stuart knew nothing but admiration by the way they were carrying out their fighting retreat they gave the us forces not the slightest clue they had allies lying in wait when they formed a line of sorts near the southern end of the canyon it looked like nothing more than a delaying action on the part of a few to let the rest put more distance between themselves and their pursuers and here came the yankees riding in loose order a puff of gray smoke rising every now and then as one of them or another fired at the retreating indians some a couple of troops worth werent properly bluecoats at all but men in civilianstyle clothes volunteers stuart supposed now that the indians werent retreating but had formed a line the us soldiers began to bunch those in front slowing while those in back came on it was the sort of target of which artillerymen dreamt stuart waited for the gunners off on their rise to decide they had enough damnyankees in their sights if they waited much longer some triggerhappy idiot was going to start shooting before they did and warn the enemy of the trap crash all the field guns fired as one all the shells burst close together among the yankees the result seen through smoke and kickedup dust was gruesome men and horses down and thrashing on the burning desert floor other men and horses and pieces of men and horses down and not moving at all as to sweet music stuart listened to the confused and dismayed cries rising from the us forces as hed hoped they hadnt yet spotted his guns and thought the apaches had waylaid them with torpedoes go wide someone yelled which sent bluecoats riding toward the gentle slopes of the canyon wallsand straight into the withering rifle fire the confederates now waiting no longer poured down on them stuarts tredegar bucked against his shoulder the yankee at whom hed aimed slid off his horse into the dirt the confederate general whooped with glee as he slipped a fresh round into the rifles breech though he wasnt absolutely sure his was the bullet that had brought down the us cavalryman other soldiers might also have aimed at the fellow now the us soldiers realized theyd run headlong into a box they still hadnt figured out what kind of box though straight at em shouted an officer leading a squadron of volunteers you charge em the damn redskinsll run every time he swung his hat come on boys he rode forward at the gallop brave but stupid a moment later he was brave and stupid and dead the bullet that caught him in the face blew off the back of his head another bullet took his horse in the chest the beast went down and in falling tripped up the horse behind it which fell on its rider more shells crashed down on the us troops not in a single neat salvo but one by one as the guns reloaded and fired christ almighty its the rebs that cry and others like it announced that too late the yankees had figured out what was going on they fought back as best they could the volunteers seemed to be armed with winchesters rather than governmentissue springfields the hunting rifles magazine feed and lever action meant those volunteers could fire faster than the regulars on both sides with their singleshot breechloaders at close range they did a fair amount of damage but not many of them got to close range the us forces were at the center of three fires the apaches and artillery from ahead and dismounted confederate cavalry to either side had stuart been their commander he didnt know what he would have done died gallantly he hoped so nobody afterwards would have the chance to blame him for sticking his head in the noose in the first place after dying gallantly the next best thing the officer in charge of the us force could have done was pull back and escape with as many men as he could perhaps sacrificing a rear guard to hold back pursuit the enemy commander didnt try that either instead though he could not have helped knowing what he was up against he tried to punch his way through the confederates dug in on the sides of the canyon a young lieutenant close by stuart screamed as he was wounded then he examined the wound and screamed again my god i am unmanned stuart bit his lip he knew the horrid chances war could take but no man ever thought of that particular injury without a shudder of dread then a bullet cracked past his own head so close he thought he felt the breeze of its passage that refocused his mind on his own survival he had never seen a battle that came so close to running itself that was as well for with the yankees in the trap his messengers had to travel a long roundabout route to reach the confederates on the other side of the canyon but the other half of the army knew perfectly well what it had to do hold its place and keep shooting at the damnyankees either till none was left or till the ones who were left had enough and ran away the same applied to the men on the west side of the canyon with him the us soldiers regulars and volunteers alike pushed their attacks with the greatest courage many of them advanced on foot to present smaller targets to their foes some got in among the confederates the fighting then was with clubbed rifles and bayonets and knives as well as with bullets but though the yankees got in among the cs troopers they did not get through those few who survived soon ran back toward the center of the canyon bullets kicking up dirt near their heels and stretching them lifeless under the sun stuart looked up to the sky buzzards were already doing lazy spirals how did they know forward stuart called if theyre going to stand there and take it lets make sure they have a lot to take cheering his men advanced neither butternut nor gray perfectly matched this country but both came closer than the dark blue the us soldiers woreand both were covered with a good coat of dust and dirt too the damnyankees found few good targets among their oncoming foes the officer in charge of the us forceswhether he was the original commander stuart had no way of knowingfinally decided far too late to pull out with whatever he would save by then rifle fire from both sides of the canyon was far closer than it had been the confederate field guns kept sending shells wherever the yankees were thickest only a battered remnant of the force that had pursued the apaches south from tucson rode back toward it splendid general splendid major horatio sellers shouted thank you major stuart told his aidedecamp and then went on in a musing voice do you know you have a bullet hole in your hat sellers doffed the headgear and examined it i know now yes sir he said and then with studied nonchalance set the hat back on his head how vigorous a pursuit were you planning to order not very stuart answered president longstrcct has made it all too plain that our mission is to protect chihuahua and sonora not to try to annex any of new mexico territory a pity but there you are after this licking i dont think the yankees will be panting to invade our new provinces any time soon i think youre right about that sellers said and i also have to say that you were right about the apaches they served us very handsomely here he looked around and lowered his voice and i hope a lot of them bit the dust too what they helped us do to the yankees they could do to us one fine day they could stuart agreed we have to persuade them that its not in their interest as ive said being neither yankees nor mexicans we have a leg up on that game he pointed toward the mouth of the canyon where the artillery lengthening its range was paying the retreating us soldiers a final farewell and we have a leg up on this game too on what had been the main battlefield gunfire ebbed toward silence more and more confederates broke cover to round up prisoners do what they could for the us wounded and plunder the dead the apaches emerged from their places of concealment too some of those seemed incapable of concealing a man until an indian or sometimes two or three came forth from them a fair number of the confederatesespecially members of the fifth cavalry who had done a lot of comanche fightingtook us scalps as souvenirs of victory to stuarts surprise the apaches didnt no that is not our way chappo said when the general asked him about it he frowned in thought then qualified that some of the wildest of us will sometimes take one scalphe held up his forefingeronly one for a special he and stuart hunted for a word a special ceremony yes the one who does this spends four days making clean not like he pointed to the cavalry troopers who were busy with their knives stuart suffered a timely coughing fit he was used to whites being disgusted at indians brutality here he had an indian unhappy with the brutality of his own men when worn on the other foot the shoe pinched to keep himself from dwelling on that he walked over to have a look at the prisoners he found that the us regular army troopers his men had captured wanted nothing to do with the volunteers who had ridden into battle with them you better keep us separate from those sons of bitches said one bluecoated cavalryman a dirty bandage wrapped around a bloody crease to his scalp god damn the tombstone rangers to hell and then stoke the fire afterwards got to get them injuns they said them injuns is runnin on account of theys a pack of cowards they said and god damn colonel hains for listening to em the stupid fool colonel hains was not in evidence among either the dead or the captured the commander of the tombstone rangers however had had his horse shot under him the beast had pinned him when it crashed to earth when stuart came up to him he was cursing a blue streak as a confederate medical steward put splints on his ankle if i knew who the shitepoke was that killed my horse id cut the balls off the asshole he greeted stuart im going to hobble around on a stick the rest of my born days goddamn it sorry to hear it stuart said a polite fiction your men fought courageously colonel theyd charged into a trapby what the regular had said theyd ignored the possibility that it might be a trap tooso they hadnt fought very cleverly but they had indeed been brave earp the colonel of volunteers said stuart thought it was a nauseated noise perhaps from the pain of his injury till he amplified it virgil earp he was about thirty with a dark mustache and a complexion at the moment on the grayish side you damn rebs went and slickered us theres nothing in the rules that says we cant stuart answered wish my brotherd come out west with me the captured colonel earp said hes the best poker player i ever knew you wouldnt have fooled him careful there you son of a whore that last was directed at the man tending to his ankle he gave his attention back to stuart we wanted to wipe out the dirty redskins but it didnt quite come off no it didnt stuart knew he sounded smug he didnt care hed earned the right virgil earp surprised him by starting to laugh thats all right reb you go ahead and gloat those bastards are your trouble now abruptly stuart turned away the volunteer might not have been much of a soldier but hed put his finger right on the confederate commanders biggest worry if the need to worry was so obvious even an arrogant fool could see it at a glance stuart didnt care for anything that implied across the ohio the guns had fallen silent frederick douglass peered suspiciously over the river toward the wreckage of what had been louisville the confederates had asked for an eighthour truce so they could send a representative to governor willcoxs headquarters and willcox after consulting by telegraph with president blaine had granted the ceasefire here came the confederate now a major carrying a square of white cloth on a stick as his laissezpasser seeing douglass standing close to willcoxs tent he snapped you boy what business do you have hanging around here speak up and be quick about it he might have been speaking to a slave on a plantation to douglass hidden fury a couple of the us soldiers escorting the messenger chuckled with ice in his own voice douglass replied what business have i the business of a citizen of the united states sir he spoke with as much pride as st paul had when declaring himself a roman citizen any country thatd make citizens out of niggers the confederate emissary shook his head and walked into general willcoxs tent douglass was shaking all over shaking with rage he turned to one of the us soldiers who had not joined in the amusement at his expense and asked why is thatthat individual here do you know im not supposed to say anything the bluecoat answered douglass stood as quietly as he could and waited in his years as a newspaper reporter hed seen how proud most people were of knowing things their friends and neighbors didnt and how important that made them feel hed also seen how bad most of them were at keeping their secrets and sure enough after half a minute or so the soldier resumed what i hear though is that there reb is going to put terms to us for ending the war terms douglass ears stood to attention what kind of terms dont know the soldier said his obvious disappointment convinced douglass he was telling the truth tell you this much uncle after what ive been through over on the other side of the river any terms at alld look pretty damn good to me and you can take that to the bank his companions nodded every one of them douglass made as if to write something in his notebook to keep the white men from seeing how they had wounded him where hed envisioned a crusade literally a holy warto sweep the curse of slavery from the face of the earth forever they having fought a bit and seen that the enemy would not fall over at the first blow were ready to give up and go home no feeling among the soldiery for the plight of the negro in confederate bondage douglass scrawled the plight of the negro in fact was not what had engendered the war he reminded himself of that grimly not even lincoln had sent men off to battle for the express purpose of freeing the bondsman blaine hated the confederate states because they were a rival not because they were tyrants had they been exemplars of purest democracy rivals they would have remained and he would have hated them no less presently captain oliver richardson came out of the tent he was puffing on a cigar and looked mightily contented with the world when he saw douglass he stared right through him douglass would have bet he knew the terms the major in butternut had brought the negro did not waste his time asking richardson about them general willcoxs adjutant cared for him no more than did the confederate emissary a couple of minutes later a corporal with the crossed semaphore flags of the signal corps on his sleeve hurried from willcoxs tent to that of the telegraphers nearby slowly as if without the slightest need to hurry frederick douglass strolled in the same direction he positioned himself not far from the entrance looked busy in fact he was jotting down unflattering observations about captain richardson of which he had a neverfailing supply and waited in due course the corporal came out once more douglass intercepted him in a way that like any great art looked effortless even when it wasnt in confidential tones he asked what sort of impossible terms are the rebs proposing they dont sound so impossible to me the soldier answered when he said no more than that douglass was tempted to grab him by the front of his blouse and shake the news out of him restraining himself with an effort he said what are they then the soldier hesitated visibly considering whether to reply it doesnt matter if you tell me douglass assured him whatever the terms may be i can neither accept nor refuse them thats true enough the signal corps corporal said half to himself all right ill tell you the offer is to end the war and pretend it never happened near enough both sides to pull back over the border no reparations nothing of the sort we just go on about our business douglass sucked in a long breath of air those were generous terms far more generous than hed expected the confederate states to offer somemaybe manyin the united states would want to accept them especially as word of the horrors of the battle of louisville spread through the land douglass had done some spreading of that word himself and now all at once bitterly regretted it what of chihuahua and sonora he asked huh oh them right the corporal needed to be reminded of the immediate cause of the war the rebsd keep em i see douglass said slowly general willcox said that far as he was concerned the confederates were welcome to em that they werent worth owning in the first place and that the only things in em was cactuses and redskins and greasers rather than keeping too quiet the soldier was suddenly talking more than douglass had expected did he the negro journalist murmured if an important us commander didnt think the mexican provinces were worth the cost the country was paying to try to make the confederate states disgorge them how would president blaine feel he did sure as im standing here next to you the signal corps corporal answered and im not going to stand next to you any more though on account of somebodys gonna spot me and figure ive been bangin my gums too much he sidled off doing his best to look as if hed never been there at all frederick douglass wrote down the details the soldier had given him while they were still fresh in his mind then he shoved the notebook back into his pocket and walked over to his tent hed been under canvas long enough to have grown used to the stark simplicity of a stool a kerosene lamp and an ironframed military cot they made his home in rochester which before leaving it hed thought of as having all the modern conveniences instead seemed overcrowded and overstuffed he sat down on the stool and covered his face with his hands he was not quite so appalled as he had been after shooting the disemboweled massachusetts artilleryman the physical shock of that deed would stay with him till his dying day the grief flowing through him now though ran deeper and stronger than that which had followed the mercy killing i was right then he said now now instead of watching a man die before his eyes he was seeing a lifetimes effort and hope take their last breaths james g blaine had started this war basically to punish the confederate states for winning the war of secession now that he had discovered he was punishing the united states even more severely how could he continue after getting an honorableno an honorablesoundingpeace proposal from the csa in blaine s place douglass would have been hard pressed to keep from accepting such a peace but if it was made the usa and csa would live side by side for another generation maybe two or even three and the vast white majority in the united states would go right on despising the handful of negroes in their midst and doing their best to forget the millions of negroes in the confederate states even existed douglass looked up and scowled at the canvas wall of the tent as if it were oliver richardsons smoothly handsome face i shall oppose this peace with every fiber of my being he said aloud as if someone had doubted him no matter what the cost i shall urge that the war go forward for the sake of my people the guns did not resume their deadly work immediately the peace expired both sides held back awaiting president blaines decision douglass did not realize how constant a companion the roar of battle had been until he discovered the long stretch of silence was making him jumpy when he messed with the staff officers in the seemingly unnatural quiet that evening he found he did not have to pretend ignorance of the proposed peace terms everyone was talking about them and everyone assumed someone else had let douglass know what they were almost to a man the officers thought president blaine would accept president longstreets offer well be going home soon captain richardson predicted id have liked to lick the damn rebs ill say that but it doesnt look like its in the cards here alfred von schlieffen spoke up did i not hear from the farwriterno the telegraph you say i am sorrydid i not hear that the confederate states have in new mexico a victory won i heard that several people said around mouthfuls of fried chicken douglass had not heard it but hed been moping in his tent since getting word of the confederate peace proposal somebody said the rebs used the goddamn apaches to lure our boys into a trap thats what happened we should have given the apaches what we gave the sioux richardson said he slammed his fist down on the table making silverware and tin plates jump we would have done it too i reckon if they hadnt run down into mexico every time we got on their tail yes and now instead of running into the empire of mexico which was weak enough to allow our pursuit they shall if president blaine accepts this peace run down into confederate territory where we can no more pursue them than we can the kiowas of the indian territory douglass said as always the power of his voice let him command attention somebody a long way down the tablehe didnt see whosaid damned if the nigger isnt right for once in his life he felt happier about the agreement than angry at the insulting title thoughtfully someone else said maybe weve been looking too hard at all the blood weve spilled here in louisville and not enough at the whole war i dont know whats to look at oliver richardson said we arent doing any better anywhere else but you are not invaded colonel schlieffen said but only in this one faroff territory your armed forces are not beaten if the united states have the will you can go on with this war youre right sir frederick douglass exclaimed we can beat the confederate states we are larger and stronger than they do you soldiers want them laughing at us for another twenty years as theyve done ever since the war of secession if we give up the fight without being defeated we shall make ourselves a laughingstock before the eyes of the whole world if we go on and keep getting our ass kicked the rest of the world is going to think thats pretty damn funny too richardson said but if we win douglass replied if we win what glory and what a triumph for the holy cause of freedom oh christ richardson muttered to the officer next to him now hes going to start going on about the slaves again the other soldier nodded douglass almost threw a bowl full of boiled beets at them with so many in the usa feeling as oliver richardson did would even victory over the confederate states bring liberation and if it did not what in gods name would colonel theodore roosevelt raised the winchester to his shoulder squinted down the sights and pulled the trigger the rifle bucked against his shoulder take that you damned englishman he shouted working the lever a brass cartridge case leaped into the air then fell to the ground with a small clink he aimed the rifle again ready for another shot he didnt fire a couple of hundred yards away the pronghorn after its first frantic bound was already staggering as its herdmates raced off over the plains of northern montana territory it took three or four more wobbly steps then fell roosevelt shouted again this time in triumph he ran toward the mortally wounded antelope his boots kicked up dust at every stride good shot colonel first lieutenant karl jobst exclaimed jobst only a few years older than his superior was a regular army officer not an original member of roosevelt s unauthorized regiment colonel henry welton had detailed him to the volunteers as roosevelts adjutant and roosevelt suspected as his watchdog too hed stopped resenting it jobst had already made himself very useful right in the lung by jingo thats bully roosevelt said seeing the bloody froth on the antelopes nose and mouth the animal tried to rise when he came up to it but could not its large dark eyes reproached him he stooped pulled out a knife and cut its throat to put it out of its misery after watching its blood spill over the dirt he rose a broad grin on his face good eating tonight yes sir jobst said with a grin of his own if theres anything better than antelope liver fried up with salt pork im switched if i know what it is he drew his knife too lets butcher it and take it back to camp they opened the body cavity and dumped the guts out onto the ground flies buzzed around them roosevelt plunged his knife into the soil again and again to clean it i wish this had been an englishman by godfrey he said i chafe at the defensive sir our orders are to patrol the border but not to cross it lieutenant jobst said if the enemy should invade us we arc expected to resist him but we are not to provoke him not when the united states have enough on their plate fighting the confederates he spoke politely deferentially roosevelt outranked him he also spoke firmly he was there not only to give the colonel of volunteers a hand but to make sure he didnt go haring off on his own roosevelt knew how tempted he was to do just that and gave colonel welton a certain amount of grudging respect for having anticipated his impulses he grabbed the carcass hind legs jobst the forelegs they carried the dead antelope back to the horses the pack animal to whose back they tied the antelope snorted and rolled its eyes not liking the smell of blood jobst who was very good with horses gave the beast a lump of sugar and calmed it down camp lay close by the bank of the willow river which at this season of the year was little more than a creek roosevelt had patrols scattered from the cut bank river in the west all the way to the lodge in the east covering better than a hundred miles of border country with his regiment placing his headquarters roughly in the middle of that broad stretch of rolling prairie did not leave him reassured how are we supposed to fight the british if they do cross the border he demanded of lieutenant jobst not for the first time theyll brush aside the handful who discover them the way i brushed off those deerflies back where we made the kill sir we arent supposed to fight them singlehanded his adjutant replied well fall back well harass them well concentrate well send word of their whereabouts down to fort benton so colonel welton can bring up the infantry and then well lick em i suppose so roosevelt said not quite graciously he admitted to himselfbut to no one elsethat he had trouble with the idea of not fighting the foe singlehanded in all his visions of battle with the british he saw himself sometimes he alone was enough to defeat the foe sometimes he had help from the unauthorized regiment in none of them did the rest of the us army play any role he knew what he imagined and what was real were not one and the same knowing it and coming to terms with it were not one and the same either the rest of the small regimental staff greeted him with enthusiasm and the antelope with even more the cook an enormous irishman named rafferty had an equally enormous pot of beans going but he was among the loudest of the men cheering the kill beansll keep you from starving that they will he said but after a while you dont care this here now he ran his tongue over his lips in anticipation roosevelt was gnawing on an antelope rib and getting grease in his mustache when a rider came trotting up from the south whats the news roosevelt called to him have some meat have some coffee and tell us what you know thank you sir the soldier from fort benton said he loaded a tin plate with foodnot only a chunk of roast antelope haunch but also a big dollop of raffertys beansand then sat down by the fire news could be better well what is it roosevelt said north of fort benton lived only a few scattered farmers and sheep herders no telegraph lines ran north from there which made roosevelt feel cut off from the world beyond the circle of prairie he could see rebs and indians done licked us south of tucson down in new mexico territory the courier answered which produced a chorus of groans from everyone who heard it and theres no good news to speak of out of louisville neither we throw in some men they get themselves shot we throw in some more dont know what the devil we got to show for it louisville roosevelt thought was the very opposite of the fight he would have to make against the british if they did invade montana territory down in kentucky too many men were jammed into too little space and all of it built up that was a recipe for slaughter not war thinking along with him lieutenant jobst said louisville s a bad place to pick for a battle if the rebels had gone into washington or cincinnati its the sort of battle wed have given them as things are we get that end of the stick what happened down in new mexico roosevelt asked the man from fort benton sir i dont rightly know the soldier said he took a note from the pocket of his blouse this here is what colonel welton gave me to give you he said i should read it before i set out so i could tell you what it said in case it got soaked or somethin roosevelt read the note it told him no more than the courier had the bare facts of defeat in new mexico and bloody stalemate in kentucky he crumpled it and threw it into the fire then rounded on lieutenant jobst if you ask me lieutenant an invasion of canada is likely to be the best thing we could do right now heaven knows were going nowhere on any other front thats not for me to say sir jobst replied nor if youll forgive me for reminding you for you either i know its not roosevelt paused to light a cigar he blew out a cloud of fragrant smoke then sighed the tobacco in this ones from confederate cuba we dont grow such good leaf here in the usa mores the pity taking his change of subject as acquiescence karl jobst said im sure the war department will notify fort benton if they want us to undertake any offensive action and why are you so sure of that roosevelt inquired as sardonically as he could look how long the powers that be took to decide that the unauthorized regiment should go into service and at everything i had to do to convince them lieutenant jobst hesitated roosevelt was for the moment his superior yes but when the war ended roosevelt would go back to being a civilian while jobst stayed in the army and despite being a young man jobst was older than his regimental commander both those factors warred with his sense of subordination he picked his words with obvious care the powers that be did not know how fine a regiment youd recruited sir i assure you they are aware of the threat the british and canadians pose to our northern frontier roosevelt wanted to argue with that he wanted to argue with everything keeping him from doing what he most wanted to do punish the enemies of the united states try as he would he found no way jobst was too sensible to be doubted here i suppose you have a point roosevelt said with such good grace as he could sir the courier asked what word should i bring back to colonel welton at the fort alls quiet roosevelt answered that didnt make him happy either for it gave him no excuse to strike back at the british empire but he felt having become a us volunteer obligated him to give his own superior nothing but the truth i have riders constantly going back and forth from each of my troops to this place should the foe make so bold as to pull the tail feathers of our great american eagle i would know it before a day had passed and would send a messenger to colonel welton with orders to kill his horse getting the news down to fort benton pull the tail feathers of the american eagle the soldier repeated then he said it again quietly as if memorizing it thats pretty fine sir you come up with things like that you ought to write em down youre not the first person whos said so roosevelt purred he was anything but immune to having his vanity watered one day perhaps i shall meanwhile thoughhe struck a theatrical pose not altogether aware he was doing itwe have a war to win yes sir the courier said lieutenant jobst studied roosevelt sir i hope we do get the chance to fight the british he said i think your men would follow you straight to hell and thats something no one but god can give an officer i dont aim to lead them to hell roosevelt said i may lead them through hell but i intend to take them to victory jobst didnt say anything to that the courier from fort benton softly clapped his hands together once before hed quite realized hed done it in the firelight his eyes were wide and bright and staring roosevelt chose not to sleep inside his tent not when the weather was dry curled in his bedroll later that night he stared up and up and up at the sky stars were dusted across that great blueblack bowl like diamonds over velvet the milky way a ghostly road of light as he watched two shooting stars glowed for a heartbeat then silently vanished he sighed you never saw skies like this in new york too much stinking smoke in the air too many city lights swallowing the fainter stars this perfection struck him as reason enough by itself to have come to montana territory so thinking he took off his spectacles slid them into their leather case and drifted off in bare moments he woke refreshed at sunrise breathing cool air like wine even in august even when the day would be hot and muggy by noon early morning was to be cherished he pulled on boots put on spectacles and began mixing calisthenics with rounds of shadow boxing colonel you make me tired just watching you lieutenant jobst said when he woke up a few minutes later you should try it yourself roosevelt panted nothing like exercise for improving the circulation of the blood if i felt any healthier now i do believe id fall over jobst replied roosevelt snorted and ripped off a couple of sharp rightleft combinations that would have stretched any invading englishmanat any rate any invading englishman without a riflesenseless in the dust after antelope meat hardtack and coffee roosevelt mounted and rode off across the plains on patrol along with commanding his soldiers he wanted to do everything they did and if the british did presume to invade the united states he wanted at least a chance of being the first to discover them duty and the siren song of paperwork brought him back to camp in a couple of hours he was busy writing up a requisition for beans and salt pork for a troop far off to the west by the cut bank river when someone rode in from the south curiosity and a distaste for requisitions no matter how necessary made him stick his head out of the tent to see what was going on hed expected the newcomer to belong to one troop or another of the unauthorized regiment but the soldier wore no red bandanna tied to his left sleeve that meant he was from fort benton roosevelt s eyebrows pulled down and together colonel welton wasnt in the habit of sending couriers up to him two days running whats the news he called the soldier who had been talking with lieutenant jobst saluted and said sir i have an urgent message for you i didnt think youd ridden fifty miles or so for your amusement roosevelt returned go ahead and give it to me sir its only in writing the courier said roosevelt blinked that wasnt what welton usually did cither he saw lieutenant jobst also looking surprised the rider took from his saddlebag an oilskin pouch that would have protected its contents regardless of the streams through which he might have splashed he handed it to roosevelt here you are sir thank you roosevelt drew away had welton wanted the courier to know what the message said he would have told him lieutenant jobst followed roosevelt who frowned a little but said nothing he opened the pouch inside lay a sealed envelope he opened that too and drew out the folded sheet of paper it contained together he and jobst read the note on that sheet of paper both of them let out low whistles neither noticing the other longstreet offers peace on the status quo ante bellum except the rebs get to keep their mexican provinces jobst murmured that could be damned hard for president blaine to turn down yes roosevelt faced southeast all thoughts of keeping secrets from colonel weltons courier flown from his head he shook his fist in the general direction of richmond you son of a bitch he shouted you filthy stinking son of a bitch god damn you to hell and fry you black i went to all the trouble of putting a regiment together and now i dont even get the chance to fight with it you son of a bitch to his own mortification he burst into tears of rage morning boys samuel clemens called as he took off his straw boater and hung it on a hat tree just inside the entrance to the morning call offices mornin boss good morning sam how are you the answers came back in quick succession as they had for as long as hed been working on the newspaper no outside observer would have noticed anything different from the way it had been say a month before as he walked to his desk clemens told himself that was because there was nothing to notice he paused to light a cigar at a gas lamp then sat down and took a couple of puffs on the desk in a fancy gilt frame sat a tintype of himself alexandra and the children he could see his reflection in the glass in front of the photograph he was unsmiling on the tintype because smiles were hard to hold while waiting for the exposure to be completed his reflection was unsmiling because because theres nothing to smile about he muttered try as he would he couldnt convince himself things were as they had been before those two ruffians hauled him off to the presidio he still carried in a vest pocket the good character colonel sherman had given him no one had accused him of disloyalty since not out loud but when he greeted people didnt their responses come a quarter of a second slow didnt they sound ever so slightly off like those of a good actor who would die prosperous but whom no one would remember three days after they shoveled dirt over him and these were his colleagues here at a newspaper that opposed the present war if this was what his brief brush with confederate service got him here he shuddered to think what the rest of san francisco thought none of the other papers had made him out to be a traitor but that was probably only a matter of time he was scowling as he sorted through the telegrams that had come in during the night for one thing none of them had the news he really needed for another he wasnt sure it even mattered if people thought he was tarred by the brush of the csa if they didnt take seriously what he wrote because he was the one who wrote it what good was he in the spot he was holding sharp quick abrupt footsteps behind him he recognized them before clay herndon said good morning to you sam morning clay sam spun around in his chair it squeaked ive got to oil that or else set a cat to catch the mouse in there he felt a little less morose as he blew smoke at herndon the reporter didnt treat him as if he suffered from a wasting sickness clemens ruffled the telegrams on his desk still nothing out of philadelphia i see not a word herndon agreed how long can president blaine sit there like a broody hen before he hatches a yes or a no clemens demanded been a day and a half so far herndon said he doesnt seem to be in much of a hurry does he he was in a hurry to start the damned war sam said now that hes got a chance to get out of it easier and cheaper than anybody thought he would i dont know what in creation hes waiting for chihuahua and sonora clay herndon said clemens rolled his eyes if he thinks a slab of mexican desert is worth the childrens crusade hes thrown against louisville hes hes hes the fellow who was in a hurry to start the damned war he sighed since he is that fellow hes liable to keep right on at it i suppose but if he cant live with this peace i dont know where hell find a better one but if he says yes to it then he has to go and tell the voters why he went and started a war and then quit before he got anything out of it herndon said thats true clemens admitted but if he says no hes liable to have to go and tell the voters why he went and started a war and then lost it that made abe lincoln what he is today a rabblerousing blowhard do you mean herndon said and sam laughed the reporter went on what i think is that blaine s like a jackass between two bales of hay and he cant figure out which one to take a bite out of blaine s like a jackass more ways than that sam threw back his head and did an alarmingly realistic impression of a donkey that made herndon laugh in turn time to get to work he said and headed off to his own desk time to get to work clemens repeated he looked upon the notion with all the enthusiasm he would have given a trip to the dentist what he wanted to do was write an editorial he couldnt do that till blaine figured out which bale of hay made him hungrier edgar leary came up with a couple of sheets of paper in his hand heres that story about the people who were stranded in colorado when the mormons closed down the railroad boss he said you should hear the way they go on if it were up to them there wouldnt be enough lamp posts to hang all the mormons from give it here ill have a look at it sam took the sheets and proceeded to edit them almost as savagely as hed dealt with mayor sutros inanities over at city hall leary had the morning calls slant on the story straight the mormon troubles were blaine s fault for the settlers in utah would never have dared defy the power of the united states were that power not otherwise occupied but the young reporter was wordy he had trouble figuring out what was important and what wasnt and once perhaps absentlysam hoped absentlyhed written its when he meant its by the time sam finished butchering the story he felt better he took it over to leary see if ive done anything to it that you cant stand if i have tell me about it if i havent clean it up and take it to the typesetters all right boss leary said clemens tone warned him he would not be wise to defend his original version too strenuously he looked down at the paper then up at his editor his unlined face turned red did i write that the apostrophe you mean its not in my handwriting sam strode off he spent the rest of the morning arguing with people who didnt want their stories shortened with people who hadnt finished stories that would eventually need shortening with typesetters who by all appearances couldnt spell cat if he spotted them the c and the a and with printers who hadnt tightened the nine wood blocks of an engraving of the ruins of louisville enough to keep the spaces between them from showing on the page as thin white lines no of course it wasnt you fellows he said when the printers tried to deny responsibility a british spy sneaked in and did it while you werent looking if hes hiding under one of your presses and jumps out and does it again though im going to be very unhappyand so will you quarreling till noon helped him work up an appetiteor maybe his stomach was growling from nerves because he still didnt know which way president blaine would jump however that was hed grown ravenous by the time twelve oclock rolled around he collared clay herndon and said lets go over to the palace for lunch bully herndon lifted a gingery eyebrow are you counterfeiting double eagles down in your cellar or is mayor sutro paying you not to run that picture of him and limber hannah clemens ears burned he rallied quickly saying if i had that picture id run it on the front page and id make damned sure the printers screwed the engraving blocks together good and tight in a manner of speaking come on if were going to live lets live a little sold herndon sprang from his seat being on market street the palace hotel was only a few minutes walk from the morning call offices going into the restaurant though was entering another world sam felt released from prison no more dingy cubbyholes crammed with wisecracking newspapermen and smelling of printers ink the restaurant was bright and airy full of starched white linen and gleaming cutlery and as full of the odors of good food and even better tobacco in such surroundings sam was almost ashamed to light up one of the cheap cheroots he enjoyed more than any other cigarsalmost but not quite he ordered toasted angelsoysters wrapped in bacon flavored with red peppers and lime juice and grilled on skewersand deviled pork chops herndon chose oysters too in an omelet with flour and heavy cream the waiter started to suggest that might make a better breakfast than a luncheon herndon fixed him with a steely glare if i wanted advice pal id have ordered some he said the waiter bowed and retreated the reporter got his omelet thats telling him clemens said lifting a sparkling tumbler of whiskey in salute put a fancy suit on some people and they think they own the worldand they make you believe it too he sipped from his drink looked thoughtful and went on thats probably why generals look like goldplated peacocks youre likely right herndon answered struck by the aptness of his own thought sam looked around the restaurant for officers there wouldnt be any generals here not with colonel sherman commanding the garrison but the principle applied in diminishing degree to other ranks as well he spotted a major a couple of captains and a lieutenant commander from the small pacific squadron of the us navy all in all enough in the way of epaulets and gold buttons and plumed hats to convince him hed stumbled across a new law of nature then the food arrived and he stopped worrying about the us army or even the navy the toasted angels were perfect or maybe a little bit better the bacon brought out the delicate oceanic flavor of the oysters with the pepper and lime juice adding a piquant counterpoint and the pork chops served in a sauce of mustard horseradish and chutney had a solid fatty taste that made him demolish them one after another across the table from him herndon was methodically laying waste to the omelet god damn sam he said features working in the throes of some deep emotion why dont we do this more often only reason i can think of is that im not stamping out double eagles downstairs clemens answered real regret in his voice i felt like it today thats all ill feel like it tomorrow too but my wallet wont after more whiskey turkish coffee and zabaglione the two newspapermen sorrowfully paid the bill and even more sorrowfully walked back to the morning call as soon as they came through the door edgar leary all but leaped on them he was waving a telegram in his hand and dancing around as if about to hit the warpath easy there sam said get the rattlesnake out of your unmentionables and tell us what the devils going on weve got blaine s answer leary said waving it in clemens face came over the wire not five minutes ago before sam could snatch it out of his hand he went on blaine says noa big loud no we arent licked anywhere he says anywhere but new mexico territory sam broke in he checked himself never mind ill shut up what else does he say says we were right to fight at the beginning and says were still right now says were going to make the confederate states cough up what they had no business taking in the first place says clemens could restrain himself no longer he says well make the empire of mexico keep those two worthless provinces if we have to kill every man in the united states to do it thats not quite how he put it leary said no but thats what it means now clemens did take the telegram from him he rapidly read through it then nodded yes thats what it means all right if wed spent five millions a few months ago we could have made maximilian happy and taken all the steam out of longstreets boiler now well spend ten or twenty or fifty times that much and for what what do we get a war that isnt going anyplace soldiers maimed and murdered by the thousands and tomorrows editorial for me isnt that grand without waiting for an answer he carried the telegram back to his desk read it again and began to write throw some good money after the bad you will hear them say after you have thrown away half your lifes savings on a railroad that goes up a mountain but does not come down the other side or on a streetpaving company whose president has lacked the forethought to cross your mayors palm with silver or on your brotherinlaw whom you reckon must surely be right this once having been wrong so often throw some good after the bad and you will earn it all back and more besides this is what they tell you and once in a blue moon they tell you the truth the rest of the time they buy themselves railroad carsheavens railroadsand yachts and shooting boxes in scotland and congressmen to shoot from the shooting boxes and they do it with your bad money and your good impartially yet this appears to be the theory upon which james g blaine has chosen to go on with this war no other theory looking to hold not only has he chosen to throw good money after bad but to throw good men after good the dead mount up and the peglegged and the hookhanded and the blind but never you fear for we have gained a mile of ground in kentucky near enough and have not lost above forty or fifty miles of new mexico to make up for it and have had washington dc knocked flat besides and so victory must be right around the corner he rubbed his chin studying what hed done will this cause them to make me out to be a confederate spy again he murmured he read the words once more to hell with that its the truth he inked his pen and kept on with the editorial chapter a braham lincoln watched the soldiers building the gallows out side fort douglas it was a touch of general popes either extraordinarily good or extraordinarily bad depending on how things worked out for lincoln was not the only one watching that exercise in practical carpentry far from it the work had to be visible from a goodly part of salt lake city and those of the latterday saints who could not see it would have heard of it as lincoln watched the men labour stripped to their shirts a guard in a blue blouse watched him he suspected the guard had stretched the truth about his age to get into the army the fellow was trying to raise a mustache but had only a little pale fuzz on his upper lip his eyes never left lincoln it was as if he were tracking a ninepoint buck a resemblance only strengthened by the loaded springfield he carried the index finger of his right hand never got far from the trigger you want to be careful with that lincoln said mildly lest something happen we would both regret afterwards oh no mr lincoln the guard shook his head i wouldnt regret it one bit his smile was wide and bright and pitiless and about half crazy so youre the one who wants to be careful believe me i shall lincoln said shot while trying to escape how many murders hid behind that stern mask of rectitude he did not care to add another to the number half a dozen traps on the gallows half a dozen nooses though the ropes were not yet in place half a dozen mormon leaders to dance on air at a time though they were not yet in place either lincoln knew john pope wanted to hang him too had pope had his way he would soon climb those steps with orson pratt and george cannon and the rest of the highranking mormons the us army had managed to run down a democrat in the white house might have let pope hang him of course with a democrat in the white house the united states would no doubt have passively acquiesced to the confederacys acquisition of chihuahua and sonora the mormons would not have gained an excuse for showing their disloyalty to the government that loved them so little would that have been better lincoln shook his head the united states should have resisted the expansion of the slave power and should have started resisting long since his smile reached only one corner of his mouth the united states should have done a better job of resisting too one of the soldiers up on the multiple gallows tried a trapdoor it didnt drop god damn it he said as any workman would have when what he was making didnt perform the way it should he called to another soldier hey jack bring me over that plane will you got to smooth this old whore down yes it was just work to him if he thought about what the work would do he didnt show it lincoln turned away from the gallows and slowly walked back into the fort the guard followed finger still near the trigger of his rifle son i am not going to run away lincoln told him i am seventytwo years old the only way i could move faster than you would be for someone to throw me off a cliff yonder he pointed north and east toward the brown sunbaked wasatch mountains thatd be good the guard said showing his teeth lincoln kept quiet inside fort douglas colonel george custer was strutting across the parade ground when he saw lincoln he scowled and trotted toward him for a moment lincoln thought the cavalry officer would collide with him but by what hed seen custer lived his entire life going straight ahead at full throttle that struck lincoln as needlessly wearing but the cavalryman wasnt going to ask his advice custer wanted to go chesttochest with him but wasnt tall enough he had to content himself with going chesttobelly and fiercely scowling up into lincoln s face as hed done several times before if it were up to me he growled youd swing i thank you kindly for the vote of confidence colonel lincoln said irony to custer was like a mouse on the tracks to a locomotive not big enough to notice he rolled right over it saying you dashed black republican they should have hanged you after we lost the last war they should have hanged you again for a communard and now they should hang you for a traitor youre luckier than you deserve do you know that im lucky in all the people who love and admire me thats plain lincoln answered again it sailed past the cavalry colonel he paused to kick dust on lincoln s shoes another of his less endearing habits then jerked a thumb back in the direction of general popes office the military governor is going to want to see you you may as well go on over there now ill do that lincoln said amiably enough when custer did not move he added just as soon as you get out of my way i mean with another growl the commander of the fifth cavalry stepped aside as lincoln ambled along in the direction of popes office the young lieutenant whod arrested him at gabe hamiltons house came out of the stockade spotted him and came over at a run mr lincoln i was looking for you general pope wants to invite me to take some tea with him lincoln said as the lieutenant gaped yes so ive been informed resisting the urge to pat the youngster on the head lincoln walked past him toward the beckoning shade general john pope looked up from the sheet of paper he was reading ah mr lincoln he said taking off his spectacles and setting them on the desk i wanted to speak with you so ive been told lincoln said a moment later he repeated so ive been told it meant nothing to pope it probably would have meant nothing to him had he seen both custer and the young lieutenant come up to lincoln the former president started to sit waited for popes brusque nod and finished setting his backside on a chair the military governor of utah territory glowered at him it was probably a glower that put his subordinates in fear since lincoln already knew popes opinion of him and was already in his power it had little effect here perhaps sensing that pope made his voice heavy with menace you know what would happen to you if your fate were in my hands i have had a hint or two along those lines yes general lincoln answered president blaine forbids it you know that too its too damned bad in my opinion but i am not a traitor i obey the lawful orders of my superiors pope tried the glare again not quite for so long this time next best choice in my view would be putting convicts stripes on you and letting you spend the rest of your days splitting rocks instead of rails in my present state i doubt the gravel business would get as great a boost from my labours as you might hope lincoln said pope went on as if he had not spoken the president forbids that as well his view is that no one who has held his office deserves such ignominyno matter how much he deserves such ignominy if you take my meaning oh yes general you make yourself very plain i assure you for which i thank you i am but a poor bluff soldier unaccustomed to fancy flights of language pope was a grandiloquent twit given to nights of bombast he didnt know it cither he was as blind about himself as he had been about stonewall jacksons intentions during the war of secession if you cant hang me and you cant put me at hard labour for the rest of my days what do you propose to do with me lincoln asked pope looked even less happy than he had before i have been given an order mr lincoln for which to make myself plain once more i do not care to the extent of one pinch of owl dung but i am a soldier and i shall obey regardless of my personal feelings on the matter commendable im sure lincoln said what is the order to get you out of utah territory pope truly did sound disgusted to put you on a train and see your back and never see your face again to make sure you interfere no further in the settling of affairs here that was better than lincoln had dared hope he did his best to conceal how happy he was if you must general i was bound for san francisco when matters here became unfortunate i shall have to set up some new engagements there having been detained so long but no pope interrupted you are not going to san francisco neither are you going to denver nor chicago nor st louis nor boston nor new york president blaine has shown so much sense if no more whither am i bound then lincoln inquired you have a choice you may go south to flagstaff in new mexico territory or north to pocatello in idaho territory and points beyond for the duration of the war you are to be restricted to the territories north or south of utah territory i am to advise you that any attempt to evade the said restriction will upon your recapture result in punishment far more severe than this internal exile ah i see lincoln nodded sagely i may go wherever i like provided i go to a place with for all practical purposes no people in it precisely pope was almost as deaf to irony as custer if you wish to muzzle me why not simply leave me in confinement here in utah lincoln asked confining you embarrasses the present administration you being the only other republican president besides the incumbent general pope replied leaving you to your own devices here in utah on the other hand embarrasses me you have already proved beyond the slightest fragment of a doubt that you are not to be trusted here but delight in meddling in affairs properly none of your concern general nothing that has happened in utah since the outbreak of the war has delighted me lincoln said neither the deeds of the mormon leaders nor those undertaken since us soldiers reoccupied this territory if you equate the mormons and the united states army we are well shut of you pope declared had john taylor and his henchmen simply remained good citizens none of what we have had to do would have been necessary when phrased thus that was true but lincoln had listened to taylor and the other mormons enough to know they thought every effort to abolish polygamy a persecution of beliefs they held dear from what he had seen they had a point but did that matter to anyone who took the view on polygamy of the vast majority of the american people it mattered not at all pope went on the time for coddling the rebels here is past we have tried to persuade them to obedience and failed persuasion having failed we shall force them to obedience one way or another however obedience we shall have what you shall have is hatred lincoln said i dont care this muchpope snapped his fingersif every mormon wakes up in the morning and goes to bed at night and spends all the time between praying that i roast in hell forever so long as he obeys me while so praying when you treat with taylor when you hold silence after treating with taylor you suggest to these poor ignorant folk that they too have some hope of successfully defying me that cannot tolerate and that is why i am sending you out of this territory lincoln sighed if singleminded ruthlessness could bring the mormons to heel pope was the right man for the job and custer a good right hand for him the question of course was whether such ruthlessness could do the job lincoln had his doubts if john pope had ever had doubts about anything hed had them surgically removed at an early age i would sooner send you out of this territory to your eternal reward pope said but as i have noted that is not among the choices president blaine has left me in fact he has left the choice to you and a better one than you deserve too north mr lincoln or south lincoln wondered if promising to arrange the peaceable surrender of john taylor would let him stay here and work to avert the tragedy he so plainly saw coming had he seen the slightest hope of success in keeping such a promise he would have made it but he did not think the mormon president would surrender even had he reckoned taylor willing he did not think general pope would let him make the arrangements and he did not think that if taylor should surrender pope would do anything but hang him north or south the military governor repeated that is the sole choice left you he was right knowing he was right saddened lincoln as he had not been saddened since having to recognize the independence of the confederate states north he said pope clapped his hands together and i win an eagle from colonel custer he was ten dollars sure youd say south but for that though it matters little during the war of secession you exiled me to minnesota to fight redskins and then lost the war anyhow now i get to return the favor and if you think it isnt sweet youre wrong i hope you dont lose the war here lincoln said being in popes power he was not suffered to have the last word there is no war here the military governor said harshly there shall be no war here your going makes that the more likely you leave tomorrow general orlando willcox studied the map of louisville give me your frank opinion colonel schlieffen he said might i have been wiser to attempt a flanking movement than a frontal assault alfred von schlieffens frank opinion was that general willcox would have made an excellent country butcher but was less than ideally suited to command an important armyor even an unimportant one he did not think willcox would appreciate his being so frank as that instead he said perhaps you might have made a small attack here to hold the foe and a larger one on the flank to beat him thats what i have in mind doing now the commander of the army of the ohio said i have reinforcements coming president blaine is committing the resources of the entire nation to this fight instead of sending them straight into louisville i purpose invading kentucky at another point farther east whence i can take the confederates defenses of the city in the flank what is your view of the matter again schlieffen could not make himself be so forthright as he might have liked what could have at the campaigns beginning been done and what can now be done are different one from the other he said oh no doubt no doubt willcox said but we have the rebs well and truly pinned down inside of louisville now thanks be to god they wont be able to shift quickly to respond to such a move now some truth lurked at the bottom of that how much schlieffen admitted to himself he did not know he did not think the world had ever known a battle like this one sieges had been fought around cities yes but in all history before now had a siege ever been fought in the heart of a city that in essence was what the fight for louisville had become when he said so aloud willcox nodded thats just what its turned into he agreed the question is are we the besiegers or the besieged both at the same time schlieffen answered each of you thinks you can the other force back and so you both push forward and you collide and neither of you can go ahead or to fall back is willing have you ever seen rams bang heads together oh yes willcox said thats why i aim to try out this flanking manoeuvre a ram that butted another in the ribs before it was ready to fight would tup a lot of ewes before it was ready to fight yes in this you have right are right schlieffen corrected himself with a grimace of annoyance at his imperfect english anything imperfect annoyed him but if the second ram were already fighting it would be harder to surprise i dont even know whether this flank move will surprise the confederates willcox said my bet is surprised or not theyll be too badly beaten up to do anything save ingloriously flee you place on this bet a large stake schlieffen said in lieu of asking willcox where he was hiding his wits these days our cause being just god will provide the general said i have prayed over this decision and i am confident it is the best thing we can do prayer is good schlieffen agreed from the bottom of his heart to prepare is also good if you do not prepare prayer asks of god a miracle god will work a miracle when it suits him but suit him it does not often no indeed willcox said if miracles were common they would not be miracles schlieffen waited from him to draw the proper lesson from that he drew some of it we shall get these men into kentucky and hurl them against the foe as expcditiously as possible schlieffen took expeditiously to mean something like expedition and had to have that straightened out which willcox did with patience and tact the german military attache admired orlando willcox the man who from all he could see lived an exemplary christian life he wished his opinion of orlando willcox the commander were higher the man did not lack courage he had the ability to inspire his subordinates both of those were important parts of the generals art these days though the art entailed more in germany schlieffen said we would have done more planning before this battle began we would have looked at the choices we might make if soandso happened in the fighting in louisville we would have known we then needed to do this thing or that we would have done the thing we would not have had to think out on the spot what the thing would be to do willcox looked at him with wide eyes we havent got anything like that in the united states i know you have not this thing in your country schlieffen said in the pitying tones he would have used to agree with a turk that railroads were sadly lacking in the ottoman empire you have not in your country the understanding of a general staff general rosecrans heads up a staff in the war department willcox said shaking his head i have a staff here and a sizable one too yes i have seen this schlieffen said it is not the sort of staff i mean your staff when you decide the army will do thusandso take your orders to the commanders of corps and divisions they to you bring back any troubles these men may have with the orders yes willcox echoed what else are they supposed to do for heavens sake aside from the quartermaster and such i mean the staff of the war department should have in peacetime been busy at making plans for how you would fight when you had to fight schlieffen remembered the incomprehension with which rosecrans had greeted the idea of having readymade plans to roll out in case of war and his own dismayed astonishment at the us generalinchiefs lack of preparation your staff here should on a smaller scale the same thing do what he was trying to say was that willcox shouldnt have decided on the spur of the moment to try a flanking manoeuvre against louisville and only then begun to make plans for such a manoeuvre it should have been one of the possibilities all along as thoroughly studied as any of the others so it was zero equaling zero but that was not what schlieffen had in mind if and when the time came to use it everything would be in place beforehand railroad transport manpower artillery supplies so much of each to be delivered to the right place at the right time what the army of the ohio had instead was frantic improvisation some of it was inspired improvisation as seemed to be the american way but not all not all those thoughts ran through his mind far faster than he could hope to turn them into english no we havent got anything like that here general willcox said in wondering tones impressed enough by what schlieffen had managed to bring out you germans really do that plan everything out ahead of time i mean aber naturlich schlieffen said and then went back to english of course maybe we ought to take some lessons from you then willcox said after a moment adding the confederates havent got anything like that either this i believe yes schlieffen said they alsois it that you say in english they make it up as they go along we say that all right willcox answered i say something else too i say im going to send a couple of telegrams to philadelphia one to general rosecrans and the other to president blaine sounds like the usa ought to know more of what youre talking about the french have adopted this method schlieffen said with something less than delight they are our neighbors they have seen what this lets us do you are not our neighbors but you have neighbors to north and south who are strong and with whom you fight as we do to cast and west and south it may help you better help yourselves if it can make us win wars the way you germans have won wars i dont see how it could be better than that willcox said he suddenly looked like what he was a tired man not so young as he had been saddled with an assignment even he might have sensed was too big for him in a wistful voice he went on been a long time since we won a real war indians dont count sooner or later they get worn down but we havent trounced anybody since the mexicans and losing the war of secession threw us down in the dumps for years this i believe we in prussia were downcast when we lost to napoleon but we rose up and were soon again strong generously schlieffen added the united states can also do this i ask the lord on bended knee every night to make it so willcox said i am nothing my country is everything to me you are a good man general this is how a soldier must think schlieffen turned to go i thank you for giving of your time to me i know you have much to do willcox nodded abstractedly his eyes were back on the map of itself one of his fingers traced the flanking move he was planning he sighed and plucked at his beard as schlieffen left the army commanders tent confederate artillery began tearing at the pontoon bridges us army engineers had thrown over the ohio every so often the guns of the south managed to put one span or another out of action for a while but the us engineers were adept at making repairs improvisation again schlieffen thought smoke mantled louisville as it always did these days smoke also rose from the docks on the indiana side of the river confederate gunners did not neglect them either in one regard orlando willcox was assuredly correct a fight on this line would take all summer and would gain little ground if he kept fighting it the same way schlieffen turned and looked to the north and east he saw smoke plumes there too smoke plumes from the trains bringing in endless streams of reinforcements to be thrown into the fire as children in ancient days had gone into the fire of moloch maybe willcox had the right of it after all what he was doing did not work that argued some other approach might work better in the german army he would have had a list of such approaches at his fingertips with similar lists of everything he needed to do to use any one of them here he had to think of them for himself and then figure out their requirements poor devil schlieffen thought if the united states did try a flanking attack could they conceal it till the time came to loose it schlieffen had his doubts for a couple of reasons one was that he doubted the ability of the united states to keep secrets as a general principle courage yes growing industrial capacity yes discipline no but even with discipline it wouldnt have been easy when prussia had fought the austrians fifteen years before each side easily spied on the other why not they both spoke the same language with only minor differences of dialect the same applied here the confederates could easily sneak men into indiana to observe their foes preparations of course general willcox and his henchmen could as easily send spies into kentucky to keep an eye on confederate troop movements and such if willcox was doing that schlieffen had seen no evidence of it did the commander of the army of the ohio know whether his opponents were readying field fortifications to help their men withstand the blow he had in mind schlieffen was tempted to go back and ask general willcox whether he knew that the map over which willcox had been poring had not shown any confederate field fortifications east of louisville did that mean none were there or did it mean he didnt know whether any were there after taking a step in the direction of willcoxs tent schlieffen turned away once more he was a neutral here his duty was to observe and report and analyze the war between the usa and the csa not to involve himself in the result of the struggle with a shrug he headed off toward his own tent to write up what willcox had told him even if he did make suggestions to the us commander he doubted willcox would comprehend them anyhow colonel george custer strode slowly down the row of men drawn up outside fort douglas he had on his stern face the one he always used at inspections nothing will escape my eye that scowl said you had better be perfect anything less and you will pay it was to a certain degree humbug custer knew it enlisted men had been inventing ways to hoax inspectors since julius caesars day if not since king davids sometimes though they got nervous when the commanding officers glare fell on them then they gave away things he might otherwise have missed privately he doubted that on this inspection for one thing he wasnt so sure about what to look for as usual for another he had trouble keeping up that stern facade about threequarters of the way down the line he gave up and let himself grin well boys he said i expect youll be able to give the mormons holy hades if they step out of line what do you say to that yes sir chorused the soldiers with the red facings on their uniforms and if you do have to open up on them i expect theyll die laughing custer went on i declare youve got the funniestlooking contraptions there in the complete and entire history of war ive seen them in action and theyre still funnylooking what do you say to that yes sir the gatlinggun crews chorused once more eight gatlings now each one with the brass casing polished till it gleamed like gold do you know what general pope calls your toys he asked the men who served them no sir they answered still in unison coffee mills custer told them and grins came out on their faces too with the big magazines set above those polished casings with the cranks at the rear of the weapons they did look as if theyd be suited to turning coffee beans into ground coffee they could take care of more grinding than that though custer said if the mormons do give us trouble well have them ready for boiling up in the pot in nothing flat wont we yes sir the soldiers in artillerymens uniforms responded some of them glanced toward the gallows not far away custers eyes traveled in that direction too the exercise in carpentry was finished now each trap had a noose above it the ropes twisted in the breeze off the great salt lake before long blindfolded men would twist at the ends of those ropes traitors custer muttered just what they deserve pity we couldnt give it to honest abe too he raised his voice if the mormons riot when we hang the devils who held the united states to ransom will we do our duty no matter how harsh it may prove yes sir the gatling gunners said custers grin got wider the next enlisted man he found with any sympathy for the mormons would be the first remember boys he said if we do have to shoot them down well be making an uncommon number of widows the gun crews laughed out loud a couple of soldiers clapped their hands with glee as far as custer was concerned the mormons were a dirty joke on america whatever happened to them he thought they had it coming he peered down the row of gatling guns as far as he was concerned they were a joke of a different sort a couple of them had proved useful against the kiowas and the confederates eight now eight struck him as excessive major tom custer came strolling out from fort douglas to join his brother the two of them had matching opinions on the new weapons in a low voice tom asked suppose we really have to go and fight the rebs autie what in blazes will we do with these ungainly critters dont rightly know custer admitted also out of the side of his mouth he walked a little farther away from the gatlings so he and tom could talk more freely best thing i can think of is to do what we did to the kiowasput em on good ground and let the enemy bang his head against them i suppose so tom said like his brother he would have led his men at full tilt against any foe he found also like his brother he assumed any other officer would do the same i just hope we get the chance to try it or to move against the rebs without the gatlings custer said frankly id prefer that what good will eight of the things do us none i can see and theyll slow us down as soon as we get away from the railroad line two didnt not too much tom observed thats so but with eight there are four times as many things to go wrong custer replied to which his brother had to nod he went on right now though everybody thinks theyre a big thing so were stuck with them come what may sooner or later my guess is that the war department will decide theyre nothing but a flash in the pan youre likely right his brother said of course i am custer spoke with his usual sublime confidence he pulled out his pocket watch looked at it and let out a low whistle tom im late in town he pointed down toward salt lake city will you dismiss these fellows and tell them what good boys they are if im not where im supposed to be on time or dashed close to it im going to get skinned sure ill take care of it for you tom answered but whats so alltired important down there custer set a finger in front of his lips for a moment ive got a lead that needs following up he whispered melodramatically if it turns out the way i hope it willwell i dont want to say too much toms eyes widened dont tell me youve got a line on john taylor i wont tell you anything custer said i cant tell you anything but believe me ive got to go all right autie if you do bring that scoop back ill bet youll have a brigadier generals stars on your shoulder straps this time tomorrow that would be fine wouldnt it custer slapped his brother on the shoulder then hurried off to the stables the hands in there were supposed to have his horse ready he was glad they did he sprang up into the saddle let the horse walk out of fort douglas and then urged it up into a trot tom had the gatlinggun crews well in hand custer had been sure he would tom was ready for a regiment of his own he didnt much want one fearing higher rank would keep him out of the field more than he fancied the road into salt lake city ran south and west the mormons custer passed on it cither gave him hatefilled snarls and glares or pretended he didnt exist he preferred the former it was honest every so often a man would clap his hands or wave his hat to the commander of the fifth cavalry custer always waved back knowing the army needed backing from utah s gentiles as it would surely get none from the latterday saints he did admire the way the mormons had lined their boulevards with trees that helped make the heat more bearable under the eagle gate he rode as he had when first entering salt lake city he kept looking around in all directions while doing his best not to let that be noticed he wanted nobody soldier or mormon on his trail the fewer who knew of the business he was on the better for everyone no one was following him when he turned onto a narrow street really more of an alley a few blocks southeast of temple square though when the temple would be completed was anyones guess now probably about the time the jews rebuild theirs in jerusalem custer thought derisively he hitched his horse in front of a battered adobe building with cafe painted in faded letters on the whitewash above the door before he went in he looked around again nobody but he was on the street the nearby shops and houses drowsed in the afternoon sunshine satisfied he went through the door inside the place was full of the good odors of roasting pork and freshbaked bread it was however empty of customers in a way that was too bad it deserved better in another way though it was perfect for the meeting custer had in mind hearing the door open and close the proprietress came out from the back room a redheaded woman in her late twenties the map of ireland on her saucy face she walked up to custer and asked and what can i do for you today sir ah katie my very dear its what we can do for each other he replied and took her in his arms the first time hed tried the cafe hed been after nothing more than dinner hed got thatand a fine one it was tooand a deal of friendly banter from katie fitzgerald besides that and the food had brought him back on his second visit hed learned she was a widow doing her best to make ends meet on his fourth visit now their lips clung their hands clasped their bodies molded to each other custer exulting in his strength picked her up and carried her back to the bedroom she laughed shed squealed the first time he did it hurry she said when he set her down he needed no urging along those lines fast as he could he divested himself of blouse and shirt of boots and socks of trousers and drawers he was fast enough to be ready to help her loosen the stays of her corset and slide it down over her hips before they embraced again naked this time and tumbled down onto the bed custer had strayed off the path of perfect rectitude before sometimes with indian women sometimes with whites when libbie was close by he made himself a model of circumspection when she wasnt he did what he did as discreetly as he could and worried about it very little afterwards i love you katie fitzgerald breathed into his ear he had never said that to her he was in his own fashion honest but the way his fingers stroked the softness not quite hidden in the fiery tuft of hair between her legs might almost have been an equivalent her soft moan said she took it for one she moaned again when he went into her and shut her eyes tight lost in her own world of sensation custer laughed deep in his throat libbie did the same thing then he stopped thinking about libbie or about much of anything at all his hips pistoned faster and faster beneath him katie yowled like a catamount her nails scored his back at the last possible moment he pulled out of her and spurted his seed over her soft white belly he prided himself on his control there as much as he did on his skill with a gun or on horseback its a sin katie whimpered halfheartedly she was a good catholic but she did not want to find herself in a family way one side of her mouth quirked upward its messy too get off me so i can clean myself she did just that with a rag and some water from the pitcher on the bedside nightstand as fast as hed got out of his uniform custer got into it again as hed helped katie undress he helped her dress too when they were both fully clothed once more he said my brother thinks im out hunting john taylor he found that deliciously funny a reputation for singleminded devotion to the task at hand was a disguise as effective as false beard and wig there were tasks and then there were tasks well when youre not here thats a good thing for you to do she answered seriously the sooner hes on the end of a rope the better off this place will be custer had never yet heard any gentile with a good word to say about the mormon president now ive got to go he told her he kissed her and caressed her and pretended he didnt sec the tear slide down her cheek hed never told her he was married not in so many words but he hadnt pretended to be a bachelor either he said ill see you again as soon as i can what if i have a customer she asked with a sly little smile ill be disappointed he answered which changed the smile to a different sort she hugged him one more time fiercely then let him gono one paid any more than the usual attention to him as he rode back up to fort douglas he whistled garry owen as he might have done going into battle but hed fought his battle here fought it and won it when he got back to the fort his younger brother collared him at once as hed known tom would any luck yes but not the sort you re thinking of not so much as i should have liked custer said and made himself look unhappy with the world theyre wily devils the mormons tom said sympathetically but you have more luck than you know as a matter of fact do i custer looked up his sleeve as if hoping to find it lurking there as his brother laughed he asked whereabouts to his surprise tom turned and pointed across the parade ground here it comes now he said hello autie darling libbie custer waved to her husband they finally let me escape from fort dodge so here i am with all the animals in tow i expect theyre unpacking the trophies even now she hurried forward to give custer a hug he had faced death more times than he could count against confederates and indians both what he did now he thought took more courage than any of those desperate fights he threw his arms wide ah libbie my very dear he said enthusiastically and smiled a big broad smile tombstone is still ours theodore roosevelt said the name tolling like a mournful bell in his mouth lets hope plenty of rebel tombstones will go up there if general stuart does choose to attack it hasnt happened yet like i told you the courier from fort benton said i pray to the lord it does not happen roosevelt declared i pray to the lord that we instead attack the confederate forces in new mexico territory and drive them from our soil lieutenant karl jobst had been taking a swig of coffee when he lowered the tin cup from his lips he said we already tried that sir and got licked thats why tombstone is in so much trouble now a shame and a disgrace roosevelt growled wherever the fighting truly matterswherever its bigger than ill raid your farms and you raid minethe damned rebels have the bulge on us theres a reason for that sir jobst said roosevelt raised an eyebrow his adjutant went on wherever the fighting matters its fighting between enough men on each side to have a general commanding them our generals fought in the war of secession and lost theirs won need i say more thats pretty damned cynical for so early in the morning roosevelt said lieutenant jobst grinned at him his own smile was on the strained side it also has the unpleasant ring of truth the courier spoke up sir have your men seen any sign that the british are likely to move soon colonel welton asked me to ask you special nary a one roosevelt sprang to his feet and paced around the cook fire when hed recruited the unauthorized regiment his head had been full of the rasping roar of the rifles and the fireworks smell of burnt gunpowder hed wanted battle what hed got was boredom and he was beginning to chafe under it if he hadnt told me they were in lethbridge id have guessed they hadnt come any closer than labrador or maybe london yes sir thats right good sir the soldier chuckled sir if its like you say and them bastards are being quiet colonel welton asks if you reckon you can leave your command for a couplethree days come down to the fort and talk things over how its all working out up here and what youll do if the limeys ever should decide to get off their asses and try something yes roosevelt sprang into the air this was action if not the action against the british his heart wanted as much as his body craved a womanwhich was no small yearningit was something different from what he was doing now after sameness that seemed unending that drew him like a magnet lets be off i can leave as soon as i saddle my horse well get you a fresh animal so you wont slow the journey with your worn one arent you done with that coffee yet good heavens man hurry that was pushing things somewhat but when any idea bit roosevelt it bit him hard inside half an hour he and the courier him with a winchester on his back the other man with a springfield were riding south toward fort benton roosevelt pounded a fist down onto his thigh in anticipation of his first return to the civilized world since taking the field then he laughed at himself if fort benton counted for civilization hed been out in the wilderness too long walk trot canter walk trot canter the two men kept their horses as fresh as they could by varying their gaits roosevelt held his mount to a canter longer than usual as long as his kidneys could stand the jarring no matter how rough it was it ate up the miles he got into fort benton a little past sundown riding along the missouri the last few miles when he dismounted he discovered his own gait resembled nothing so much as that of a bear with the rheumatism as a couple of enlisted men took the horse away to be seen to he stumped across the parade ground to colonel weltons office my dear fellow welton exclaimed you look as if you could use a good brushdown and a blanket across your back and to the devil with your horse he reached into a desk drawer the kerosene lamps that lighted the chamber sent shadows swooping in every direction welton pulled out a corked bottle full of tawny liquid cant give you that im afraid but what do you say to a small restorative i say yes sir i say thank you sir roosevelt sank into a chair sitting hurt as much as moving did oof i say good god sir dont blame you a bit welton poured him a restorative that might have been small for a rhinoceros i didnt expect you till tomorrow morning some time thats a long ride for one day but you are a chap who takes the bull by the horns wouldnt have eagles on your shoulder straps if you didnt eh thats about the way i see it sir roosevelt drank fire ran down his throat and exploded into contentment in his belly ahh i say god bless you sir youre right a man without pluck goes nowhere henry welton sipped at his own glass of whiskey if thats the measure of success youll go farand heaven help anyone who stands in your way he took another sip he was still behind roosevelt but he didnt need the drink so badly and was wise enough to remember he carried twice his guests years so the british are quiet are they yes sirquiet as the tomb roosevelt did not even try to keep the regret from his own voice i know how tempted youve been to go over the border and take a whack at em the way a boy whacks a hornets nest with a stick welton chuckled be glad youve restrained yourself were you foolish enough to try anything of the sort youd get what the hornets would give the boyif not from the british then from your own side for disobeying orders i understand that sir im switched if i like it but i understand it roosevelt stared at his glass where had the whiskey gone when president blaine told longstreet we werent whipped yet i thought the englishmen would come down over the border to try and make us change our minds eri say thank you again sir welton had restored the restorative setting the bottle back on the desk the commander of the seventh infantry studied roosevelt with considerable respect i looked for the very same thing as a matter of fact he said slowly you may be an amateur strategist colonel but youre a long way from the worst one ive ever seen if you can lead your men in action too well in that case youll make a firstrate soldier and i thank you yet one more time for that sir roosevelt made himself be deliberate with his second glass of whiskey after getting such a compliment the last thing he wanted was to act the drunken foolthe young drunken foolbefore his superior you called me downthat is you said i might come downso we could confer on how best to resist the british should they happen to recall they are men your men delay them and concentrate against them mine join you we pick the best ground we can and we fight them henry welton said ticking the points off on his fingers how does that sound to you it sounds bully roosevelt said but begging the colonels pardon i dont sec how its any different from what wed planned before the unauthorized regiment went up to watch the border its not welton admitted cheerfully but figured a few days in towneven so small a town as fort bcntonwould do you a world of good youre not used to going off on your lonesome for long stretches blowing off steam while everythings quiet wont hurt the war and itll help you as roosevelt had seen the fleshpots of fort benton were nothing to threaten new york city or even great falls but welton was rightthe little town by the fort seemed positively sybaritic when set beside a regimental headquarters out in the middle of the empty montana prairie still sir if youre generous enough to give me a few days of ease like thisand i do thank you for them dont mistake memight i give the troops in the regiment leave to come into fort benton one at a time to blow off their steam the troops adjacent to that coming in on furlough could spread themselves thinner to cover its ground i should hate to take advantage of a privilege my men cannot enjoy well i hadnt thought of it but i dont see why not welton said he stared across the desk at roosevelt colonel have your troopers any conception of how fortunate they are in their commanding officer sir in this request i am only seeking to apply the golden rule you are a young man henry welton said he raised a hand no i mean nothing by that but praise we need young men their energy and their enthusiasm and their idealism without them this part of the country will never come to its full growth had welton meant nothing by the remark but praise he wouldnt have felt the need to amplify and justify it so roosevelt was not so young as to fail to understand that but even with whiskey burning through him he refused to take offense instead he answered some few men are fortunate enough to retain their youthful energy and enthusiasm and idealism throughout the whole span of their lives they are the ones the history books written a hundred years after they are dead call great i cannot judge the course of my life before i run it but that is the goal to which i aspire henry welton didnt say anything for fully five minutes after that one of the lamps burned out filling the room with the sharp stink of kerosene and throwing new dark shadows across his face when at last he spoke it was from out of those shadows and in a meditative tone suited to them i wonder colonel what the old generals and captains who had fought so long and so well under philip of macedon thought when alexander gathered them together and told them they were going to go off and conquer the world alexander would have been about the age you are now i expect roosevelt stared nothing he could say or do sitting down seemed thanks enough forgetting his aches and pains he sprang to his feet and bowed from the waist i cant possibly live up to that now he felt the whiskey it put him at risk of sounding maudlin god made only one alexander the great and then he broke the mold but a man might do much worse than trying to walk as far as he can in his footsteps yes so a man might welton paused again this time to light a cigar when he had it going he chuckled selfconsciously in vino veritas or so they say lord only knows what they say about whiskey from a fort benton saloon he suddenly seemed to notice the lamp had gone out heavens what time has it gotten to be its a little past ten sir roosevelt said after looking at his watch i didnt mean to keep you gabbing here till all hours colonel welton said you must be about ready to fall over dead let me gather you up and take you off to the bachelor officers quarters for the night as a matter of fact im fine roosevelt said and to his surprise it was true much better than i was when i first rode into the fort must be the excellent company and the equally excellent restorative if you dont get some rest now you wont be fine in the a knock on the office door interrupted welton before he could finish the sentence come in he called and a soldier did telegram in hand welton raised an eyebrow it must be after midnight back in philadelphia whats so important that it wont keep till daybreak its not from philadelphia sir the soldier answered its from helena from the territorial governor all right whats so important in helena that it wont keep till daybreak welton took the wire read it growled something vile under his breath crumpled up the paper and flung it across the room god damn that lazy bastard whats wrong sir roosevelt asked you may have heard they booted abe lincoln out of utah territory for interfering with the military governor no well they did he turned up in helena preaching the power of labour and started a riot down there now hes on his way up to great falls probably to preach on the same text im supposed to help keep order there and id have had a hell of a lot better chance of doing it if his idiotic excellency hadnt waited till the day before lincoln was getting into great falls before bothering to tell me he was on his way hes talking there tomorrow night sir whomever you send send me too roosevelt exclaimed ive always wanted to hear lincoln im not sending anyone welton said im going myself youre welcome to ride along if you like he waited for roosevelt s eager nod then went on and now i will put you to bed and put myself to bed too we have a busy day ahead of us tomorrow and likely a busier night good roosevelt said which made henry welton laugh as far as frederick douglass knew he was by at least twentyfive years the oldest correspondent crossing the ohio with the second wave of invadersno of liberatorsentering kentucky hed wondered how much trouble he would have in getting permission to see the action at first hand hed had no trouble at all the officer in charge of granting such permissions was captain oliver richardson instead of being difficult general willcoxs adjutant had proved the soul of cooperation when the process was done douglass had said thank you very much captain with a certain amount of suspicion in his voice hardly believing richardson wanted to be helpful and then the captain had smiled at him its my pleasure mr douglass believe me hed said and the smile had got wider that wasnt pleasure it was gloating anticipation he thinks hes sending me off to be killed douglass had realized he hopes hes sending me off to be killed worst of all the negro journalist couldnt say a word richardson had only done what hed asked him to do and now along with a raftactually a bargefull of nervous young white men in blue uniforms a nervous elderly black man in a sack suit set out across the ohio to go into the confederate states of america for the first time in his life on his hip was the comforting weight of a pistol he didnt expect to do much damage to the rebels with it it would however keep them from ever returning him to the life of bondage he had been fortunate enough to escape us artillery opened up thunderous in its might as had happened before the direct assault on louisville the southern bank of the ohio disappeared from view engulfed in smoke if all went according to plan the bombardment would leave the confederates too stunned to reply if all had gone according to plan louisville would have fallen weeks before and this second assault would have been unnecessary douglass did his best not to dwell on that at the rear of the barge the steam engine began hissing like a whole nestful of snakes here we go boys shouted major algernon van nuys who commanded that part of the sixth new york volunteer infantry crammed aboard the awkward ugly vessel the soldiers cheered douglass wondered whether they were outstandingly brave or outstandingly naive no matter what sort of noises the engine made the barge wasnt going anywhere in a hurry it crawled away from the wharf and waddled south toward the kentucky shore of the ohio one of many boats and barges in the water as soon as they started moving shells started falling among them weve been hoaxed somebody near douglass exclaimed they said they were gonna knock all these rebel guns to kingdom come they lied to us lied he sounded comically aggrieved one of his friends a youngster with a more realistic view of the world replied likely they said that to the fellows who went over the ohio the first time too you think they were right then ned ned didnt answer a shell that came down very close to the barge drenched everyone and set all the men cursing and trying to dry off douglass decided too late that the occasion was probably informal enough for him to have escaped criticism even if he hadnt worn a cravat and wingcollared shirt how slowly kentucky drew near he felt hed been on the barge forever with every cannon in the confederate states of america taking dead aim at him and him alone the logical faculty he so prized told him that was an impossibility it had been bare minutes since hed set out from the northern bank of the river with death in the air though logic cowered and time stretched like saltwater taffy once we land well have to step lively major van nuys called cool as if his men were going onto the parade ground for drill not into enemy territory to fight for their lives well form columns of fours and advance southwest in column till we meet the enemy then deploy into loose order and sweep him aside our shout will be revenge his men raised another cheer for that only a handful of them were old enough to remember the war of secession but the scars from that defeat had twisted the national countenance ever since even the young soldiers knew why they wanted revenge douglass would have preferred libeity for a shout or perhaps justice but revenge would do the job the queen of the ohio had gone aground far harder than the invasion barge did the steamboat had been going far faster when she grounded too yelling fit to burst their throats the soldiers of the sixth new york swarmed off the barge they swept douglass along catching him up in their resistless tide he counted himself lucky not to be knocked down and trampled underfoot get the devil out of the way you damned old nigger somebody bawled in his ear the soldier whoever he was didnt sound angry at him for being a negro so much as for being an obstruction whichever his reason douglass could do nothing to accommodate it he had no more control over his own movement than a scrap of bark borne downstream by a flood on the mississippi and then suddenly he spun out of the main torrent of men and realized the muddy ground on which he was standing was not just any muddy ground but the muddy ground of kentucky of the confederate states of america he had carefully planned what he would do when at last he bestrode enemy soil shaking his fist toward stonewall jackson in louisville he cried out sic semper tyrannis thus always to tyrants major van nuys echoed well said but do you know what mr douglass that is the motto of the confederate state of virginia oh they are great ones for taking a high moral tone the confederate states douglass said taking a high moral tone costs them nothing living up to it is something else again van nuys did not linger to argue the point he waved his sword to draw the attention of the men under his commandabout the only use a sword had on a battlefield dominated by breechloaders and artillery disembarking from the barge had mixed the soldiers promiscuously officers sergeants and corporals screamed like madmen to get them into some kind any kind of order and moving forward against the foe a few bullets cut the air even as the sixth new york began its part of the us flanking assault against louisville a man fell with a dreadful shriek clutching at his belly and wailing for his mother and someone named annie sister sweetheart wife whoever she was douglass feared she would never set eyes on her young hero again he hoped his own anna would sec him once more when the soldiers began to march the negro journalist discovered that with the best will in the world a man in his sixties had a hard time keeping up with fellows a third his age he did his best stumping along heavily and managing to keep the tail of the column in sight panting he muttered the faster they go the better i like it if the men of the sixth new york and all the other regiments thrown into the fight moved swiftly they did so because the confederate defenders had not the strength to withstand them no one going straight into louisville had moved swiftly two shells burst up ahead a man flew up into the air limp and boneless as a cloth doll tossed away by a girl who didnt feel like playing with it any more others were simply flung aside still others screamed when shell fragments sawed into their tender flesh come on lads keep it up come on major van nuys called we cant play these games without paying a little every now and then believe you me whatever it costs us the rebs will pay more more cheers rose from the sixth new york van nuys then ordered them into open echelon which suggested to douglass not only that they were already in the zone of combat but that they were liable to pay more than a little how much the confederates were paying was anyones guess one thing was plain the csa had not resisted this thrust as they had the one aimed straight at louisville that the us soldiers were advancing and not entrenching to save their lives from devastating confederate fire proved as much douglass hoped that meant the rebels were at full stretch to contain the usa in louisville itself and had little left to resist elsewhere the countryside was pretty farms with belts of oaks and elms between them after a moment douglass revised his first impression the countryside had been pretty and might one day be pretty again war was rapidly doing what war didmaking ugly everything it touched shell craters scarred meadows and fields a couple of farmhouses and barns were already burning smoke from their pyres staining the morning air several small cabins near a farmhouse also burned for a moment douglass simply noted that as any reporter would then he realized what those smaller buildings were slave shanties he said through clenched teeth even here so close to the ohio and freedom they had slave shanties may they all burn and all the big houses with them a few minutes later a couple of us soldiers with long bayonets on their springfields led half a dozen or so confederate prisoners back past him toward the river a couple of the rebs were wounded one with his arm in a sling made from a tunic the other wearing a bloody bandage wrapped round his head all of them were skinny and dirty and surprisingly short rumor made sixfoot confederate soldiers out to be runts they did not look like invincible conquerorspetty vagrants was more like it may i speak to these men douglass asked their guards sure snowball go right ahead one of the men in blue replied cant think of anything liable to make em feel worse not off the top of my head i cant douglass ignored that less than ringing endorsement you prisoners he said sharply to remind them of their status how many of you are slaveowners two men in gray nodded the fellow with the bandaged head said you wouldnt bring me fifty dollars youre too damn old and too damn uppity i cant help being old and im proud to be uppity douglass said how dare you presume to own to buy and to sell and to ravish your fellow human beings the captured confederate laughed hoarsely you damn crazy nigger id sooner ravish my mule than ugly old nero who helps me farm he spat a stream of tobacco juice and you got a lot of damn nerve tellin me what i can and cant do with my property which aint none o your business to begin with men and women are not property douglass thundered as if to an audience of twenty thousand they are your brothers and sisters in the eyes of god not where i come from they aint the prisoner said and spat again he turned to the us soldiers guarding him you done caught us aint that bad enough we got to put up with this damn mouthy nigger too take us away and put us somewheres why dont you youre damn lucky youre breathin reb one of the soldiers in blue answered you want to stay lucky youll do like youre told douglass had often anticipated interviews with ordinary confederates this one wasnt going the way hed anticipated the other rebel who admitted to being a slaveholder said what in blazes are the ywnited states invadin us for anyways we aint done nothin personal to you nigger we aint done nothin to nobody in the usa all we done is buy up a chunk o mexico wasnt doin nobody no good nohow an youall start shootin at us an blowin us up on account of that my pappy always told me they was funny up in boston and massachusetts and them places and reckon he was right the existence of a nation built on bondage is a stench in the nostrils of the entire civilized world douglass said it aint your business both confederate soldiers spoke as one it is the business of every man who loves liberty douglass declared he threw his hands in the air he and the slaveholders might have been speaking two different languages he asked them how were you captured the uninjured one said three yankees yelled at me to throw down my rifle at the same time right about then i reckoned thatd be a plumb good idea what about you douglass asked the other one you really want to know nigger the reb with the bandaged head answered i was squattin in the bushes with my pants around my ankles doin my business when this motherfucker in a blue coat says hell blow me out a new asshole to shit through if n i dont put my hands high so i done it he gave douglass a sour stare an looky herei got me the new asshole anyways that set not only the confederate prisoners but also their guards braying like donkeys douglass stomped off the rebels jeers pursued him he paused to scribble in his notebook they are now as they have long been ignorant uncouth and stubbornly indifferent to the sentiments of their fellow men and to the appeals of simple human justice only a brutelike hardinessironically the very trait they impute to their enslaved negroesenables them to persist in their infamous course a second look told him that was hardly objective he grunted so what he said aloud he put the notebook in his pocket and tramped off toward the southwest chapter g eneral thomas jackson looked up from the map they are throwing everything they have into this he observed can we reduce our forces within the city of louisville to add a core of battlehardened men to the forces we are deploying against their flanking manoeuvre i believe so sir major general e porter alexander answered they have stepped up their attacks within the city but their troops there have not the dash and spirit they did when the fighting was new they know they are likely to gain little and to pay dearly for what they do get few men give their best under such circumstances any men who fail to give their best under any circumstances deserve the sternest treatment from their own superiors jackson said the old roman custom of decimation has much to recommend it i wouldnt go so far as that sir alexander said trying to turn it into a joke i would replied jackson who saw nothing funny in it raising one arm above his head he went on but back to the nub of things what can you do general about the yankees artillery their guns seriously hamper our efforts to move troops to face the attack from the east they have more guns than we do e porter alexander said unhappily theyve taken some off the louisville front to do just as you say to make shifting soldiers harder for us its a good thing you had the forethought to build so many trench lines around the city before the yankees started moving against our flank if we had to dig while we were fighting wed be in worse trouble than we are already this demonstrates a point i have repeatedly stressed to president longstreet jackson said namely that having a servile population upon which we can draw in time of need confers great military advantage on us he sighed the president is of the opinion that other factors militate against our retaining this advantage perhaps he is even right for the sake of the country i pray he is right yes sir general alexander hesitated then said sir do you mind if i ask you a question by no means general ask what you will despite that generous permission alexander hemmed and hawed before he did put the question sir why do you stick your arm up in the air like that ive seen you do it many times and its always puzzled me oh that jackson lowered the arm hed all but forgotten hed elevated it in the first place one of my legs it seems to me is bigger than the other and one of my arms is likewise unduly heavy by raising the arm i let the blood run back into my body and so lighten the limb it is a habit i have had for many years and one i believe with nothing but beneficial results all right sir alexander grinned at him i expect i ought to be glad im the same size on both sides then is that levity the generalinchief of the cs army knew he had trouble recognizing it well never mind the key to this fight will lie in halting the new yankee thrust before it can crash into the flank of the position we were previously maintaining the foe has been generous enough to give us considerable room in which to manoeuvre hes given himself considerable room to manoeuvre too alexander pointed out you have set your finger on an unfortunate truth jackson studied the map again we have to manoeuvre more effectually then we have no other choice as best i can judge from the reports reaching this headquarters the intended direction of the yankee column is straight at us near enough porter alexander broke in i believe you are correct yes jackson took another long look at the indicated us line of attack absent interference they would be here in a couple of hours i intend to see that such interference is not absent sir a telegrapher waved for jackson s attention i have an urgent wire here from second lieutenant stuart commanding the third virginia south and west of st matthews his line to divisional headquarters is down so he calls on you he says the yankees are there in great numbers hes thrown an attack at them to delay and confuse them but requests reinforcements whatever you have he says he shall be reinforced jackson s head came up a lieutenant commanding a regiment i dont know anything about that sir past what the wire says the telegrapher answered shall i order him to report the circumstances never mind jackson said if he has the command he has it and does not need his elbow jogged for explanations afterwards will be time enough to sort through the whys and wherefores e porter alexander said one way or another he wont be a second lieutenant by this time tomorrow either hell be a captain or maybe a major or else hell wind up a private with no hope of seeing officers rank ever again he paused or of course he may well end up more concerned about his heavenly reward than any he might gain upon this earth a lot of good men must have fallen for a lieutenant to assume regimental command if afterwards he ordered an attack he would hardly be removing himself from danger thats true general jackson studied the telegram trying to divine more from it than the operators bald statement had given him then suddenly his tangled eyebrows rose second lieutenant stuartthats stuart general alexander is our colleagues son not of that rank and in this army jeb jr alexanders eyebrows went up too i believe he is sir of course even with that spelling its far from the least common of names would you answer his request any differently if you knew he was or for that matter if you knew he wasnt in the midst of battle dont be absurd jackson tossed his head as he did so he remembered robert e lees habitual gesture of annoyancelee would jerk his head up and to one side as if trying to take a bite out of his own earlobe it was in jackson s view ridiculous raising his arm over his head again he concentrated on the map the fourth virginia the third tennessee and the second confederate states are ordered to support the attack of the third virginia if their commanders shall not have already moved to do so of their own initiative yes sir the telegraphers key clicked and clicked almost as fast as the castanets of the mexican senoritas whose sinuous grace and flashing eyes jackson had admired during his longago service in the us artillery no sooner had he thought of artillery in one way than general alexander did in another saying we have three batteries by the village of west buechel sir that could lend the infantry useful assistance let it be so jackson agreed and the telegraphers key clicked anew more and more wires began coming in to headquarters from that part of the field second lieutenant stuart from whom nothing further was heard had been right in reporting that us troops were there in great force they had been driving forward too they no longer seemed to be doing so stuarts attack had done what hed hoped rocking them back on their heels they must have thought that if the confederates were numerous enough to assault them they were also numerous enough to beat back an assault jackson knew perfectly well that they had not been so at the time when second lieutenant stuart ordered the attack was it jeb jr hadnt jeb jr been born day before yesterday or last week at the outside hadnt he just the other day graduated from a little boys flowing dress into trousers intellectually jackson knew better every so often though the passing years up and ambushed him they had more skill at it than any yankees one day they would shoot him down from ambush too even had it not been so then it was rapidly becoming so now he who hesitates is lost was nowhere more true than on the battlefield the brief halt stuart had imposed on the enemy let jackson bring forces up to yet another of the lines he had had the conscripted negro slaves of the vicinity build he had every intention of sending president longstreet an exquisitely detailed memorandum relating everything the slaves labours meant to his forces longstreet no doubt would consign it to oblivion that was his affair jackson would not keep silent to appease him by midafternoon the line had stabilized jackson called off the counterattack which he knew must have cost him dear in terms of men though his instinct was always to strike at the enemy he had come to see a certain virtue in the defensive in making us forces rise from concealment to attack his men while the soldiers in butternut and gray waited in trenches and behind breastworks unlike his thoughts on slave labour he did not plan on confiding that one to james longstreet when the crisis was past he told the telegrapher order second lieutenant stuart to report to his headquarters immediately as the soldier tapped out the message jackson sent a silent prayer heavenward that the lieutenant would be able to obey the command he caught e porter alexander looking at him his chief artillerist crossed his fingers jackson nodded alexander had been thinking along with him in more than matters strictly military then when lieutenant stuart did not report as soon as jackson thought he should the confederate generalinchief began to fear the officer was now obeying the orders of a higher commander but then to his glad surprise a sentry poked his head into the headquarters tent to announce that stuart had arrived after all let him come in by all means let him come in jackson exclaimed he and e porter alexander both exclaimed then for it was jeb stuarts son how the devil old are you alexander demanded sir im seventeen jeb stuart jr answered he looked like his father though instead of that famous shaggy beard he had only a peachfuzz mustache but for that though he looked older than his years as any man will coming straight out of battle with his face dark from blackpowder smoke he had the aspect of a minstrelshow performer freshly escaped from hell how did you become senior officer in your regiment lieutenant jackson inquired how young stuart had become a lieutenant at his age was another question but one with an obvious answerhis father must have pulled wires for him sir i wasnt stuart answered captain sheckard sent me back to colonel tinker with word that the yankees were pressing my company hard i see jackson wasnt sure he did not altogether but he didnt press it had sheckard decided to get his important subordinate out of harms way or had he chosen him because he was worth less on the fighting line than an ordinary private no way to tell not from here go on there i was sir and a yankee shell came down and next thing i knew colonel tinker was dead and lieutenantcolonel steinfeldt had his head blown off and major overallstuart gulpedthe surgeons took that leg off him i heard later and the yankees were coming at us every which way and everybody was yelling what do we do what do we do he looked a little green around the gills remembering nobody else said anything so i started giving orders i dont know whether the captains knew they were coming from me but they took em and we threw the yankees back jackson glanced at alexander alexander was already looking at him they both nodded and turned back to jeb stuart jr alexander spoke first congratulations son like it or not youre a hero that summed it up better than jackson could have done he did find one thing to add your father will be very proud of you thank you sir stuart was less in awe of jackson than most young officers would have been having known him all his life but the wobble in his voice had only a little to do with his youth more came from the question he asked sir what would have happened if it hadnt worked out jackson was not good at diplomatic responses he managed to come up with one now you probably would not be here to wonder about that the young officer needed a moment to see what he meant jackson was unsurprised at that age hed thought he was immortal too stuart licked his lips he understood what might have happened once jackson pointed it out he said i meant sir if id failed but lived best to draw a merciful veil of silence over that e porter alexander said beneath his coating of smoke and soot jeb stuart jr turned red er yes sir he said and turned back to jackson sir will we hold the yankees from our flank that still hangs in the balance jackson replied i will say however that we have a better chance of doing so thanks to your action lieutenant stuart he inclined his head to his old comrades son you will be changing the ornaments on your collar in short order jeb stuart jr understood that right away he raised a hand to brush one of the single collar bars marking him as a second lieutenant his grin lit up the inside of the headquarters tent brighter than all the kerosene lamps hung there orion clemens rolled a hard rubber ball through a couple of squads of graypainted lead soldiers take that you dirty rebs he shouted as several of them toppled sutro ran barking after the ball and through the soldiers completing the confederates overthrow with a cry of fierce glee orion sent bluepainted lead figures swarming forward theyre on the run now his father looked up from les miserables if only it were that easy for our side or theirs sam clemens remarked to his wife the war would be over in a fortnight one way or the other and we could slide back to our comfortable daily business of killing one another by ones and twosretail you might sayinstead of in great wholesale lots alexandra set louisa may alcotts after the war was lost on her lap i think too many telegrams from the front have curdled your understanding of human nature no he shook his head in vigorous denial its not the wires from the front that make your belly think youve swallowed melted lead its the ones from the politicians who keep on claiming the boys die to some better purpose than their own stubborn greed and the generals stupidity even orions triumphal advance was interrupted ophelia got the ball away from sutro and threw it at the toy soldiers who wore blue paint the missile struck with deadly effect one of the many casualties flew into the air and bounced off sams shin artillery ophelia cried knock em all down sam studied his daughter with the mixture of admiration and something close to fear she often raised in his mind she couldnt possibly have read the latest despatches out of louisville could she he shook his head she was after all only four years old she knew her abcs she could print her name in a sprawling scrawl and that was about it how then had she been so uncannily accurate about what the confederate guns were doing to us attackers she was ophelia that was how pa orion shouted angrily look pa see what she did she broke two of em pa this one got his head knocked off and this other one here this sergeant his arm is broke casualties of war clemens said see you cant even fight with toy soldiers without having them get hurt i wish president blaine were here i do it would learn him a good one if you dont mind my speaking missouri sam alexandra clemens somehow stuffed a world of warning into one syllable three letters worth of sound well maybe i could find a better time to talk about politics her husband admitted with a sigh sam raised his voice ophelia yes pa suddenly she sounded like an ordinary fouryearold again come here young lady yes pa no not an ordinary fouryearold after all as she walked toward him a halo of rectitude sprang into glowing life above her head sam blinked and it was gone a trick of the gaslights or perhaps of the imagination though what a newspaperman needed with such useless stuff as an imagination was beyond him you broke two of your brothers lead soldiers he said doing his best to sound stern and not break out laughing at the sight of the oh so precious oh so innocent countenance before him what have you got to say for yourself im sorry pa the voice was small and sweet and pure like the chiming of a silver bell probably sorry you didnt wipe out the whole blasted regiment clemens thought he turned her over his knee and gave her a swat on the bottom that was as much ritual as punishment that opened the floodgates for a storm of tears ophelia always howled like a banshee when she got smacked part of that sam judged was anger that she should be subjected to such indignities and part of it probably stemmed from a calculation that if she made every spanking as unpleasant as possible she wouldnt get so many of them orion seemed properly gratified at the racket his sister made when she stalked off to sulk in her tent he held out the broken lead soldiers and asked can you fix em pa ill take em to the paper tomorrow clemens answered the printers can melt em down for type metal sam three letters and an exclamation point from alexandra this time too late orion started crying louder than ophelia had over those theatrical groans sam said i was only joking theyll be able to solder the soldiers back together he had to say it twice more once to get his son to hear him through the caterwauling he was putting out and again to get the boy to believe him cant you remember to save all that for the editorial page and not to bring it home to your family alexandra asked after relative calmand calm among the relativesreturned im all of a piece my dear clemens answered you cant very well expect me to flow like a pennsylvania gusher at the morning call and then put out pap for no better reason than that ive come home at night can i expect you to keep in mind that your son will believe you no matter what you say while the politicos who read your editorials wont believe you no matter what you say alexandra was never more dangerous than when she worked hardest to hold on to her patience sam wagged a finger at her you had better be careful you will make me remember that once upon a time i was fitted out with a sense of shame and thats dangerous excess baggage for a man in my line of work hmm was all alexandra said joke as much as you like but orion broke in pa will you really and truly fix my soldiers they will rise from the deador at least the maimedlike lazarus coming forth from his tomb clemens promised orion looked blank his father explained in other words yes i will do that if only general willcox could make a similar alexandra suffered a coughing fit of remarkable timeliness sam shot her a look half annoyed half grateful orion said as long as they really and truly get fixed its all right he paused then asked when you get em soldered will it leave scars on em like i expect it may sam said solemnly im sorry but bully orion exclaimed which made his father shut up with a snap the next morning sam walked over to the morning call carrying the mortal remains of the lead soldiers in a jacket pocket one of the printers a wizened little welshman named charlie vaughan took a look at the casualties of war and said yeah we can set em right again his cigar made from a weed even nastier than those clemens favored bobbed up and down as he spoke damn shame we cant fix the real soldiers this easy aint it you sir have been listening at my window sam said vaughan shook his head before realizing the editor was joking he gave sam a sour look never mind clemens told him youll make my son very happy and help my daughter out of trouble he rolled his eyes and god forbid i should use that particular phrase fifteen years from now jerk jerk jerk went the printers cigar as he chuckled know what you mean he said i have three of em married the last one off a couple years ago so i dont have to worry about that any more all your children out of the house then clemens asked when charlie vaughan nodded he aimed another question at him how the devil do you stand so much quiet you think youre making fun of me again only you aint vaughan said gets almost spookylike sometimes the cigar twitched would be worse i suppose if my missusd ever learned to shut her trap ill be sure to tell her you said that next time i see her sam said and beat a hasty retreat in the direction of his desk before the printer could choose one of the numerous small heavy objects within arms length and throw it at him morning sam clay herndon said when he walked in a few minutes later what have you got there this policecourt story edgar turned in last night clemens answered excising an adverb man bites dog you might say three chinamen charged with setting on an irish railroad worker whaling the stuffing out of him and departing with his wallet since the celestials decided the wallet was worth keeping they must have caught the mick before he started his round of the saloons ha herndon said and then youre rightthats not the way it usually goes the irish get liquored up they cave in john chinamans skull and the judge slaps em on the wrist weve seen that story so many times its hardly news enough to put in the paper back when i first started working for this sheet in the days when the office was over on montgomery you couldnt have put that story in the paper sam said publisher wouldnt let you get by with it he thought it would offend the irish though i always reckoned not more than a double handful of em could have read it those must have been the days herndon said this would have been a ripsnorting town back then it was when i first got here clemens agreed then the united states went and lost the war and san francisco got a lot of the snorts ripped clean out of it the panic was a hell of a lot worse than it ever got back in the states for the first time in a long while he hauled out the old california expression for the rest of the usa the railroad hadnt gone through yet remember and we were about as near cut off from the rest of the world as made no differenceand the rest of the world seemed to like it just fine that way too ive heard it was pretty grim all right clay herndon allowed grim clemens said why it made dying look like a circus with lemonade and elephants because once you were dead you didnt have to try and pay your bills with greenbacks worth a hot four cents on the gold dollaroh they dropped down to three cents on the dollar for a week or two but by then everybody who could be scared to death was already clutching a lily in his fist hard times herndon said every time somebody who went through it here starts talking about it you wonder how people got by you hunker down and you hang on tight to what youve got if it isnt that damn lily sam answered the great earthquake of didnt do us any good either youll have felt em here now and again but theres never been anything like that since thank heavens not even the quake of which wasnt a piker i dont reckon well see the like again for another couple of hundred years and if god pays any attention to what i think thatd be too soon too even the common gardenvariety earthquakes are bad enough herndon said with a shudder makes me queasy just thinking about em he deliberately and obviously changed the subject whats the war news theyre killing people sam said and let it go at that when his friend coughed in annoyance he blinked as if surprised oh you want the details he pawed through the blizzard of telegrams on his desk general willcox has proved he can get stuck in two different places at the same timea lesser man would have been incapable of it dont you think the british gunboats on the great lakes have bombarded cleveland again though lord knows why having visited the place once they felt inclined to come back the indians arc on the warpath in kansas the confederates are on the warpath in new mexico territory and abe lincolns on the warpath in montana territory and with ruffles and flourishes the war department announced the capture of pocahontas arkansas pocahontas arkansas clay herndon asked in tones that suggested he hoped sam was kidding but didnt really believe it and sam wasnt he waved the telegram to prove it in case youre wondering pocahontas is almost halfway from the border down toward the vital metropolis of jonesboro he said solemnly i looked it up at first i thought it was only a flyspeck on the map but i have to admit that further inspection proved me wrong hallelujah i must say no doubt the shock waves of the seizure are reverberating through richmond even as i speak pocahontas arkansas herndon repeated sam nodded ruffles and flourishes the reporter asked clemens handed him the wire he read it grimaced and handed it back ruffles and flourishes sure enough good god almighty we shouldnt cackle that loud if we ever do take louisville you cant cackle over the egg you didnt lay clemens pointed out we havent got louisville but pocahontas arkansas by thunder is ours he clapped his hands together once twice three times sam herndons voice was plaintive why do we have such a pack of confounded dunderheads running this country my theory used to be that we get the government we deserve sam said bad as we are though i dont think were that bad right now im taking a long look at the notion that god hates us he glanced up at his friend i know somebody whos going to hate you if you dont set your posteriors in a chair and get some work done to soften that he added and id better do the same returning his attention to edgar learys story he killed seven adjectives at one blow a brisk crackle of gunfire came from the northern outskirts of tombstone new mexico major horatio sellers turned to jeb stuart and said you were right sir they are going to try and hold the place i didnt reckon theyd be such fools i think we rolled most of the real yankee soldiers back toward tucson the ones we didnt capture at contention city i mean stuart answered what weve got left in these parts is mostly tombstone rangers and the like unless i miss my guess theyll be fighting for their homes here and they havent got the brains god gave a camel sellers said with which stuart could not disagree either his aidedecamp rubbed his hands together in high good cheer theyll pay for it boom a roar louder than a dozen ordinary rifle shots and a large cloud of smoke rising from the graveyard north of tombstone declared that the us defenders had found a cannon somewhere stuart stayed unperturbed i hope to heaven we know better by now than to pack ourselves together nice and tight for a field gun to mow us down his smile was almost found those smoothbore napoleons did a good business during the last war but weve come a long way since his own field artillery posted on the hills that led up to the dragoon mountains north and east of town consisted of modern rifled guns that not only outranged the tombstone yankees obsolete piece but were more accurate as well no sooner than the napoleon revealed its position shells started falling around it it fired a couple of more times its cannonballs kicking up dust as they skipped along then fell silent so much for that horatio sellers said with a chuckle a couple of minutes later though the oldfashioned muzzleloader came back to life we must have knocked out their numberone crew stuart guessed and sent them scrambling around for replacements theyve got some brave men serving that gun much good may it do them sellers grunted they likely never did have a whole lot of men with much notion of what to do with a cannon if youre right sir and their best gun crews down they wont be able to hit a blamed thing now not without fool luck they wont that makes sense to me jeb stuart agreed we dont want em to get lucky though he turned to chappo who along with geronimo was watching the fight for tombstone alongside the confederate commander will you ask your father if he can slide some apaches forward and pick off the yankees who are tending to their gun yes i will do that chappo spoke to geronimo in their own language young man and old gestured as they spoke back and forth the apaches used their hands as expressively as frenchmen when they talked chappo returned to english my father says he will gladly do this he wants to punish the white men of tombstone to hurt them for all the times they have hurt us if we take this place together he will burn it stuart looked down at tombstone s wooden buildings baking under the desert sun and no doubt tinderdry if we take this place its going to burn whether he burns it or not i reckon even though he watched with a telescope he could not spy any of the apaches moving up toward the napoleon the tombstone volunteers were still firing he wondered whether geronimo had ordered them forward the ground beyond the graveyard offered more cover than a billiard table but not much he wouldnt have cared to send his own men up to try to knock the gunners out of action thats why were allied with the apaches the cold calculating part of his mind said let them get hurt doing the nasty little jobs like that he glanced over at geronimo the indianmedicine man was the closest term stuart could find for his positionwas watching litterbearers carrying wounded confederate soldiers back toward the tents where the surgeons plied their grisly trade when geronimo felt stuarts eye on him the old indian quickly moved his head and looked in a different direction he didnt do it quite quickly enough i will be damned stuart thought i know just what that driedup devil of a redskin is thinking and nobody will ever make me believe i dont hes thinking sure as hell hes thinking thats why were allied with the confederates let them get hurt doing the nasty big jobs like that to hell with me if hes not stuart whistled dixie between his teeth weeks of travel with geronimo and the other apache leaders had taught him they were more than the unsophisticated savages the dime novels made them out to be they were in fact very sophisticated savages indeed not till that moment though had stuart paused to wonder who was using whom to the greater degree now geronimo looked over toward him the apache seemed to realize stuart had peered into his thoughts he nodded to the white man a small tightly controlled movement of his head stuart nodded back the two of them might have been the two sides of a mirror each reflecting the others concerns and each surprising the other when he realized it all at once stuart noticed the napoleon had fallen silent again now geronimo looked his way without trying to be furtive about it the apache raised his tredegar to his shoulder and mimed taking aim stuart nodded to show he understood and doffed his hat for a moment in salute to the apache warriors skill geronimos answering smile showed only a couple of teeth losing their cannoneers once more dismayed tombstone s defenders they fell back from the graveyard into the town had stuart commanded them he would have had them hold out among tombstone s tombstones as long as they could when they retreated the confederates and apaches promptly seized the high ground the confederate field guns started hammering away at tombstone itself when shells struck bare ground smoke and dirt leapt skyward when a shell hit a building it was as if a spoiled child kicked a dollhouse timbers flew every which way no doubt glass did too though stuart could not see that even with his telescope but he knew what flying bits of glass could do to a mans body having been educated in the war of secession do we wait for fire to do our work for us major sellers asked a couple of thin threads of smoke were already rising into the sky no well press it a bit stuart replied even in fire the damnyankees can hold out for a long time down there and it wouldnt burn them all out besides if we take the town instead of burning it we also get to forage to our hearts content yes sir his aidedecamp said enthusiastically the confederate army in new mexico territory operated on the end of an enormously long supply line thanks to their victories stuarts troopers had plenty of food for themselves and fodder for their animals they had enough powder and munitions for this fight too looking ahead to the next one stuart didnt like the picture he saw down from the hills toward tombstone came the dismounted confederate cavalrymen four going forward for every one who stayed behind to hold horses down from the hills too came the apaches stuart was sure that was so although again he could see next to no sign of the indians after a bit he watched geronimo instead of trying to spot redskinned willsothewisp the indian could plainly tell where his braves were and what they were up to even if stuarts eyes could not find them the apaches were convinced geronimo had occult powers watching him watch men he could not possibly have seen halfway convinced stuart they were right the volunteers in tombstone kept on putting up a brave fight as they had been in the valley south of tucson the us forces were caught in a box with opponents coming at them from three sides at once here though they had good cover they also had no good line of retreat from tombstone which made them likelier to stand where they were whenever confederates or indians pushed them they drove off their foes with an impressive volume of fire from their winchesters but then more and more of the saloons and gambling halls and sporting houseswhich seemed to make up a large portion of tombstone s buildingson the northern edge of town caught fire the flames forced the defenders out of those buildings and farther back into tombstone the smoke from them also kept the tombstone rangers from shooting as accurately as they had been doing confederates and apaches began dashing between flaming false fronts and into tombstone as stuart rode closer to the mining town the cheers of his men and the indians war cries drowned the shouts of dismay from the us volunteers major horatio sellers rode alongside him sir will you send in a man under flag of truce to give the yankees a chance to surrender geronimo and chappo were also riding forward with the confederate commander before stuart could answer chappo spoke urgently to his father in the apache language geronimo answered with similar urgency and greater excitement chappo returned to english do not give them a chance to give up they have done us too many harms to have a chance to give up sure as the devil the apaches were using the confederates to pay back their own enemies but then major sellers said its not as if they were regular army men sir true enough probably better than half of them are gamblers or road agents or riffraff of some kind or another the spectacle of his aidedecamp agreeing with geronimo instead of trying to find a persuasive excuse to massacre him bemused stuart it also helped him make up his mind if the tombstone rangers want to surrender they can send a man to us i wont make it easy for them chappo translated that for geronimo his father grunted spoke gestured spoke again chappo didnt turn his response back into english from the old indians tone and expression though jeb stuart thought he could make a good guess about what it meant something to the effect of oh all right id sooner every one of them bit the dust but if they give up what can you do a dirtyfaced confederate came running back to stuart sir the damnyankees put a couple of sharpshooters up in that church steeplehe pointed back through drifted smoke toward what was plainly the tallest structure in tombstone and theyve done hit a bunch of our boys i cant knock em out by myself corporal stuart answered he looked back to see where the field guns were a couple of them had already taken up positions in the graveyard not far from where the napoleon had stood go tell them theyll take care of it the range was short the gunners were barely out of effective winchester range from the outskirts of tombstone and might have come under severe fire from us army springfields stuart watched shells fall around the church then one gun crew made a pretty good shot and exploded their shell against the topmost part of the steeple no further reports of yankee sharpshooters there came to stuarts cars that church he found when he rode into town was at the corner of third and safford the tombstone rangers made a final stand a block south of it at the adobe wells fargo office at third and fremont and the corral across the street from it whose fences theyd reinforced with planks and stones and bricks and whatever else they could find the ok corral was a target artillerists dreamt of after a couple of salvos turned the place into a slaughterhouse the defenders raised a white flag and threw down their guns and the fighting stopped geronimo seeing the men who had so tormented the apaches now in his allies hands wanted to change his mind and dispose of them on the spot no stuart told him through chappo we dont massacre men in cold blood what will you do with them the medicine man asked send them down to hermosillo along with the rest of the us soldiers weve captured stuart answered geronimo sighed it is not enough it will have to do stuart told him we havent done too badly here when you think about it weve cleared us forces from a big stretch of southwestern new mexico territory and we did it without getting badly hurt at all much of what you did you did because we helped you geronimo replied through chappo we should have some reward he could not force the issue he had not the men for that stuart said you do have a reward here is all this land with no yankee soldiers on it here are your braves with the fine rifles they have from us how can you complain it is not enough geronimo repeated he said nothing more after that stuart resolved to keep a close eye on him and his followers as soon as abraham lincoln saw the crowd that had come to hear him in great falls he knew he would not have such an appreciative audience as he had enjoyed in helena by the standards of montana territory helena was an old town having been founded just after the end of the war of secession great falls by contrast was so new the unpainted lumber of the storefronts and houses hardly looked weathered more to the point though helena was a mining town a town built up from nothing by the labourers who worked their claimsand who most of them worked luckier mens claims these daysin the surrounding hills great falls by contrast was a foundation of capital a town that had sprung to life when the railroad out to the pacific went through if it hadnt been for fear of the british up in canada the railroad would probably still remain unbuilt but it was here and so were the people it had brought storekeepers and merchants and brokers predominated the bourgeoisie not the proletariat lincoln sighed in helena hed got exactly the response hed wanted hed told the miners some home truths about the way the country treated them without more than a handful of negroes to exploit it battened off the sweat of the poor and the ignorant and the newly arrived and the unlucky capitalists didnt want their victims to know that capitalists had reasons for not wanting their victims to know that too after hed told the miners some things of which their bosses would have preferred them to remain ignorant theyd torn up helena pretty well he smiled at the thought of it he hadnt touched off that kind of donnybrook in years hed won the supreme accolade from one of the local capitalists a tough whitebearded fellow named thomas cruse if i ever set eyes on you again you son of a bitch cruse had growled ill blow your stinking brains out thank you sir lincoln had answered which only served to make cruse madder lincoln wasnt about to lose sleep over that from what hed heard cruse had once been a miner one of the handful lucky enough to strike it rich having made his pile hed promptly forgotten his class origins in much the same way as an irish washerwoman whod married well would come back from a european tour spelling her name brigitte not brigid another sigh came from his lips no no sparks tonight not from these comfortable welldressed people a couple of army officers sat in the second row no doubt to listen for any seditious utterances he might make one of them looked preposterously young to be wearing a cavalry colonels uniform lincoln wondered what sort of strings the fellow had pulled to get his command and why hed tied a red bandanna around his left upper arm rather nervously a local labour organizer not that there was much local labour to organize named lancaster stubbins introduced lincoln to the crowd friends lets give a warm montana welcome to the man who makes it hot for capital the fiery champion of the working man the former president of the united states mr abraham lincoln despite stubbins images of heat the most enthusiastic word lincoln could in justice apply to the round of applause he got was tepid that did not surprise him here in great falls he would have been surprised had it proved otherwise when he took his place behind the podium he stood exposed to the crowd from the middle of his belly up that didnt surprise him either almost every podium behind which hed ever stoodand hed stood behind a great forest of themhad been made for a smaller race of men he sipped at the glass of water thoughtfully placed there then began my friends they ran me out of helena because they said i made a riot there as god is my witness i tell you i made no riot there no applause came from the crowd shouts of liar rang out so did other shouts we have the telegraph and we know what happened lincoln held up a hand i made no riot there he repeated that riot made itself more outcry rose from the audience the young colonel in the second row wearing a red bandanna seemed ready to bounce out of his chair if not out of his uniform lincoln waited for quiet when he finally got something close to it he went on do you think my friends the honest labourers who heard me in helena would have turned the town on its ear had they been happy with their lot i did not make them unhappy with it how could i have done so having only just arrived all i did was remind them of what they had and what in law and justice they were entitled to and invite them to compare the one to the other if that should be inciting to riot then adams and franklin and washington and jefferson deserved the hangings they did not get sudden silence slammed down he had hoped for as much the people still remembered freedom no matter how the plutocrats tried to make them forget heartened lincoln continued so many in helena like so many elsewhere in the united statesso many even here in great fallslabour so that a few who are rich can become richer ignorant old man that i am i have a moderately hard time seeing the fairness there a capitalist will tell you that his wealth benefits everyone maybe he is even telling you the truth although my experience is that these capitalists generally act harmoniously and in concert to fleece the people or do you not think his wealth would benefit you more were some part of it in your pocket rather than his that got a laughnot a large one but a laugh tell em abe somebody called somebody else hissed lincoln held up his hand again quiet this time came quicker he said even before the war of secession i made my views on the matter clear as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master democracy has no place for slaves or masters to whatever extent it makes such a place it is no longer democracy a man with silk drawers a gold stickpin and a diamond on his pinky may disagree what of the miner in his tattered overalls or the shopkeeper in his apron does not the capitalist trample them down by his own rising up and does he not sow the seeds of his own destruction in the trampling for when through this means he has succeeded in dehumanizing the labouring proletariat by whose sweat he eats soft bread when he has again and again put the working man down and made him as nearly one with the beasts of the field as he can when he has placed him where any ray of hope is extinguished and his soul sits in darkness like the souls of the damned when the capitalist has done all this does he not fear while he sips his champagne that the demon he has made will one day turn and rend him that was the sentence upon which his speech in helena had ended he had not intended it to end there he had planned to go on for some time but the ragged miners there construed his words literally and acted on what he had taken for or part of him had taken for a mere figure of speech here in great falls he got no riot he did get an audience perhaps more attentive than it had planned on being when he saw men leaning forward to hear him better he knew hed succeeded my friends the defense of our nation lies not in our strength of arms though wish our arms every success in this war upon which we are engaged our reliance is in the love of liberty which god has planted in us if we let it perish we grow the seeds of tyranny on our own soil if we suffer our labourers to wear the chains of wage slavery we look forward to the day when the nation is enchained to our north in canada we find a people with a different government from ours being ruled by a queen turning south to the confederate states we see a people who while they boast of being free continue to hold their fellow men in bondage at present we are at war with both these peoples not least because we do not wish to permit their unfree power to be extended if is altogether fitting and proper that we should struggle if struggle we must for such a cause yet will we fight for the cause of freedom abroad while allowing the same cause to perish at home we all declare for liberty but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing with some the word means for each man to do as he pleases with himself and with the product of his labour with others the same word means for some men to do as they please with other men and the product of other mens labour the fullness of time i am convinced will prove to the world which is the true definition of the word and my earnest hope remains that the united states of america shall yet lead the way in the proving in great falls he got applause warmer than when he was introduced in helena that passage might have touched off the riot had the previous one not done it in a way he appreciated the polite hearing in another way he would sooner have been booed off the platform people who listened politely and forgot an hour later what theyd heard were no great asset to the cause of liberty we shall have change in this country my friends he said i leave you tonight with this thought to take to your homes if we cannot find a peaceable way to bring about this change we shall find another way as our forefathers did in we have now as we had then the revolutionary right to overthrow a government become a tyranny to benefit only to the rich i pray we shall have no need to exercise this right but it is there and if the need be there as well we shall take it up and the foundations of the nation shall tremble good night as he stepped down he got about what hed expected cheers and catcalls mixed together one fight started in the back of the hall instead of joining in the men around the fighters pulled them apart and hustled them outside lincoln smiled ever so slightly no it hadnt been like that in helena lancaster stubbins came up to lincoln and shook his hand that was very fine sir very fine indeed he said youll stay the night with my family and me i should be honored lincoln said stubbins was earnest and sincere and when and if the new revolution came would undoubtedly be swept away stillit will prove a better bed i am sure than the one i enjoyedthough that is scarcely the proper wordin fort douglas getting to the promised bed would take a while some people came forward to congratulate him some people came forward to argue with him half an hour after the speech was done he was still alternately shaking hands and arguing that brash young cavalry colonel stuck a finger in his chest and growled you sir are a marxian socialist his tone was anything but approving lincoln found himself surprised men who so emphatically disagreed with his positions seldom came so close to identifying their true nature that is near the marknear but not quite on it colonel he said roosevelt the cavalry officer answered impatiently theodore roosevelt he scowled up at lincoln through his goldframed spectacles how do you mean sir not quite on the mark in what way am i in error the challenge in his voice declared that like george custer he saw disagreement as affront still lincoln judged the question seriously meant and so answered seriously a marxian socialist colonel roosevelt believes the revolution will come no matter what measures be taken to prevent it my view is the revolution will come unless strong measures be taken to prevent it ah roosevelt gave a slow thoughtful nod that is a distinction unlike custer he evidently could feel the intellectual force of a counterargument that index finger stabbed out again but you do believe the pernicious marxian doctrine of the class struggle i do believe it yes lincoln said i do not believe it pernicious not after spending my time since the war of secession observing what has been afoot in the united states in the confederate states and as best i can at a distance in britain and europe as well class struggle is balderdash poppycock roosevelt declared we can attain a harmonious society by adjusting our laws and their interpretation so as to secure to all members of the community social and industrial justice we can surely i said as much lincoln replied but shall we or will those in whose hands most capital now rests seek only to gain more that looks to be the way the wind is blowing and it blows a fire ahead of it roosevelt surprised him again this time by nodding the worst revolutionaries today are those reactionaries who do not see and will not admit that there is any need for change you had best be careful colonel roosevelt or people will be calling you a marxian socialist lincoln said by no means sir by no means the brash young officer said you believe the damage to our body politic is i shall give you the benefit of the doubt and say all but irreparable my view on the contrary is that the political system of the united states remains perfectible and that resolute action on the part of the citizens as voters and the government as their agent can secure the blessings of both liberty and prosperity for capital and labour alike i have heard many men with your views but few who express them so forcefully lincoln said most if you will forgive me have their heads in the clouds not i by jingo theodore roosevelt said i wish i could believe you likely to be correct lincoln carried out for reform to be carried out in the manner you describe though a man of truly titanic energy would have to lead the way and i see none such on the horizon i do see workers by the millions growing hungrier and more desperate day by day now if you will excuse me colonel this other gentleman wished to speak with me roosevelt turned away lincoln heard him mutter poppycock under his breath once more then the former president being greeted by a supporter forgot about the young cavalry colonel frederick douglass wished he could go home to rochester in fact nothing save his own pride and stubbornness kept him from going home to rochester if he went home he would be admitting defeat not only to those who read his despatches from the louisville front in their newspapers but also and more important to himself as he got out of a carriage captain richardson had furnished him and headed for the newly built wharves several miles east of louisville he knew defeat was there whether he admitted it or not captain richardson kept right on being obliging still douglass was convinced in the hope that he could get him killed with each new time douglass crossed the ohio into kentucky the total chance of his getting killed grew more likely and he knew it he kept crossing anyhow every time he could the united states now held two tracts on the southern side of the river one inside battered louisville itself the other projecting toward it from the east the shape of that second salient sadly was deceiving the front had not advanced more than a couple of furlongs in the past several days hope that the flanking manoeuvre would drive the confederates from louisville had all but died with it had also died a great many young men in us blue confederate artillery pounded away at the us positions east of louisville this salient was bigger than the one in the city and had pushed the rebels out of range of the indiana side of the ohio the amount of ground gained however was not the beall and endall of the campaign the beall had not come to be and the endall was not in sight another barge was loading barges were always loading sending in more soldiers to do what they could against the rebels entrenchments and rifles and cannon some soldiers came back on barges too shrieking in anguish some stayed in kentucky and fought and did not go forward some stayed in kentucky and died and were hastily buried some stayed in kentucky and died and were not buried at all sometimes douglass had trouble persuading the soldiers he had the right to cross this time though he met no difficulties even before he drew from a pocket captain richardsons letter authorizing him to go into kentucky one of the men tending to the barges engine waved and said got a letter from my cousin sayin she really likes the way youre writin about the war thats very kind of her the negro journalist said as he stepped aboard the barge had he been white he thought the soldier would have called him mr douglass few white men could bring themselves to call a negro mister making an issue of an act of omission though was much harder than doing so about an act of commission douglass kept quiet consoling himself with the thought that he might have been wrong once the one white man had accepted him as an equal or something close to an equal the rest did the same hed seen that before too people all too often put him in mind of sheep had that fellow mocked him and called him a nigger the others packing the barge likely would have followed that lead as readily as the other us guns on the kentucky shore not far from the riverbank belched smoke and flames as they tried to put their confederate counterparts out of action near the guns lay wounded soldiers who would go back to indiana aboard the barge once it had unloaded the men it carried some cried out some groaned and some lay limp too far gone in suffering to complain along with the soldiers headed toward the battle line he averted his eyes from the bloodstained evidence of what war could do he did not accompany the fresh troops to whatever position they had been assigned instead he made his way toward the men of the sixth new york they had come closer than any other us troops to breaking the confederate line and smashing into louisville as general willcox had envisioned only a desperate countercharge by a rebel regimentled by a lieutenant some said though douglass didnt believe ithad knocked them back on their heels and let cs forces bring in more troops and solidify their position several confederate shells came screaming down within a couple of hundred yards of him he took no notice back before the battle began they would have sent him diving panicked for the closest hole he could find he was astonished at how blase hed grown about shellfire on toward the line of battle he tramped not at any great speed but as steadily as if powered by steam that comparison made him smile he puffed less now on such hikes than he had when hed first made them his wind was better than it had been for years hed always been blessed with a robust constitution which served him in good stead today hed gone up to the sixth new yorks position so often by now some of the troops behind the line had grown used to his presence one made as if to set his watch by douglass how are you this morning uncle another called the negro answered that with a nod and nothing more as usual uncle straddled the line between polite and insulting another us soldier whistled and waved and said good morning to you fred and to you corporal douglass answered this time feeling his face stretch into a broad almost involuntary grin a white man who called him fred might be short on formality but was also short on prejudice douglass reckoned that a fair exchange he was drawing near the front line up into the area where entrenchments seamed kentuckys smooth fields as scars from the lash seamed his own back when an officious provost marshal whom he hadnt seen before challenged him who the devil are you and what business have you got here dont you recognize jefferson davis when you sec him douglass demanded the joke fell flat like most provost marshals this one had no sense of humor douglass produced the letter from captain oliver richardson the soldier read it moving his lips at last reluctantly he returned it to the journalist and stood aside up in the trenches the men of the sixth new york hailed him as an old friend youre a crazy old coot you know that one of them said by way of greeting weve got to be here and you dont but you keep comin anyhow he reckons well keep him safe aaron thats what it is another soldier said looky he aint even carrying his sixshooter no more as you say i am among heroes douglass smiled at the bluecoat who along with his companions hooted and jeered many of them were heroes but they bore that heroism lightly as if mentioning it embarrassed them douglass had stopped wearing a revolver once the line stabilized no longer seeing much likelihood he would need it for selfdefense instead of a colt he pulled out a notebook and what has gone on here since my latest visit snaked a raid over into the rebs trenches yesterday afternoon we did aaron said proudly killed two or three brought back a couple dozen prisoners only had one feller hurt our ownselves well done douglass said and scribbled notes inside though he winced this was what the bold if tardy flank assault had come down to little raids and counterraids that might move the front a few yards one way or the other but meant nothing about when or if the army of the ohio would ever drive the confederates out of louisville douglass listened to the volunteers as they talked excitedly about the raid they were caught up by it because theyd done well in a tiny piece of the war they thought the whole of it was going well douglass had not the heart to disillusion them even had they chosen to listen to him in turn he pressed on up to the foremost trench knowing he would find colonel algernon van nuys there sure enough van nuys squatted by a tiny fire eating hardtack and waiting for his coffee to boil ah mr douglass you come back again the regimental commander said his knees clicked as he straightened up you must be a glutton for punishment here you can prove it have a hardtack with me he offered douglass one of the thick pale crackers why do you hate me so douglass asked which made colonel van nuys laugh accepting the hardtack douglass took a cautious bite when fresh the crackers werent bad by the way this one resisted his teeth it might have been in a warehouse since the war of secession after hed managed to swallow he said do i rightly hear that you poked the rebels yesterday a poke is about what it was a little poke van nuys said with a sour smile he knew too well this wasnt what orlando willcox had intended for the flanking move today tomorrow the next day the rebsll try to poke us back i expect we might as well be playing tag with em no thank you douglass said and the colonel chuckled again van nuys stooped to see how the coffee was doing and as if to confirm his words confederate artillery opened up on the sixth new york now douglass did throw himself flat these shells came crashing down far closer than a couple of hundred yards away fragments scythed through the air above his head hissing like serpents through the din of the shelling the roar of rifle fire also picked up to the firing steps colonel van nuys shouted here they come lets give it to em the sons of bitches a moment later he cried out wordlessly and reeled back into the trench the cry was necessarily wordless for a bullet had shattered his lower jaw tearing away his chin and leaving the rest a red ruin he gobbled something unintelligible at douglass maybe it was i told you so but it could have been tell my wife i love her or anything else then his eyes rolled up in his head and mercifully he swooned his blood pouring out onto the floor of the trench douglass wondered if he would ever wake again with that wound eternal sleep might be a mercy high and shrill rebel yells rang out from the stretch of ground between cs and us trench lines reinforcements douglass shouted we need reinforcements here but no reinforcements came cleverly the confederates were using the artillery bombardment to form a box around the sides and rear of the length of entrenchments they had chosen to attack anyone who tried to get through that bombardment was far likelier to get hit a us soldier a few feet away from douglass fired his springfield one of the rebel yells turned into a scream of a different sort but as the bluecoat was slipping another cartridge into the breech a confederate bullet caught him in the side of the head unlike algernon van nuys he never knew what hit him he slumped to the ground dead before he touched it the rifle fell from his hands almost in front of frederick douglass he grabbed for it wishing it were a carbine whose shorter barrel would have made it easier for him to reverse it and blow out his own brains but all his resolve about not being taken alive came to nothing for a confederate in dirty butternut leaping down into the trench landed on his back pain stabbed through hima broken rib he didnt know he didnt have time to think either come on nigger the reb screamed up out move youre caught or youre a dead man no matter what his head thought douglass body wanted to live however much it hurt he scrambled out of the trench and after getting jabbed in a ham by the confederates bayonet stumbled toward the cs lines a rebel captain was shouting come on you prisoners move move fast when he saw the journalist captured with eight or ten us soldiers his eyes widened good god he said it cant be but it is frederick douglass as i live and breathe the nigger rabblerouser three confederates asked it at once him himthe same the captain had no doubt whatever the soldier whod captured douglass jabbed him again harder lets string the bastard up his friends bayed approval chapter a s the louisville campaign ground on colonel alfred von schlieffen found himself with ever freer access to orlando willcox and to the mapfilled tent where the commander of the army of the ohio planned his operations he found himself less and less happy each time he visited the us general it was too much like having ever freer access to a sickroom where the patient grew visibly more infirm as day followed day brigadier general willcox seemed uneasily aware of the wasting sickness afflicting his campaign aware but doing his best to pretend he wasnt good afternoon colonel he said when he spied schlieffen through the partly open tent fly come in come in ah i see you have coffee very good yes general i have coffee thank you carrying the tin cup stamped usa schlieffen ducked his way into the tent and came over to stand beside willcox the guns in the night were not noisier than usual have i rightno am i right this mistake i make too oftennothing new happened nothing new willcox agreed with a small sigh he stared down at the maps at the blue lines and the red that had moved so much less than hed hoped its always good to see you here colonel i want you to know that you are too kind to a man who is not of your country schlieffen said without looking over at the german military attache general willcox went on you always keep your temper you never judge me my corps commanders my division commanderssometimes this tent gets like a kettle full of live lobsters over the fire but i never hear recriminations from you colonel and if you send telegrams to philadelphia you dont send them to general rosecrans schlieffen hadnt heard the word recriminations before but he didnt bother asking willcox to explain it context made the meaning plain an army that was winning had little backbiting when things went wrong everyone was at pains to prove the misfortune could not possibly have been his fault willcox said tell me what you think of our position at the present time let me examine the map before i answer schlieffen seized without hesitation the chance to think before he spoke he wished he had kurd von schlozers diplomatic talents so he might come somewhere near the truth without destroying the us commanders good opinion of him at last he said i think it now unlikely that you will from the east into louisville break willcox sighed again im afraid i think the same thing although if admit it to anyone but you ill see my head go on a platter faster than john the baptists after herodias daughter danced before king herod we came close ill wager we scared old stonewall out of a years growth but in war the only thing that does any good if its close to where it ought to be but not quite there is an artillery shell that was an effective image schlieffen filed it away to use if and when he had the luck to return to general staff duty in berlin he said in the salient you made with the flanking move you still have most of your men on the line facing louisville and in other places not so many well yes of course i do general willcox replied i have orders that i am still to do everything i can to capture the city and i must obey them if you think you can do this then naturally you are right schlieffen said pleased hed remembered the english idiom this time if you think you cannot do this and you leave your flank as weak as it is the rebs looked to have a weak flank willcox said it got strong a lot faster than we wished it would have and thats the lords truth if the confederates could stop us i reckon well be able to stop them this may well be so but your situation here seems to me not to be the same as that of the confederate states schlieffen said and why not willcox bristled at what was to schlieffen a gentle suggestion of something so obvious a schoolchild should see it patiently the attache spelled it out in words almost literally of one syllable the confederate states had more depth to use than you have now they could halt you for a little while fall back halt you again and so on this is not something you enjoy if they break through your trenches from the south they will go into the rear of the main body of your forces there ah i see what youre saying general willcox was mollified nonetheless he brushed aside schlieffens concern we do have men enough and guns enough to make them pay a high price if they try that myself i dont think theyll do it all their attacks up till now have been aimed at the line closest to louisville someone came into the tent willcox nodded a greeting what is it captain richardson after saluting willcox and politely inclining his head to schlieffen the adjutant answered sir we just got a report that the rebels have raided the stretch of trench the sixth new york was holding after a glance at the map willcox turned triumphantly to schlieffen there do you see they persist in striking us where we are strongest he spun back toward oliver richardson a raid you say they didnt break through did they oh no sir richardson assured him im sorry to say colonel van nuys was killed in the attack but they seemed to be trolling for prisoners more than anything elseand i daresay paying back the sixth for a raid yesterday they captured a few men then withdrew to their own entrenchments why even bring this to my notice then willcox asked he took a longer look at the young captain and why after a raid in which a colonel was killed have you that smirk on your face schlieffen wondered if richardson had an enemy in the sixth new york of whose demise in the raid he had heard the adjutant had sounded properly regretful when reporting colonel van nuys death so schlieffen doubted he was the man if any man there were he would not have wanted an officer who gloated at a comrades death on his staff by the building anger on willcoxs round face the commander of the army of the ohio felt the same way and then captain richardson said sir you must know that frederick douglass has made the sixth new york his pet regiment and also the horse on which he mounts all his complaints about the manner in which you have conducted this campaign he was with them today i gave him a letter authorizing a river crossing this morning and i have reports sir that he was among those whom the confederates captured in this raid ah schlieffen said a short involuntary exclamation his opinion of captain richardson recovered to some small degree disliking a reporter to the point of enjoying his misfortune was a lesser matter than similarly disliking a fellow officer and richardson had made no secret of his distaste for douglass though schlieffen could not understand what aside from being a negro douglass had done to deserve it good god willcox exclaimed taking a point that had eluded the german douglass has been a thorn in the slaveholders side since long before the war of secession what will the confederates do to the poor man if he has been so unfortunate as to fall into their hands i dont know sir but my bet would be that they dont do anything good yes richardson sounded delighted at douglass discomfiture english lacked the word schadenfreude but not the idea behind it men being the sinful creatures they were no nation schlieffen was sure lacked that idea he said but is he not protected from mistreatment as a civilian citizen of the united states the confederate states seldom feel obliged to recognize any black mans rights of any sort willcox said you ask me sir theyve got the right idea too richardson said if it hadnt been for the niggers abe lincoln never would have been elected president and we never would have fought the war of secession in the first place never would have lost it either how does the second statement follow from the first schlieffen asked the only answer richardson gave him was a dirty look that made him realize hed been less than diplomatic he wasnt so upset as he might have been failures in logic distressed him he rejected unclear thinking as automatically as he breathed most disturbing orlando willcox said most disturbing indeed i shall pray for douglass safety and eventual liberation however unlikely i fear that may prove ill pray too richardson said ill pray may god have mercy on his soul he laughed a nasty laugh that will be quite enough of that captain willcox said as sharply as alfred von schlieffen had ever heard him speak the german military attache frowned not understanding why richardson s prayer was offensive seeing as much general willcox explained colonel thats what the judge in an american court says after he sentences a prisoner to death ach so schlieffen murmured truly praying for god to have mercy was one thing a prayer any christian ought to be glad to make or to have made for him praying for a man to be condemned to death was something else again willcox had been right to rebuke his adjutant richardson came to attention saluted did a smart aboutturn and left the tent with precisely machined steps that was exactly what a german officer similarly rebuked yet still feeling himself to be correct would have done the only difference schlieffen could see was that the americans did not include a heelclick as part of coming to attention willcox drew in a deep breath held it and let it out in a long sigh hes an able young man colonel he said as if schlieffen had denied it hes justunreasonable on the whole negro question many in the united states are is this not so schlieffen said it is true almost as much in the united states as in the confederate states yes mm not so bad as that id say willcox replied on the other hand one man in three in the csa is a negro near enough and we have only a relative handful of colored people in the usa so white men here have less to get exercised about a lot of folks do wish though we had no negroes among us i cant deny that this is foolishness schlieffen said never for a moment thinking of the polish peasants his ancestors had subjugated to help make prussia the power that would reshape the german reich i think so myself willcox spread his hands palms up not everyone agrees with me though and youd be hard pressed to say my adjutant is wrong in one regard absent the negro i believe the united states would still remain one nation today i understand this reason for resenting negroes schlieffen said but if negroes were not resented before your war of secession for other reasons there would have been no war is this not true and these other reasons i must say i do not understand its a hard business that it is general willcox said which most likely meant he didnt understand it either as if to confirm that he changed the subject i fear captain richardson is right in thinking it will be a hard business for frederick douglass too if he is mistreated will the united states avenge themselves by mistreating confederate prisoners in their hands schlieffen asked this is excuse me for saying it an ugly way to make war so it isor so it would be at any rate willcox answered as for what will happen colonel schlieffen i just dont know and have no way to guess right now id say it lies in the hands of godand of the confederate states general thomas jackson looked as dour as usual while studying the situation map of his twofront battle in and east of louisville but his heart sang within him i truly do believe we have nothing more to fear from the army of the ohio he said i think youre right sir e porter alexander agreed with a boyish grin been a hard fightthey are brave even if their officers could be betterbut i dont really see how they can surprise us now thats why they fight wars general alexander to discover how the other fellow can surprise you when jackson essayed a joke he was in good humor indeed more seriously he went on in my view however you are correct do not think they can break free of their present lines and the cost of containing them within those lines appears acceptable that being said will you take some supper with me id be delighted sir so long as you let me put mustard on my meat alexander said grinning still such sauces are unhealthy jackson insisted his artillery chef looked eloquently unconvinced jackson yielded as he would not have on the battlefield have it your way general you see i refuse you nothing laughing the two men started out of the tent had alexander not teased jackson they would have been gone when the messenger came rushing in instead he almost ran into themhe almost ran over them as a matter of fact general jackson sir he gasped theyve capturedyoull never guess who theyve captured sir hes on his way here now not that far behind me he was so excited he didnt notice hed failed to give jackson the name who is on his way here now the confederate generalinchief inquired by the way you sound young man it might be general willcox himself even bettern that sir the messenger answered chortling with glee they just captured frederick douglass his own self you dont mean it e porter alexander exclaimed that was foolishness the messenger obviously did mean it alexander turned to look at jackson jackson was already looking at alexander the same thought had to be uppermost in both their minds alexander spat it out first we couldnt get a hotter potato right out of the fire sir what in blazes do we do with him i dont know jackson briefly felt all at sea this was not the sort of decision he was supposed to have to make as soon as that thought crossed his mind he knew what needed doing stepping back into the tent he walked over to the telegraphers table i am going to wire president longstreet requesting instructions this is more a political than a military matter and beyond my sphere of competence he dictated a brief telegram then turned back to the messenger you said douglass is being brought here yes sir the man answered i had better stay and await him then general alexander you may go and eat your mustard without me sir by your leave i wouldnt miss this for the world alexander said its almost like having the antichrist walk into the tent isnt it i had not thought of it in those terms but you are not far wrong jackson agreed he nodded to an orderly bring back supper for two corporalno for three douglass will be hungry too no doubt and bring back as well a pot of mustard for general alexander since he will have it after that there was nothing to do but wait the orderly returned with three full plates a mustard pot and three cups of coffee jackson and alexander were still wondering whether to begin on their own meals when the tent flap opened and frederick douglass walked in ahead of a couple of grinning young soldiers with bayoneted tredegars i thank you for delivering your present lads jackson told them i believe we shall be able to protect ourselves from him henceforward go on back to your regiment now saluting they obeyed frederick douglass was staring at him the negromulatto actually by his lookswas a fine figure of a man despite dishevelment and obvious dismay you are stonewall jackson he said his voice deep and rich his accent that of an educated man of the united states with only the slightest hint of something else something softer underneath i am jackson admitted he pointed to the food the orderly had just brought will you join general alexander here and me for supper to his surprise douglass burst out laughing i beg your pardon general he said checking himself after a moment but seeing you i feel rather as if i have been ushered into the presence of the antichrist in that presence the last thing i expected was a supper invitation jackson said you may be interested to know that not fifteen minutes before your arrival general alexander compared your coming to that of the antichrist to the unrighteous the righteous no doubt seem wicked douglass replied you are not the least bold of men to say such a thing here jackson observed more approvingly than otherwise e porter alexander caught something he had missed who here is righteous who the reverse and how do you go about proving it he held up a hand since we could argue about that through the night what say we dont but eat supper instead i find myself unable to oppose such logic especially when i but recently thought a noose my certain fate douglass said jackson contented himself with a single short sharp nod a couple of minutes later general alexander said do you see sir douglass is among the righteous after allfor he eats mustard his digestion would be better if he abstained said jackson who as usual used only salt on his meat frederick douglass looked from one of them to the other unsure how serious they were jackson willed his face to reveal nothing only when his artillery chief smiled did the captured negro agitator relax after all three men had finished douglass asked the question no doubt uppermost in his mind since hed entered the tentno doubt uppermost in his mind since he was taken prisoner what do you intend to do with me general hold you here until i have received instructions from president longstreet jackson answered then follow them whatever they may be he cocked his head to one side raised his arm in the air and asked in turn what would you have us do with you what would i have you do douglass said why release me of course i am a us citizen and a civilian member of the fourth estate you are i have heard an escaped slave jackson remarked douglass scowled i am an escaped slave he said proudly but i escaped from maryland which is and has always been one of the united states not a confederate state so your cruel laws pertaining to such conduct are without application to my case further on payment of the sum of one hundred dollars my former master formally manumitted me in december of the year proof of which i can readily provide if allowed to communicate in any way with my friends i am sir a free man both in my heart and in point of law you are the cause of more runaways and the wellspring of more plots against the white men of the confederate states than any other half dozen people i could name e porter alexander said thank you douglass replied which nonplussed the artillerist douglass added you are telling me i have not lived my life as a free man in vain why should we not condemn you for attempting to create a servile insurrection of the sort john brown tried raising jackson asked i advised brown against that brave patriot though i thought himand still think him douglass said with a defiant toss of his head as for why you should not i told you i do not fall and have never fallen under your jurisdiction i have broken none of my nations laws if you declare me persona non grata and deport me you would be within your rights condemn me no not if you wish to adhere to the law of nations jackson leaned forward relishing the argument but uprisen slaves have committed many outrages in the confederate states some of them citing you as the author of their discontent in war shall i shoot the simpledminded soldier who goes over the hill as a deserter while taking no notice of the wily civilian who induces him to desert your case strikes me as similar how can it douglass raised his impressive eyebrows do you not aim to keep your negroes in such abysmal ignorance that they are not allowed to learn to read and write lest the written word lead them to the desire for freedom how then could your servile populace come to know my words since assuredly i have never given an address within confederate territory we instruct them in the things that matter jackson said why i myself began and taught a sunday school for the negroes in and around lexington virginia before the war of secession they are in my view perhaps not the regulars of the church but they assuredly make up the militia douglass started to say something then stopped he resumed after an evident pause for thought i have come to see over the years that few men are entirely of a piece i did not know you had done such a thing general it shall redound to your credit on the day when our father judges you how can you though justify the manifold evils of slavery while preaching the gospel that sets all men free as you must know the good book sanctions slavery jackson replied if providence sanctions it who am i to speak in opposition i do believe negro slaves to be children of god no less than myself and deserving of good treatment you might be wiser from a masters point of view if you did not douglass observed a slave who has a bad master wants a good master a slave who has a good master wants to be free are you not betraying slaves secrets to tell us this porter alexander asked douglass shook his leonine head a bad master does not become a good one at the pull of a lever nor does a good one easily go bad that can and does happen as i know to my pain but slowly over years one of the telegraph keys in the tent began to chatter everyone whirled to stare at it when it fell silent the telegrapher carried the transcription of the wire over to jackson douglass eyes followed the mans every step jackson read the telegram then smiled a crooked smile anticlimax i fear he said general alexander some of the new shipment of horses that will haul your guns has arrived im relieved to hear it the artillery commander glanced over at frederick douglass rather more so than our guest i daresay i am not your guest unless i misunderstand and am in fact free to come and go as i please douglass snapped i am your prisoner yes you are a prisoner jackson minced few words and appreciated candor in others whether you will remain a prisoner and upon what termsthese matters await president longstreets decision porter alexander raised an eyebrow i stand corrected our distinguished prisoner i should have said or perhaps our notorious prisoner no distinguished will do for were you not distinguished douglass were you say an ordinary white yankee it is moderately unlikely that you should have taken supper with the generalinchief of the confederate states a beat slower than he might have jackson caught the irony there it won a smile from frederick douglass too a sour smile i note general alexander that however distinguished i may be in your eyes and those of general jackson i am not distinguished enough for either of you to preface my name with mister jackson blinked it never occurred to me to do so he said to the best of my recollection i have never called a negro mister in my entire life that in itself speaks unhappy volumes on the history of my race in what are now the confederate states douglass said bitterly and i note in the united states as well another telegraph apparatus began to click this is the reply from the president sir said the soldier at the chair in front of it like every telegrapher he enjoyed the privilege of learning the content of the message before it reached the man to whom it was addressed when the clicking stopped he brought the wire to jackson who donned his reading glasses and skimmed through it longstreet made his instructions unmistakably clear jackson turned to douglass by order of the president of the confederate states you are to be turned over to us military authorities under flag of truce as soon as that may be arranged you are to be freely given to those us authorities no exchange of any confederate prisoner now in us hands is to be required or requested until such time as you are turned over to the us authorities you are to be treated with every consideration is that satisfactory he hesitated but the president had said every consideration and he was not a man to disobey orders he began again is that satisfactory mr douglass the negros eyes widened he recognized what jackson had done ever so slightly he inclined his head to the confederate generalinchief it is more generous than i had dared hope as soon as my identity was known to my captors i thought a rope hoisted over a tree branch my likeliest fate an apprehension of which they did little to disabuse me i know your opinion of me here not far removed from your opinion of us general alexander remarked perhaps douglass shoved that aside with one word his features took on a look of intense concentration president longstreet is a clever politician he realizes where many in his position would not that harming me would in the end also harm the reputation of your country even more and refrains from taking the brief pleasure that hanging me would bring his shoulders hunched and slumped as he sighed president longstreet is a clever politician jackson agreed he eyed douglass and you sir every consideration unless i find myself badly mistaken are at the moment somewhat dismayed that you shall not make your cause a martyr after all i cannot contest the charge douglass said and yet i should also be lying were i to claim that i am not glad to go on living and even more so to be restored to liberty having lived without it more than twenty years i know how dear it is at dawn tomorrow shall send an officer under flag of truce to arrange for your return to the united states jackson said i delay only because a flag of truce may not be recognized at night and would not willingly expose a man to danger thus i understand douglass turned his dark clever eyes on jackson tell me general what would you have done with me absent president longstreets instructions since i did not know what to do with you i asked for those instructions jackson answered it was an evasion and he knew as much to his relief frederick douglass did not press him on it cananea baked in the mexican sun no sooner had that thought crossed jeb stuarts mind than he rejected it sonora now being part of the csa cananea baked in the confederate sun the stars and bars hung limp from a flagpole in the middle of town the tents of the confederate army and its apache allies vastly outnumbered the squalid adobe houses that made up the miserable little place water mirages danced and shimmered on the desert stuart knew they werent real they were amazingly convincing though someone thirsty who hadnt seen them before would surely have chased them till he perished or realized that like willsothewisp they endlessly receded before him and were not worth pursuing major horatio sellers walked up beside stuart good morning sir hmm oh good morning major stuart answered a little sheepishly im sorry i was looking at the mirages and not thinking about very much of anything if you hadnt come along the buzzards probably would have picked me up and carried me off in an hour or two really sir sellers looked surprised i would have guessed you were thinking about your son captain stuart do you mean the commander of the department of the transmississippi smiled if hes not the youngest captain in the history of the confederate army ill be everlastingly surprised what i should be is jealous i wasnt even at west point at his age let alone winning battlefield promotions war will give a push to things that would have happened more slowly without it his aidedecamp said sellers suddenly looked as if hed bitten down on a lemon without seeing any more than that stuart understood what it meant sure enough geronimo and chappo silently came up to stand beside the two confederate soldiers their soft moccasins were far better suited to quiet movement than the boots stuart and sellers wore as always geronimo greeted stuart as an equal that bothered the general less than the impression he got that geronimo was stretching a point to do so through chappo the medicine man said is it true your son is now a warrior i have heard this from my men who have some english it is true stuart agreed gravely your son chappo here fought well against the yankees in new mexico territory my son who is chappos age and has the same name i do fought well against the yankees in a land called kentucky far from here for boys to become men is good geronimo said your son i hear did something very brave something very fine what is it the yankees were attacking stuart answered and all the officers of higher rank in his regiment were killed or wounded that was oversimplifying but the indian wouldnt know the difference and explaining it struck stuart as more trouble than it was worth he took charge of the regiment and fought back against the yankees and stopped their attack after that was translated geronimo and chappo went back and forth for a couple of minutes as if the old man was making sure he understood correctly then he said but your son with only chappos yearshow did the other soldiers the men who were soldiers for a long time how did they obey him they were already men and he a boy in his first fight not so yes stuart said but he had higher rankagain oversimplifyingand so they had to obey foolish to make men who have been in many fights obey a boy in his first he might lead them wrongly geronimo said under normal circumstances he would have had a point circumstances where jeb jr was hadnt been normal and realizing he might have been tactless the indian added but this is your son and he did well in the fight you say this is good a father is always glad when his son grows up well he set a hand on chappos shoulder to show that he too had a son of whom he was proud they would have gone on but the alcalde of cananea came up and waited for stuart to notice him senor salazar was a roundbellied little man who wore a dirty red sash of office over a black jacket ruffled shirt and tight trousers that had all seen better days yes sir what is it stuart asked him respecting the dignity of his office salazar fortunately spoke fair english the us border lay only a few miles to the north can i talk wit you general by yourself his black eyes flicked to geronimo and chappo the apaches stuart had discovered frightened the whey out of him and out of everybody in cananea the farmers had scarcely dared work their parched meager fields since maximilians national guards withdrew in the wake of the confederate occupation geronimo sent senor salazar the sort of look a coyote gave a pork chop which did nothing for the alcaldes composure stuart had mercy on the petty official well yes senor i suppose so he stepped a few paces away from the two indians salazar followed with obvious relief geronimo and chappo both frowned though their unhappy expressions did not make stuart start to turn to jelly as they did with salazar the confederate officer understood why the apaches were unhappy the alcalde made major horatio sellers seem as if he were on the indians side salazar not only feared the apaches he hated them with a latin passion beside which sellers feeling toward them hardly rated more than the name of mild distaste he would have slaughtered them all if he could he only hated them the more because he couldnt to forestall him stuart said do hope you will remember the apaches arc our allies oh si general stuart i remember this salazars eyes flashed he might remember but he didnt like it for hell he needed a deliberate effort of will to set aside his anger stuart watched him make it like ocean waves with oil poured over them his face smoothed i dont want to talk about no apaches thats good stuart said equably what do you want to talk about then we have a ball tonight salazar said to commence when the sun go down we have dancing and music and good food and mescal you do us the honor to come you and so many officers from your countryofficers from this country now i should sayyou want to bring if cananca boasted good food stuart had yet to see it the locals mostly ate atole a cornmeal gruel that reminded him of library paste sometimes they enlivened it with chilies that would have made a man sweat at the north pole let alone in the middle of the sonoran desert as for mescal it gave the vilest north carolina moonshine a run for its money major sellers swore the mexicans distilled the stuff from kerosene but that oath came the morning after a night of copious indulgence as much as anything else curiosity impelled stuart to say thank you very much senor salazar my men and i will be there wickedly he added does your generous invitation also extend to the leaders of the indians maybe we do that salazar said but he made no effort to hide his scorn for the apaches we do it before we get them plenty drunk get them loco with mescal then kill all we can we do it three four times every few years stupid apaches come every time they like to drink plenty mescal and you wonder why the ones you dont kill want to kill you stuart said the alcaldes answering shrug was as old as time whether mexicans had first wronged apaches or apaches mexicans no longer mattered much each side had been going after the other for so long the csa would need lots of years or lots of troops or more likely both to bring firm order here you will come and not the indians senor salazar persisted we will come and not the indians stuart agreed salazar bowed stiffly from the waist and departed as soon as he was gone geronimo and chappo hurried up to stuart what did he want geronimo demanded stuart could hear the hard suspicion underlying the apache words even before chappo translated that man is a rattlesnake in stupid mexican clothes he would murder every one of us if he had the way and the courage to do it that being obviously true stuart ignored it what he said had nothing to do with you he answered which wasnt true but would keep the lid on the kettle he invited me and some of my officers to a ball in town tonight ah geronimo said when that was translated he knew what a ball was and what accompanied it mescal longing filled his voice he ran his tongue over his lips stuart hadnt altogether believed senor salazars claim that the apaches would frequently come into town for ardent spirits and lay themselves open to massacre the warriors hed seen in action had appeared too levelheaded for that now he decided the alcalde had been telling nothing but the truth the explanation did satisfy the old medicine man and his son to stuarts relief they didnt seek to invite themselves to the ball the commander of the transmississippi had no trouble finding enthusiastic celebrants among his officers those who held a high opinion of senoritas were eager to dance and drink with them those who held a low opinion were even more eager at the appointed hour stuart led his contingent of officers into cananeas central square an orchestra of two drums two fiddles and an accordion greeted them with a squeaky rendition of what about threequarters of the way through the piece stuart recognized as dixie it was in its way a compliment so was the roast pork basted in a red no doubt fiery sauce and so was the tumbler of mescal senor salazar pressed into stuarts hand the alcalde was armed with a similar tumbler he raised it to the confederate states of america he said in english and spanish he gulped down half his tumbler stuart had to follow suit he felt as if a shell had exploded in his stomach his eyes crossed his ears rang dimly he realized he had to offer a return toast he wondered if he could still talk duty required him to make the effort to sonora and to cananea he croaked and everyone within six inches of him could hear his voice he tried it again and succeeded in making himself understood the second time the cananeans burst into applause stuart drank the rest of the tumbler that he didnt fall over proved he was made of stern stuff your glass is empty salazar said sympathetically he filled it from an earthenware jug stuart stared glassyeyed the mescal didnt seem to bother the alcalde food helped the sauce on the pork was as spicy as it smelled it started a fire of its own in stuarts belly and seemed to counteract the fire from the firewater he ate bread too hoping it would help absorb some of the second tumbler of mescal disappointingly few senoritas were in evidence the band thumped out something that might have been a dance tune or an improvisation whatever it was people started dancing to it about seven out of eight were men nobody cared much after more mescal flowed nobody cared at all in the middle of a quadrille with the colonel of the fifth confederate cavalry stuart said if a horse danced the way you do theyd shoot it if a camel danced the way you do theyd shoot it retorted colonel calhoun ruggles who when it came to camels knew whereof he spoke being considerably elevated by mescal he needed a moment to remember proper military courtesy sir after a while stuart decided to take a blow while he leaned against an adobe wall and watched his officers and the cananeans cavorting senor salazar tapped him on the shoulder the alcalde swayed where he stood by now whatever his capacity hed illuminated himself even more generously than the confederates but he spoke with great earnestness do you know general those indios will take your guns and take your bullets and go up into the sierra madrehe pointed west then correcting himself eastand they be bandidos there they go up there they be bandidos forever they can be bandidos against the united states stuart said they wont be bandidos against your people any more maybe you are right quien sabe the alcalde smiled a sweet sad drunk smile but if you are right then the estados unidos his english was slippingwill get indios to be bandidos against us it will be the same in the end for us it is siempre the same in the end how many years of disastersand how many tumblers of mescal went into that resignation stuart shook his head which was beginning to throb it wont be the same any more youre in the confederate states of america now youre going places and youd better believe it the only place the alcalde was going was to sleep his eyes closed he sagged against the wall and slumped to the ground jeb stuart laughed five minutes later he joined senor salazar well colonel henry welton said i trust your stay in fort benton and also in great falls has been a pleasant one yes sir thank you very much theodore roosevelt answered pleasant in ways i couldnt have anticipated when you ordered me down from my regimental headquarters as a matter of fact colonel welton grinned a sly grin when i ordered you down you thought you were coming for nothing but work thats true sir roosevelt said but its not precisely what i meant the usual pleasures of fort benton and even of great falls are easily named saloons dance halls bathtubs with hot water a couple of other pleasures were easily named too but he declined to name them hot water yes henry welton nodded you do miss it in the field but roosevelt hadnt finished as i say sir those are the usual pleasures the commonplace pleasures hearing abe lincoln speak though that i had not looked for and i expect ill remember it all my days after he finished you and he were going at it hammer and tongs there for a while henry welton said you made him stop and be thoughtful once or twice too he chuckled you make everybody you meet stop and be thoughtful seems to me twentytwoyou ought to be illegal twentythree soon sir roosevelt said with a grin which made welton grimace and mime pathetic decrepitude roosevelt went on plainly lincoln has a faction that will heed him in all he says as plainly there is a large faction that will not heed him in anything he says he laughed he has me speaking like him even yethe is a demon on the stump but both those factions i mentioned have their homes in the republican party it could split on account of him it could split if we lose this war too welton replied which was plain common sense of course if we lose this war not enough men will admit to being republicans for it to matter much whether the party splits or not these things do matter sirthey always matter roosevelt said seriously look what happened when the democrats like gaul were divided in partes tres in had that not happened the united states might well be the only nation lying between canada and the empire of mexico maybe youre right im just a soldier and soldiers are better off not meddling in politics welton said if we hadnt already learned that lesson the war of secession would have driven it home like a schoolmaster with a hickory switch he slapped roosevelt on the back here come the stablehands with your horse colonel have a safe trip back to the unauthorized regiment and i hope to see you again before too long likewise whether here or in the field roosevelt said and thanks to your generous permission i will be sending a troop here for rest and recreation as soon as i can draft the orders that will be fine colonel welton said i do very much approve of an officer who looks out for the wellbeing of his men roosevelt mounted and rode out of fort benton pausing in the gateway to wave back at welton his mount which had done next to nothing since hed come down to fort benton felt lively almost electric under him he had to hold the animal under tight rein to keep its trot from exploding into a gallop easy old fellow easy he said patting the horse on the neck weve got a long road ahead if you go too fast now youll wear yourself down to a nub long before we get there the horse didnt want to listen to him it wanted to run roosevelt laughed as the fort disappeared behind a swell of prairie he was the same way when anyone told him to slow down he generally went faster and not a man in the world had the right to rein him in he checked himself that wasnt quite true military discipline did for him what reins did for the horse without it he would have charged into canada by now but the cases werent identical hed submitted to military discipline of his own free will the horse didnt have a choice jackrabbits bounded over the plains sensibly taking no chances on whether he might try to shoot them if they stayed around to watch him ride by he didnt need to bother with jackrabbits not today not with freshbaked bread and several chunks of fried chicken in his saddlebag if he spied a herd of pronghorns on his way north though he saw some antelope off in the distance but too far off for him to bother chasing them welton had sent a courier up to the headquarters of the unauthorized regiment letting lieutenant jobst and the rest of the men know he would be spending some time at fort benton he couldnt help feeling hed been away too long one thing he emphatically did not want was for his regiment to discover it could get along just as well without him walk canter trot walk canter trot mile after mile of prairie unrolled behind him more miles lay ahead the horse was still willing but no longer eager roosevelt rode north by the sun and by his compass not nearly enough horsemen had traveled back and forth between fort benton and his headquarters to wear even the beginnings of a trail into the grass walk canter trot every hour or so he gave his mount a few minutes rest and let it snatch at clumps of grass the grass was still green it wouldnt stay green forever nor even much longer winter came early to montana territory just as it left late blaine had rejected the confederates peace offer well and good despite that though roosevelt still hadnt been able to do any fighting if the damned british didnt get moving or if his own orders didnt change he wouldnt be able to start till spring when he came to the marias river he stowed the compass in his saddlebag he wouldnt need it any more he rode northwest along the southern bank of the river till he came to a ford with the water so low in summer that didnt take long his boots stayed dry while his horse splashed across no steamboat had ever made it up the marias and i know steamboats he told the horse that can pour a barrel of beer into a dry riverbed and make fifty miles on the suds the horse snorted he couldnt tell whether it was derision or appreciation he rode up the northern fork of the marias which was the willow almost there now he told the horse as the sun sank toward the rockies the horse didnt answer not this time it had worked hard all day he patted its neck come onnot much farther he strayed away from the riverbank after dark and almost rode past the camp the night was mildmilder than the past few had beenand the men had let the fires die back to embers he spied their red glow off to his left only a moment before a challenge came out of the night halt who goes there hello johnny he answered recognizing the sentrys voice its colonel roosevelt back from fort benton advance and be recognized colonel johnny unger said playing the game by the rules his voice held a grin though as roosevelt rode slowly forward he whistled to the next nearest sentry and called hey seanthe old mans come back from town bully sean said neither of their voices would have disturbed the men sleeping back at regimental headquarters a booted foot crunched a twig johnny unger materialized one moment invisible the next standing right beside roosevelt yes sir its you all right he said and chuckled go on in did you do the trip in one day or stretch it out over two started this morning roosevelt answered never waste time johnny its the one thing in the whole wide world you cant get back yes sir the sentry said if youve been riding that horse all day i was just thinking hell need more seeing to than if youd done it the easy way ill tend to him never fear roosevelt said he asked for very few of the privileges to which his rank might have entitled him when the sentry vanished once more roosevelt rode the beast into camp he poked and fed one of the fires up to brighter life so he could see what he was doing as he brushed down the horse and checked its hooves one of them had a pebble caught in the horseshoe he dug it out with a curved steel pick the beast couldnt have had it long or it would have started favoring that leg roosevelt tried to be as quiet as he could but a couple of men sat up in their bedrolls to see what was going on good to have you back colonel one of them said softly roosevelt waved and went back to work after an hour or so the horse was settled roosevelt patted him one last time then got out his blanket wrapped himself up in it like a papoose and fell asleep even while still wriggling around to get comfortable he woke with the sun shining in his face the smell of coffee in the air and first lieutenant karl jobst standing only a couple of feet away good morning sir jobst said while roosevelt stretched and yawned by what the courier had to say you found yourself a livelier time than you looked for when you went down to fort benton thats nothing but the truth roosevelt said i rode down to great falls with colonel wclton as youll have heard to listen to abe lincoln very fine speakerno two ways about thatbut he spouts nonsense nothing but socialistic nonsense let him rave i say if he keeps at it hell split the republican party right down the middle or im a dutchman uh sir you are a dutchman jobst pointed out of german blood himself he got called a dutchman a lot but roosevelt was the genuine article proves my point doesnt it roosevelt said gleefully as he got to his feet over coffee and hardtack and antelope he asked anything new on patrol thats worth hearing no sir his adjutant answered all routine no i take that back somebody in d troop got bitten by a rattlesnake but its not a bad bite and theyre pretty sure hell pull through im glad to hear itnot that he got bitten but that we wont lose him the rattlesnakes north of the border arc quiet though when jobst nodded roosevelt went on in that case he set out the scheme for leave colonel welton had accepted karl jobst blinked plainly such an idea would never have occurred to him once he heard it he liked it what a clever notion sir youre rightim sure it will have a tonic effect on the mens spirits ill draft the necessary orders roosevelt said jobst looked slightly miffed a lot of regimental commanders would have let him do the job everything roosevelt could do himself he did do himself inside of an hour one courier was on his way to a troop announcing a weeks leave for its men and another to b troop ordering it to stretch out to cover the ground a troop would be clearing half an hour after that another courier rode into regimental headquarters at a pounding gallop roosevelt s farmhand esau hunt who was serving in b troop boss he shouted and then remembering himself colonel roosevelt sir the limeys are over the border sir whole great big column of em crossed yesterday we took a few shots at em but they got a hell of a lot more men than we do theodore roosevelt stared briefly speechless all leaves cancelled he murmured half a moment later he was bellowing for couriers at the top of his lungs some to concentrate his regiment and set it in motion against the british another to ride down to fort benton and bring the rest of the army the news that done he threw back his head and laughed out loud god delivered the midianites into gideons hands and he has delivered the british into mine he raised his voice to a great shout for the lord and for gideon colonel george custer had a splendid view of the hanging of the mormon traitors in front of fort douglas but could not watch it so closely as he should have liked he was too busy keeping an eye on the crowd that pressed up against the restraining rope a couple of hundred yards from the gallows be ready men he called to his gatlinggun crews if anyone crosses that barrier we are to open fire without warning and without mercy the scoops know as much they had betterweve warned them often enough the mormons were splendidly lawabidingexcept when their church elders led them astray if john taylor who remained at large wanted martyrs in large numbers he would have them the believers were likelier to heed his admonitions than those of the hated us army well get em sir sergeant buckley said and the other gunners nodded they were not alone out there riflemen stood between the gatlings and several cannon shotted with canister bore on the crowd custer wished the gatlings werent there at all their absence would have let him pay more attention to the mormons getting what they deserved but general pope had assigned him the miserable gadgets and so he had to make the best of it softly his brother tom said here they come autie and indeed out through the gate guarded and led by more soldiers with springfields came george q cannon orson pratt a mormon apostle named daniel wells cannons brother whose christian nameif mormons first names deserved that description custer had never bothered to learn and two other leaders of the latterday saints their hands were bound behind them john pope followed in dress uniform none of the mormons hesitated in mounting the thirteen steps to the multiple gallows their steps were firm and sure each leader took his place at a noose beside which stood a hangman in a black hoodpope sensibly did not want the grimly silent crowd to be able to recognize the executioners each hangman offered his mormon a hood without eyeholes wells cannons brother and one of the men whose names custer had not noted accepted pratt george cannon and the other stranger refused the hangmen set the nooses around the mormons necks in a voice just loud enough for custer to hear orson pratt asked general pope may i speak to my people one last time i give you my sacred oath the words shall be of reconciliation not of strife custer turned his head and watched pope mull he would have said no but pope answered speak then be brief though and remember that your people shall answer if you betray them into madness i remember and i thank you pratt said quietly still the saltsmelling breeze ruffled his bushy white beard he cried out to the throng who believed as he did my brethren my friends i leave you today for a better world to come and give you these words from the second book of nephi as my parting gift o then if i have seen so many great things if the lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy why should my heart leap and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow and my flesh waste away and my strength slacken because of mine afflictions and why should yield to sin because of my flesh yea why should i give way to temptations that the evil one have placed in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul why am i angry because of mine enemy awake my soul no longer droop in sin rejoice o my heart and give place no more for the enemy of my soul do not anger again because of mine enemies he bowed his hoary head amen george cannon cried amen the other mormon leaders echoed more quietly amen it rippled through the crowd along with the sound of weeping he kept his word tom custer murmured his voice more serious than was his wont thats not the worst prayer i ever heard either it is nothing but a mockery and an imitation of the good book george custer remained unmoved so did brigadier general john pope these men have been convicted of treason and insurrection against the united states of america he declared in a shout that would have been huge had it not followed orson pratts for their crimes i under the authority given me by president james g blaine have sentenced them to death by hanging president blaine having reviewed and confirmed these sentenceshe raised his right hand high in the airlet the punishment be carried out the hand dropped so did the traps beneath the six condemned mormons as the hangmen worked their levers so did the mormons bodies custer heard neck bones snap the men whod tied the hangmans nooses had known their business the bodies kicked and spasmed briefly then were still no one surged forward out of the crowd the sound of weeping grew louder shame someone shouted in an instant men and women alike took up the call shame shame shame it washed over the soldiers and their weapons and the military governor of utah territory and the gallows and the bodies dangling from it for a quarter of an hour the mormons repeated their oneword answer to what they had just witnessed john pope had grit he walked out in front of his men advancing on the rope barrier till he was within easy pistol range of the crowd that hated him he raised his hand as he had done to order the executioners to ready themselves hear me he shouted people of utah hear me and the people did grant him something close to quiet go home all is over here live in peace and obey the laws and authority of the united states of america go home some of the mormons kept on calling shame more though began the walk back down to salt lake city little by little the crowd melted away tom custer whistled softly we got by with it autie i was a long way from sure we would so was i custer didnt know whether to be relieved the mormons had not erupted at the execution of their leaders or disappointed the us army had not had the chance to teach them precisely how much rebellion could cost by the expression on popes face the military governor was contemplating the horns of the same dilemma six traitors dead he said walking up to custer apparently choosing to look on the bright side he added god grant the rest learn their lesson yes sir custer looked back toward the gallows they died well he shrugged to show how little that mattered to him redskins die well too in my view the mormons arc about as fanatical as the sioux and the kiowa and in mine as well pope took off his plumed hat and mopped his forehead with a linen handkerchief i took a chance with that rascal pratt and i know it but i reckoned he couldnt make things much worse and might make them better and his fanaticism i have seen includes a fanatical truthfulness it worked out well sir custer was not about to criticize a superior to his face especially not after that superior had scored a success what he said to libbic come evening was liable to be something else again he thought of katie fitzgerald of her mouth of her breasts of her coppery bush ever so slightly he shook his head no matter how much of a tigress katie was between the sheets he was glad his wife had come to fort douglas he could unburden himself to her as to no one else on earth pope pointed to the limp bodies swaying in the breeze well have to cut that carrion down and bury it i dont fancy giving the bodies back to the mormons so they can riot at a funeral where they didnt at the hanging thatsvery clever sir custer said and meant it worrying about the funeral would never have entered his mind he turned to the eight gatlinggun crews men you have helped keep order in utah territory the united states are in your debt well said colonel pope agreed that goes for all of us here we have subdued this territory and we are reducing it to obedience and we have done it with a minimum of bloodshed and with no need to summon excessive forces away from the armies in the field against the confederate states i wish i were serving in an army in the field against the confederate states custer said so do i pope replied we also serve here however i remind myself of this daily and were i facing the rebels should not have had the opportunity after all these years to pay abe lincoln back at least in part for the bitter lot he imposed upon me and rendered far more bitter by the fact that my sacrifice was made in vain but i am in some measure avenged for my exile to minnesota i wish hed tried to tread the air with the mormons here today custer said from what i hear he continues to spread trouble wherever he goes you know we are also in complete agreement on that score pope said but being soldiers we can only obey the orders we receive from the duly constituted civil authorities he cocked his head to one side it is a pity isnt it yes sir it is custer said i was general mcclellans man during the war of secession and you of course were anything but yet all soldiers who served during that unhappy time cannot possibly have any other view of honest abe he freighted the title with as much contempt as it would bear pope set a hand on his shoulder since coming to utah we have proved to be in harmony on more than that view alone colonel you have carried out my wishes in a fashion with which i can not only find no fault but which pleases me very highly indeed and i have so stated in my reports at every opportunity thank you sir custer said joyfully when he told libbie about it at supper that evening she beamed too thats splendid news autie she said of course you deserve it but a man does not always get what he deserves her lip curled as you said lincoln is the chiefest example there yes custer cut a piece off his beefsteak and tossed it up in the air stonewall caught it before it touched the ground gulped it down and barked for more later boy his master told him custer patted the dogs head to his wife he went on i always marvel at how you manage to move everything we have beasts and all without missing a beat your duty is to be a soldier autie my duty is to keep an eye on you and one way or another i do it if libbies mouth narrowed a little if her voice held the slightest edge custer whose gaze was ever most focused on himself failed to notice the cook came out of the kitchen anything else sir maam she asked no thank you esmerelda libbie said before custer could reply esmerelda nodded and withdrew in a low voice custer said she cooks wellno one could deny itbut that is one of the homeliest women i have ever set eyes upon even in salt lake city really i hadnt noticed libbie said custer chuckled at womens blindness about other women if libbie wasnt quite so blind as he thought she was he failed to notice that too as hed failed for a good many years he was pouring cream into his coffee when a soldier rushed up thumping in booted feet to the door to his quarters and pounded on it shouting colonel custer colonel custer general pope needs to see you right away sir custer pushed back his chair and sprang to his feet i wonder what it can be he said whatever it was stonewall wanted to come along and find out too down sir down custer commanded the dog stared at him with resentful eyes as he dashed off as if to say why do you get to have all the fun hurry sir the orderly said when custer opened the door hurry i shall to prove it custer dashed past the soldier and beat him to popes office by half a dozen strides he wasnt quite so young as he had been but kept himself in top shape not breathing hard at all he saluted and said reporting as ordered sir pope held up several telegrams colonel within the last half hour i have learned that british forces have invaded montana territory good god sir as if lightning had struck close by electricity arced up custers spine i can only presume that their goal is to plunder and ravage the mining regions of that territory as the confederates have done to such unfortunate effect in new mexico pope said whatever their purpose though we must and shall beat them back punishing them as they deserve for thus testing our mettle yes sir custer said well lick them we must lick them and so we shall and then hardly daring to hope he asked what can we here in utah by which he meant what can i myself personally do to lend a hand and pope replied as i told you earlier today i have spoken highly of you in my reports back to philadelphia that praise has apparently borne fruit he picked through the sheaf of telegrams for one in particular you and the fifth cavalry and specifically the eight gatling guns attached to your regiment are ordered to great falls montana there to join in defending our beloved country and you colonel are ordered to take overall command of that defense with the brevet rank of brigadier general he stood up and shook his hand congratulations general custer in a pinktinged daze custer shook the proffered hand thank you very much sir he whispered hed dreamt of stars on his shoulder straps since the day he entered west point now at last they were his i shall save our country sir he declared while an interior voice added in spite of those gatling guns chapter s am clemens walked in to the office of the san francisco morning call hung his straw hat on a branch of the hat tree and asked well boys whats gone wrong since i went home last night a chorus of voices answered him so loud and vigorous that he had trouble sorting out one piece of bad news from the next the british army in montana territory was still moving south british gunboats on the great lakes were bombarding us lakeside cities again with apparent impunity louisville remained a bloody stalemate president blaine didnt think he had reason enough to give over the war before clemens observed our enemies seem to be giving him reason now dont they and pocahontas arkansas has fallen back into rebel hands clay herndon added good god sam staggered as if taking a mortal wound that proves the struggle truly hopeless how save by the grace of a thick skull can blaine keep from yielding to common sense edgar leary delivered the topper the wires say british ironclads have appeared off boston and new york and theyre bombarding the harbors and the towns good god clemens said this time in earnest they are taking the switch to us youd think that if we were going to get into a war with the whole world we might have made some sort of an effort to be ready for it ahead of time but the democrats reckoned saying yes massa to the rebs once a day and twice on sundays would get us by without fighting so they didnt fret much about the army and navy and blaine didnt fret about em either he just up and used em ready or not and now we know which from the back of the office somebody shouted holy jesus telegraph says the french navy is shelling los angeles harbor that does it sam cried that absolutely does it the confederates wrestle us to the ground england jumps on us as soon as were down and now france bites us in the ankle cant you see her yapping and panting pretty soon shell piss on our leg you mark my word off in the distance thunder rolled clay herndon frowned it was clear when i got here half an hour ago dont usually get thunderstorms this time of year anyhow hell we dont usually get any rain at all this time of year fastest thunderstorm ever heard of clemens said it was clear when i walked in five minutes ago look out the window leary said its still clear sam couldnt see the window he opened the door bright daylight streamed in another rumbling roar sounded though this one not so far away that isnt thunder he exclaimed its cannon fire it cant be clay herndon said its not coming from the direction of the forts and wed have heard if colonel sherman were moving any guns most of those big ones dont move anyhow i didnt say they were our guns clay clemens answered quietly i think somebodys navy has just brought the war to san francisco thats era herndon began then he shook his head it would have been crazy yesterday it wasnt crazy today not with the royal navy shelling boston and new york harbors not with the french whose ships sam judged had to be sallying from some port on the west coast of their puppet mexican empirebombarding los angeles and as if to confirm clemens words more thunderous reports rolled out of the west but they were not thunder a few seconds later came another blast close enough to rattle the front window of the morning call offices through which edgar leary was still staring as if expecting rain a rending crash followed thats a building falling down herndon whispered no clemens shook his head thats a building blowing up now at last from the northwest came the thunderous reports that had grown familiar through the summer the cannon in san francisco s fortifications opened up defending the harbor against the foe theyll never make it through the golden gate leary exclaimed i wonder if they even care to try sam was thinking out loud and not liking any of his own thoughts by the sound of their guns theyre standing off the coastmaybe out past the cliff houseand shooting across the peninsula either toward the wharves or just toward us i wonder if they know which themselves or care a shell landed only a couple of blocks away the floor jerked under sams feet from the explosion as if at a small sharp earthquake a moment later he heard the rumble of collapsing masonry hed heard that during earthquakes too but not during small ones blast and rumble were so loud he marveled at how faint and distant the following screams seemed but where the roar of the cannons had not those screams reminded him he was a newspaperman jesus christ boys he burst out were sitting in the middle of the biggest story thats happened in this town since were not going to be able to cover it standing around here or hiding under our desks leary get over to fort point see what the devil the garrisons doing to drive the enemy away sec if theyre doing anything to drive the enemy away see if they know who the devil the enemy is thatd be a good bit of news to put in a story dont you think right boss edgar leary pushed past him and out the door clay sam snapped you go to the cliff house fast as you can whatever you can see of the enemy fleet note it down ill do it herndon said then he hesitated what if theyve already blown the cliff house to hell and gone clemens exasperated exhalation puffed out his mustache in that case you chowderhead dont go inside herndon nodded quite seriously as if that hadnt occurred to him maybe it hadnt more explosions were rocking the city now how could you blame anybody for having a hard time thinking straight clemens sent someone to the harbor to see if enemy shells were falling there as well as on san francisco itself and also to see what if anything the pacific squadron was doing about the enemy he scattered reporters through the city whatever happened heand the morning call would know about it one of the last men out the door asked are you going to stay here and put everything together boss thats what i have in mind yes sam answered every one of you will know more about some of this business than i do but ill end up knowing more about all of this business than any of you unless a shell comes down on your head the reporter said with a nervous chuckle some people who work for this paper that would hurt the shell more than the head in question clemens fixed the reporter with a glare shall i name names oh no boss the fellow said hastily and departed not five seconds after he was out the door another shell made the building shake the front window broke in a tinkling shower of glass somewhere not too far away a firealarm bell was clanging sam grimaced at that how many gas lines was the bombardment breaking how many fires had started how bad would they get how was the fire department supposed to put them out with ironclads shelling the men as they worked those are all good questions clemens muttered i wonder if any good answers will stick to them he stationed himself at his desk every time a shell smashed down west of the newspaper office he scowled and chewed on his cigar what were alexandra and orion and ophelia doing this was a nasty way to make war throwing shells around in the hope of smashing up whatever they hit and not worrying much about what that was most of an hour went by the local telegraph clicker started to chatter no one was minding it clemens had sent everybody out to cover the story he got up to see what the message was it was from clay herndon royal navy shelling city cliff house wrecked and burning at nearest telegraph office to ocean damage severe already our guns of little effect that gave sam something to write he wrote it and gave it to the typesetters other reports began coming in some by wire some by messengers the reporters had paid some by messengers who loudly demanded to be paid sam suspected some of those had already been paid once but he shelled out they hadnt had to come here after all a picture began to emerge the enemy ships did seem to be trying to reach the harbor with their guns or at least with some of them most of the shells were falling short though thanks sam muttered sourly as the morning call building rattled again i never would have noticed that the pacific squadron was moving out to engage the foe he suspected the handful of antiquated gunboats would be sorry in short order but making the effort was their job he wished edgar leary would send him something but the cub remained silent maybe hed been hit on the way to fort point maybe the telegraph lines were down and maybe colonel sherman wasnt inclined to let any news out of the fort and into the city considering how little the forts guns were doing to drive away the british ironclads the last explanation struck clemens as most likely men with rifles started running down market other men with rifles started running up market good to see the volunteers have everything well in hand sam muttered chickens act this way after the hatchet comes down but chickens arent in the habit of carrying springfields somebody fired one of those rifles how many of our own shall we kill clemens scribbled how many of them shall we blame on the british the telegraph clicker started up again he hurried over to it the message was to the point marines landing ocean beach herndon sam was still carrying his notebook and pen he looked down at the two sentences hed just written they were still true they were if anything truer than ever with three quick firm strokes he scratched them out anyhow whos wearing a hogleg he shouted as loud as he could the goddamned englishmen are landing troops well nail the sons of bitches a typesetter yelled he and two of the men who served the presses dashed out the front door pistols in their hands clemens wondered if the british marines knew what they were getting into apart from the volunteer companies a lot of men in san francisco carried guns for selfprotectionnot least for protection from other men carrying guns he wondered whether the regular army garrison up at fort point and the presidio knew the ironclads out in the pacific had landed marines anyone with a lick of sense would have posted lookoutswith luck lookouts with telegraph keysall along the ocean front opposite the builtup part of san francisco which means the army likely hasnt done it he said then he shrugged if they dont know about em theyll find out pretty damn quick he went back to his desk and started writing up some of the reports he was getting as soon as he finished one he carried it back to the typesetters who set about turning it into something someone besides him and them and perhaps alexandra could read by the time hed finished a couple a great rattle of smallarms fire had broken out to the west it rapidly got louder and closer people might be shooting at the british marines but they were shooting back too and evidently to better effect smoke started floating in through what had been the front window clemens coughed a couple of times then called boys if you want to go out in the street i wont say a word this is a fine paper but its not worth burning up for most of the printers and typesetters did leave the building as long as some of them stuck sam did too figuring the men out there would warn him before advancing flames got too close he covered page after page of paper wondering all the while if what he wrote would meet a hotter critic than hed ever been clay herndon burst into the offices without his jacket with his cravat all askew and with blood running down the side of his face my god sam he cried hoarsely theyre coming this way nobody can stop them theyre coming clemens pulled a bottle of whiskey out of a desk drawer here he said drink some of this herndon did and then wheezed and choked sam said wipe your face and tell me what happened to you herndon ran a sleeve across his cheek and seemed astonished when it came away red must have been when a bullet took out a window and sprayed me with glass he said its nothing listen those royal marines make the regulars look sick nobody can shift em and theyre not far behind me either what in tarnation are the limeys up to clemens demanded i thought theyd do some shooting and burning for show but if theyre on your heelsand the everswelling racket of gunfire made that obviously truethey must be after something bigger but what damned if i know the reporter said whatever it is whos going to stop em city hall sam mused he shook his head no too much to hope forand if they shoot mayor sutro the city gets stronger and then almost with the force of divine relation he knew or thought he did my god the us mint i dont know herndon took another slug of whiskey you cant imagine what its like out there all fire and smoke and chaos and people shooting and people running and people screaming and horses screaming and the only ones who have any notion of what theyre doing or where theyre going are the marines you sound like a man talking about the devils in hell clemens said you arent far wrong herndon said listen if they are after the mint its not far from heredown on mission by fifth he swayed where he stood shock whiskey some of both probably the last sam guessed the reporter gathered himself theyll be here soon thats not good have to get the story sam said and pushed outside past herndon people were still dashing every which way some with weapons some without and then almost without warning they werent running every which way they were all running east with rifle fire lashing them on every so often someone with a rifle or pistol would pause to send back a shot or two after that hed run some more except one of them didnt run any more instead he fell clutching his chest a moment later a skinny little man in an unfamiliar uniform not far from confederate butternut dashed up and bayoneted him to make sure he didnt get up again then he yanked the long bloody bayonet free and aimed his rifle at sam clemens time stretched endlessly as if in a dream sam raised his hands to show he was unarmed the royal marines face was sweaty and smokestained his scowl showed very bad teeth he couldnt have stood more than fifty feet from sam pointblank range after a hundred years in which sams heart beat once the englishman turned the rifle aside and ran on all the starch went out of clemens knees even though the marine had not shot him he sagged to the pavement now instead of once in a hundred years his heart thudded a thousand times a second more and more royal marines dashed past him none of them gave him a second glance no one could have imagined him a danger at that moment more gunfire rang out not far to the east the mint sure enough he remained too dazed to feel proud of being right some of the british fighting men must have brought dynamite for loud explosions smote the ear move against them shouted a fellow in a captains uniform surely a volunteer no one moved against them no matter how he bellowed and carried on and then quite suddenly or so it seemed to sam the royal marines were running west where they had been running east he went back into the morning call offices you know what this is he said to clay herndon its the biggest goddamn bank holdup in the history of the world how much silver and gold do you think however many british marines there are could carry away herndon asked in an awed voice dont know the answer to that one but ill tell you this people are going to fight over the bodies of any who got killed the way lions fought over the christians in the coliseum sam said as the sounds of gunfire had once advanced through san francisco so now they retreated toward the pacific half an hour after the royal marines departed from whatever was left of the us mint by the smoke billowing up from it not much two natty companies of regular army infantry marched past the morning call offices in neat formation sun gleaming from their fixed bayonets sam didnt know whether to laugh or cry he took that bottle out of his desk and got drunk instead brigadier general orlando willcox beamed at frederick douglass how good to have you restored to my table here once more the commander of the army of the ohio said raising his coffee cup in salute as if it were a goblet of wine a pleasure to see you returned to freedom and a pleasure to enjoy your company again your very good health he drank the unspirituous toast so did all the officers at his table even captain richardson thank you very much general douglass said believe me i feel myself delivered as were the israelites from pharaohs bondage in the land of egypt you are a pious man mr douglass colonel alfred von schlieffen said this is in my judgment good it will take you through hard times in your life more surely than will anything else douglass eyed the german military attache what did he know of hard times in his life prussia had gone from triumph to triumph and now headed a german empire that was surely the strongest power on the european continent he had not seen his nation split in two nor ninety percent of his own people his own kind trapped in bondagelike the israelites indeed douglass thought but then he recalled having heard that schlieffen had lost his wife in childbed that was an anguish douglass had never had to bear he nodded judiciously schlieffen could know whereof he spoke they brought you before stonewall himself didnt they someone asked what was that like what had that been like stonewall was a name with which mothers in the united states and especially negro mothers in the united states had been frightening naughty children for a generation when the rebel soldiers took me into his tent i told him i thought i had come before the antichrist as well you might general willcox said and then oh thank you grady the cook set on a table a large tray piled high with squab the succulently roasted birds went from tray to plates in next to nothing flat douglass snagged a couple for himself baked potatoes followed shortly he went on the very strange thing was that jackson s artillery commander general alexander oliver richardson put in general alexander yes douglass agreed shortly before my arrival there he had likened me to the antichrist richardson nodded as if he not only believed alexander would say such a thing but agreed with it himself orlando willcox asked and do you and the confederate generals still hold this view of each other cutting up a potato and grinding pepper over it douglass paused before answering then slowly reluctantly he said i at any rate do not general jackson is a man convinced of his tightness and of his righteousness but not the horrific figure of evil i had made of him in my mind captain richardson looked mischievous youll notice friends douglass says nothing of whether the rebs changed their minds about him he spoke lightly so the words would be taken for a joke but douglass did not think he was joking by the snide laughs that rose around the table neither did a good many members of willcoxs staff in fact i believe they did douglass answered we shall never love one another we may now know a certain respect previously lacking he laughed a laugh of his own i cannot deny that general jackson treated me far more respectfully than the rebel soldiers who first took hold of me he chuckled again that rib didnt seem to be broken after all he didnt know why not down at the far end of the table someone said they didnt worry about the antichrist ill bet they likely thought theyd nabbed old scratch himself that got another laugh this time one in which douglass felt he could join that major down there wasnt far wrong colonel schlieffen changed the subject saying thesehe groped for the english wordthese doves are very good eating and we have them often so they must common be very good he sucked the meat off a leg bone not doves colonel oliver richardson enjoyed showing off how much he knew though this was something any american schoolboy could have told the german military attache theyre passenger pigeons and yes they are very common in this part of the country not so common as they used to be general willcox said when i was a lad in michigan the flocks would darken the sky as the persians arrows are said to have done at thermopylae against the greeks swarms of that size are no longer seen fewer forests here in the midwest where the birds can rear their young than in the old days suppose but as captain richardson says they do remain common and as colonel schlieffen says they do remain very good eating douglass had reduced the two hed taken to a pile of bones he hooked another bird off the tray and devoured it too schlieffen said i am glad mr douglass you here again to see and to know that you are safe after being captured i will not much longer with the army of the ohio stay i think i have learned much here and am sorry to have to go but i think it is for the best ill miss you colonel douglass said and meant it like most europeans hed met schlieffen was far more prepared to accept him simply as a man and not as a black man than the common run of americans but if youre still learning things here why go i believe schlieffen replied after a perceptible pause for thought that what new things i may learn by staying will be small next to the knowledge i have already gained douglass needed a moment to figure out why the german had taken such pains with his answer then he saw schlieffen was saying he didnt expect the army of the ohio to accomplish much more than it had already done he didnt expect us soldiers to break through the confederate entrenchments ringing them and to rampage across kentucky had he thought they could manage something like that he might have stayed to watch them do it and in saying the army of the ohio was unlikely to accomplish anything more he was also saying that army had failed it still did not hold all of louisville its flanking manoeuvre had been costly but had not dislodged the rebels even if it did eventually dislodge the rebels from louisville it surely could not launch any triumphal progress through kentucky thereafter since triumph was what blaine and willcox had purposed anything less meant defeat no wonder schlieffen was so careful not to offend his departure passed judgment on the campaign and on those who ran it richardson said whether he reckons youre the antichrist or not mr douglasshe was smooth when he wanted to be smooth enough to use a title in public no matter how hypocriticallyim surprised old stonewall up and let you go instead of keeping you to trade for a reb or something douglass shrugged had the decision been his i do not know what he would have done with meor to me had the decision been his i gather he did not know what he would have done he referred it to president longstreet however who ordered my release having received the order jackson not only obeyed but treated me quite handsomely better than you deserved richardson s face said orlando willcox sighed longstreet was more astute than i had thought he would be by releasing you so promptly and with such good treatment he enabled the confederate states to escape the odium that would have fallen on them had they sought to punish you for your views and actions over the years yes douglass said and let it go at that martyrdom was easier to contemplate in the abstract than to embrace in the flesh from across the ohio artillery rumbled confederate guns captain richardson said and grimaced weve done everything we could but we never have been able to beat them down the long range of modern guns makes this hard schlieffen said so we learned when we fought the french when the guns you are shooting at are behind a hill or otherwise hidden out of sight finding accurately the range is not easy true true general willcox said sadly during the war of secession you could see what you were shooting at and what you could see you could hit only twenty years ago but how much has changed since we do use up a lot of ammunition feeling around for where the other fellow is and thats a fact richardson said a good thing hes doing the same with us or wed be in the soup who learns first how to find the range to the enemys guns will a large advantage have in the war where this happens schlieffen said nods went up and down the table oliver richardson said when theyre in sight a rangefinder like the ones the navy uses would do some good but land isnt flat the way water is guns can hide almost anywhere and shoot from behind hills as you say colonel id like to see the boys in the ironclads cope with that the discussion grew technical as far as frederick douglass was concerned the discussion grew boring changing only the subject of the conversation and not its tone the soldiers hashing over the best ways to blow up their foes at enormous distances might as readily have been steamboat engineers hashing over the best ways to wring a few extra horsepower out of a highpressure engine stifling a yawn douglass shifted in his seat but before he could rise general willcox held up a forefinger something i was meaning to ask you sir the commander of the army of the ohio said what was it now oh yes i have it during your captivity did you have any occasion to speak with men of your race held in servitude in the confederate states douglass settled himself firmly once more no general i did not i wish i had had such an occasion but it was denied me my captors went to such lengths to prevent me from having any intercourse with my own people that until i was returned to this side of the fighting line i had all my meals from the hands of white soldiers detailed for the task appreciating the irony of having white servants at my beck and call perhaps more than the confederate authorities would have done i refrained from pointing it out to them although i have every intention of prominently mentioning it in one of my future pieces on the experience they were so afraid youd corrupt their niggers eh richardson said he found himself in a predicament that must have been awkward for him douglass had seen how he despised negroes but he also despised the confederate states of america juggling those two loathings had to keep him on his toes if captain by corrupting you mean instilling the desire for freedom into the heart of any negro douglass stressed the proper wordupon whom i might have chanced then i should say you are correct should you desire to construe the word in any other sense i must respectfully ask that you choose another instead that is what i meant close enough richardson said douglass sighed a small sigh no point to taking it further none of the officers at the table not even general willcox had noticed that richardson had called douglass brothers in bondage niggershad in effect called him a nigger too no colonel schlieffen had noticed the mournful eyes in that nondescript face held sympathy for douglass schlieffen of course was a foreigner none of the us officers at the table had noticed anything out of the ordinary frederick douglass wished that surprised him more had he really escaped from captivity after all or only from the name of it and not from the thing itself brakes squealed iron grinding against iron sparks flew up from the rails putting general thomas jackson in mind of distant muzzle flashes seen by night the train was a special laid on by order of president longstreet no conductor came down the aisle shouting richmond all out for richmond jackson s was the only pullman behind the engine and tender gaslights turned the richmond and danville railroad depot bright as day under that yellowish light a captain stood waiting he sprang to attention when jackson emerged from his car sir i have a carriage waiting for you right over yonder youre in less than half an hour later than you were scheduled to get here president longstreet will be waiting up for you very welltake me to him jackson said part of himthe frivolous part hed been fighting all his lifewished the train had been hours late so longstreet would have gone to bed and he would have been able to spend the night in the bosom of his family and to see the president in the morning but duty came first the president would not have summoned me had he not reckoned the matter urgent let us go without delay the captain saluted yes sir if youll just follow me as hed promised the carriage waited just beyond the glow of the gaslights he stood aside to let jackson precede him up into it then spoke to the old negro holding the reins the presidents residence yes suh the driver tipped his top hat clucked to the horses and nicked the leather straps the carriage began to roll every so often jackson saw men in uniform on the streets of richmond but he might well have done that in peacetime too here in the capital of his nation from the spectacle that met his eyes he could not have proved the confederate states were at war did you have a good trip sir the captain escorting him asked middling he replied as travel goes it went well enough i should be lying however if i said i was eager to leave louisville with the fight unsettled he glared at the young officer as if it were his fault as hed hoped that glare suppressed further questions until the carriage had rattled up shockoe hill to the presidential mansion good to see you general g moxley sorrel said as if jackson had come round from the war department rather than from louisville go right in sir the president is waiting for you that was out of the ordinary jackson couldnt remember the last time he hadnt had to cool his heels in the anteroom while longstreet finished dealing with whoever was in his office ahead of the generalinchief this time longstreet was going through papers when jackson came in you made good time he said rising to shake jackson s hand sit down sit down make yourself comfortable can i shout for coffee thank you your excellency coffee would be most welcome as usual jackson sat rigidly erect taking no notice of the chairs soft almost teasing efforts to seduce him into a more relaxed posture longstreet didnt shout for coffee he rang a bell the steaming brew appeared with commendable promptness jackson spooned sugar into his cup sipped nodded and said and now sir may i inquire what was so urgent as to require removing me from the sight of my command without the battles end in sight longstreet drank some coffee too before asking do you expect the yankees to break through while youre away i do not expect them to break through at all jackson snapped longstreet only smiled at him after a moment he had the grace to look sheepish very well your excellency i take your point perhaps my absence will not unduly imperil the front nevertheless nevertheless i wanted you here general longstreet took a presidents privilege and overrode him conferring by telegraph is far too cumbersome were the telephone improved to the point where i could remain in richmond and you in louisville that might serve but we must deal with life as it is not with life as we wish it were or as it may be ten years or fifty years from now i do take the point mr president i assure you jackson said when longstreet said conferring he often meant lecturing like a lot of clever men he enjoyed hearing himself talk jackson had not seen him anywhere near so happy when listening to someone else and the president kept right on talking what came from his lips though was praise for jackson to which the confederate generalinchief was not averse to listening you did exactly the right thing when you wired me after frederick douglass fell into your hands next to holding the yankees first assault at louisville sending that telegram may well prove your most important action in the entire campaign thats very kind of you your excellency but surely you exaggerate jackson said i do not in no particular do i overstate the case longstreet began ticking off possibilities on his fingers had the soldiers who captured him shot him on realizing who and what he was we might have claimed he was killed in the fighting had they lynched him after realizing who and what he was a fate he nearly suffered jackson broke in i believe that longstreet shuddered had they done it i should have had to punish them and publish to the world that they had done the infamous act without authorization from anyone higher in rank and had you hanged him generalthe president of the csa frowned most severelythat would have been very bad i dont know how i could have repaired it mr president you are starting at shadows jackson said douglasshed forgotten about saying mister douglassis a prominent figure in the united states but his prominence does not translate into popularity what you say is true so far as it goes longstreet agreed nodding his majestic head it does not go far enough you see over the hill to the battle just ahead but not to the larger fight three weeks later and half a state away enlighten me then jackson said more than a little testily he knew he was no match for longstreet as a politician but did not enjoy having his nose rubbed in the fact almost to his disappointment longstreet did enlighten him as you say douglass is not nearly so popular as he would wish in the usa he embarrasses his countrymen by reminding them they lost the war of secession an unpalatable fact on which they would sooner not dwell but douglass is popular in france and he is extremely popular in england and has been for upwards of thirty years we would have had an easier time explaining to the united states how we had killed one of their citizens than explaining to our allies how we had come to kill a man they revere ah now i see it plain jackson dipped his head to the president i humbly beg your pardon your excellency in such matters your mind does cast a wider net than mine each cat his own rat longstreet said that was not quite the same as admitting jackson made a better soldier than he but it came close enough to keep the generalinchief from being offended then the president of the csa leaned forward and asked and how did you find douglass general he might almost have taken that curiously avid tone had he asked jackson about a lewd photograph or something else at the same time illicit and attractive after meeting the negro agitator jackson understood why he is a formidable man your excellency he answered after a pause spent groping for a word that fit that i believe longstreet said but jackson once begun with his judgment would not give over until he had completed it were all men of his race endowed with gifts even approaching those he possesses we should never have succeeded in holding them in bondage i believe that too but they are not so endowed i have read much of his work longstreet said jackson blinked startled the president saw the blink and laughed do you not favor knowing the enemy general mm jackson said put that way yes sir having done so i will say within the confines of these four walls and these four ears that few white men are endowed with gifts even approaching his in any public setting of course i should say nothing of the sort i understand your excellency jackson said and he did the confederate constitution mandated free speech but no one used that mandate to proclaim the negros equality to the white man let alone his superiority over him as i say you did the nation a good turn by your forbearance longstreet said i have received cables from both london and paris thanking and congratulating us for our prompt release of douglass i am convinced it has made our allies more willing to play an active part in the fight against the usa they certainly have done that of late jackson said with a smile now he told of the blows on his fingers boston new york the great lakes los angeles nice to find the french doing somethingsan francisco that town up in washington territory seattle longstreet supplied the name thank you mr president and this invasion of montana territory is one more stroke against which the yankees will be hard pressed to find an effective response ah i see you have not heard the latest a smile broke through longstreets beard like the sun breaking through clouds no fault of yours generalyouve been on the train but this morning british and canadian troops crossed over the border from new brunswick into maine maine jackson shivered theatrically brr why would anyone want it give me mexico any day or seen from canada does maine look warm theres achilling thought longstreet said with a smile but there are two excellent reasons for invading it one is that the border which was not settled until the s was not settled altogether to england s satisfaction and the otherthe smile got wider as if the president was inviting jackson to share the jokethe other is that maine is president blaines home state which makes the invasion doubly humiliating to him ah jackson said appreciating the beauty of it with a certain savage satisfaction longstreet went on when i last offered president blaine peace on the status quo ante helium he refused not least on the grounds that the united states were undefeated if i make him the same offer again he will have a harder time putting forward that claim he certainly would jackson said with a chuckle then he checked himself and studied the president of the confederate states your excellency are you thinking of renewing that offer longstreets big leonine head went up and down i am along with the matter of douglass gaining your opinion of such a move was the other reason i asked you to come here my view is that at this time no one in the usa or anywhere else in the world could possibly believe we would offer peace because we are weak rather than because we are strong how say you our lord did say blessed are the peacemakers jackson answered but i must tell you that i would prefer to see the united states pay a high price for starting a war over something that was none of their proper concern in the first place having to give up the war while gaining nothing and having to recognize our right to chihuahua and sonora to prevent which acquisitions they went to war in the first place should be price enough dont you think longstreet asked the united states have now twice elected republican presidents twice gone to war with us almost immediately thereafter and twice failed in mortifying fashion to achieve their purpose based on that general how long do you reckon it will be before they elect a third republican president sooner than you think perhaps mr president if you let them down too gently jackson said are you saying i should not do this longstreet looked unhappy as he did when anyone disagreed with him they are there general he pointed north they will be there we cannot subdue and occupy them now they see they cannot subdue and occupy us is it not enough air hissed out between jackson s teeth put that way he was not happy himself nor anywhere close but the president had a point grudgingly he said perhaps it could be tried knew youd see it my way now longstreet was all smiles why not jackson thought hes got what he wanted brakes squealed iron grinding against iron sparks flew up from the rails brevet brigadier general george custer turned to his brother and said reminds you of muzzle flashes in a night battle doesnt it tom major tom custer shrugged nobodys trying to kill us not yet unless its the railroad line the conductor stuck his head into the car that carried the fifth cavalrys officers great falls he shouted all out for great falls custer shifted in the scat hed occupied far too long something in his back gave a sharp click he let out a sigh of relief thats a little better anyhow the railroads he muttered ah the railroads how i do love it when the faster way to go from hither to yon is around three sides of a square he stretched again despite that welcome click his back remained unhappy to get from salt lake city to great falls his regiment had had to travel back past denver then up through nebraska into the black hills country of dakota territory clipping a corner of wyoming territory before they finally entered montana and that had been a while ago montana itself was a big place gods own luck its not general gordon and the british army meeting us here he grumbled wouldnt that be fineto get shelled and shot up as we were trying to leave the train i mean happened a couple of times during the last war didnt it autie his brother said but youre rightits not what id want to do for fun were blasted lucky the mormons didnt greet us that way when we got to utah oh dont i know it custer got to his feet as the train slowed to a stop well lets get ourselves disembarked and on the move the sooner we set to marching the sooner we can send the damnedthe dashedenglishmen back over the border with their tails between their legs he was the first one out of the car back in the days when he was a mere colonel others might have tried to leave ahead of himmore likely tom than anyone else but those shiny stars on his shoulder straps froze the rest of the officers in their seat till he had gone by a general he thought and walked straighter im a general down to the ground he sprang boots scuffing on gravel an infantry colonel stood there waiting to greet him a blond man a few years older than he was and weathered leathery by sun and wind and snow welcome to montana general custer he said saluting his voice was familiar even if his face hadnt been at first glance custer looked again and did a double take henry welton you son of a gun he exclaimed and clasped the other mans hand id heard you were up in these parts but it went clean out of my head in the rush to get here from salt lake city by thunder its grand to see you again been a long time hasnt it since we were a couple of mcclellans bright young men almost twenty years welton said that one didnt turn out the way we wanted it to heres hoping we do better this time around amen and wed better custer said he grabbed his brother by the arm henry did you ever met tom here when welton shook his head custer went on more formally colonel welton id like to present to you my younger brother major tom custer tom henry welton and i both served together at little macs headquarters in our army of the potomac days very pleased to meet you sir tom said and you major welton lowered his voice as he spoke to george custer once more and after all that army of the potomac duty how did you find serving under brigadier general john pope as a matter of fact that went better than id thought it would custer answered we differed naturally in our views of general mcclellan but discovered a common aversion to the latterday saints and another to the abilities and characters such as they are of abraham lincoln he stiffened speak of the devil there he is on the platform i thought id never set eyes on that goddamned old undertaker againhe forgot about dashed and other euphemisms after we sent him packing from salt lake city hes been up here most of the time since trying to raise trouble welton answered he managed it in helena but he hasnt had such good luck in great falls christ here he comes what does he want with us lincoln towered over henry welton and both custers tipping his hat to george he said i know you find my good wishes superfluous colonel cus he caught himself he was an observant man excuse megeneral custer congratulations in any case i do hope you enjoy all good fortune in driving the invader back from our soil i aim to do exactly that mr lincoln custer said and when i have done it and when our great nation is once more free to turn to the things of peace i expect you sir will go right on setting class against class and preaching hatred and strife until they plant you in the ground i preach neither of those things lincoln said quietly i preach justice and equality for all men in the united states yes for the mormons custer jeered we gave them justice and equality all rightthey were plenty equal at the end of a rope lincoln s long sad face grew longer and sadder i had already heard of that may it not come back to haunt us pah you care for the mormons more than for the decent citizens of the united states with a fine show of contempt custer turned his back ive wasted enough time now to get this regiment moving behind him he heard lincoln walk away the expresidents step was that of a much younger man firm and regular as long as he was leaving custer didnt care what he sounded like cavalry troopers filed out of the cars behind the one housing the regimental officers they hurried back to the freight cars that held their mounts from one freight car emerged not horses but the regiments gatling guns and limbers carefully guided down special extrawide ramps by their crews heavens henry weltons eyebrows rose in surprise youve got enough of those contraptions dont you enough and to spare custer answered not altogether happily i had two in kansas and went down into indian territory and did good work with them after my regiment got sent to utah to help overawe the mormons the other half dozen were attached to me for no better reason than that the first two had done good work and when i was ordered here i was ordered here with the gatling guns specifically included welton asked the first question that would have entered any good soldiers mind can they keep up the first two did well enough in kansas custer said i made sure the gun carriages had good horses not screws ive been doing the same with all of them but now with eight guns and eight limbers we have four times as many things that can go wrong he affected a tone of ruthless pragmatism if they cause trouble on campaign ill leave them behind thats all that makes good sense sure enough welton said well well have a chance to see how well they travel from here up to join with the seventh infantry from that point on well be moving against the british so if they cant keep up they will have to fall back custers face crinkled into a frown i havent been so well briefed as i would have liked he said which would do for an understatement till a bigger one came along he exulted at having the command in montana but with command went responsibility youre not in contact with the enemy he didnt care for the sound of that my infantry regulars arent no sir welton replied which made custer like it even less then the infantry officer went on but the first montana volunteer cavalry are skirmishing with the limeysthats the unauthorized regiment you know volunteer cavalry custer said scornfullyhe didnt know and had no way of knowing unauthorized volunteer cavalry theyre good men siras good as a lot of the troopers you have welton said custer didnt believe that last for a minute but if the commander of the seventh infantry thought it was true they might prove better than their name suggested welton next addressed that very point they started calling themselves the unauthorized regiment because they had a devil of a time getting into us service after their colonel recruited them they still wear the name with pridea finger in the eye of the war department you might say all right colonelfor the time being i have to take your word about such things not having seen them myself custers tone remained dismissive henry welton held up a warning hand sir they truly are a finelooking unit and their colonel the fellow who recruited them and organized them is a lad to watch out for one way or another you mark my words he will make the world notice him their colonela lad custer wasnt sure hed heard right theodore roosevelt is twentytwo though he will be twentythree soon welton spoke with a certain somber relish by godfrey custer exploded thats right one of those welton nodded he will run rings around any three ordinary men you could name hes run rings around me more than once ill tell you that do you know what he puts me in mind of he puts me in mind of you sir the day you got yourself onto general mcclellans staff do you remember im not likely to forget custer said with a smile welton went on as if he hadnt spoken there we were on the banks of the chickahominy and little mac wondered how deep it was and what did you do you spurred your horse into the river got to the other sidegod knows how because it wasnt shallowand then came back across and said thais how deep it is general roosevelt would have done the same thing there i cant think of anyone else ive ever seen who would hmm custer wasnt sure he liked that he preferred to think of his headlong bravado as unique well we shall see a man who goes hard at the foe will find a place for himself sure enough yes sir welton looked around your regiment is shaping with remarkable speed wont be long before youre ready to move out will it were not volunteers unauthorized or otherwise custer said with more than a hint of smugness by god it will be good to get out in the clean air on a horses back instead of sitting cooped up in a rolling box breathing the fumes of other mens tobacco until it was as if i were doing the smoking myself welton chuckled well then sir i shant offer you a cigar as i was about to he got one out lighted it and puffed up a happy cloud of smoke never took the habit custer said though i really am thinking of starting now having made such a good beginning at it heres a habit i know you have henry welton took a flask off his belt it gurgled suggestively but custer shook his head again i was a man whod raise hades sure enough but i havent touched spirits and i havent cursedmuchsince i married libbie right after the war of secession well well welton said should i congratulate you or commiserate with you one of those should do it custer answered but ill tell you this henryif we dont lick the british we may as well get drunk because the whole country will be up the smokestack henry welton solemnly nodded jeb stuart took off his hat and fanned himself with it el paso was hot he said to major horatio sellers cananeas hotter dont know whether id have believed that if someone told it to me last spring but its so his aidedecamp nodded rueful agreement with his chunky build the heat told harder on him when he spoke he spoke of a different sort of warmth latest wagon train from el paso is overdue too if the yankees hit us now they could make things hot we still havent caught up with all the munitions we used against them in new mexico territory i sent a wire off yesterday asking where the wagons were stuart said havent had an answer yet maybe the lines down again heaven knows how it stays up strung from cactus to fence post the way it is maybe a cow tripped over a wire and maybe the yankees are up to something farther east if i dont hear anything from el paso by this time tomorrow im going to send out a troop of cavalry and see whats up railroad line might be broken east of el paso too sellers said its not as if we havent worried about that no its not stuart kicked up dust as he paced along cananeas main street which would scarcely have made an alley in a proper town a town that had some life to it el paso s on the end of a long supply line from the rest of the csa and were on the end of a long supply line from el paso i suppose i ought to get down on my knees and thank god our ammunition has come in as well as it has embarrassing to try and fight a battle without it agreed major sellers who had a sardonic cast of mind we almost found that out to our cost at tombstone if the yankees had had a couple of companies of regulars there along with the tombstone rangers we might have found ourselves biting down hard on a cherry pit thats so of itself stuarts tongue ran over a broken tooth on the left side of his lower jaw he hadnt done it on a cherry pit but on a bit of chicken bone the comparison struck a nerve even so he went on weve taught the yankees a lesson though since we licked them in that last fight they havent even tried moving soldiers into the stretch of their own country we overran let alone down into sonora but counting on the united states to stay quiet was a mistake as stuart learned that afternoon when a halfdead confederate cavalry trooper rode a foundering horse into cananea a bucket of water poured over his head another poured down him and a tumbler of mescal poured after it did wonders to revive the soldier drench me again he said whether seeking more water on him or more mescal in him stuart did not know what news the commander of the transmississippi demanded sir the damnyankees bushwhacked our wagon train maybe twenty miles west of this janos place the trooper answered wasnt like they came ridin down on us neither they was waitin there right in the road like they got there a while ago and they was afixin to stay oh they were were they stuarts eyes lit up thats what they think how many men have they looked like a couple troops of cavalry mebbe some infantry with em the soldier answered i was ridin rear guard but i reckoned you needed to know what they was up to worsen the folks back in el paso so i went wide around the ambuscade and managed to get on by them bastards without em spottin me they was too busy foragin mongst the wagons to pay much heed to one rider off on his lonesome you reckon my horsell live sir thats powerful dry country i rode him over and i didnt do much in the way of stoppin you know what i mean yes stuart said i dont know about your horse he did know about foraging in a captured wagon train hed done plenty of that during the war of secession he also knew the trooper was right about how dry the land between cananea and janos was if he galloped out at the head of a column of horsemen hed get to the yankees a day and a half later with all the mounts at deaths door as this troopers was now the us cavalrymen would ride rings around him if he galloped out at the head of a column of horsemen he hunted up colonel calhoun ruggles commander of the fifth cavalry and outlined his difficulty oh yes sir we can do that colonel ruggles said confidently those yankee sons of bitches wont reckon we can drop on em anywhere near so quick as well do it thats what i hoped id hear you say stuart answered get your regiment in order colonel we leave as soon as may be colonel ruggles erected one of his bushy eyebrows like a signal flag we sir he asked are you certain good heavens yes stuart answered did you think id miss the chance to ride with the fifth camelry if it ever came up or do you deny that a threat to our supply line is business important enough to demand the attention of the army commander in person no sir and no sir again its only that ruggles eyes took on a wicked gleam its only that if you ride a camel the way you dance a quadrille sir youll be yanking cactus spines out of your backside with pliers before weve made a mile meaning no disrespect of course oh of course heaven forbid you should mean disrespect stuart said both officers laughed stuart went on i have been aboard the mangy critters your regiment fancies colonel but ive never seen them in this kind of action striking across the desert from a distance horses cant hope to match thats what theyre for sir ruggles said weve hit the comanches a few licks over the years that they never expected to get after they raided west texas from out of new mexico and now we can hit the yankees who paid em to do it thisll be purely a pleasure sir well be ready to ride in an hour at the outside he proved as good as his word stuart spent most of that hour convincing major horatio sellers that he wasnt just indulging himself by riding off with the fifth camelry he was indulging himself and he knew it but a us force athwart his supply line was serious business too this is what we were talking about before the trooper rode in if youll recollect he said after hed said it several times major sellers both outranked and outargued threw his hands in the air and gave up despite what stuart had said to colonel ruggles he hadnt ridden a camel in several years he quickly discovered several things hed forgotten the rank smell of the beast the strange feel of the saddle under him and the even stranger grip his legs had on the animal and how high up he was when it reluctantly rose after reluctantly kneeling to let him mount its gait was strange too when it set out east across the desert with the rest of the fifth confederate cavalry it had much more sidetoside sway than a good honest horse did stuart began to suspect they called camels ships of the desert not only because they could travel long distances on little water but also because a man might easily get seasick atop one despite that sway in another way the camels trot was smoother than a horses along with the hard hooves on the ends of its toes it also struck the ground with padded feet no jolts flowed up its legs to him its strides were slow but they were so much longer than a horses that stuart found himself astonished when he realized how quickly the barren countryside was flowing past to his left and right and while the countryside might have seemed barren to him the camels reckoned it flowing with milk and honeyor at least with cacti and thorn bushes which they found an adequate substitute whenever colonel ruggles halted the regiment to let men and animals rest the camels would forage thorns seemed to bother them not in the least some of the cacti they bit into dripped with juice so they were getting something in the way of water to go along with their food the sun dropped toward the horizon behind the fifth camelry colonel ruggles called out to stuart i presume we go on through the night sir i should say so stuart pointed ahead where a fat nearly full moon hung low in the southeast thatll light our way we wont go so fast as we would in daylight but well get some good work done and weve done amazingly good work so far if anyone wants to know we should come down on the yankees before noon tomorrow wouldnt you say youd best believe it sir ruggles answered when you want to get somewhere a long way away in a hurry camels are the best thing this side of a railroad they were also the noisiest things this side of a railroad they moaned and complained when they started up they moaned and complained when they stopped and they moaned and complained in between times to keep from getting bored stuart began to see why it took a special sort of trooper to want to have anything to do with them they were easier to hate than to love but how their long strides ate up the ground on through the night the fifth camelry rode maybe some of the troopers long used to their beasts were able to sleep in the saddle by the time the sun turned the eastern horizon gray and the moon sank behind stuart in the west he was yawning but he and the rest of the men kept on as dawn stretched the distance a man could see colonel ruggles sent scouts out ahead of the main body of the regiment to search out the yankee position they found the us force a little past nine oclock better than an hour earlier than stuart would have expected did the damnyankees spy you he asked dont reckon so sir one of the scouts answered and the rest nodded stuart glanced over to ruggles we outnumber em if we spread out and hit em from three sides at once the way the whole army did with the yanks at tombstone they shouldnt be able to stand against us expect youre right sir ruggles said i wouldnt say this if we were riding horses but i think we ought to go in mounted the stink of camels panics horses that arent used to themyoull have seen thatand the sight of them ought to panic yankees who never set eyes on the like before good stuart said well do it he swung north with three troops from the regiment firing had already broken out from the west when his men came into sight of the yankee position it was a roadblock with an encampment beyond it fine for ambushing a supply column but not intended to hold against a serious assault the fifth camelry howled rebel yells as their ungainly mounts bore down on the horrified us forces a few yankees got into the saddle but their horses wanted nothing to do with the confederate camels more us soldiers fought as infantry but taken in the flank and caught by surprise they didnt hold out long a couple of rounds snarled past and over stuart he fired his tredegar carbine four or five times and thought he might have wounded one running yankee then white handkerchiefs and shirts began fluttering in lieu of flags of truce the fighting couldnt have lasted more than half an hour you damn rebs dont fight like you should ought to a disgruntled us sergeant complained wouldnt have had to fight at all if it werent for you people stuart said borrowing robert e lees scornful name for the yankees he found himself in an expansive mood the us forces hadnt yet sent all the captured supply wagons up into new mexico and out of his reach that made him add the way we fight is to winand i reckon were going to do it the sorrowful sergeant did not disagree chapter r edcoats the scouts cries echoed across the montana prairie the redcoats are coming come on lads theodore roosevelt called to the men of the unauthorized regiment or those troops of it that had joined him to try to impede the progress of the british column penetrating us territory come on he repeated the english wore red a hundred years ago too when we licked em in the revolution and the patriotic continental soldiers wore blue just as we do they won against great odds and so can we forward forward they went with cheers on their lips first lieutenant karl jobst said sir i have to commend you my opinion of volunteers has gone up immeasurably since we began harassing the british roosevelt noted his adjutants phrasing jobst didnt say my opinion of volunteers has gone up since i joined the regiment hed waited till he saw the unauthorized troops fight before approving of them maybe that made him a hard man to please maybe it just made him an oldor rather a youngstickinthemud they do grow brave men outside the regular army lieutenant roosevelt said he filled his chest with air then let it out in a shout like the cry of a bull moose close with em boys and fill em full of lead that got another cheer as roosevelt rode north after the scouts he made sure his own winchester had a full magazine only the firepower his men had at their disposal let them slow down the enemy at all most of the british cavalry was armed with singleshot carbines much like the ones the us regulars carried some of the others were lancers who but for their revolvers might have fought against napoleon or louis xiv or for that matter against joan of arc they were brave too hed seen that he hadnt seen that it helped them much he pointed buglers horns cried out a warning there ahead was the cavalry screen the british used to protect the infantry and baggage train advancing into montana territory charge roosevelt roared he wanted to wave his sword about to help inspire his men but in the end hung onto his winchester instead knocking a few limeys out of the saddle would be the best inspiration possible rapidly the british horsemen swelled from little red specks visible across the prairie to an astonishing distance to scarlettunicked whitchelmcted men they opened fire at several hundred yards well beyond the reach of the unauthorized regiments winchesters puffs of dirty gray smoke shot from their carbines a horse went down a man slid out of the saddle but not enough horses fell not enough saddles were emptied to keep the us soldiers from getting close enough for their winchesters to bite and when the magazine rifles bit they bit hard a man could shoot two or three times as fast with one as with a singleshot breechloader as had happened several times before the british outriders recoiled back onto the rest of the cavalry in general gordons force before the larger force had been enough to drive back the volunteers now roosevelt had a couple of more troops than hed been able to deploy at the last skirmish keep at em boys he shouted and waved his hat bullets sang past him hed been delighted to discover not that he felt no fear in battle but that he had no trouble keeping under control the fear he did feel and the savage exultation that filled him almost canceled out even his controlled fear he raised the rifle to his shoulder and sent a stream of lead at the englishmen who had stabbed the united states in the back a redcoat dropped his carbine and clutched his right arm roosevelt whooped he wasnt sure that was the limey hed been aiming for or that his bullet had wounded the foe but who could prove it hadnt with his extra men with his extra firepower he drove back even the reinforced british cavalry they in turn fell back toward the redcoated infantry the foot soldiers shook themselves out from column into line of battle they too fired singleshot martinihenrys but there were far more of them than troopers of the unauthorized regiment one thing coming out west had eventually taught theodore roosevelt when not to raise on a pair of threes back he yelled a bugler always rode close by him the order to retreat blared forth the british cavalry did not pursue his men when they broke off the fight and galloped off to the south theyd learned from painful experience that they paid a high price if they got too far separated from the infantry they screened lancers roosevelt thought derisively we re nearing the end of the nineteenth century and the british still have lancers in the line well done sir karl jobst said wiping sweat from his face with his sleeve theyll have to go back from line into column and that will delay them we bought our country another hour or so there you have a coldblooded way of looking at war lieutenant roosevelt said its the regular army way sir his adjutant said war is your hobby its my profession our job is not to drive the british back into canada we cant not with one regiment against a much larger force our job is simply to slow them down as much as we can so they dont get the chance to plunder anything important before reinforcements join us for him it was a chess problem he was interposing a pawn into a rooks threatening path so other pieces would have time to move forward and defend his king as far as roosevelt could tell he would have been as happy deciding the result on a chessboard as on the plains of montana too roosevelt said such calculations have their place but they are not the beall and endall of warfare if strategy seemed to call for a long continuous retreat how would the soldiers ordered to make it have the spirit to fight once the time came for action that is an important point no doubt about it jobst smiled to find his superior so acute men are not steam engines to perform at the pull of a lever it wasnt the chessboard analogy roosevelt had in his own mind but it wasnt far removed jobst went on persuading men to fight bravely under such circumstances as you describe is what makes war an art rather than a science the germans believe they can reduce it to a science but i for one remain unconvinced good roosevelt said you do show signs of life after all lieutenant he watched jobst wonder whether he ought to be insulted his adjutant finally decided it was a compliment and smiled instead roosevelt smiled too stout fellow having delayed the british what do we do next what we have been doing lieutenant jobst answered we break away from them we fall back to the next stream lying across their line of march we post dismounted riflemen at the easiest fords to contest their crossing we do our utmost to ensure that we are not outflanked and when we have no other choice we fall back again colonel welton is moving to our aid as are the more easterly troops of our regiment and as are reinforcements from outside the territory and if were lucky we shant be all used up by the time all those reinforcements come up roosevelt said yes if were lucky jobst agreed his voice was tranquil if you had to sacrifice a pawn to stave off the other fellow and set up moves of your own later in the game you did it and did it with no regrets roosevelt understood that attitude but it didnt come easy to him the men of the unauthorized regiment were a force that might delay the british yes but they were more than that to him they were his comrades they were his friends they werein an odd sort of way since many of them were older than hehis children without him they would not have been born as a regiment without him they would not be facing danger now like a comrade like a friendlike a fatherhe felt obligated to keep them as safe as he could in thoughtful tones he said we havent seen much in the way of outflanking moves from this general gordon of theirs he seems to think only of going straight for what he wants karl jobst nodded so it would seem wouldnt it sir i daresay its because of his service in china and the sudan with properly disciplined troops you can go through the heathen chinese and the bush niggers like a dose of salts he likely expects to do the same against us against americans our blood is as fine as hisfiner roosevelt declared when we gain the numbers to make a proper fight of it i believe we shall give his excellency mr chinese gordon a proper surprise he loaded with scorn the titles he had applied to the british soldier yes sir jobst said by what i know of brigadier general custer our new commander he fights the same way once everything is in place it should be like two locomotives heading down one track toward each other we shall survive the smash roosevelt said i hold with this attitude myself as you will have gathered admiral nelson may have been a damned englishman but he spoke the truth when he said no captain could do very wrong if he placed his ship alongside that of the enemy having made that vaunting statement he felt the irony inherent in falling back but he also felt the need having splashed through some small tributary to the marias he left behind a couple of dozen of his best sharpshooters he stayed behind himself too to see how they did what they did so he told himself at any rate he kept on telling himself so too and almost convinced himself that wanting to take another lick at the british out of sheer personal hatred had nothing to do with why he did not ride on along with his troopers he concealed himself among the alders and birches and cottonwoods that grew by the river he might have been hunting canvasbacks instead of redcoats the only difference was that englishmen unlike ducks were liable to shoot back the oncoming british neared the river after hed been waiting about an hour and a half they approached with caution the troopers of the unauthorized regiment had stung them at crossings even before roosevelt came galloping in with his headquarters staff to take charge of resistance roosevelt drew a bead on a fellow who by the way he was waving his comrades about was probably an officer the redcoat had courage he went about his business as if without the slightest notion his foes were liable to be anywhere nearby knowing when to start shooting was an art in itself open fire too soon and the british would gallop off and ford the stream a few miles to the east or west without giving you the chance to hurt them wait too long and theyd have enough men forward to overwhelm you even if they couldnt shoot as fast one of his men pulled the trigger a little sooner than he would have liked an englishmans horse screamed shrilly and fell on him that made the englishman cry out too roosevelt fired at the officer who was a couple of hundred yards off to his blasphemous disgust he missed he worked the winchester s lever a brass cartridge case flipped up into the air and fell to the damp ground at his feet he fired again and cried out in delight as the englishman clutched at himself along with his troopers he emptied his magazine as fast as he could trying to do the enemy the most damage in the shortest stretch of time some of the british cavalrymen fired back though they had almost as small a chance of hurting his men as their ancestors under general braddock had had against the skulking redskins during the french and indian war most of the englishmen having discovered the enemy sensibly drew out of range twenty minutes passed the englishmen rode forward again one of roosevelts troopers knocked a redcoat out of the saddle at better than two hundred yards a fine bit of shooting with a winchester the rest of the british cavalrymen drew back again to wait for reinforcements they couldnt be sure how many men roosevelt had waiting for them if hed chosen to defend the line of the river with everything he had that could make for a large hard fight he hadnt he hooted like an owl the signal for his troopers to withdraw to the horses a handful of their comrades were holding for them even in retreat his smile was broad and triumphant hed given the tail of the british lion another nasty yank why not he said aloud im a nasty yank myself sam clemens had never liked his brotherinlaw as far as he was concerned his wifes most prominent virtue was that she was nothing like her brother vernon perkins was ideally suited to his bookkeeping job he was bald thin bespectacled fussily precise and had as much juice in him as a brick save that she wasnt bald his wife lucy might have been stamped from the same mold their two daughters were insipidly wellmannered even their dog behaved himself and now vernon perkins was not only sams brotherinlaw but also his landlord lying on the uncomfortable divan in the tatty parlor of perkins house knowing he wouldnt go to sleep for a good long while yet clemens muttered under his breath whats wrong dear asked alexandra who lay beside him she knew what was wrong bless her she didnt mind giving him the chance to blow off steam and he didnt mind taking it why in the name of all thats holy and a good many of the things that arent didnt the royal marines pass by without setting fire to our house and why didnt they come up here by telegraph hill and burn out your brother instead or why at least didnt one of their shells fall on this place shockingly bad gunnery if anyone wants to know what i think you dont mean that alexandra said i dont in the darkness clemens raised an eyebrow thank you for informing me of that because i didnt know it and why pray tell dont i because if vernon s house was wrecked and ours wasnt he and lucy and mary and jane and rover would have moved in with us instead of the other way round his wife answered boring names for their children boring name for their blasted dog too but sam sighed all right i dont wish your brothers house was wrecked i wouldnt want him in my pockets any more than i want to be in his heaven only knows how much i wish our house hadnt been torched though alexandra reached out and set a hand on his shoulder i know sam i feel the same way but we all came through safe even sutro even the cat thats what matters how many people werent so lucky she was right of course she usually was that she was right failed to lighten sams mood my soul rejoices every time i think the royal marines furnished you with a gentleman arsonist he did his best which was none too good to put on a british accent terribly sorry to disturb you maam but if youd be so kind as to gather up the tykes and the pets so i can pour out the kerosene and touch a match to it bah from what alexandra had told him he wasnt exaggerating much the british invaders had set a number of fires to cover their withdrawal to the pacific and turk street was one of the streets down which theyd pulled back they hadnt actually set fire to his house theyd set fire to the one next door and the firewhat a surprise had spread lots of fires had spread through san francisco in the wake of the british bombardment and invasion the sour smell of stale smoke still tainted the fog try to sleep alexandra urged i am i do he said i try every night sometimes lord knows how i even turn the trick a hindu straight from his bed of nails would have trouble sleeping on this divan she patted his shoulder again it will be all right she said as soon as we have a place of our own it will be all right and with that and without further ado she rolled over onto her side and did fall asleep orion and ophelia were sleeping too on piles of rugs and blankets their steady breathing mingled with alexandras in a rhythm that did nothing whatsoever to lull sam to sleep he muttered under his breath again and stared up at the ceiling eventually he did doze off and tossed and turned through the night his head full of dreams of exploding shells and snarling rifles when morning came he put on the suit hed been wearing the day the british came it was at the moment the only suit he owned he downed a bowl of lucy perkins oatmeal which stuck to his ribs like a cheap grade of cement declined a cup of her watery coffee and fled the house as fast as he decently could or perhaps a little faster he was farther from the morning call offices than he had been while he still had a home of his own trudging down to market and then along it showed him a sample of what the british had inflicted on san francisco most of the houses along the narrow streets that led down to market were fine no royal marine incendiaries had penetrated so far north and east here and there though where a shell from an ironclads big gun had landed rubble took the place of what had been a home some gaps where shells had started fires were bigger still the northern end of market street was more of the same a couple of shells had landed right in the middle of the street and dug sizable craters dirt and rubble filled those craters work gangssome made up of white men including convicts in striped suits others of pajamawearing pigtailed chinesewere clearing away wreckage one ruined house or shop at a time and then a little north of the morning call offices three or four blocks were nothing but wreckage those were the blocks the royal marines had passed on their way to and from the mint they were also the blocks where some of the hardest most desperate fighting had gone on the stench of damp smoke lingered most strongly there another stench still lingered too the sicklysweet smell of meat going bad a white straw boss was shouting orders to a gang of chinese clemens called out to him hey sweeney find any more bodies in the ruins yesterday we did that sam the straw boss answered only one though better than it has been heaven only knows who the poor bastard was with him so swole up and black and all he held his nose hell go in one o the common graves poor sod for not even his own mother could be naming him the now filthy business clemens said and sweeney nodded sam could look west and see some of the swath of devastation the invaders had cut through san francisco it ran straight toward the ocean he would have been able to take in more of it had some of the citys hills not blocked his view is there any word yet on how much in the way of gold and silver the sassenachs are after stealing sweeney asked if words were drops of water noah would be up at the top of telegraph hill right now building a new ark sam answered which made the irishman grin around the stub of his cigar whether theres truth in any of them heaven only knows ive heard a quarter of a million dollars but ive heard fifty million dollars too he tipped his hat and went on his way sweeney shouted at the chinamen they hadnt slowed down while he was talking with sam as a gang of white men would have done he shouted at them anyhow at the morning call offices sam hung his straw hat on one of the trees in the entry hall then called out the question uppermost in his mind the past few days has blaine decided to take the carrot yet or will they have to hit him a few more licks with the stick still no word out of philadelphia boss edgar leary answered that means the wars still on give me two synonyms for idiots clemens said and then gave them himself fools and republicans they havent got any notion of when to start wars but just to make up for it they havent got any notion of when to quit them either well whats gone wrong since yesterday british are shelling erie pennsylvania leary said with a certain weary relish wires say there are big fires down by the waterfront we know about that here dont we he turned red and grimaced uh sorry boss sorry i got burned out or sorry you mentioned it clemens asked never mind you dont need to answer that you ought to live with my wifes brother then youd really know what sorry was all about whats the news out of montana territory there is no news out of montana territory leary said the british are over the border that volunteer outfit with the funny name is skirmishing with them roosevelt s unauthorized regiment sam supplied i like it anybody whos unauthorized and proud of it is my kind of fellow why i come from a long line of unauthorized instead of interrupting edgar leary he interrupted himself montana dammit nothing else to tell the young reporter said the cavalry is skirmishing with the british soldiers and regulars are moving to help moving where clemens asked irritably montana s a hell of a big place are they all over it like measles or sort of settled down in one spot in particular and if they are in one spot which one is it whichever spot it is its one thats out of reach of the telegraph lines leary replied of course there arent very many telegraph lines in montana on account of there arent very many people in montana one of the biggest stories of the whole war and its happening out where nobody can take a proper look at it sam said do you know what edgar ill bet the army likes that just fine after the british give us another licking the donkeys in blue will have an extra couple of days to cipher out how to make it sound like a victory grumbling about the us army vernon perkins and other calamities of nature he went to his desk and lighted a cigar spotting three typographical errors in the first paragraph of a story sitting there did nothing to improve his disposition neither did the text of the story itself whoever edited this would have done the world a favor if hed never learned to read he muttered then he remembered hed edited it himself he blew out as large and thick a cloud of cigar smoke as he could to keep everyone else in the office from noticing him turning red edgar leary said colonel sherman announced that two men diego reynoso and michael fitzpatrick were shot at sunrise in the presidio for looting there thats another victory sam exclaimed cant lick the royal marineschrist cant even find the goddamn royal marines but were death on looters no two ways around it of course if wed done any kind of proper job fighting off the royal marines in the first place the looters wouldnt have had anything to loot maybe just maybe if we give them enough hell now this particular brand of idiocy wont happen the next time we find ourselves in a scrape i hope not i surely do leary said after brief hesitation he went on boss i do hear tell that colonel sherman isnt happy about what the papers been saying since the british hit san francisco and if he isnt happy with the morning call he isnt happy with you well i have to tell you edgar my lad im not very happy about what the army did when the british hit san francisco and if im not happy with the army im not happy with colonel sherman sam took sardonic pleasure in turning lcarys warning on its ear the young reporter shuffled his feet uncertainly i know that but i thought i ought to tell you anyway because you cant throw sherman in the stockade but he can put you there and throw away the key once hes done it throw a newspaperman in the stockade he wouldnt d clemens began but he ran down like a pocket watch that wanted winding the trouble was he wasnt just a newspaperman he was a newspaperman whod spent a few inglorious weeks as a marion ranger a soldier of sorts on the confederate side during the war of secession if sherman decided he was lambasting the army because he sympathized with the confederate states after all rather than because he was a man who recognized damnfoolery when he saw it if that happened the commandant at the presidio was liable to lock him up on suspicion of general frightfulness he threw back his head and laughed till he started to cough are you all right edgar leary asked anxiously ill do no doubt about it sam answered it just occurred to me that considering where im staying now the stockade might be a step upso long as the estimable colonel sherman doesnt fling my brotherinlaw into the cell next door abraham lincoln stood on the platform at the great falls train station patiently waiting for disembarking passengers to get off then carrying his carpetbag he got aboard he looked around the car wondering if a couple of unsmiling soldiers would come up tap him on the shoulder and order him off he saw no soldiers unsmiling or otherwise he smiled himself hed gauged things about right when he was the principal menace to law order and the peace of mind of the moneyed class in montana territory the army had watched him like a hawk as soon as the british came over the border though everyone forgot all about him with the invaders heading south nobody cared a continental for john popes order limiting him to the territories he would he supposed have been even more worried about the future of the country had the military authorities kept right on watching him closely even though the british had invaded montana the conductor walked down the aisle big gold watch in hand now departing for bismarck fargo st paul milwaukee and chicago he intoned all aboard a blast from the steam whistle also announced the trains departure cars jolted in their couplings as it began to roll a vexing thought made lincoln s long face grow longer he wouldnt be altogether free of the armys grip till he passed fargo and left dakota territory maybe no one had tried to keep him from leaving great falls because the soldiers who would stop him were waiting in fargo he shook his head he didnt believe it no one had tried to keep him from leaving great falls because no one knew or cared he was leaving if no one knew he was gone or where he was going no one could stop him no sooner had he settled back in his seat than the young man across the aisle a fellow who looked like a miner in illfitting sunday best asked beg your pardon but aint you abe lincoln yes lincoln answered warily and wearily had he had a dime for every time hed had a conversation opened with that gambit he would have been a plutocrat himself the only commoner opening was god damn you lincoln you son of a bitch and that one usually came from older men men who recalled the sorry course of the war of secession who are you son my names hosea blackford mr lincoln the youngster said and stuck out a hand lincoln relaxed a little as he shook it hed had enough of curses and to spare lately it was strong and roughskinned and callused the hand of a working man blackford went on heard you talk in helena when you was there he nodded half to himself sure as hell did is that a fact lincoln said a little sentence polite in any context yes sir hosea blackfords green eyes glowed hell of a speech made me reckon we ought to get shut of fightin our neighbors till we finished muckin out our own barn first like you said we had ourselves one revolution and now we could use ourselves another one thank you mr blackford lincoln said every now and again when i hear a young man like you speak my hope for the country revives aint that somethin blackford said after a moment lincoln realized it was his equivalent of is that a fact they talked politics on and off till the miner lincoln had indeed pegged that one correctlygot off the train at oriska a tiny spot in eastern dakota territory where his sister and brotherinlaw had a farm he didnt even carry a carpetbag his suitcase was made of cardboard when he rose to leave he pumped lincoln s hand again you dont know what this heres meant to me he said ever since i started thinkin about things i could see they wasnt right but i never seen how or how to go about fixin em you done opened my eyes and i reckon can go and open some other folks eyes my own self you got yourself awhats the bible worda disciple thats what it is good luck to you mr blackford lincoln said be the truths disciple not mine follow the truth wherever it may lead you the miner bobbed his head in an awkward nod then hurried away at a place like oriska the train didnt stop long at a place like oriska you were lucky if the train stopped at all lincoln smiled at the miners stalwart back he wondered how long blackfords enthusiasm would last young men burned hot but they burned out fast too lincoln thought of that ridiculously young cavalry colonel back in great falls he was doing something special now too how long before he became a lawyer or a banker or something else stuffy and boring and profitable profitable lincoln s lip curled the owners took the profits and took them from the sweat of the working man a few hours and a few stops out of oriska the train halted in fargo no soldiers waited for lincoln fargo was a fairsized town and the train paused there half an hour long enough for him to get off and wire his son that he was on the way boarding again he crossed into minnesota out of these flat farmlands john pope had driven the sioux when they rose up against white settlers in the hope that the united states would be too distracted by the war of secession to bring any great force to bear against them that had been a double miscalculation on the indians part the usa had had soldiers enough to fight them and the confederates both and after the war was lost soldiers originally recruited for it hurled the indians west across the plains using numbers and firepower they could not hope to match farms grew thicker and towns larger and closer together as the train carried lincoln east minneapolis and st paul were real cities some in the east that had been settled a hundred years longer could not compare to them the passengers who boarded at the two rival centers were perhaps more warmly inclined to lincoln than people from the rest of the united states in minnesota he was remembered as much for being the man whod driven the indians out of the state as for being the man whod lost the war of secession with a sort of melancholy pride he recalled that hed carried minnesota in the election of recalling that wasnt hard he hadnt carried many states the republicans hadnt carried many states since not till public disgust at the democrats unending soft line toward the csa swept blaine into the white house the autumn before and now blaine had taken a hard line and done no better with it than lincoln how long would it be before the republicans carried many states again lincoln thought he had the answer or at least an answer to that question hed thought so for ten years and more now as hed watched factories boom and capitalists send their spaniels to europe on holiday and workers live in squalid warrens at which those pampered spaniels would have turned up their noses hed been able to make only a handful of party leaders pay any attention to him till now now he thought now they no longer have any choice if they dont heed me now the party will surely go under and then as the train passed from minnesota into wisconsin he closed his fat shakespeare took off his reading glasses and put them in their leather case and buried his face in his hands these past ten years he hadnt even succeeded in persuading his own son he was right he doubted he would persuade robert even now his son having enriched himself at the practice of law thought like a rich man these days not that robert would be anything but glad to see him in family matters they were close as they always had been only in politics did a chasm separate them the chasm that yawned between a man satisfied with his lot and another who could see how many in the country he loved had no reason to be satisfied with theirs the tracks beat south and east as they ran through wisconsin lincoln knew no great joy when he left that state and came into illinois even though hed lived more of his life in the latter state than anywhere else illinois had repudiated him in and had not looked on him kindly since no matter how great a power in the land robert had become chicago sprawled along the shores of lake michigan everything came together there great lakes commerce however damaged that was at the moment because of the war mississippi river commerce with the same caveat and railroads from east south and west smoke from its factories darkened the skies the great stockyards made the air pungent the other scent in the air the one robert breathed day and night was the scent of money even with five train stations chicago seemed undersupplied lincoln s train waited in the yard of the chicago and northwestern depot for close to an hour until a platform became available it inched its way forward then sighed to a stop robert lincoln was waiting on the platform as he embraced his father he said by all accounts youve had a busy time of it his tone was no more ironic than he could help maybe a bit lincoln allowed matching dry for dry its good to see you son you look well thank you sir in his late thirties robert lincoln was plainly his fathers son his neat beard only strengthened the resemblance but having his mothers blood in him as well he was several inches shorter than abraham a good deal wider through the shoulders and the face and by all conventional standards a good deal handsomer as well so youll put upand put up withyour radical old father for a while will you lincoln asked a little later as they made their way toward roberts carriage you know i dont fancy the direction in which your politics have taken you his son answered you also know that matters not at all to me when it comes to the family if youre willing enough to put up with a son reactionary enough to believe in earning money and keeping what he earns well get on splendidly as we always have good lincoln said he climbed into the carriage robert tipped the porter who had carried the bags and who now heaved them up behind the seats the man lifted his cap murmured thanks and departed to his driver robert lincoln said take us home kraus yes sir by his accent kraus had not been in the united states long he too tipped his cap then flicked the reins and got the carriage rolling quite a nabob youre getting to be son everyone bowing and scraping over you as if you were an earl on the way to becoming a duke lincoln said hiding dismay behind facetiousness robert who understood him very well without agreeing with him in the slightest gave him a sharp look lincoln sighed he hadnt really intended to provoke his son he tried to smooth it over as i told you it is good to see youbetter than setting eyes on anyone else ive seen lately and that is a fact unless im much mistaken its also faint praise but robert fortunately sounded amused not angry he went on being held superior to john pope whom i suspect you have in mind is closely similar to being reckoned taller than a snake lighter than an elephant or more in favor of abolition than an alabama planter his tone grew more sympathetic it was very unlucky for you father that you had to fall foul of a man who bore you a grudge from the war of secession few us soldiers from the war of secession bear me no grudge lincoln spoke with sadness but without resentment they have their reasons whom better to resent than a man who led them into a losing war suffering in war is hard enough in victory but ten times harder in defeat few of them are so resentful as to want to put a rope around your neck robert said lincoln thought of pope he thought of colonelnow brigadier generalcuster he thought of the bloodthirsty guard hed been assigned who would still have been soiling his drawers when the war of secession ended he didnt answer robert said now that youre here father how do you aim to amuse yourself and stay out of mischief amusing myself should be simple enough lincoln replied for i intend to get myself into as much mischief as i can which is to say i intend to struggle for the soul of the republican party our main plank can no longer be permanent unyielding hostility toward the confederate states we have tried that twice now and blaine is failing with it as badly as i failed the people will never give us a third chance and i see no way to blame them for their reluctance fighting the confederate states england and france we are simply overmatched a conclusion i reached myself some time ago robert said as they rolled into the fashionable north side neighborhood he called home he paused to get his pipe going then asked the inevitable question and what plank would you put in its place justice for the working man and freeing him from oppression at the hands of the capitalist who owns the factory in which he labours lincoln said we have lost sight of the fact that capital is only the fruit of labour and could never have existed if labour had not first existed you intend to convene a meeting of republican leaders and convince them of this doctrine robert said i do lincoln answered simply they will eat you up father the way savages in the south sea islands eat up missionaries who are sent to convert them to a new faith they do not want perhaps they will lincoln said i aim to make the effort regardless for i tell you this son if the republican party will not build on this plank some other party will and will make a go of it general orlando willcox held out his hand goodbye colonel i have enjoyed your presence here and i shall miss you i thank you alfred von schlieffen said and i shall miss you as well frederick douglass said his voice as deep and pure as a tone from the lower register of an organ you always treat me as a man first and as a black man after that if at all you are a man so i have seen schlieffen said as he might have to a soldier who had fought well captain oliver richardson scowled at him he took no notice of willcoxs adjutant but climbed up behind the private who would take him to the train on which hed return to philadelphia south of the ohio cannon still bellowed and rifles still rattled schlieffens driver let out a wistful sigh colonel you reckon the presidents going to take the rebs up on that call for peace this time i am not the man to ask schlieffen told him your own officers will a better idea have of what your president wills wants to do had he worn blaine s shoes he would have made peace on the instant and then got down on his knees to thank the lord for letting him off on such easy terms but that was not the question the soldier had asked him after spitting a brown stream of what the americans called tobacco juice into the road the driver said my officers wont give me the time of day hellfire they wont tell me whether its day or night i was hopin you might be different a german officer would not give one of his common soldiers the time of day either a german common soldier would not expect to get the time of day from one of his officers the american private sounded aggrieved that he was not made privy to all his superiors opinions and secrets americans schlieffen thought sometimes let the notion of equality run away with them he and a couple of us officersone with his arm in a sling the other walking with the aid of a crutchhad a firstclass car to themselves one of the americans produced a bottle they were both drunk by the time the train left indiana for ohio they offered to share the whiskey with schlieffen and seemed surprised when he said no once theyd passed it back and forth a few times they forgot he was there that suited him fine till they started to sing from them on work got much harder he persevered minister von schlozer would need a full report on the battle of louisville to send to bismarck schlieffen himself would need an even fuller one to send to the general staff the report did not go so well as he would have liked and the musicfor lack of a suitably malodorous wordwas not the only reason parts flowed smoothly as long as he was talking about matters tacticalthe effects of breechloading rifles and breechloading artillery on the battlefieldhe wrote with confidence that was part of what the chancellery and the general staff had to have but it was only part he sighed he wished the strategic implications of the louisville campaign were as easy to grasp as those pertaining to tactics that breechloaders and improved artillery gave the defensive a great advantage was obvious so strategists had been sure before the outbreak of the war and so it proved perhaps to a degree even greater than they had envisioned what remained unclear while at the same time remaining vitally important was what if anything an army taking the offensive could do to reduce the defenders advantages unfortunately he wrote the us forces did not conduct the campaign in such a way as to make such analysis easy as they took little notice of the principles of surprise and misdirection based on what i observed i can state with authority that headlong assaults against previously readied positions even with artillery preparation by no means to be despised is foredoomed to failure regardless of the quality of the attacking troops which was also high he sighed again every us campaign he had studied both here and in the war of secession had a ponderous obviousness to it like mcclellan before him willcox seemed to have taken the elephant as his model if he smashed to pieces everything between him and his goal he could knock down the tree reach out with his trunk and pluck off the sweet fruit no us general seemed to have figured out that if he went around the tree instead of straight at it the terrain might be easier than that right in front of it and the fruit might fall of its own accord the confederates understood as much even if their opponents didnt robert e lee hadnt gone straight for washington dc in no hed moved up into pennsylvania and forced the usa to respond to his moves in a fluid situation lee seemed to have been blessed with an imagination the only hint of such a feature us commanders displayed was in their fond belief that they could batter their way through anything and that had proved more nearly a madmans delusion than healthy imagination schlieffen wrestled with his reports till evening and then after dark by gaslight by that time the american officers had stopped singing having drunk themselves into a stupor they were snoring instead that racket was if anything even worse than the other had been which schlieffen hadnt reckoned possible they were monstrously hung over the next morning an indication to schlieffen that god did indeed mete out justice in the world in short order they put his faith to the test one of them pulled a new bottle of whiskey from his carpetbag and they got drunk all over again this time schlieffen was tempted to get drunk with them if for no other reason than to blot out their raucous voices satan sent temptations to be mastered he mastered this one he sent up a hearty prayer of thanksgiving when late that second night the train pulled into philadelphia gloating at the sad state of the two us officers was something less than perfectly christian no man he told himself was perfect gloat he did a driver waited to take him back to the sausage manufacturers establishment when the fellow greeted him in german he automatically replied in english then feeling foolish he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand please excuse me he said in his native tongue not only have i used nothing but english lately i am so tired i can hardly put one foot in front of the other lch verstehe hen oberst the driver answered reassuringly bitte kommen sie mit mir schlieffen did come with the driver he fell asleep in the carriage and then once back in a proper bed for the first time since his departure did as good an imitation of a dead man as was likely to be found this side of the grave when he awoke a glance at his pocket watch sent him leaping from that soft inviting bed in something close to horror it was nearly eleven kurd von schlozer waved aside his mortified apologies think nothing of it colonel the german minister to the united states said i understand that a man returning from arduous service on his countrys behalf is entitled to a night in which to recover himself reminding schlieffen he had done his duty was the best way to restore him to good humor thank you for your patience with me your excellency he said now i have been away from newspapers and the telegraph for two days has president blaine yet answered the new confederate call for peace schlozer shook his head a slow mournful motion he has not said yes he has not said no i spoke with him yesterday urging him as i have urged him beforeto accept these terms before he finds himself forced to accept terms far worse and what did he say what could he say schlieffen asked he actually said little the german minister replied i do not think he believes any longer he can win this war but i do not think he believes he and his party can afford the embarrassment of admitting they are defeated in a war they began either their coasts arc bombarded and sacked their lakeside cities are shelled they are beaten on the border of the provinces whose annexation they are trying to prevent they are invaded from the north their own invasion of the enemys territory is one of the bloodiest failures in all the history of war if this is not defeat god keep me from it colonel did i think you mistaken be sure i would say as much schlozer answered what docs blaine say how does he justify going on with a war he cannot win schlieffen asked he says the united states because they are still standing are not beaten kurd von schlozer said how to turn this into anything anyone might recognize as a victory is beyond me it is also beyond him although he will not admit as much what can be done to make him see what is so schlieffen asked the only reason he has not had to pay fully for his folly is that the united states are too large to be devoured at a gulp i understand this believe me schlozer said blaine understands it too he is not altogether a fool but he reckons that size is an advantage and a reason to keep fighting and he is so full of hate for great britain and for france for aiding his enemies that he has let his hatred cloud his mind and keep him from thinking clearly being so large has helped russia many times schlieffen said it is indeed a factor to be reckoned with but the russians use it by letting invaders plunge deep into their land and by fighting them only when and where they choose thus did napoleon come to grief and the swedes before him it is our own greatest concern should we ever have to fight the russian empire but invasion here is no more than a minor issue and was undertaken only after the united states rejected president longstreets peace offer the first time he made it schlozer said yes the confederates have adopted a strategy of the defensive which suits what the new weapons can do schlieffen agreed full details will appear in my report longstreet is clever to hold to this strategy even when he could gain more for the moment by abandoning it longstreet is clever the german minister to the usa repeated i have heardyou need not ask wherethat some confederate generals strongly advocate imposing a more punishing peace on the united states and a large invasion of the usa to force its acceptance longstreet resists this proposal and imposes his policy on government and army both this is what the head of a government is supposed to do schlieffen said for that matter your excellency president blaine has imposed his policy on the government and army of the united states so he has colonel kurd von schlozer said so he has the other thing a head of government is supposed to do however is choose a wise policy to impose both concerns are important for if the policy itself is misconceived it will fail no matter how vigorously it is imposed sometimes in fact a misconceived policy will fail more spectacularly the more vigorously it is imposed schlieffen considered that his main concern was devising policy not seeing that it was carried out after a bit of thought he inclined his head to the german minister to the united states your excellency i think you may be right on one side of jeb stuart stood senor salazar the alcalde of cananea he had forgotten his english and was screaming at the commander of the department of the transmississippi in rapidfire spanish at stuarts other side stood geronimo and chappo geronimo was shouting in the apache language far too fast for chappo to hope to translate every so often the old indian who understood and spoke spanish would break into that language to respond to something salazar had said surrounded by unintelligible cacophony stuart turned to major horatio sellers and said good godi think id sooner deal with camels after his wild ride in the direction of janos and back again that was a statement of profound distress indeed his aidedecamp nodded at least camels dont form factions sir nice to think theres something you can say for the brutes stuart raised a hand gentlemen please he began neither the apaches nor the alcalde paid any attention to him he drew his pistol and fired it into the air while the report still echoed he shouted shut up all of you at the top of his lungs that did the trick at least for the moment into the sudden silence major sellers said weve been trying to sort out just what the devil happened here since the day you rode out of town sir the only thing i can tell you even now is that the indians and the mexicans would have had a battle of their own if our own boys hadnt been keeping em apart ever since he shook his head you listen to one story and then you listen to the other story and its as though theyre talking about gunpowder and gritsyou wouldnt believe both yarns started from the same place you try to listen to both stories at the same time and all you get is a headache worse than the one mescal gives you stuart said salazar followed that he nodded after chappo translated it for geronimo the ghost of a smile appeared on the medicine mans facebut only the ghost and only for a moment stuart went on the people of cananeaall the people of sonora and chihuahua are now the subjects of the confederate states of america we will protect them from anyone who troubles them in any way senor salazar looked smug before he could say anything though stuart continued the apaches arc our allies who have fought alongside us and bled alongside us we will also protect them from anyone who troubles them in any way how in blazes were going to do both those things at once major sellers muttered under his breath resolutely stuart pretended not to hear that at the moment he didnt know how the confederate states were going to do both those things at once either he did know they would have to do both of them if they were going to administer chihuahua and sonora feeling rather like king solomon listening to the two women claiming the same baby he said lets see if we can sort this out and keep the peace here i want to hear these stories one at a time digging in his pocket he produced a fiftycent piece tossed it in the air and caught it its tails senor salazar you go first the alcalde glared venomously at geronimo and chappo he was bolder around them than he had been when they and the confederates first came to cananea no doubt because hed seen that the confederates would not let the apaches harm him or his people they are animals he hissed why should we live at peace with them they do not know what peace means you are the ones who break oaths chappo shouted not waiting for any response from his father one at a time stuart held up his hand again no insults from either side just tell me what you say happened senor salazar go on gracias salazar said with dignity here i will tell you the precise truth so you will know the lies of the indios when you hear them jeb stuart coughed the alcalde sent him a look almost as venomous as the one he was aiming at the apaches but then went on these indios he visibly swallowed something harsherinvaded my village drunk on mescal stole away three of its finest and loveliest virgins and ravaged them over and over like the he checked himself again one is now dead of what they did to her and the other two have both tried to hang themselves since is it any wonder we are outraged if thats what happened no stuart turned to chappo and geronimo that is a hard charge against you what have you got to say about it chappo had been translating the alcalde remarks for his father now when geronimo spoke he did the same for stuart my father says cananea has never had three virgins in it not here not here and not here either he pointed in turn to his crotch his mouth and his backside senor salazar gobbled in fury and looked about ready to explode no insults stuart said sternly if he felt like guffawing his face never found out about it go on geronimo spoke again again chappo translated my father says three putas came to our tents i do not know how to say putas in english women who give you their bodies if you give them something whores major sellers said succinctly whoresthank you chappo said he collected english words the way his cousin batsinas collected artisans tricks batsinas had made himself a pretty fair blacksmith in a few months time and was always trying to trade for new tools stuart took that as a good sign a sign that the apaches could with patience be civilized perhaps with the patience of job he thought before chappo could apply his new vocabulary salazar erupted again shouting lies lies all lies he let you speak stuart told him you will let him speak or i will decide this case for him on the spot do you understand ever so reluctantly the alcalde composed himself stuart nodded to chappo and geronimo again through his son geronimo said like i say these three whoreschappo pronounced the word with care it did not usually getcame to our tents they had mescal with them some of my warriors enjoyed them yes and gave them silver it could be even gold for their bodies and for the mescal after a bit the old medicine man added our women do not make free of themselves like this and if they do we cut off the tip of their nose ought to do that in new york city major sellers said with a coarse laugh sure would be a lot of ugly women there in that case the biggest city in the usa had in the confederate states the name of being the worlds chiefest center of depravity however much stuart agreed with his aidedecamp he waved him to silence then he asked geronimo how did the woman of cananea come to die during all this she is not dead the apache leader answered she fell in love with one of my men and they ran off together bring them back stuart said send men after them if you can prove this you had better do it chappo translated for geronimo but then sounding worried spoke for himself the woman will say the man took her away by force whether it is true or not she will try to take the blame off herself it could be stuart said in neutral tones in fact he thought it likely no oneconfederate yankee mexican indianwas fond of accepting blame he turned to senor salazar who are the two women who did come back to cananea and where do they live one is guadalupe lopez her familys house is by the plaza the alcalde answered the other poor victim of the indios desires is carmelita fuentes she lives on the edge of the town by the road toward janos thank you sir stuart tugged at his beard as he thought after a few seconds he said to major sellers send men to both these houses see if there are any unusual amounts of us gold and silver coins in them the apaches have been doing a lot of looting up in new mexico territory if they have silver and gold to spend on women thats the money theyll be spending yes sir his aidedecamp beamed thats very clever sir now salazar was the one who spoke in tones of alarm i must remind you general cananea has since a long time traded with los estados unidos much money of that country is in this town you must not be surprised to find it in many homes it could be stuart said as neutrally as he had toward chappo well find out any which way the same as well find out whether the apaches bring in this other girl of yours and what she says when they do the alcalde bowed i will go with your soldiers to the houses of these two poor women and aid them in any way i have the power to do you will do nothing of the sort you will stay here with me stuart put the snap of command in his voice the last thing he wanted was salazar telling the women and their families what to do and what to say he let the alcalde save face by adding i have men who speak spanish doing this will be good practice for them under the circumstances salazar could only acquiesce he looked very unhappy doing it geronimo and chappo looked unhappy too seeing that stuart realized nobody knew exactly what had passed between the women of cananea and the apaches and indians and mexicans both feared finding out exactly what had passed would show them in a bad light horatio sellers had been thinking along the same lines when he came back from sending soldiers into cananea he spoke to stuart in a low voice what do you want to bet we find out the greasers were whores and the redskins did ravage em wouldnt surprise me one bit stuart answered also almost whispering they arent sure who did what but they were sure they were ready to kill each other on account of it were going to need more regulars in the army than we used to just because of these two provinces well need to patrol the border with the yankees well need to patrol the new border with the empire of mexico and well need to patrol every foot of ground in between unless we want fights like this one almost was to break out three times a week god help the secretary of war when he tries to explain that to congress sellers said god help congress if they dont listen stuart returned whether the congressmen in distant richmond would listen was anyones guess if they didnt the noise would get louder soon stuart was sure of that after a couple of hours the soldiers who had searched the lopez and fuentes houses reported to stuart we found five us silver dollars at one place sir and two us quartereagles at the other sir said the lieutenant whod led them five dollars at each place more than those mexican sluts are worth major sellers muttered as if by accident stuart trod on his toe doesnt prove anything not really the commander of the transmississippi said we are close to the us border the women still insist they were violated at the lieutenants nod stuart sighed all right lets see if the other one turns up if she doesnt then i reckon we have to believe the alcalde but shemaria guerrero was her namedid indeed turn up four days later once back in cananea she loudly proclaimed the outrages the apache in whose company she was found had inflicted on her the warrior in question a stalwart brave named yahnozha as loudly insisted on her willingness she wasnt bruised and battered and beaten but she declared shed been too terrified to resist yahnozha said she hadnt wanted to resist impasse stuart hated impasses he hated ambiguity of any kind the older he got the more ambiguity he saw in the world he hated that too in a battle by god you know whos won and whos lost he complained to his aidedecamp thats what war is good for yes sir sellers agreed but what do we do now since nobody here knows anything and nobody much wants to find out convince the apaches and the mexicans to forget this time since nobody is sure about it stuart said thats all i can think of now next time they quarrel maybe who did what to whom will be a little clearer i hope to heaven it is i tell you that he did his best to keep the peace between allies and subjects time helped too when they hadnt flown at each others throats for a while he decided they probably wouldnt not over this he wished he could believe either side would really forget it try as he would he had no luck with that chapter f rederick douglass train pulled into chicago at the south side depot on the corner of state and twelfth streets looking out the window at the hurlyburly on the platform douglass was forcibly reminded that while the army of the ohio butted heads with the confederates at louisville most of the united states kept right on with the business on which they had been engaged before the war began after seeing nothing but blue uniforms for so long save only during that brief appalling interlude when he saw gray and butternut uniforms instead douglass blinked at the spectacle of checked and houndstooth and herringbone sack suits and brightly striped shirts on men and at the fantastic unfunctional cut and bright colors of womens clothes truly this was a different world from the one hed just left carrying his suitcases he made his way to the waiting line of parmelees omnibuses the driver who was taking a feed bag off a horses head looked at him with something less than delight what would you be wanting he asked brogue and carroty head of hair alike proclaiming him an irishman to go to the palmer house douglass replied evenly as they often did his deep rolling voice and educated accent went some way toward making up for the color of his skin so did his destination one of the two best hotels in chicago instead of snarling at him to take himself elsewhere the omnibus driver after a visible pause for thought said nothing more than fare is fifty cents have you got fifty cents lurked behind the words as it would not have were the driver addressing a white man with practiced carelessness douglass tossed him a halfdollar ive been there before he said the driver plucked the coin out of the air as if it would vanish if he let it touch the ground douglass boarded the halffull omnibus the driver stared at him as if wondering how much he could get away with douglass looked back with imperturbability as practiced as the carelessness the irishmans shoulders slumped he picked up douglass bags and heaved them a little harder than he might have into the boot at the rear of the omnibus before long all the seats on the conveyance were takenexcept the one next to frederick douglass he wondered how many times hed seen that over the years more than he could count certainly the driver evidently reckoned that last seat would not be filled for he climbed up into his own place flicked the reins and got the omnibus rolling above the streets telegraph wires were as thick as vines in the jungle palmer house the driver shouted when he got to the hotel which occupied the block on monroe between state and wabash the entrance lying on the latter street douglass a couple of other men and a woman got off the omnibus douglass tipped the driver a dime for getting his bags out of the boot then went inside the lobby was a huge hall with a floor of multicolored marble tiles spittoons rang to wellaimed expectorations poorer shots gave the marble new less pleasant hues western union boys and letter carriers hurried through the hall in all directions to douglass relief he had no trouble with his reservation room the desk clerk said and handed him a key with that number stamped on it the fellow looked back at the great grid of pigeonholes behind the front desk yes i thought sotheres a letter waiting for you thank you douglass took the envelope which bore his name in a script long familiar the note inside was to the point if you are not too tired it read meet me for supper at seven tonight in the hotel restaurant we were in at the birth let us pray we are not to be in at the death as usual the signature ran the cross stroke of the initial of the christian name into the beginning of the first letter of the surname a lincoln help you with anything the desk clerk asked only in reminding me whether i remember correctly that the entrance to your restaurant is on the state street side of the building douglass replied yes thats right the clerk nodded he wasnt calling douglass sir but in all other respects seemed polite enough the negro discounted slights far worse than that he went upstairs unpacked and took a bath in the tin tub down at the end of the hall refreshed he went back to his room relighted the gas lamp above the desk and wrote letters and worked on a newspaper story till it was time to join the former president for supper at the palmer house restaurant the maitre d gave him a fishy stare i am to dine with mr lincoln he said and the ice began to break up a discreetly passed silver dollar made the fellow as obsequious as any confederate planter could have wanted in a slave lincoln was already seated when douglass came up he unfolded to his full angular height like a carpenters jointed ruler good to see you fred he said and held out his big bony hand douglass took it its been too long he said but neither of us is in fashion these days and so we both have to work harder just to make our voices heard that leaves too little time for sociability aint it the truth lincoln said in the rustic accents of his youth well sit yourself down well get outside some supper and then well hash this out and see what we come up with an excellent proposal douglass did sit then examined the menu he spoke with firm decision i shall have a beefsteak if i cant get a good one in chicago they have vanished off the face of the earth i had beef last night so i believe ill order the roast chicken lincoln said considering what we shall be about over the next few days though i wonder whether cooked goose wouldnt be a better choice surely things have not come to such a pass douglass said lincoln looked at him lincoln in fact looked through him the expresident said not a word douglass feeling himself flush was glad his brown skin kept that from showing when the waiter came round to see what the two men wanted he reckoned the interruption not far from providential his beefsteak when in due course it arrived occasioned another interruption a rapturous one across the table from him lincoln methodically demolished half a chicken both men drank whiskey with their meals how you stay so lean with such an appetite is beyond me douglass said patting his own considerable girth lincoln shrugged i eatand i am eaten he had not drunk to excess any more than douglass had but perhaps it was the spirits that let his frustration with the world in which he found himself come forth to a degree he did not usually permit or perhaps it was something else after one of his selfdeprecating chuckles he said i bear up well in the presence of mine enemies only with my friends do i let my sorrows show having so few friends these days i am most often quite the jolly gentleman he looked as jolly as an undertaker he usually looked that way regardless of how he felt douglass said surely the state of the republican party cannot be so bad as you implied in your invitation to this supper cant it why not lincoln asked and douglass had no answer the former president went on this may be the last supper of the republican party with the way the war has gone i fear youre likely right douglass said i had such hopes when we began it and now his voice trailed away now weve both come closer than we would have liked to making the acquaintance of the hangman lincoln said and douglass winced and nodded lincoln continued but that is not what i meant our party would face hard sledding and face it soon even had the war gone as we should have liked you are i believe too much the pessimist douglass said had we succeeded in forcing the confederate states to disgorge chihuahua and sonora republican strength would have been assured for years to come but lincoln shook his head try as i will i cannot make myself believe it for we have abandoned the principles upon which weyou and i and othersfounded the party in the first place when was the last time you heard a republican speak up for a fair shake for the working man or for justice and equality for all men those are the ideals we espoused when we were young have they changed from boons to evils as we grew old douglass frowned and looked down into his glass of whiskey in those charged heady days before the war of secession everything had seemed possible he spoke carefully since the war we may perhaps have grown too concerned with giving the country back its spine and allowing it to stand tall in the world and what about caring what it stands for when it stands tall lincoln broke in we have forgotten the working man as the capitalist ground him into the dirt we have looked outward too much and at ourselves too little and so a pit yawns beneath the party unless the mass of men believe we represent them and can better their lot they will cast their ballots elsewhere and i for one shall not blame them in their shoeswhen they have shoesi should cast my vote elsewhere too i look outward douglass said i look south to my brethren yet in bondage i know you do old friend lincoln said nor do i presume to condemn you for there your heart lies but do you not see that the factory owners in the united states abuse the working classes in much the same way as the slaveowners in the confederate states abuse the negro it might seem so to a white man douglass snapped but then he softened we have disagreed here for years you and i i ask you abraham where is the factory owner who when a pretty woman in his employ strikes his fancy can abuse her chastity as he wishes his mouth tightened the color of his skin the shape of his features testified that he was the product of such a union lincoln replied where is the slaveowner who when times are slack or when a hand grows old can turn him out to starve without a backwards glance as if he were discarding a torn glove the evils are not identical but both spring from superiors enjoying untrammeled power over those they call inferiors which is as i have long maintained destructive of democracy the plight of the negro is worse and more deserving of attention douglass insisted the plight of the negro in the united states is not far different from the plight of other proletarians in the united states and grows less different day by day lincoln said in looking toward the negro in the confederate states for whom we can do little you ignore both the negro and the white man in the united states for whom we can do a great deal i look to amend the worst evil i see douglass said stiffly which is also the one least susceptible to amendment then lincoln laughed which irked the negro orator and journalist who found nothing amusing in the discussion seeing his expression the expresident explained i went through what they call the lincolndouglas debates more than twenty years ago and now i find myself in the midst of the lincolndouglass debate after some of the things the little giant said about the colored man ill thank you not to compare me to him douglass said but he was smiling now too you lost that election but those debates made you a force to be reckoned with and all that reckoning with me got the country was a lost war and a new unfriendly neighbor on our southern border lincoln answered all that electing me got the party was the assurance it would not elect another republican president for the next generation yes douglass thought lincoln was letting his bitterness show tonight more than he normally did the negro said cheer up old friend you yourself spoke of the king who charged his wise men to come up with a saying that would be true and fitting in all times and situations they gave him the words and this too shall pass away yes and do you know what those wise men were talking about lincoln asked douglass shook his head the republican party abraham lincoln said captain saul berryman looked neither so bright nor so young as he had before the war against the many foes of the united states good morning colonel schlieffen he said wearily he did not bother speaking german as he had before but waved schlieffen to a seat in the outer office general rosecrans will be with you shortly thank you alfred von schlieffen told rosecrans adjutant captain berryman only grunted by way of reply he had already immersed himself once more in the paperwork that had engrossed him when schlieffen walked into the office the closed door to rosecrans inner sanctum did little to muffle the phrases he was presumably bellowing into the telephone yes mr president no mr president no no no im sorry your excellency but i dont think we can manage that what what im sorry i cant hear you that last was followed a moment later by a sharp little crash as of the newfangled machines earpiece being slammed back into the bracket on which it rested when not in use major general william rosecrans opened the door to the inner office and peered out a hunted look in his deepset eyes ah schlieffen the gcneralinchief of the united states said suddenly genial id sure as hell sooner talk with you than with james ghis beard swallowed a word or two blaine thank you general schlieffen said rising and going into rosecrans office what he thought of an officer who would curse his commanderinchief he kept to himself instead pointing to the box on the wall he said i am sorry it did not let you hear well what rosecrans stared then he laughed i could hear just fine colonel what happened was i got sick of listening any time a man asks you to do what isnt possible youre a damned sight better off pretending you cant make him out schlieffen thought of the british admiral nelson deliberately raising a telescope to his blind eye so he could keep from officially seeing an order he did not like with as much sympathy as he could put in his voice the german military attache asked what does the president ask of you that you cannot do he wondered if rosecrans would answer him he wouldnt have answered a question like that from a foreign attache were he back in berlin but the american soldier did not hesitate what does he ask rosecrans echoed what does he ask he asks me to win the goddamn war for him thats what not so much at this stage of things is it his breath stank of whiskey even a sober man though would have been hard pressed to be optimistic at the moment how does he want you to do this schlieffen inquired how rosecrans howled stretching the word out into a cry of pain he hasnt the faintest idea how im the soldier so thats supposed to be my affair have you got a won war concealed anywhere about your person colonel schlieffen i havent sure as the devil if president blaine still wants you this war to win i do not know how to tell you to do this schlieffen said the only question i have is why he does not take the peace the confederates say they will give him and thank god for it when we france beat we from them took two provinces and made them pay five milliards of francs whats a milliard rosecrans asked schlieffen took a pen from its inkwell and wrote the number on a scrap of paper rosecrans looked at it oh five billion francs you mean he whistled softly thats a lot of money ja schlieffen answered laconically thats a hell of a lot of money rosecrans said as if the german had not spoken ja schlieffen said again and then and longstreet wants to take no provincesno no states you would sayfrom the united states he wants to take no money from the united states he wants to take only the two provinces he bought from the empire of mexico and to have the united states say they are his with what he could do these are good terms nicht wahrt oh theyre good terms all right rosecrans said you ask me theyre too damn good its as though longstreet is saying we can lick you any old time we please and we dont have to take anything away from you to make that so itshumiliating thats what it is schlieffen essayed a rare joke if president blaine does not for these terms care president longstreet will them harder make of this i am sure do you not think that i am right he nodded to himself pleased hed again remembered the english idiom in a redhot minute rosecrans said which the german military attache judging by the tone took for agreement sighing scowling rosecrans went on but he cant do that now because that would be humiliating too do you understand what im saying colonel oh yes i understand schlieffen said but in war the way not to be humiliated is to win if you lose a war how can you keep this from happening to you the enemy to be stronger himself has shown hasnt he though but then rosecrans violently shook his head no god damn it the confederates havent shown that theyre stronger than we are as strong as we are maybe but not stronger its only after england and france jumped on our back that everything went into the privy but we of this spoke down in washington before the war began schlieffen said britain and france have been friends to the confederate states since before the war of secession the united states should have had ready a plan to fight at the same time all three countries i remember you saying that rosecrans replied i have to tell you i didnt take it seriously then do you really mean to tell me that back in berlin youve got a plan for war against france and one for war against france and england and one for war against france and england and russia and one for aber natiirlich schlieffen broke in and we think of also austriahungary and italy though they are now our friend and we remember holland and belgium and denmark and sweden and turkey and the gcncralinchief of the united states stared at him jesus christ you do mean it rosecrans said slowly what do they do in that general staff of yours colonel sit around all day studying maps and timetables and lists of regiments and i dont know what all else yes schlieffen answered surprised yet again that rosecrans should be surprised at the idea of military planning we believe that if war comes we should as little to chance leave as we can a lot of chance in war rosecrans insisted cant help it yes he was an american looking for nothing more than the chance to go out in the field of uncertainty and snatch what he could from it yes this is so schlieffen said a lot there is as little as there can be there should be what the united states had snatched from the field of uncertainty was a thumping defeat maybe rosecrans said like a man admitting limburger cheese might possibly taste good in spite of the way it smelled maybe he brushed a pale speck from the dark blue wool of his tunic the more you talk about it colonel the more i do think the united states should send some of our officers to your country after this blamed war is finally overif its ever overso we can take a long look at how you go about things they would be welcome schlieffen said your neighbors who do not love you are allied to the french who do not love us since we have one enemy who is the same it might for us be good to be with each other friends he held up a hasty hand you must understand i speak here only for myself not for chancellor bismarck yes yes general rosecrans nodded impatiently i cant speak for the secretary of state either speaking for nobody but william s rosecrans though colonel ill tell you i like the idea pretty god damn well alfred von schlieffen sat very still contemplating what he had just said the enemy of my enemy is a friend was an ancient truth france so far as he could see would never be anything but germany s enemy france was the confederate states friend the confederate states were an enemy to the united states also unlikely to be anything else so far as he could see real close friendship between germany and the united states made good strategic sense he wondered what minister von schlozer would think of the idea up till now german relations with both the usa and the csa had been polite even cordial but not particularly close would chancellor bismarck want to continue what had been working well enough or would he be interested in changing things if he was a us military mission to berlin might be one tooth of the key in the lock schlozer will have a better idea of the chancellors mind than i do schlieffen thought then he realized rosecrans had just spoken and he had no idea what the general had said i am sorry he said you must please excuse me i was thinking of something else guess you were rosecrans said with a chuckle the judgment trump could have sounded right then and you never would have noticed what i said was ill take the notion of sending officers to berlin over to the secretary of state to see what he thinks of it that is good i am glad to hear it schlieffen said damned if i know what will come of it though rosecrans good humor vanished ever since washington warned us against entangling alliances weve held apart from em of course in washington s day we didnt have nasty neighbors tangled up with foreigners themselves but hes like the good book to a lot of people here even if he was from virginia that rosecrans was himself talking with a foreigner never seemed to enter his mind schlieffen had seen in other americans the same interesting inability to judge the effects of their own words it did not offend him not here he would not let it offend him you will do what you can do general with the officials of your country and i will do what i can with the officials of mine and we will see what from this comes before rosecrans could answer the box on the wall clanged to let him know someone wished to speak with him he grimaced and swore fiercely under his breath but then like a hound summoned to the dinner bowl by the ring of a bell he got up and went to the telephone rosecrans here he shouted into it yes mr president i hear you pretty well right now what were you saying before your excellency a pause but mr president schlieffen quickly realized the conversation with president blaine was liable to go on for some time he half rose general rosecrans nodded permission for him to go he respectfully dipped his head to the american generalinchief then left the inner office auf wiedersehen hen oberst captain berryman said when he emerged rosecrans adjutant had regained enough spirit to try german again ich hoffe alles is mit uh bei ihnen gut yes everything is well with me thank you schlieffen answered how is everything with you before berryman could answer rosecrans bellow of frustrated fury did the job for him god damn it to hell mr president i cant give you a victory when the sons of bitches are coming at us five ways at once yes well maybe you should have thought about that more before you dragged us into this miserable war maybe you should think about making peace too while youve still got the chance the sharp click that followed was again the earpiece slamming down onto its rest schlieffen and berryman looked at each other neither found anything to say after a polite sympathetic nod schlieffen let himself out of the antechamber abraham lincoln appreciatedindeed savoredthe irony of meeting in the florence hotel to do battle for the soul of the republican party here he was doing his best to make the party remember the labourers who had helped bring it to power and doing it in a hotel erected by the pullman company on part of the city within a city they owned factories houses blocks of flats all in the holy name of pullman robert had arranged it of course his chicago connections were far better than his fathers these days the room lincoln could not deny was splendid magnificent walnut paneling table with legs even more elaborately carved than that paneling chairs upholstered in maroon velvet and soft enough to swallow a man gaslights overhead so ornate they resembled a forest frozen in beaten bronze i think we are all here lincoln said looking around the room fewer were here than he had hoped some of his telegrams had gone unanswered some men he had hoped would accept had declined he wondered whether he had enough strength at hand even if everything went as he wanted to turn the party into the path he had in mind the only way to find out would be the event around the table heads nodded there sat frederick douglass with his big frame and white mane and beard as solid and impressive as a snowtopped mountain there was john hay a lighter presence once lincolns secretary then minister to the csa in blaine s administration till war broke out there sat benjamin butler a clever mind concealed within a bald bloated sagging walrus of a body before the war of secession a democrat who thought jefferson davis might make a good president of the united states at its end a us general whod had to flee new orleans in a navy frigate to keep the returning confederates from hanging him without trial next to butler rotund hannibal hamlin fiddled with his spectacles he had been lincoln s vice president and had gone down to defeat with him in but he was a maine man and secretary of state to boot and as such more likely than others to gain the ear of president blaine senator james garfield of ohio sat farthest from lincoln an officer during the war of secession he had risen to prominence as a member of the military courts that purged the army of defeatists after the fighting ended but for hay he was the youngest man in the room i think two questions stand before the house today lincoln said as if he were addressing the illinois assembly the first is where does our party stand now the second and more urgent is where do we go from here where we are is in trouble ben butler declared in his flat massachusetts accent how do we get out of it he shook his big round head the gray hair that fringed his bald pate flew this way and that damned if i know hanging blaine from the washington monument might be one place to start he did what he was elected to do hannibal hamlin spoke up in defense of the president so he did and did it damned badly too butler sneered fighting the confederate states opposing their tyranny is not and cannot be a sin frederick douglass declared but butler had an answer for him too fighting them and losing is as you will know from the invitations i sent you i was speaking in more general terms lincoln said the question i wish to address is assuming the war lost as it seems to be how is the republican party once more to recover its status with the american people by doing as it was meant to do from the outset by championing freedom over all this continent douglass said in aid of that john hay said his voice light and thin after the negros i have heard that longstreet will formally free the negroes in the csa once this war ends his allies are said to have extracted such a promise from him as the price of their aid against us one more reason for blaine to come to terms then douglass exclaimed his leonine features lighting with hope a moment later though he spoke more cautiously if it be true of course you john will be the best judge of us all as to that with my few months in richmond before the fighting started hay said with a laugh full of selfmockery i believe it to be true having heard it from sources i reckon trustworthy but i can offer no guarantee nor even if it is true can i guess how much de facto as opposed to de jure freedom the negroes in the confederate states are to have giving them any at all goes dead against the confederate constitution garfield pointed out that doesnt always stop us butler said i dont see any reason the rebs will lose a whole lot of sleep over it your cynicism mr butler has truly astonishing breadth and scope john hay murmured butler gave him an oleaginous smile as at a compliment maybe he thought it was one lincoln said when a man has no freedom any increase looms large f hope you are indeed correct john the negro unchained will grow in ways the men now his masters do not expect frederick douglass nodded vigorous agreement to that lincoln continued even as the chains may fall from the limbs of the slave in the confederate states so they are being fitted to those of the labourer in the united states standing firm against this we can and shall become the party of the majority once more after the misfortune of the war sinks below the surface of public recollection james garfield frowned i dont see how sounding like radicals will take us anywhere we want to go justice for the working man is not a radical notion lincoln said or if it is that stands as a judgment against the united states but what do you mean by justice lincoln garfield demanded if you call raising a red rebellion the way you tried to do in montana territory if you call that justice i want no part of it i make two points in response to that sir lincoln said the first is that i raised no rebellion red or otherwise made a speech similar to many other speeches i have made over the years if the miners in helena were forcefully of the opinion that it fit the circumstances under which they lived i cannot help it second and more basic is the fact that the people do retain the right of revolution against a government they find tyrannical now you do sound like a red ben butler rumbled his jowls shook with the weight of his disapproval without the right of revolution we should to this day be british subjects revering queen victoria lincoln said we might make discontented british subjects but british subjects we should be if we were still british colonies we would retain the right of revolution against the crown how can we not retain it then against the government in washington in philadelphia you mean butler said on this theory you should have let the confederate states go without firing a shot by no means lincoln said they sought to break and sadly succeeded in breaking a union they did not aim to establish a more perfect one for the nation as a whole a subtle distinction said butler an admirer of subtle distinctions my view frederick douglass said is that while mr lincoln exaggerates the likenesses between the position of the confederate slave and that of the us labourer we may if we so desire use such exaggerations to good effect on the stump that is what i meant to say yes lincoln said save that i purpose making this principle the rock on which our platform stands not just a net with which to sweep up votes when the next election comes hannibal hamlin said if we take this line the democrats will call us a pack of communards and that alongside all the other low things they are in the habit of calling us the democrats lined up in support of property when that included property in negro slaves they have not changed since lincoln did not try to hide his scorn if they start flinging brickbats theyll have to duck a good many too how much good will any of this do gentlemen when we are tarred with the brush of two losing wars in the space of twenty years john hay asked exactly my point lincoln said if we go on as we have been we are surely ruined if on the other hand we make the changes in our course i have suggested we offer the entire nation a new birth of liberty otherwise i fear government of the people by the people and for the people shall perish from this earth replaced by government of the rich by the rich and for the rich the free men who made the united states a beacon to the nations of the world shall be reduced to gearing in the vast capitalist engine of profit i just dont see it senator garfield said i wish i did but i dont no room for compromise in any of this without compromise you cant have politics the brickbats will be flying all right but theyll be real brickbats with real bricks thats the direction whence class warfare comes yes it is lincoln said softly do you think we can avoid it by pretending the seeds from which it springs are not already planted and growing whether we can avoid it is one question hay said whether we should embrace it is another question altogether you mean that john lincoln s voice was full of wonder full of grief hay was his protege hay was nearly as much his son as was robert as far as lincoln could see his own course of thought had followed over the years a perfectly logical perfectly inevitable path and yet the handsome young man who was now an even more handsome middleaged man had not gone in the same direction for that matter neither had robert lincoln hay said i think everyone here with the possible exception of mr douglass feels the same as i do he sounded sad too the way a doctor sounded sad when he had to tell a family the situation for a sick man was hopeless and that he would soon die lincoln looked around the table silently polling the men he had asked to join him in chicago with him they could have swung many in the republican party to his views if they were against him reform along the lines he desired would not come not through the republicans gentlemen think again please he said can you not see that this country needs a new birth of freedom if it is to go on being the wonder and the envy of the world he knew he was pleading the last man with whom hed pleaded was lord lyons the british minister to the united states during the war of secession hed failed then after lees victories in pennsylvania the british government had recognized the confederate states as a nation among nations and with france had forced the usa to do likewise he was failing now too he saw that by the way his comrades would not meet his eyes garfield said lincoln if we republicans tried to go down your road i think you would split the party not in two but in three some would go with you and i expect you would gain a few among the socialists and others who believe in notions even more radical than yours thank you so much lincoln murmured i mean no offense i speak the truth as i see it as you do garfield was earnest sensible in the middle of the road he proved as much continuing some would probably try to hold the party on the course it has now i lean that way myself truth to tell and some would bolt to the democrats and hannibal hamlin added the devil would come down with chilblains before we won another election benjamin butler said it occurs to me that what we may need is not more freedom but a little less compared to any european country this is a land full of bombflinging anarchists were so damned free weve thrown two wars away because we did not properly prepare for either of them take germany nownothing in germany but coal and potatoes far as the eye can see but theyve got discipline there by god and theyre the strongest power on the continent i wouldnt go so far as mr butler hay said but i am compelled to believe there is some truth in what he says hamlin nodded so did garheld lincoln discovered hed only thought he knew despair he turned to frederick douglass what of you fred he asked douglass had less political clout than any of the others but more moral authority after staring for a while at something only he could see he answered my own people both in the confederate states and in the united states need more freedom not less i must believe the same also holds true for white men had he stopped there he would have aided lincoln but he went on neither am i convinced that taking the republican party into the streets so to speak is the way to gain a majority for it let me ask the question another way lincoln said other than taking the republican party into the streets how is it to gain a majority only sixteen years of accumulated disgust at democratic fecklessness let us win this latest election things being as they are now when do you gentlemen foresee our winning another one and by what means for close to two minutes no one answered then james garfield said whatever the means may be they shall not include riots and rebellion which would only raise enmity against us like pressure from steam in an engine pressure for change will rise in the united states lincoln said whether it rises through the republican party or outside the party remains to be seen i would sooner see it rise through the party that we may channel it for the nations good and for our own he looked around the table again not even douglass looked as if he agreed with him ben butler said if workers go into the streets soldiers go into the streets too soldiers carry more rifles they always have they always will unless and until they turn those rifles against the men who give them orders they cannot in good conscience obey lincoln said which produced another long silence into it he continued gentlemen i say this with a heavy heart but i say it nonetheless if as this meeting makes it appear likely the republican party cannot find room to encourage change i shall work outside the confines of the party to encourage it for change sure as i live and breathe is coming and though they may not be here today there are those calling themselves republicans who will follow me you would deliberately split the party it was half a gasp from hannibal hamlin half a wheeze no i would not lincoln answered but i will if you try we shall read you out and pretend you were never in butler said the way the democrats have campaigned against you ever since the war of secession we might be better off reading you out an ostrich may bury its head in the sand and pretend the lion is not there lincoln said will that keep the lion from enjoying a supper of ostrich butler got to his feet since he was short and squat drawing himself up to his full height was less impressive than it might have been otherwise but he did his best i think we have heard enough he said thank you for inviting us here mr lincoln i expect each of us can find his own way out his own way back to his hotel and his own way home one by one the republican leaders filed past lincoln and toward the door as john hay went by the expresident softly asked et tu john et ego mr lincoln hays voice was sad but it was firm like the others even frederick douglass he left without a backwards glance lincoln stood all alone in the room poor men had built so rich men might confer in it labour first he said as he had so many times labour first then capital if they cannot remember that on their own i shall make certain they are reminded of it and he left too his back straight his stride determined he had been a whig he wasno he had beena republican now they have lost the war general thomas jackson told major general e porter alexander if they cannot realize that on their own i shall make certain they are reminded of it yes sir alexander was not a young man but retained a large measure of boyish enthusiasm president longstreets tried to make em take their medicine if they wont open their mouth well just have to yank it open and shove the pill down their throats whether they like it or not well put jackson studied the dispositions on the map everything appears to be in readiness everything on my end is sir his chief artillerist answered the guns await only your order to begin tomorrow morning at half past five jackson said the end of the day if god grant victory on our arms should see the removal from our soil of more than half the yankees now infesting it heres hoping youre right sir general alexander said and if you are im damned if i can see how theyll be able to go on fighting after that do not speak so lightly of damnation jackson put a rumble of reproof in his voice to tell the truth though i cannot see how they have gone on fighting so long when so little has gone right for them much as i hate to say it they are braver than i reckoned hasnt done em much good and thats what counts alexander answered absently jackson nodded courage and the goodness of ones cause unfortunately do not always go hand in hand yes sir thats a fact his artillery chief nodded too if douglass taught us anything he taught us that alexanders chuckle had a slight nervous edge and looking out of the other side of the mirror he learned the same thing from us i reckon goodness does not depend on the position from which one observes it jackson said sternly goodness is he sounded very certain he was very certain even so he did his best not to think about frederick douglass he also noticed that e porter alexander didnt reply which might well have meant alexander too carefully wasnt thinking about the negro he went to bed that night with the rattle and bang of rifle fire from the trenches in louisville and to the east of the city and the occasional rumble of artillery in his ears everything sounded as it had since the us flank attack bogged down thus lulled he fell asleep almost as soon as he finished his prayers neither too much noise nor too little would give the yankees anything out of the ordinary with which to concern themselves an orderly shook him awake with the words half past three sir like you ordered yawning jackson got into his boots and stuck his hat on his head the orderly gave him a big tin cup full of coffee strong enough to try to climb over the rim the handle burned his fingers the coffee burned his mouth when he gulped it down ahh he saida gasp of approval im ready now off to meet up with general alexander he reached the artillerist at batteries east of louisville that had come to kentucky gun by gun from all over the csa about half an hour before the show was scheduled to begin good to see you sir alexander said saluting in the dim gray of early dawn he seemed as much a ghost as a man everything is ready we await only the hour as it should be jackson said every so often he would hold his watch next to a lantern time moved more slowly than it had any business doing hed seen that before it always bemused him at last a little after he could see the time without putting the watch up to the light he said the hour is come as if his words had been a signal a great bellow of artillery rose west of him all the guns that had defended louisville against the flanking attack now sent their full fury against the line upon which they had halted the us forces the flashes from their muzzles lit up the horizon as if the sun were rising from the wrong direction e porter alexander beamed isnt it bully sir in searching for a description jackson would sooner have found one in the book of revelations even so he did not reprove his gayer subordinate it will do general it will do us artillery both in the salient east of louisville and on the far side of the ohio was quick to respond all through the fight for louisville the us cannon had given jackson more worry than anything else the united states had brought a lot of guns into the fight and handled them well their artillerymen might lack porters imagination but they were solid professionals their shells would punish the confederate entrenchments in spite of that countcrfire the cs soldiers in those entrenchments opened up on the yankees in front of them with their tredegars a hailstoneontinroof accompaniment to the big guns thunder jackson was sure rebel yells rang out all along the line as the confederates there went over to the attack but the roar of the guns drowned them i pity those poor fellows alexander said they cant possibly break through and theyll pay a stiff price for trying it is the price of victory jackson said in a voice like iron his chief artillerist grimaced but finally nodded the sun rose jackson waited still as a statue while messengers brought word of the fighting to the west as general alexander had predicted the us position facing louisville was more than strong enough to keep the attacking confederates from doing much past getting into the first couple of lines of trenches jackson had hoped for more but he had not really expected it an hour passed turning to alexander he asked do you think they are fully engaged reserves coming up all their eyes turned on the fight right in front of them sir if theyre not they never will be alexander replied with a faint hint of scorn he added they have so much trouble seeing whats right in front of their noses they sure as the devil arent going to look any further jackson considered from the outset he had held this moment in his hands and his hands alone he stared eastward his nostrils flared like a wolfs when it takes a scent he nodded a sharp almost involuntary motion let it begin he said e porter alexander shouted an order all the guns within the sound of his voice let loose that roar signaled the eruption of all the guns the confederates had assembled along the southern flank of the yankees salient up till now nothing much had happened along that flank jackson had kept it strong enough to discourage us forces from trying to shift direction and move against it which hadnt been hard the enemys aim remained focused on louisville alone along with guns hed been quietly bringing men forward over the past few days now as they burst from their trenches and dashed toward those of the yankees he did hear rebel yells through the gunfire a great catamount chorus of them the men must go forward at all hazard so long as any hope of success presents itself he said aloud as he had in the orders hed sent to the brigade commanders south of the us salient if we are to roll up the yankees strong fortified westfacing line we can only do so by an unexpected assault from the flank and rear pour it on boys porter alexander was yelling pour it on jackson tried to inspire his men to the same clear cold despisal of the foe and certainty god was on their side as he felt himself alexander was warmer and earthier at the same time give em a good boot in the ass he shouted come on you mangy bastards work those guns he got louder and coarser from there jackson started to rebuke him then noticed how splendidly the sweating smokestained artillerymen were handling their cannon he held his peace after the battle was over perhaps he would reprove alexander for some of his more blasphemous suggestions and ask that he refrain from using them in the future meanwhile the artillery commander was getting results that counted for more streams of yankee prisoners began shambling past what had for so long been the dividing point between their army and that of the csa one of them a man old enough to have fought in the war of secession recognized jackson god damn you stonewall you sneaky son of a bitch he shouted jackson tipped his hatto him that was praise the confederates guarding the us soldiers laughed so did a few of the yankees some of the us guns north of the ohio shifted their fire to oppose the confederate breakthrough jackson used a telescope to watch shells bursting among his advancing soldiers but for once the us artillerymen were slower than they should have been in responding to changing conditions on the field as an old artillerist jackson also realized the smoke and dust his own bombardment was kicking up hampered the foe in his choice of targets more prisoners came back some of them carried on makeshift litters by their comrades messengers came back too one young man his voice cracking with excitement exclaimed general jackson sir them damnyankees is unraveling fastern the sleeve off a twobit shirt they would run only they aint got nowheres to run to god having delivered them into our hands let us make certain we do not fail to achieve his great purpose by permitting them to slip through our fingers jackson said and ordered more reinforcements forward general alexander was also sending some of his guns forward so they could bear on the retreating us soldiers you know something sir he said this business is a lot more fun when youre moving ahead than when youre falling back i believe i may have made a similar observation myself at one time or another in my career jackson said yankees arent having much fun right now alexander said jackson smiled it was the sort of smile that made bluetuniced prisoners shiver as they stumbled into captivity a messenger ran up sir he panted weuns just ran over the biggest damn yankee supply dump you ever did see put guards around it jackson ordered let no one go into it arrest any who try if they resist even in the least shoot them do you understand me private yyyes sir the messenger stammered and fled to e porter alexander jackson said during the war of secession we lived off yankee plunder because we had so few goods of our own sometimes we foraged when we should have been fighting now with a sufficiency of our own supplies fighting shall come first as it should telling soldiers not to plunder is like telling roosters not to tread hens alexander said sooner or later the philandering rooster ends up in a stew jackson replied the plundering soldier is also likely to end up stewing especially if he pauses to plunder when he should advance before long disarmed confederates started coming past him only a trickle compared to the number of yankee prisoners but too many to suit jackson some of them called out to him in appeal he turned his back the better to remind them they had jeopardized his victory with their greed messengers also kept coming back they were far more welcome since almost all the news they brought was good here and there by squads and companies the yankees kept fighting grimly more often though they gave way to the alarm that could jolt through even experienced troops when flanked and tumbled back toward the ohio in headlong retreat slyly porter alexander asked what do we do if we go and catch frederick douglass again dear god in heaven jackson clapped a hand to his forehead i forgot to issue any orders about him we give him back to the united states exactly as we did before president longstreet i must say convinced me of the urgent necessity for following that course and no other he shouted for runners and sent orders for the good treatment of any captured elderly negro agitator up to the front along with orders for continued advances no news of any such prisoners being taken got back to him no news of any such negros being conveniently found dead on the field got back to him either but then such news wouldnt if douglass had been killed by bullet or shell or hasty noose his body either lay unnoticed where it had fallen or had been flung into a ditch to make sure it stayed unnoticed maybe he was back in us territory when the attack began jackson said hopefully for our sake i pray he was for his sake i pray he was too you say that about frederick douglass sir e porter alexander gave him a quizzical look i do jackson answered he has i would say already done as much damage to our cause as he is likely to do he did not mention president longstreets plan for manumitting negroes in the csa after the close of the war general alexander did not need to know about that not yet jackson wished he didnt need to know about it either over the months since longstreet had broached his intentions to him hed reluctantly decided the president knew what he was doing longstreet as far as jackson was concerned made a better politician than a soldier he was full of the deviousness politics required if he said manumitting the negro would redound to the advantage of the confederate states odds were he knew whereof he spoke sir a messenger shattered jackson s reverie sir we have men on the ohio praise god from whom all blessings flow jackson murmured we wont keep em there alexander predicted the damnyankees can send too many shells down on em from across the river youre likely right jackson said but that they are there spells the ruin of this salient and all done in the space of a couple of hours uh sir look to the sky alexander said the sunll be going down in an hour or so jackson looked and blinked in astonishment where had the time gone very well general in the space of a day i hope you are satisfied he used words that seldom passed his lips i certainly am brother sam vernon perkins said severely over breakfast i must tell you that i am most vexed at the way your dog gobbles everything in his bowl and then steals from the portion allotted to rover you have to remember vern sam clemens answered sutro is named for a politician so its in his nature to steal whatever he can grab and stop calling me vern his brotherinlaws voice went shrill vernon is a perfectly good name and the one by which i prefer to be known all right sam was on the point of calling him vern again as if absentmindedly but alexandras warning glance persuaded him that wouldnt be a good idea he ate the rest of his insipid lumpy oatmeal grabbed his hat and fled the regimented boredom of his brotherinlaws house for the genial congenial chaos prevailing at the san francisco morning call wrecking crews were still tearing down buildings the british bombardment and invasion had ruined already on some sites that had been cleared new construction was going up pine frames of a yellow bright enough to hurt the eye on lots still empty signs promised resurrection almost as fervently as did the bible the otto v jones institute of phrenology shall reoccupy these premises one declared too bad sam said and walked on half a block farther south another sign in the middle of a vacant stretch of ground said when cohans opens up again well have a better free lunch table than ever always a man to prefer fivecent beer and free lunch to phrenology clemens beamed at that two lots farther on again yet another sign offered a simple promise well be back once sam got down to the morning call offices on market street he forgot about signs whats the story on kentucky he called walking in the door us troops still in the city of louisville clay herndon said general willcox says he pulled back from the salient east of town to consolidate for another push somewhere else new york quotes berlin quoting london quoting richmond quoting stonewall jackson saying we pulled back on account of he licked the stuffing out of us that sounds about right even if it did go through more hands than a streetwalker when the fleet sails into port clemens said and whats the latest out of philadelphia or dont i want to know herndon spoke in a monotonous drone president blaine is reported to be studying the situation and will comment further when more is known he went back to his normal voice hes probably hiding under the bed waiting for the rebs to walk in and cart him off why would they want to cart him off sam asked with a bitter snort he does them more good right where he is i dont suppose hes said anything more about longstreets call for peace since yesterday nary a word herndon answered clemens snorted again well i dont reckon we ought to be surprised since the last time longstreet said he could have peace if he wanted it weve been licked up and down both coasts in new mexico and on the great lakes if that wasnt enough to give the man a clue why the devil should he take any notice of throwing away half of whats supposed to be the best army weve got damned if i know herndon paused to light a cigar then added you forgot about montana oh have we been licked there too sam asked you didnt say anything about that dont know if we have or we havent his friend replied not enough telegraph lines up where the soldiers are for anyone to know anything word goes from louisville to richmond to london to berlin to new york to here a hell of a lot faster than it leaks out of a place like that theyve kicked us around everywhere else sam said they being whoevers gone up against us no reason to expect anything different out in the middle of nowhere is there cant think of any herndon said wish i could dont we both sam walked over to his desk and sat down all unbidden he saw in his mind the grimy face of the royal marine who could have killed him out in front of the newspaper offices even though he was sitting his knees quivered we were at their mercy he muttered more than half to himself they could do anything they wanted with usand they did the telegraph clicker started delivering a new message lets see whats gone wrong now herndon said out came the message a word at a time london by way of berlin by way of new york city the british and canadians are saying theyve reached the line in maine that was the british claim line before the websterashburton treaty and theyll stop there and annex it to canada is that what theyre saying clemens raised a bushy eyebrow how does that square with what longstreets been saying about peace without losing pieces of the usa damned if i know herndon said again of course longstreet only speaks for the confederate states not likely the limeys would let him tie their hands they do as they please not as old pete pleases youre right about that sam agreed the british empire is the biggest dog around which is why englishmen can act like sons of bitches all over the world but good god clay now theyve given blaine a reason to keep fighting and one that makes some kind of sense this damned war is liable to drag on forever congressional elections next year herndon said reassuringly with the house of representatives blaine ll get after this fiasco he wont see two bits of money for the army hed have to give up then he should have given up weeks ago clemens snapped he shouldnt have started the blamed war in the first place he shook his fist in the direction of philadelphia i told you so mr president now if only youd gone and listened to me but what the hell no one else does so why should you be any different herndon didnt answer that sam fired up a cigar and filled the space around him with noxious fumes thus fortified he attacked the pile of stories on his desk colonel sherman was proclaiming that more fortifications could make san francisco invulnerable to attack from the sea sam scribbled a note at the bottom of the article comments about stolen horses and locked barn doors would seem to fit here edgar leary had covered mayor sutros latest pronunciamento about the urgency of rebuilding what the royal navy and marines had devastated sam devastated learys prose shelling adjectives and bayoneting adverbs he had a scrawled suggestion for a further line of development on this piece too the faster we rebuild the less anyone checks on how much money gets spent and on who spends it it will stick in somebodys pockets odds are those of some of his honors chums whose find out and well shake this city harder than any earthquake ever did he didnt think leary could or would find out adolph sutro had proved adept at covering his tracks and those of his henchmen but it would give the kid something to do and keep leary out of his hair for a while which wasnt the worst bargain in the world and leary even if he couldnt write for beans was pretty good at getting to the bottom of things the rest of the pieces were routine a looter caught in the act and shot dead the usual rash of robberies and burglaries and assaults and praise for the entertainments offered in those theaters to which the royal marines had not applied the most incendiary form of dramatic criticism having covered both the policecourt circuit and the theaters in his time clemens knew how hard it was to breathe life into reports concerning them after marking the copy with a relatively gentle hand he passed it on to the typesetters that done he pulled out a blank sheet of paper inked his pen anew and did not write he knew what he wanted to say he knew what he needed to say hed been saying it ever since the war broke out and suggesting it before the war broke out what point to doing it again if your editorials sounded the same day after day after day how did that differ from touring the police courts and recording the neverending human folly and viciousness they memorialized at last he found a way no wifebeater ever born he muttered no wifebeater with the worst will in the world does a millionth part of the harm james g blaine caused with only good intentions that scornful grumble gave him a title for the editorial that would not write itself good intentions he printed in block capitals at the top of the page the title gave him an opening sentence we know what road is paved with good intentions what we need to do now is take a long hard look at how the united states found themselves on that road and how they will be able to get off it again without becoming too badly scorched in the doing heaven and the infernal regions both know there is blame and to spare to go around ever since the voters in their wisdom threw abe lincoln out on his carafter in their wisdom electing him four years earlier and thus proving what a remarkably changeable commodity wisdom can be quicksilver wont touch it and not a single nor even a married woman in the electorate to blame it onafter heaving lincoln over the side i say we spent the next many years electing democrats whose notion of statecraft as best anyone can tell was to bow down to richmond as the pious mussulman bows in the direction of mecca and the voters saw this and said that it was good and richmond said it was pretty good too and gobbled down cuba without so much as calling for a toothpick and sent redskins into kansas until any old runofthemill bald man was reckoned to have had his coiffure lifted by the kiowas and the democrats in the white house sighed and wrung their hands and likely knocked back a beaker or three of whiskey on the sly since they had hardly more use for the kansas jayhawkers than they did for the niggers of cuba kick a country or any other dog long enough though and it will turn and try to bite you as we had coughed up abe lincoln so in the fullness of timeif last november will do duty for that articlewe coughed up james g blaine and blaine snarled and blaine growled and like a fierce old bulldog tormented past endurance blaine bit like an old old bulldog though blaine unfortunately neglected to equip the said bite with anything in the least resembling teeth and so having closed his gums round the leg of the confederate states he has hung on like grim death while they and england and france all belabour him with a fine assortment of clubs and switches and bludgeons he will gnaw off the rebels leg or die tryingso his mumbled growls proclaim that he will die tryingthat we will die while he trieshas long since become obvious to everyone save him alone he is evidently an old blind bulldog as well as an old toothless one our own fair city has already paid the price for his bullheaded bulldoggery if he persists how long will it be before we once more play the role of a china shop what will it take to make him come to his senses if by some accident he should have any left he sam hadnt noticed the telegraph clicking away in a voice filled with excitement clay herndon cried blaine s calling for an unconditional ceasefire on all fronts hes thrown in the sponge sam clemens stared at the editorial hed been writing he picked up the sheet tore it to shreds and flung them into the wastepaper basket he was grinning from ear to ear as he did it too chapter o n men george custer shouted are we going to let a pack of damned volunteers get the better of us that made his men ride harder which was what hed had in mind it also made colonel theodore roosevelt who was trotting along beside him display a mouthful of very large teeth in a grin the cheshire cat might have envied im glad you think well of my regiment general custer roosevelt said ive seen worse custer allowed which only made roosevelt s grin wider after coughing a couple of times custer went on colonel welton who is an old friend of mine spoke highly of them and i do begin to understand why he spoke highly of you too colonel hes very kind roosevelt said the grin did not diminish roosevelt knew others had a good opinion of him he had a good opinion of himself too custer wondered if hed been such an arrogant puppy at the same age he probably had as henry welton had said he never would have bulled his way onto general mcclellans staff otherwise now observing the phenomenon from the outside as it were he wondered why no one had taken a gun and shot him for the way hed carried on roosevelt said general didnt i hear that you brought a good many gatling guns up with you from utah territory i brought them custer admitted i left them behind with the seventh infantry they slowed down my riders to an intolerable degree he felt nothing but relief at finally having got rid of the contraptions but roosevelt frowned we havent enough horse here even with your regiment and mine combined to halt the damned englishmen the mechanized firepower the gatlings represent would have been most welcome dont you agree that war is increasingly a business where the side with more and better weapons hold an advantage mere courage is hard pressed to overcome i most assuredly do not custer snapped put brave men in one army and a rabble of clerks and tinkers in another and i know which i would favor why do you suppose the dashed rebels licked us in the war of secession roosevelt was not one to back down any more than custer was how do you think lccs men would have fared general had they gone up against todays rifles and artillery with their muzzleloaders and napoleons that question had never crossed custers mind he was not much given to abstract thought before he could answer the need for him to answer went away a scout came riding up calling general custer general custer the british are coming colonel roosevelt whooped tell me your names not paul revere soldier the scout ignored him sir their infantry is drawn up in line of battle theyve got cavalry in front and on both wings and i spotted a couple of field pieces with em too if we dont get out of their way theyre going to try and bull right through us you mark my words sir if they want a fight they shall have it custer declared sir ive been dogging that army for a while now roosevelt said as i told you before they badly outnumber us your regiment and mine together i mean should we not find a defensible position and let them move upon us colonel if you wish to withdraw you have my permission custer said icily perhaps you will permit some of your braver soldiers to remain sir i resent that roosevelt scowled and went red my men begging your pardon have done a damn sight more fighting in this war than yours have youll not find us backward now very well then custer said having insulted the younger man into doing what he wanted roosevelt if he was any judge would fight his men with no thought for tomorrow to prove his courage and theirs i will want your troopers on either flank to oppose the enemys cavalry while we regulars discuss matters with his foot soldiers yes sir roosevelt s salute was so precise custer wondered if his arm would break after a moment he added i understand that general gordon the british commander is very much a straightahead fighter too is he custer shrugged it mattered little to him he knew what he was going to do past that he didnt much care i intend to send him straight to a warmer clime than this roosevelt liked that the grin came back to his face he saluted again this time as if he meant it rather than as a gesture of reproof and rode off shouting orders for the unauthorized regiment custer started shouting orders too sounds like a big fight brewing autie his brother said i reckon so tom custer agreed not quite the enemy i wantedi still owe the rebs a couple of good licksbut this will do this will do by jingo ill say it will tom custer beamed did i hear right have they got a lot more men than we do thats what roosevelt says custer shrugged hes the one whos been skirmishing with the limeys ever since they came down out of canada if anybody knows what theyve got hes the man fair enough the prospect of going up against long odds didnt bother tomquite the reverse they wont expect us to hit em then theyll be looking to have everything their own way lets lick em autie i sure aim to try custer reached out and slapped his brother on the back they grinned at each other tom was the only man in the whole us army who might have relished a good scrap more than he did the regulars deployed from column to line with a nonchalant ease that came from not just weeks but years of endless repetition on the practice field roosevelt s unauthorized regiment was nowhere near so smooth but the volunteer cavalrymen werent slow either custer found nothing to complain about on that score from the right flank roosevelt waved his hat to show he was ready to go forward custer waved too so roosevelt would know hed seen him the brevet brigadier general turned to the trumpeter beside him signal the advance he said as the horn call rang out the men of the fifth cavalry cheered loudly not to be outdone so did the regiment roosevelt had raised when custer reached the top of a low swell of ground he pointed ahead and cried out there is the enemy let us sweep him from our sacred soil as our forefathers did a hundred years ago in the revolution the forefathers of a lot of his troopers had been grubbing potatoes out of the ground of ireland a hundred years before but no one complained about the rhetoric the men raised another cheer general gordon had ordered his army as the scout described cavalry right and left a screen of horsemen in front of the infantry and the thin red line of foot soldiers stretching across the prairie off to the right of custer roosevelt s men shouted idly custer wondered what their colonel had told them the british army disappeared from sight for a while when custer rode down the far slope of the rise he wished the englishmen would vanish as easily when the time for fighting came as it would in mere minutes up another swell of ground he trotted his men close behind thin over a couple of miles of ground the enemys cheer reached his hear theyve seen us he called a moment later he spied a flash and then another one from behind the line of british infantry a couple of hundred yards ahead of him dirt fountained up into the air as two shells landed custer laughed out loud they cant hit the side of a barn boys calmly methodically the british artillerymen served their field guns the cannons flashed and roared again one of the shells fell short the other landed behind custer glancing back over his shoulder he saw a horse down and kicking his troopers cheered once more this is nothing tom called to him youre right he said during the war of secession a couple of miserable little popguns banging away like this wouldnt even have been enough to wake us up he pointed toward the british cavalry ahead by god they do still have lancers i wouldnt have believed it if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes his own men rode in loose formation the lancers mounted on horses that might have carried knights of the round table formed lines that were real lines all their lances came down at once sunlight glittered off steel as one those big horses began to trot what a bully show custer cried nothing but admiration in him for his enemies horsemanship yes and now were going to smash it all to pieces tom replied custer nodded and then felt his face grow hot what they would smash it with were breechloading carbinesmodern industry set against medieval courage maybe colonel roosevelt had known what he was talking about after all custer gauged the range fire at will he shouted behind him and to either side the springfields began to bark he raised his own carbine to his shoulder picked one of those lancers and fired at him the man did not go down custer had not particularly expected him to though hed hoped he would but a lot of troopers were blazing away at the englishmen all along the line of lancers those big horses crashed to the ground men slid from the saddle or threw down their steelshod spears to clutch at wounds the ones who were not hit kept coming riders moved up from the second rank to take the places of those in the first who had fallen as the lancers drew nearer custer felt not fear for he had never known fear on a battlefield but a certain amount of intimidation the big tough men looked ready to ride over the fifth cavalry and trample them into the grass and dirt of the prairie as if they had never been then he shot at an englishman and hit him square in the chest the luckless fellow dropped his lance threw up his hands and slumped dead over his horses neck more and more englishmen were falling as the range narrowed and they could do nothing to hit back none of them wavered though christ theyre brave he shouted christ theyre stupid his brother shouted back reloading his springfield a lancer thundered toward custer he fired at the fellow and missed the lancehead pointed straight at his breastbone in another couple of seconds the british soldier would spit him as if he were a prairie chicken roasting over a campfire he yanked out his colt revolver and fired three quick rounds one of them missed too but one hit the horse and one the rider custer didnt think any of the wounds would kill but the lancer lost interest in skewering him here and there british lancers did spear his men out of the saddle here and there too the englishmen drew their own revolvers and blazed away at his troopers but a lot of the horsemen in red tunics were down and more of them fell every minute flesh and blood even the bravest flesh and blood could take only so much after some minutes of desperate overmatched fighting at close quarters the lancers broke away from the fifth cavalry and galloped for their lives back toward their infantry or away to the wings to shelter among horsemen whose rifles could protect them custer cheered and waved his hat forward men he shoutedthe order he always loved best follow me weve given their horse a good lesson now to deal with the foot he galloped past a dead redcoat then past a british horse with a broken back trying to drag itself along with its forelegs then he and his troopers thundered toward the british infantry who waited in a twodeep firing line to receive them a shell chewed up the prairie off to his right fragments of the casing hissed past his head he shrugged and kept riding every so often along that firing line a redcoated soldier would go down the british held their positions as steadilyindeed as stolidlyas any troops custer had seen during the war of secession as he rode toward the british line doubt tried to rise in his bosom cavalry had had a devil of a time shifting steady infantry during the last war true his men carried breechloaders now but so did their foes the british lancers had been as brave as any men hed ever seen would the foot soldiers be any different he did what he always did with doubthe stifled it here we go he shouted for the united states of america chaaarge as if held by a single man all the rifles along the british firing line leveled on the fifth as if held by a single man all those rifles fired at the same instant a great cloud of blackpowder smoke rose above and around the enemy through it flames thrust like bayonets from the muzzles of the englishmens martinihenrys three balls snapped past custer not all his men were so lucky as to have bullets miss them the charge broke up almost as if the troopers had slammed into a wall men screamed horses screamedlouder shriller more terrible cries than could have burst from a human throat the british infantry fed more cartridges into their rifles precise as so many steamdriven machines they gave the fifth cavalry another volley and another and another the horsemen replied as best they could their best was not enough not nearly the redcoats not only outnumbered them but were also firing on foot rather than from the bounding backs of beasts englishmen many englishmen toppled and writhed and cursed and shrieked the americans though melted away like snow on a warm spring afternoon we cant do it autie tom custer shouted if tom said a piece of fighting could not be done no man on earth could do it well have to fall back custer said and then to the bugler blow retreat but no call rang out the bugler was dead retreat custer yelled at the top of his lungs fall back the words were as bitter as the alkali dust of utah in his mouth so far as he could remember hed never used them before fewer of his men heard him than would have heard the horn but they would have fallen back whether he ordered it or not they now made the same discovery the british lancers had not long before some fires were too galling to bear then tom shouted again wordlessly this time the shout ended in a choking gurgle custer stared at his brother blood poured from toms mouth and from a great wound in his chest ever so slowly or so it seemed to custer tom crumpled from his horse when he hit the ground he didnt move custer let out one long howl of pain the worst of it was that was all he had time for even without tomand tom surely would never rise again till judgment dayhe had to save his force his head swiveled wildly to east and west did the volunteer cavalry know he couldnt maintain the fight if they didnt they would have to face the weight of the whole british army by themselves but nothey were breaking away from combat too falling back to screen the retreat of the regulars that was humiliating even more humiliating was that the british cavalry showed no great inclination to pursue roosevelt s unauthorized regiment had given the limeys all they wanted and then some the boy colonel rode over to custer what now sir he asked as if his superior hadnt just finished feeding his own prized regiment into the meat grinder what now indeed custer wondered without tom he hardly cared but he had to answer he knew he had to answer we fall back on our infantry and await the british attack as the enemy awaited ours he mumbled it was a poor solutioneven with weltons infantry he didnt have the manpower general gordon did but battered and dazed as he was it was the only solution he could find yes sir roosevelt by his tone thought it brilliant dont worry sirwell lick em yet come on men theodore roosevelt shouted weve got to keep the damn limeys off the regulars backs a little bit longer first lieutenant karl jobst gave him a reproachful look sir i wish you would have found a politer way to put that why roosevelt said its the truth isnt it right now general custers men couldnt fight off a sundayschool class let alone the british army you know it i know it and custer knows it too his adjutant still looked unhappy they fought general gordons men most valiantlysmashed the lancers all to bits and hurt the infantry too that they did they charged home as bravely as youd like roosevelt said so did the six hundred at balaclava they paid for it and so did the regulars custers brothers down i heard among too many others we won our part of the fight unfortunately the result is measured by the whole which here proves less than the sum of its parts off from behind him came a brief crackle of rifle fire the british cavalry confident he would not turn on it with the whole unauthorized regiment was dogging the tracks of the us force keeping an eye on it as it retreated every so often british scouts and his own rear guard would exchange pleasantries sir do you happen to know where colonel welton has positioned the seventh infantry this was not the first time jobst had asked the question though normally a coldblooded fellow he could not keep concern from his voice the seventh infantry was his regiment henry welton his commander to whose rule he would return when roosevelt went back to civilian life now though roosevelt had to shake his head i wish i did but general custer has not seen fit to entrust that information to me he rode on for another few strides then asked a question of his own you being a professional at this business lieutenant what is your view of custer the soldier i told you before he came up to montana sir that he had a name for impetuous boldness karl jobst started to say something else stopped and then began again the reputation appears to be well founded after a while roosevelt realized that was all hed get from his adjutant if jobst said anything moresomething on the order of he took a perfectly good regiment and chopped it into catmeat for instanceand word of that got back to custer it would blight the lieutenants career no one could possibly doubt custers courage hed done everything he could going straight into the british but that hadnt been enough and hadnt come close to being enough to turn them back roosevelt sighed well in his shoes i might well have done the same thing with the enemy in front of him he could think of nothing but driving them off i do believe sir that you might have handled the engagement with rather more finesse jobst said roosevelt needed a moment to realize that was praise and another moment to realize how much if a regular army officer felt a colonel of volunteers could have done better than a regular brevet brigadier general that spoke well of the volunteer indeedand not so well of george custer a few minutes later custer rode back to confer with roosevelt even if custer had been overeager in the attack even if the loss of his brother left his face raw with anguish he was handling the retreat about as well as any man could he kept a firm rein on both his unit and the unauthorized regiment and made sure he found out whatever roosevelt s riders could learn about british dispositions and intentions roosevelt found a moment to say im sorry about your loss sir yes yes custer said impatientlyhe was surely doing his poor best not to think of that now we have to see to it that our countrys loss does not include the whole of this force yes sir i wish i could tell you more roosevelt said their cavalry screen keeps us from finding out as much as wed like just as ours does to them custer gnawed at his mustache i wish i knew how far ahead of their infantry the cavalrys got not far enough to suit me unless i miss my guess infantry pushed hard can almost keep up with horsemen once weve joined with colonel welton odds are we shant have to wait long before they attack us you dont think theyll simply ignore us and go on down toward the mines around helena which i presume to be their goal roosevelt said not a chance of it colonel custer spoke with decision we shall be far too large a force for them to dare to leave us in their flank and rear we could and would work all sorts of mischief on them that does make sense roosevelt said and from what ive heard their general gordon is a headlong brawler as i believe ive mentioned once before yes yes custer said again roosevelt bristled at the tone even if custer was not could not be quite himself had the general commanding us forces in montana territory done so well he could afford to ignore what anyone told him the answer was only too obvious had the general done as well as all that he and roosevelt would have been riding north not south but then custer showed hed heard after all if hes so very headlong maybe hell run onto our sword the way bulls do in the arena i do hope so sir roosevelt said custers response let him ask the question in whose answer both he and karl jobst were keenly interested where has colonel welton set up the position that awaits us not far from the teton river custer replied which told roosevelt less than he would have liked but more than hed already known the brevet brigadier general went on he has orders to pick the best possible defensive position we should be in it wherever it proves to be by nightfall there was information worth having if we are well fight in the morning roosevelt said i expect we will custer said he hesitated gnawing at his mustache once more that was unlike him after a moment he went on i am thinking of dismounting my men and having them fight on foot that would leave your regiment colonel as our sole force on horseback i shall rely on you to keep the british cavalry off our flanks well do it sir roosevelt promised thats the sort of job winchesters were made for the unauthorized regiment would never have got close enough to the british infantry to engage them with the repeating rifles whose effective range was not great with springfields custer and the fifth cavalry had slugged it out with the foot soldiers in redand had come out on the short end of the fight i shall rely on you as i did in the engagement farther north custer said roosevelt didnt mention that his part of the force had driven back their opponents custer already knew that he nodded absently to roosevelt and then trotted south to the regiment he had long commanded no sooner had he gone than karl jobst rode over to roosevelt a questioning look on his face roosevelt repeated what custer had said jobst brightened colonel welton knows how to read a field as well as anyone ive ever seen he said hell pick the best place he can find for us to make a stand good roosevelt said a moment later he wished his adjutant had put it a different way making a stand implied that defeat carried disaster in its wake that was probably true here but he would sooner not have been reminded of it as brigadier general custer had said they met henry welton about four that afternoon and as lieutenant jobst had said welton did indeed know how to read a field hed chosen to defend the forward slope of a low gentle rise no one could possibly approach without being seen and fired upon from as far out as rifles could reach and not only had he picked a good position hed improved on what nature provided his men had dug three long trenches and heaped up in front of them the dirt theyd shoveled out the trenches and breastworks didnt look like much from the front roosevelt wondered if they were worth the labour theyd cost so did custer who was arguing with welton as roosevelt rode up welton looked stubborn sir he was saying from everything i saw in the war of secession any protection is a lot better than just standing out in the open and blazing away at the bastards on the other side all right all right custer threw his hands in the air have it your way henry the dashed things are dug and you cant very well undig them but while youve been building like beavers weve been fighting like fiends yes sir i know that henry welton said he nodded to roosevelt and was i right about the unauthorized regiment they fought well ill not deny it custer replied theodore roosevelt drew himself up straight at the praise he thought his troopers deserved even better than that theyd outfought the regulars seven ways from sunday but whatever else custer might have been about to say he didnt say it instead he stared and pointed colonel youve posted all my damnedhe didnt bother with dashed he was exercisedcoffee mills in the forward trench dont you think wed be better off with riflemen there sir i thought we might as well use the gatling guns since weve got them welton answered roosevelt stared at them with interest hed never seen one before they did look rather like a cross between a cannon and a coffee mill welton went on if they perform as advertised they should be well forward i think if they dont we can always bring riflemen in alongside them theyre the only artillery weve got custer said worriedly that means they belong in the rear he looked aroundprobably for his brother roosevelt thought he did not see tom custer he would never see tom custer again not seeing him the brevet brigadier general settled for roosevelt whats your opinion in this matter colonel theyre already emplaced roosevelt answered and theyre not quite like artillery are they sir if youre asking me i say we leave them custer yielded as he likely would not have done with tom to back him have it your way then if they dont work it doesnt matter where in creation they are i reckon that likely myself as you say though colonel welton we can always bring up riflemen sir with your permission im going to throw out a wide net of cavalry pickets to make sure the british dont try anything in the night roosevelt said when the real fight comes ill keep them off your flanks thats what youre here for custer agreed go do it it wasnt quite a summary dismissal but it was close roosevelt saluted and stomped off occasional rifle shots punctuated the night as american and british scouting parties collided in the darkness the british werent trying a night attack their pickets rode out ahead of their main force to keep the americans from unexpectedly descending on them roosevelt snatched a few hours of fitful sleep interrupted time and again by riders coming in to report he drank hot strong vile coffee before sunup as he deployed his men he commanded the right as he had in the earlier fight against general gordons army the left wing was largely on its own he knew he wouldnt be able to keep in touch with it once the fighting started and it would start soon when men found targets they could actually see cavalry skirmishing picked up in a hurry on came the british infantry deployed in line of battle rolling straight toward the position custer and welton were defending roosevelt s men tried without much luck to delay them their british counterparts held them off behind the british line the field guns accompanying the men in red opened up on the us entrenchments custer and welton had nothing with which they could reply the gatlings couldnt come close to reaching those cannon in the trenches the regulars infantry and dismounted cavalry alike took what the enemy dished out roosevelt s respect for them grew that had to be harder than fighting in a battle where they could strike back at what was tormenting them once general gordon has us properly softened up or thinks he has hell send in the infantry karl jobst said gordon let the two field guns pound away at the entrenchments for half an hour his foot soldiers pausing just outside rifle range then the cannon fell silent thin in the distance a bugle rang out the british infantry lowered their bayoneted rifles as the cavalry had lowered their lances the bugle resounded once more the englishmen let out a great wordless shout and marched forward what a bully show roosevelt exclaimed enemies they may be but they are splendid men he raised his winchester to his shoulder and tried at very long range to pot some of those splendid men unlike the luckless lancers the british infantry fired as they advanced their breechloaders made reloading on the move which had been next to impossible during the war of secession quick and easy a cloud of smoke rose above them thicker and thicker with every forward stride they took smoke rose from the trenches where the bluecoats crouched too englishmen began falling their comrades filled their places no doubt americans were falling too but roosevelt couldnt sec that what he could see was the red british wave flowing forward steady and resistless as the tide the redcoats drew within four hundred yards of the frontmost entrenchment within three hundred theyre going to break in roosevelt cried in bitter pain and then through the din of the rifles he heard a sound like none hed ever known before a fierce explosive snarl that might have been a giant clearing his throat and clearing it and clearing it amazing puffs of smoke blossomed in the center of the us front line the gatlings karl jobst yelled somewhere between astonishment and ecstasy roosevelt had no words only awe in what seemed the twinkling of an eye and was perhaps two or three minutes of actual time those steadfast british lines abruptly ceased to exist in much the same way as a slab of ice will rot when hot water pours over it for the first half of that time the infantry kept trying to go forward in the face of fire unlike anything theyd ever met or imagined they dropped and dropped and dropped not one of them got within a hundred yards of the trench after that the foot soldiers those of them still on their feet realized the thing could not be done they also realized they were dead men if they didnt get out of range of the terrible stream of bullets pouring from the gatling guns it was not a retreat custer had led a retreat it was a rout a panicstricken flight a stampede the british surely were as steady in the face of familiar danger as any men ever born in the face of the snarling unknown they broke some of them roosevelt took off his spectacles and rubbed his eyes to be sure he was seeing straightthrew away their rifles to run the faster he spent only a little while luxuriating in amazement then he started thinking like a soldier again after them he shouted after them by jingo they thought theyd run over us like a train did they well theyve just been trainwrecked boys now we haul away the rubbish now his men cheering as if their throats would burst pressed hard upon the fleeing foe the british horse which had been screening an advance suddenly had to try to screen a broken army falling back the enemys field guns fired a few rounds of canister before the men of the unauthorized regiment coming at them from three directions at once overran them and killed their crews captured guns lieutenant jobst said cheerfully thats the true measure of victory has been as long as cannons have gone to war after them roosevelt shouted we dont want to let even a single one get away no maybe one to tell his pals up in canada what it means to invade the united states he fired at an english cavalryman and knocked him out of the saddle easy as shooting pronghorns he exulted north over the prairie went the pursuit as it had gone south the day before the troopers of the unauthorized regiment took rifles away from slightly wounded or exhausted englishmen they passed and rode on after the main body roosevelt didnt think he had enough men to beat them but they were so shaken he intended to try if he got the chance they might all throw down their guns and give up at a show of force and then from behind he heard not one but several buglers blowing halt his men looked at one another in surprise but most obedient to the training hed drilled into them reined in no he raged god damn it no i didnt order that ill kill the idiot who ordered that weve got em licked to a faretheewell halt a great voice shouted george custer who must have almost killed his horse catching up to roosevelt s men to roosevelt s amazement tears streaked custers cheeks not just tears of grief but tears of fury to his further amazement custer reeked of whiskey from twenty feet away halt damn it to fucking hell he shouted again whats wrong sir roosevelt demanded wrong ill show you whats wrong custer waved a sheet of paper whats wrong is a ceasefire with the english sons of bitches went into effect yesterday only we didnt know it we just licked the boots off the shitty limeys we just got my brother killed in a battle we never should have fought and now we have to let whats left of the bastards go home i havent had a drink of liquor save for medicinal purposes in almost twenty yearsnot since before i married libbie do you wonder roosevelt do you wonder that i got myself lit up riding after you no sir roosevelt said and then hell no sir after a moment he added is anything left in your bottle sir not a drop custer answered not a single fucking drop too bad roosevelt said in that case ill just have to find my own frederick douglass got off the train in rochester his wife and son were the only black faces on the platform anna douglass burst into tears when she saw him lewis folded him into a hard muscular embrace good to have you home father he said let me take your bag there thank you my boy douglass said believe you me it is very very good to be home again he gave anna a gentle kiss then stood up tall and straight before her as you see my dear i have come through all of it unscathed dont sound so proud of yourself she said sharply i reckon that was the lords doin a whole lot moren it was yours he looked down at the planks of the platform floor since i cannot possibly argue with you i shall not even try the lord took me through the valley of the shadow of death but he chose to let me walk out the other side safe for that i can only praise his name anna nodded satisfied lewis douglass asked the question his father had known he would ask what was it like sir coming up before stonewall jackson a frown twisted his strong features he laughed ruefully if working with you on the newspaper hasnt yet taught me the futility of asking what something is like and then expecting to feel the answer as did the man who had the experience i dont suppose it ever will if it hasnt yet taught me that futility why should it have done so with you douglass returned what was it like it was frightening he held up a hand before his son or wife could speak not in the way you think either it was frightening because i found myself in the presence of a man both formidable and i judge good but one who believes deep in his heart in things utterly antithetical to those in which i believe and who reasons with unfailing logic from his false premises he shivered it was in every sense of the word alarming they all walked out toward the carriage anna on frederick s arm as lewis put the last suitcase behind the seat he remarked you have said before that it is possible for a slaveholder to be a good man yes douglass helped his wife up then climbed aboard himself and sat beside her it is possible he went on as lewis took the reins it is possible but it is not easy jackson surprised me reckon you surprised him too anna patted her husbands arm i hope i did i rather think i did douglass said and i have what may be great news in chicago i heard that the confederates areno may beplanning to manumit their bondsmen once the war now suspended is truly ended this being a quid pro quo in return for their allies assistance against the united states wonderful news if true lewis said weve heard the like now and again down through the years though and nothing ever came of it who told you this time father lincoln no john hay douglass answered since he was minister to the confederate states he should know whereof he speaks lincoln had other concerns he let out a bitter sigh lincoln has had other concerns than the negro before which i say though he is and has always been my friend in the summer of he drafted a proclamation emancipating all slaves within the territory of the confederate states then waited for a us victory to issue it lest it be seen as a measure of desperation rather than one of policy the victory never came and when our straits indeed grew desperate he let that paper languish having been convinced it was by then too late to do any good i shall go to my grave convinced he was mistaken of course he was father lewis said angrily he looked back over his shoulder in all the years since you have never spoken of this nor has anyone else i ever heard the proclamation was never widely known for obvious reasons douglass answered once the confederate states succeeded in breaking away it became moot and what would have been the point to mentioning it as youll remember the fight to emancipate the negro slaves remaining within us territory after the war of secession was quite hard enough that is so and you may be right about the rest too lewis said but it galls me to think the united states went down to defeat when we still had a weapon we could loose against the enemy frederick douglass let out a hoarse whoop of laughter you say that after the ignominious ceasefire to which president blaine has agreed we have an armys worthno a nations worthof weapons we have not loosed against our enemies in this fight and now we shall not loose them and thats a right good thing too anna douglass said on account of the only thing we would do with cm is shoot our own selves in the leg lewis pointed north toward lake ontario two ironclads flying the union jack steam back and forth out there we arc under their guns as we have been since they first bombarded us we are helpless against them the problem is not only poor use of the weapons we have but also weapons we lack we have now twice gone unprepared to war douglass said may god grant that where we did not learn our lesson the first time we shall do so the second i hope that in years to come smoke will billow from the stacks of the factories producing every manner of gun and munition so that should another war ever come we shall at last be ready for it when the carriage reached the street on which douglass lived lewis had to rein in sharply to keep the horses from running down daniel who was pedaling his bicycle along without the slightest care for where he was going the boy handled the highwheeled ordinary with far more confidence than hed shown before douglass left for louisville too much confidence perhaps seeing douglass he whizzed close to the carriage welcome back he shouted welcome home thank you son douglass answered by then daniel was speeding away again douglass wondered whether he heard even so the journalist softly repeated the words thank you to daniel he wasnt a negro or at least wasnt first and foremost a negro before that he was a neighbor and a man to douglass that was as it should be lewis reined in again in front of the house where douglass and anna had lived so long here we are father he grinned and tipped his cap cab fare fifty cents douglass gave him two quarters and a dime tip to boot he would not let lewis return the money either saying its the best ride ive had since i left home and one of the cheaper ones too all right since you put it that way lewis shoved the coins into his pocket good to know i have a trade i can fall back on at need heaven knows the newspaper business isnt so steady as i wish it were see what you get for not pandering to the most popular opinions frederick douglass kept his tone light but the words were serious and he and his son both knew it he got down then helped anna she felt fragile bony in his arms anxious he asked my dear how are you as the good lord meant me to be she answered to which he found no response she went on pretty soon ill see him facetoface and i intend to have a good long talk with him about the way things do go on in this here world good douglass said im sure he could have made a much better job of things had he had you to advise him anna glared then poked him in the ribs they both laughed together they walked into the house douglass stopped in the front hall the feel of the throw rug under his feet the rows of framed pictures on the walls the infinitely familiar view of the parlor on one side and the dining room on the other the faint smell of paper and tobacco and foodall told him he was home and nowhere else a long happy sigh escaped him are you glad to be back anna asked slyly oh maybe just a bit he answered they laughed again lewis came downstairs brisk and quick and sure of himself ive put your bags in the bedroom father thats settled for you he was a young man still and certain that things were easily settled a small problem solved he moved on to a greater one where do we go from here how do you mean that frederick douglass asked i myself am going upstairs before long to find out if i still remember what sleeping in my own bed feels like if however you mean where does the colored man go from here or where do the united states go from here well those questions require a little more thought only a little you understand i had suspected they might lewis chuckled without much mirth any quick answers before i see to the horses and the carriage you let your father rest anna said with a touch of asperity he hasnt had hisself an easy time of it nothing could have been better calculated to make douglass say i will answera horseback guess before lewis goes back to the horses as i said before the lot of the colored man in the confederate states may improve though to what degree i cannot now guess the lot of the colored man in our own country i see no great change on the horizon though i wish i did we shall have to go on working state by state for laws asserting our rights for the national government having finally broken our chains can go no further without another constitutional amendment and you know as well as i how likely that is un lewis said wryly all right thats not a bad summation for us can you do as well for the country no one can guess where the country goes from here douglass said shaking his massive head we shall have to see what the full effect upon us is of this defeat lincoln believes the white labourer will be pressed down until he is no better off than the negrobut lincoln being white cannot fully grasp all the vicissitudes of being black ben butler if i understand him rightly feels the national government needs to organize us down to our shoelaces to make certain we are never again caught short by our enemies whether the national government can do that whether it will do that whether it should do thatif i could read a crystal ball i would wear a turban on my head not a derby what does president blaine think lewis asked did you get any hint of that in chicago no douglass answered surprisingly little was said of him at that meeting perhaps that was because he is sure to fail of reelection when his term is up perhaps because he has not clearly shown he has any thoughts to speak of past unwavering hostility toward the confederate states and he has bought only disrepute on that policy more democrats lewis said with a sigh more democrats frederick douglass agreed as mournfully anna said you was right the first time frederick now go on upstairs and get yourself some rest you can do that your own self and do it this here minute the rest of itll still be here when you get up shes right father lewis said she generally is douglass answered he headed for the stairway under flag of truce general thomas jackson approached the line where his men had halted the army of ohios push into louisville his guards looked jumpy even though no guns had barked for several days do you really trust the damnyankees sir one of them asked they fought honorably jackson answered if i was not afraid to come up here while the fighting raged why should i fear doing so with the ceasefire in place i dont like it the guard said stubborn still his eyes flicked now here now there lordy they made a hell of a mess out of this here place didnt they he paused a moment in thought course we helped i reckon a call came from within the us lines that you general jackson yes it is i jackson replied to his ear the us accent was sharp and harsh and unpleasant come ahead general the yankee said general willcox is here waiting for you come i shall jackson said he picked his way over broken bricks and charred boards here in the center of louisville nothing but rubble remained the only walls to be seen were those us and cs soldiers had erected from bits of that rubble none of the graceful architecture that had made louisville such a pleasant place before the war survived and president longstreet jackson thought is willing to let the united states off without a halfdimes indemnity his mouth tightened christian charity was all very well but what point to charity toward those who deserved it not a couple of men in blue uniforms showed themselves they stood up a little warily for a long time showing any part of your body was an invitation to a sharpshooter to drive a hole through it one of them said if youd been here a few days ago stonewall no doubt my men would say the same to you young fellow jackson answered he wasnt so severe as he might have been that was soldiers banter from the yankee not outandout hatred a trim young captain in tunic and trousers far too clean and neat for him to have served at the front line came up out of a trench and nodded im oliver richardson general jackson general willcoxs adjutant if youll be so good as to come with me sir when jackson saw willcox he stabbed out a forefinger at him i remember you sir he exclaimed unless im much mistaken you were in the west point class of the year following mineclass of are you not thats it sure enough orlando willcox answered and i went into the artillery just as you did he let out a rheumy chuckle we were all on the same side once we oldtimers another few years sir and no men in your country or mine who served with one another before the war of secession will be left youre right general jackson said we are now separate and grow more separate every daydespite i might add the illadvised efforts of the united states to exert a nonexistent influence upon our peaceful domestic affairs remembering the ceasefire he held up a hand but let that go it is behind us god grant forever your men here fought most valiantly you have every reason to be proud of them the same holds of yours willcox said he paused perhaps waiting for jackson to praise his generalship so he could again return the compliment jackson had not so much diplomacy in him to business he said i am charged by president longstreet to inquire of you when you intend to abandon these lines and withdraw all forces of the army of the ohio from the soil of the confederate states i cannot answer that at the present time general jackson willcox replied i have as yet been given no orders on the subject absent such orders what choice have i but to hold the men in place sir i mean no disrespect to you or to your government but this is not entirely satisfactory if that wasnt an understatement jackson had never uttered one the united states requested the present ceasefire presumably because you felt yourselves to be at a disadvantage this being so i must tell you that we shall not indefinitely tolerate your occupying territory that has belonged to our nation since the close of the war of secession come with me general orlando willcox said and began to walk away from the gathered men of both sides when his adjutant started to come too he waved the young captain back taking that as a hint jackson also motioned for the soldiers who had accompanied him inside the us lines to hold their places he followed the commander of the army of the ohio till they were out of earshot of their subordinates willcox stopped then his boots scrunching on broken bricks jackson halted beside him quietly the confederate generalinchief asked how now sir how now willcox said also in a low voice but with unmistakable anger how now i shall tell you how now general getting any orders out of washington city excuse me out of philadelphia spoke from force of habitis a miracle comparable to that which our savior worked with the loaves and fishes getting orders in a timely fashion would be a miracle comparable to the resurrection i say would be rather than is for i have seen no timely orders this is not as it should be jackson said and tried to decide whether that was a bigger understatement than the one hed made a moment before some such conception had already formed in my mind yes willcox said jackson did not remember any sardonic streak in him but theyd had little to do with each other for more than thirty years and nothing to do with each other for more than twenty maybe willcox had changed maybe on the other hand hed just been tried beyond endurance what am i to tell my president then jackson asked he will suspect your government of having asked for this ceasefire so you could strengthen your position here not as a prelude to abandoning it longstreet would certainly suspect that longstreet and suspicion were made for each other general willcox spread his hands this is not the case the ceasefire requested was on all fronts against all enemies what point to making such a request for the purpose of fortifying one relatively small position from which you must be able to see as well as i we have no prospect for large or rapid advance that is so jackson admitted but then he felt he had to qualify his words i say it is so in my own person you understand how the president will view the matter when i report to him remains to be seen of course general willcoxs laughter was bitter the responsibility for war and peace and in the broad sense for the conduct of the war lies with the civilian branches of government who though who takes the blame when their plans go awry do they blame themselves have you ever seen them blame themselves jackson did not answer in the main he agreed with willcox most professional soldiers in the usa and csa both would have agreed with willcox but not all the blunders in the us campaign in kentucky lay with the civilians willcox could not have more plainly advertised what he purposed doing had he telegraphed jackson ahead of time and his flanking attack had been woefully late willcox went on i do not desire any more fighting here not a man in my command wants any more fighting here if however we are ordered to resume the strugglehe spread his hands againwe shall do so what is the soldiers lot but to obey what do you judge president blaines likely response would be to an ultimatum demanding withdrawal from louisville on pain of renewed war jackson asked i cannot answer that question willcox said it was the proper response but disappointed jackson all the same he had hoped willcoxs anger might lead him into a revealing indiscretion the commander of the army of the ohio went on the only one who knows blaincs mind for certain is blainc and by all weve seen he is none too sure of it either that was indiscreet it might have been revealing had recent events not shown it to be a simple statement of fact jackson said president longstreet is not pleased that you remain here and will grow less pleased by the day i wish i could tell you more willcox answered i am however not a free agent any more than you are sir probably less than you are for i doubt the apron strings holding you to your government are as tight as the ones i am compelled to wear i doubt thatbut then i would wouldnt i jackson said he and willcox looked at each other with wry sympathy soldiers from one side often had more in common with soldiers from the other than with the civilians who told them what to do you have no better word to give me general nothing i can send to richmond to help ensure that we remain untroubled here if i had it i would gladly give it i assure you of that willcox said but i cannot give what i do not have very well jackson s nod was almost a bow i thank you for your time sir and i thank you for your courtesy please do take it as given that should you at any time desire to visit me at my headquarters you shall have no difficulty in passing through the lines and you will be most welcome there you are very kind sir willcox did bow after further protestations of mutual esteem the two men parted jackson made his way back into confederateheld territory he got aboard his horse there entering the us lines mounted might have made him seem like a man who judged himself a conqueror and so he had refrained even if he did so judge himself as he rode south devastation gradually diminished single buildings and then whole blocks appeared as if they were growing out of the rubble his headquarters being beyond the range of us artillery were set among unharmed trees and houses on the outskirts of town and were quite pleasant taken as a whole though louisville would be a long time recovering he wired longstreet the results or rather lack of results of his meeting with general willcox the answer came back within a few minutes will another blow aid in shifting the yankees if so can you lay it on i can he replied by telegraph willcox judges blaine does not know his own mind a blow may restart the war he paced back and forth awaiting the presidents judgment longstreet was right telegraphic conferences were not all they might be after a while the clicker brought the presidents response hammering fulminate of mercury unwise longstreet said we can wait waiting hurts usa worse all in readiness here at need jackson wired i assumed nothing less longstreet eventually answered i rely on you keep me apprised of your situation that last wire made jackson feel good he knew longstreet had sent it for no other reason than making him feel good knowing why longstreet had sent it should have lessened the effect somehow it didnt jackson took that to mean longstreet was a formidable politician indeed he chuckled which made the telegrapher waiting for his reply give him a startled look never mind son jackson told him its nothing i didnt already know alfred von schlieffens office in philadelphia was neither so comfortable nor so quiet as the one he had enjoyed down in washington nor did the german military attache have here the reference volumes hed used there that philadelphia did not lie under confederate guns was at the moment in his view less of an advantage than the other factors were annoyances he hadhe hoped he hadthe books he needed here he looked from an account of lees advance up into pennsylvania the advance that had won the war of secession for the csa to an atlas of the world tracing lees movements day by day fight by fight gave him a fresh appreciation not only of what lee had accomplished but also of precisely how he had accomplished it indirect approach schlieffen scribbled on a sheet of foolscap he had been studying lees campaigns since he came to the united states they were not so well known to the general staff as they should have been when he traced on the map the army of northern virginias movements he saw strategic insight of the highest order he had seen some of that all along now he saw more he also saw or thought he saw how to apply that insight to his own countrys situation up till now he had been blind to that had beethoven had this inspired feeling this dazzling burst of insight when the theme for a symphony struck him for his sake schlieffen hoped so the german military attache felt like a god noting the movements on the map as if he were looking down on a world he had just made and finding it good he underlined indirect approach then he underlined the words againfor him an almost unprecedented show of emotion lees goal all along had been washington dc yet hed never once moved on the capital of the united states hed swung up past it and then around behind it smashing mcclellans army and ending up here in philadelphia before britain and france forced mediation on the usa but washington had been the schwerpunkt of the entire campaign not only had lee taken advantage of the us governments urgent need to protect its capital he had also used the great wheel around the city to gain the confederacy the largest possible moral and political advantages schlieffen flipped pages in the atlas since it was printed in the usa the states of the united states and confederate states came before the nations of europe and were shown in more detail provincialism schlieffen thought scornfully but the maps he needed were there even if toward the back of the book ach gut he muttered the map of france also showed the low countries and a fairsized chunk of the western part of the german empire in the francoprussian war the armies of prussia and her lesser allies had moved straight into france and after smashing french forces near the border straight toward paris that coup would not be so easy to repeat in a new war he had seen for himself how stubborn good artillery and good rifles could make a defense as if of itself the index finger of his right hand moved in a wide arc from germany around behind paris he smiled and scribbled more notes that sort of manoeuvre would make the french come out and fight in places they had never intended to defend and hadnt spent years fortifying and what frenchman even in his wildest nightmares could imagine paris attacked from the rear the finger traced that arc again schlieffen noticed it ran through not only france but also through luxembourg belgium and perhaps holland as well in case of war between germany and france all three of the low countries were likely to be neutral would this manoeuvre be valuable enough to justify violating that neutrality and bringing opprobrium down on germany s head ja schlieffen said decisively whether the general staff would agree with him he did not know he did know his colleagues back in berlin had to see this notion and had to see it soon even if they did not accept it it would give them a new point of departure for their own thinking he was writing furiously moving back and forth between the maps of france and pennsylvania when he noticed someone knocking on the door the knocking was loud and insistent he wondered how long it had been going on before he noticed it how is a man to get any work done he muttered and gave the door a resentful stare when that failed to stop the knocking he sighed rose and opened the door kurd von schlozer stood in the hallway looking less than happy himself oh your excellency excuse me schlieffen said how may i serve you seeing schlieffen contrite the german minister to the united states made his own frown vanish you must come with me to president blaines residence he said perhaps between the two of us we can convince him not to resume this idiotic war must i schlieffen asked casting a longing glance back toward the maps and papers you must schlozer said sighing again schlieffen obeyed while in philadelphia president blaine resided at the powel house a threestory red brick building on third street about halfway between washington square and the delaware river the reception hall was full of rich ruddy mahogany schlieffen noticed it only peripherally he paid closer attention to james g blaine whom he had never before met blaine was about fifty with graying brown hair and beard and would have been most handsome had his nose not borne some small resemblance to a potato he gave an impression of strength and vigor married to good sense those were valuable traits in a leader a vigorous leader without good sense was liable to be more dangerous to his country than an indolent one similarly constituted minister schlozer colonel schlieffensay your say blaine sounded abrupt as if nothing the two germans might say had any hope of changing his mind kurd von schlozer affected not to notice i thank you mr president he answered in english more fluent than schlieffens my attache and i are here to try to persuade you that since you have wisely chosen peace you would do your country a disservice if you allowed the talks between your representatives and those of your opponents to fail i would do my country a worse disservice if i let my enemies ride roughshod over the united states blaine growled but your excellency how by weapons can you keep them from doing this schlieffen asked they have on every front defeated you not in montana by jingo blaine exclaimed with savage pleasure oh yesthe battle after the ceasefire schlieffen said the us press shouted that fight to the skies putting what the us papers said together with what came from canada and london by way of berlin the military attache gathered that the us and british had tried to impale themselves on each others guns and the british had succeeded that shows what we can do when we set our minds to it blaine declared yes your excellencybut what of all the fights before the ceasefire what of all the fights that made you for the ceasefire ask schlieffen said blaine looked as if he hated him he probably did schlieffen bore the hatred of an american with indifference only slightly tinged by regret it was not as if that could matter to him in any important way the president of the united states said i did what i had to do to still public outcry that having been accomplished i am now obliged to seek the best possible peace for my country schlieffen thought of talleyrand battling for france at the congress of vienna after napoleons overthrowand gaining concessions too despite the weakness of his position then he thought again talleyrand was a gifted diplomat something the americans despite their many abilities had yet to produce if only we were not so alone in the world blaine said querulously if only every nations hand were not raised against us that is not so kurd von schlozer said throughout this unfortunate time mr president the hand of germany has been outstretched in friendship and in the search for peace sir you are right about that and i beg your pardon blaine replied germany has done everything a good neighbor can do but germany though she is a good neighbor is not a near neighbor all the nearest neighbors of the united states have joined together in oppressing us as you should have anticipated schlieffen thought as you should have prepared for but that was water over the dam now aloud he said your excellency general rosecrans and i have about this talked germany is not your near neighbor no but germany is to france a near neighbor a nearest neighbor france is now your enemy france has our enemy been and is likely our enemy again to be two lands with the same enemy can find it good to be friends he watched blaine slowly the president of the united states nodded rosecrans has mentioned these conversations to me he said for all their history the united states have steered clear of entangling foreign alliances rosecrans had used that phrase too it seemed deeply engrained in the minds of all us leaders blaine might almost have been quoting scripture your excellency the confederate states have had foreign allies kurd von schlozer said the united states have not when you and they have quarreled who has had the better of it blaine s mouth puckered his cheeks tautened against the bone on which they lay i do take the point your excellency and then instead of merely saying he took it he looked to take it in truth when you fought the french you beat them like a drum the last time we beat anyone like a drum it was the mexicans not much of a foe and a long time ago perhaps then you will to berlin send officers to learn our ways schlieffen said perhaps also your minister to my country will speak with chancellor bismarck to see in what other ways we can work together to help us both perhaps we will blaine said perhaps he can it might be worth exploring at any rate if nothing comes of it we are no worse off schlieffen and schlozer glanced at each other schlieffen knew fellow officers who were avid fishermen they would go on at endless boring length about the feel of a trout or a pike nibbling the hook as it decided whether to take the bait there sat james g blaine closely examining a wiggling worm the enemy of my enemy isor can bemy friend schlieffen murmured blaine nodded again he might not bite here and now but schlieffen thought he would bite nothing else in the pool in which the united states swam looked like food that was certain may we now return to the matter of the ceasefire and the peace which is to come after it schlozer said schlieffen wished the german minister had not been so direct he was liable to make blaine swim away and sure enough the president of the united states scowled the confederates hold us in contempt he said sullenly and the british aim to rob us of land they yielded by treaty forty years ago how can i surrender part of my own home state to those arrogant robbers and pirates your excellency i feel your pain schlozer said but for now what choice have you even prussia for a time yielded against napoleon schlieffen added blaine did not answer after a couple of silent minutes the two germans rose and left the reception hall chapter t he cab drew to a halt by the edge of the sidewalk the chicago street was so narrow it still blocked traffic behind it the fellow atop a fourhorse wagon full of sacks of cement bellowed angrily so did a man in a houndstooth sack suit whizzing past on an ordinary the cab driver said thats sixtyfive cents pal pay up so i can get the hell out of here abraham lincoln gave him a half dollar and a quarter and descended without waiting for change no sooner had his feet touched the ground than the cab rolled off escaping the abuse that had been raining down on it this was a chicago very different from the elegant spacious north side neighborhood in which robert lived people packed the streets lincoln had the feeling that were those streets three times wider they would still have been packed one shop built from cheap bricks stood jammed by another all of them were gaudily painted advertising the cloth or shoes or hats or cheese or dry goods or sausages or pocket watches or eyeglasses sold within most had signs in the window proclaiming enormous savings if only the customer laid down his money now fire sale going out of business shop early for christmas capitalism at its rawest lincoln thought unhappily the weather was raw too a wind with winter in it hannibal hamlin who being from maine knew all about winter had called a wind like this a lazy wind because it blew right through you instead of bothering to go around lincoln pulled his overcoat tighter about him he felt the cold more now than he had in his younger days the wind blew through the coat too he looked around there a couple of doors down advertising itself like all its neighbors stood the frowzy sootstained office of the chicago weekly worker lincoln hurried to the doorway and went inside a blast of heat greeted him because the winters in chicago were so ferocious the means deployed against them were likewise powerful he hastily unbuttoned his coat sweat started on his forehead a bald man in an apron and a visor who was carrying a case of type looked up at the jangle of the bell over the door what do you wan he began his english germanaccented then he recognized who was visiting the newspaper and came within an inch of dropping the case and scattering thousands of pieces of type all over the floor what do you want mr lincoln he managed on his second try the type metal rattled in its squares but did not escape i would like to see mr sorge if you would be so kind lincoln answered as politely as if he were addressing one of his sons clients rather than a typesetter who hadnt had a bath in several days i do understand correctly do i not that he heads the chicago socialist alliance yes that is right the man in the apron said please you wait here uh he looked confused and angry at himself hed probably been about to say sir and then caught himself because sir was not the sort of thing a socialist was supposed to say he set down the type case grunted in relief at being rid of the weight and hurried into a back room a couple of printers and a fellow who though he was surely a socialist too looked like most of the other reporters lincoln had seen over the years stopped what they were doing to gape at him then the typesetter came out of the back room with a lean man in his fifties a fellow whose wary hunted eyes said hed made a lot of moves one step ahead of the police in the course of his lifetime you are abraham lincoln he said in some surprise i wondered if ludwig knew what he was talking about like the typesetters his speech had a guttural undertone to it and i i am friedrich sorge i have had to flee germany i have had to flee new york city democrats can be as fierce in their reactions as prussian junkers but i will not flee chicago hier steh ich ich kann nicht anders i dont follow that lincoln said im sorry here i stand i cannot do otherwise sorge translated martin luther a progressive in his day aiding the rising bourgeoisie against the church and the feudal aristocracy that supported it now mr lincolnwhy do you stand here because it has been made painfully clear to me that the republican party is not and cannot be the party that represents the laboring class in the united states lincoln answered i believe that class deserves representation i believe this democracy will fail unless that class has representation if the republican party is not up to the job then the socialists will have to be friedrich sorge and ludwig the typesetter exchanged several excited comments in german after a minute or so sorge returned to english this is what we have been doing since founding the party ten years ago i know lincoln said ive watched you ive watched your progress with no small interest i would have watched it with even greater interest had there been more progress to watch too many american workers are in love with the status quo to make progress quick sorge said with a grimace it is the same as it is in europe no it is worse than it is in europe in the united states a man who despairs of factory labour will go and start a farm or prospect for gold in the hope of becoming rich at a stroke this can never be an answer but it can look like one and it gives the capitalists a safety valve to drain off revolutionary energy the safety valve will not stay open much longer lincoln said the prairies are filling up failed miners become proletarians in western towns instead of eastern cities or they stay on as miners for the lucky handful who do grow rich and serve as labour in the mines of the big companies yes sorge nodded emphatically so as i say though progress is slow the revolution will come and will throw down the capitalists and their minions you believe the engine is broken and will explode lincoln said sorge nodded again so did ludwig the expresident went on i believe the engine is broken but may perhaps be repaired the republicans would not hear me because i dared to say something was wrong with the engine will you now cast me forth because i dare to say it may be set to rights for a moment he thought sorge would tell him yes and that would be that then the socialist newspaperman said come back into my office mr lincoln we do not need to speak of these things standing here at the counter like men choosing pickles from the barrel the office was small and cramped and dark and full of bookshelves most of the books on them were in german the rest in english and french the word socialist looked much alike in all three languages sorge had to clear more books off the chair in front of his desk to give lincoln room to sit down the desk itself was a disorderly snarl of papers seeing lincoln take the measure of the little room sorge chuckled wryly i you see will never be a wealthy capitalist luckily for me i never wanted to be a wealthy capitalist had you wanted to be one i should be here or perhaps somewhere else close by speaking of this with someone else lincoln answered for the socialists in chicago would have a leader regardless of whether or not you were he now to come back to the question i asked out front will you condemn me for not being revolutionary enough as the republicans condemned me for being too revolutionary socialist thought is divided on whether the proletarian revolution is inevitable sorge said the marxian socialists now believe it is and i am familiar with the division lincoln broke in not long ago in montana territory colonel theodore roosevelt accused me of being a marxian socialist and i told him i had to decline the honor this was before he became a national hero you understand his laugh was as wry as sorges now of course i could deny him nothing of course the socialist answered his voice curdled with irony the only confusion the papers have had is whether to fawn more on roosevelt or on custer if something is before their eyes they will never look farther pah this digression is my fault lincoln said i do apologize for it let me ask my question a third time am i too soft for you as i am too hard for the men of what had been my party sorge frowned in thought i have seen little in the behavior of capitalists to cause me to believe they will not create so much outrage among the proletariat as to make revolution inevitable you have never seen the behavior of capitalists reined in by government regulation either lincoln replied no i have not sorge said i have not seen the second coming of jesus christ either i do not expect to see the one thing or the other while i live and which is less likely i would not even guess here in the united states the power of the ballot box gives the labouring classes a power or the potential for a power that they lacked in the days when marx wrote the communist manifesto and in the places he knew best lincoln said marx yet lives marx yet writes sorge answered in tones of reproof but he does not live here he does not write here lincoln said by what i have read of his writings he does not understand the united states well you have lived in new york you say now you live in chicago can you tell me i am mistaken he gave friedrich sorge credit the socialist gave the question serious thought before answering at last sorge said no marx does not understand this country as well as he might good we can go on from there will you also agree this is true of many socialists in the united states lincoln asked pressing the newspaperman as if he still were a lawyer questioning an opposing witness with the labour problems this country has would you not have enjoyed greater success if you could have figured out how to make the voting man see things your way it could be it is not certain but it could be sorge said cautiously i think you are now coming to say what it is your aim to say say it then i will say it lincoln replied leaving revolution out of the bargain save as a last resort i feel the socialists offer the laborers of this country their best chance to reclaim it from the wealthy if and when i bolt the republican party i can bring some large fraction of its membershipa third maybe half if im luckywith me into the fold here that is not enough to elect a president or senators not yet but it is enough to elect congressmen state legislators mayors and it is a base from which to build when blaine goes down in as you know he will more people will see the republicans are doomed and join our ranks now how does that look to you sorge licked his lips he was tempted lincoln could see as much the prospect of some actual power hit the newspaperman like a big slug of raw rotgut whiskey playing to win was a game very different from playing to agitate slowly sorge said this is not something i can decide at once also this is not something i can decide alone i shall have to talk with some men here and wire others what you propose he dug through the rubbish on his desk till he found a pencil after licking the point he scribbled for a minute then he said if i understand you what you have in mind is yes thats right nor near enough lincoln said when the socialist had finished reading back his notes off the record mr sorge how does it strike you i am more revolutionary than you you are right about that sorge answered but you are also right in saying we have not done as much as we might have maybemaybe i saythis will show us the way this is how the republican party was born more than a generation ago lincoln said antislavery whigs freesoilers knownothings even a few northern democrats who couldnt stomach the extension of slaverywe all joined together to work for a common goal i think this new coalition may do the same in regard to wage slavery i hope you arc right sorge gave him a keen look president blaine will call you a traitor and when he loses the next election he will say it is for no other reason than that you and your followers left the party president blaine is not in the habit of listening to what i say no matter how hard a time i have convincing people that that is so lincoln said sadly remembering john taylors miscalculation i sec no reason why i should be obliged to take notice of what president blaine says especially when from this day forth we shall no longer be members of the same party friedrich sorge pulled open a file cabinet behind his desk when his hand came out of the drawer it was clutching a whiskey bottle more rummaging in the cabinet and in his desk produced two tumblers mismatched and none too clean he poured a couple of hefty dollops handed one glass to lincoln and raised the other high to socialism he said and drank lincoln drank too the whiskey was bad but it was strong to socialism he said brigadier general george custer rode along bare yards south of the fortyninth parallel of latitude the border separating montana territory from canada along with a troop from the fifth cavalry bare yards north of the border not quite in rifle range but not far out of it a troop of redcoated british cavalrymen rode along dogging his trail neither side had fired a shot since general gordon took his mutilated army of invasion back over the border both sides were ready for his part custer was eager several reporters rode along with the fifth cavalry one of them an eager young fellow named worth asked how does it feel general to have your brevet rank made permanent well ill tell you charlie it beats the hell out of going to the dentist to get a tooth yanked custer quipped charlie worth and the rest of the reporters laughed appreciatively custer held up a hand to show he wasnt through the newspapermen fell silent to hear what other pearls of wisdom might fall from his lips he went on in a serious even a bombastic vein my only regret is that the promotion comes as the result of a battle from which we could not seize the full fruits of victory because of the ceasefires having gone into effect absent that we should have pursued to destruction the ruffians who dared desecrate our sacred soil awkwardly the reporters scribbled as they rode god damn but he gives good copy one of them muttered to another in admiring tones the second man nodded custer didnt think he was supposed to hear his chest swelled with pride truly he was the hero of the hour he waved to charlie worth the reporter honored at being shown such a confidence rode up close to him custer said do you mind if i make another foraging run amongst your cigars charlie why not at all general worth held out a leather cigar case custer took a fat stogie from it and reined in so he could strike a match he coughed a couple of times after he got the cigar going and sucked smoke into his mouth before the battle by the teton river the only tobacco hed smoked had been in a few peace pipes handed him by the leaders of indian tribes hed smashed a reporter asked what is your view of the ceasefire general i regret that it came when it did as it prevented us from punishing the british as they so richly deserved custer replied i also regret it even more on general principles for it has humiliated us before the nations of the world for the second time in a space of less than twenty years his stomach knotted at the thought he had loved his country longer and more faithfully than he had loved his wife now as in the united states were going down to mortifying defeat and that despite his victory a victory which had he learned of the ceasefire in time would never have happened when hed married libbie after the war of secession hed promised to stop cursing and stop drinking hed held to the promise till he learned his victory counted for nothing hed stayed drunk for days after that and let out all the oaths he had in him he was still drinking he was still swearing and hed taken up smoking for good measure camp that evening brought everybody up close to everybody else men stayed near the greasewood fires for warmth to the north the campfires of the troop of british cavalry were a constellation of brightly twinkling stars on the horizon custer and his troopers wolfed down salt pork and hardtack some of them crumbled the biscuits and fried them in the grease from the pork of which there was always an adequate supply how do you people eat this stuff day after day week after week and live to tell the tale one of the reporters asked so sorry boys custer said next time you ride along with us well make sure we cater the affair from denver that got a round of laughter as hed hoped it would then one of the reportersit was charlie worth damn himasked how did colonel roosevelt and the unauthorized regiment take to army rations im afraid i really dont know custer answered his voice all at once as cool as the breeze hissing down from the north i never discussed that with mr roosevelt he laid the tiniest bit of stress on the civilian title the reporters of course made their living noticing tiny stresses come on general one of them said what do you really think of colonel roosevelthe laid the tiniest bit of stress on the military titleas a soldier what do you think of the men of the unauthorized regiment as soldiers have mercy gentlemen custer said ive answered those same questions a lot of times over the past weeks and id like it a lot better if you asked them a damned sight less often having to share the limelight with the boy colonel gave him worse dyspepsia than salt pork and hardtack gave the reporters they wouldnt leave him alone he might have known they wouldnt leave him alone come on general charlie worth coaxed give it to us straight you can do that i can only repeat what ive said a great number of times custer answered colonel roosevelt and his volunteers were gifted patriotic amateur soldiers and fought as well as men of that sort could be expected to fight every word of that was true if the reporters judged the tone to be ever so little on the slighting side was that his fault one of the newspapermen said general isnt it a fact that the unauthorized regiment performed better against the limeys than the fifth cavalry did like hell its a fact custer snarled and if roosevelt has been saying that hes a damned glorysniffing liar no general i never heard it from him the reporter said hastily but didnt the unauthorized regiment fight gordons cavalry to a draw and then chase the redcoats halfway back to canada after the whatdoyoucallemsthe gatling gunschewed them to smithereens the unauthorized regiment custer said as if lecturing on strategy at west point to a class of idiots engaged the enemy forces pursuant to my orders had i placed them in the center and us on the wings we would have done as well against the british cavalry but they would have fared far worse against gordons foot since my men were fighting dismounted at the battle by the teton they were not so well positioned to pursue as were the volunteers all that was true too had theodore roosevelt been sitting by the campfire custer was sure he would have agreed with every word custer was also sure he would have tried to aggrandize himself one way or another though that trait being acutely developed in him he had an eagle eye for spotting it in others but reporters were not after agreement agreement didnt sell papers argument did what about thegatterlingguns general another news hawk asked gatling guns custer corrected gatling idiots indeed he thought well what about them even if we hadnt had a one of them gordons men hadnt a prayer of carrying our position he thought that was true too but he wasnt quite so sure bold as he was he wouldnt have cared to mount an infantry assault on men in earthworks even in the war of secession that sort of business had proved hideously expensive with the right troops thoughgood american boys not those limey bastardshe might have had a go of it charlie worth said i hear tell roosevelt says those gatling guns saved your bacon in that fightchewed the englishmen up and spit em out again this being a free country mr roosevelt may say whatever he likes custer answered if you prefer the word of a man who became a soldier only because he was rich enough to buy himself a regiment over that of one who has devoted his entire life to the service of his country you may do so but i daresay no one will take you seriously afterwards that flattened young worth who gulped his coffee down in a hurry so he could get a big tin cup in front of his red face but one of the other men asked colonel welton down at fort benton tells it pretty much the same way doesnt he i havent heard what henry has to say custer replied i will note that while i and many of the officers of my regiment were promoted for our work by the teton colonel welton remains a colonel in this you have the war departments judgment on the value of our respective contributions the reporters scrawled furiously one of them muttered when the devil are we going to be able to get to a telegraph clicker charlie worth came up with a question no one else had asked custer andrew jackson licked the british after the war of was over and he ended up president of the united states now that youve done the same thing in this war would you like to end up the same way why charlie the notion never entered my mind till this moment custer answered truthfully also truthfully he went on now that it is in there i have to tell you i like it the reporters laughed youre a democrat arent you general somebody asked what sensible man isnt custer returned did i hear rightly that lincoln has shown the republicans true colors by going communard several reporters assured him he had heard rightly sadly he shook his head if blaine werent in the white house general pope could have done the country a good turn by hanging old honest abe hell cause more trouble now mark my words lots of democratic politicians who could run for president charlie worth observed we dont have so many soldiers who know how to win battles what if they want you to stay in the army i shall serve the united states wherever that service can lend the greatest aid custer declared his tone grandiloquent and on the whole sincere winter was on the way to sonora and chihuahua that was obvious to jeb stuart instead of being hotter than blazes the weather was all the way down to warm as for stuart himself he was on the way to el paso which suited him down to the ground he turned in the saddle and spoke to major horatio sellers wont it be fine getting to spend christmas somewhere near the edge of civilization yes sir his aidedecamp agreed enthusiastically if el paso isnt civilization at least its on the railroad line to it i like that stuart said its true both literally and metaphorically we are going to have to build a line through to the pacific just as fast as we can scrape together the capital until we have one and the feeder lines down to the city of chihuahua and to hermosillo we arent going to be able to control these provinces territories states whatever we finally call them thats true sir major sellers nodded i expect well end up with a pacific squadron in the navy too and well also need the railroad to keep that supplied he chuckled the damnyankees will love having us for neighbors too you can just bet on it one of the reasons they fought this war was to keep our frontier from touching the pacific no doubt about that stuart said but they lost and now theyll have to make the best of it serves them right for starting the fight in the first place sellers said you ask me sir president longstreet ought to squeeze an indemnity out of them that would make their eyes pop paying for a railroad would be a lot easier then old pete knows what hes doingyou can doubt a lot of things major but youd better think twice before you doubt that stuart said my guess is he reckons the united states hate us plenty now that weve licked them twice piling on an indemnity would be adding insult to injury thats how hed see it i think before major sellers could reply a commotion to the rear made him and stuart both look over their shoulders stuart soon heard men calling out his name he waved his hat and shouted to show where he was a grimy sweaty rider on a lathered horse came pounding up to him general stuart sir the confederate trooper gasped everythings gone to hell back in cananea sir oh lord stuart did not look at his aidedecamp horatio sellers had been sure nothing good would come of cooperating with the apaches and maybe hed turned out to be right after all i left a troop of cavalry behind there to make sure the mexicans and the indians didnt go at each other yes sir the trooper said wasnt enough sir you remember that yahnozha who ran away with the mexican gal and she says he drug her off and he says she was beggin for more oh yes i remember stuart said a sinking feeling in his midsection what about him did he steal another woman no sir the soldier answered the gals father and her brother they was layin for him and one of em put about three bullets in his belly and the other one he put two three more in his head then they cut off his privates sir and left cm sittin by the carcass for the indians to find that started the fightin and its been a regular war ever sinceyoud best believe it has christ stuart said an exclamation that had nothing to do with the approach of the holiday season what the devil have you men been doing to put the lid back on the place the look the trooper sent his way reminded him how insubordinate so many confederate soldiers had been during the war of secession they were men accustomed to speaking their minds regardless of the niceties of rank this cavalryman was stamped from the same mold he said what weve been doing sir is trying to keep from gcttin ourselves killed hell of a lot more apaches down by cananea than weuns an every one of em totes a tredegar just like the ones weve got hell of a lot more mexicans than weuns too they got every damn kind of rifle you ever did see we try and get between the greasers and the redskins only means we get shot at from both sides at once whos winning major sellers asked his voice was exuberant almost gleeful whoever gets killed off long as it isnt our own soldiers were well shut of em stuart glared at him he stared right back not so noisily insubordinate as the man whod ridden in from cananea but not backing away from his opinion by even an inch either well sir thats right hard to say the confederate trooper answered the mexicans they dont get to go out of their houses a whole lot but theyve got plenty of vittles and any injun sticks his head up inside of rifle range hes liable to end up with his brains rearranged you know what i mean every now and again some of the greasers the ones with the best guns and the most balls theyll sneak out of a night and shoot at the apaches camp we cant have that stuart said we cant have any of that sort of nonsense if we let it go on there itll go on all over these two provinces he heaved a deep regretful sigh so much for christmas on the edge of civilization bugler yes sir the trooper produced his polished brass horn blow halt stuart said he sighed again then blow aboutface were going to have to go back there and stamp out that foolishness the whole army sir major sellers sounded appalled hed been looking forward to christmas in texas too perhaps even to taking leave and traveling back to virginia for christmas with his family but stuart answered yes the whole army the apaches and the cananeans arc going to think they were strolling along the railroad tracks when a train ran over them if we smash both sides now it will save the confederate states a lot of trouble for years and years to come all right sir well do that then sellers laugh held a gravelly rumble of doom ive been saying all along that we ought to clean out those indians the faster and harder we do it the better off these provinces will be i knew youd say i told you so major stuart said and his aidedecamp grinned altogether unabashed the commander of the department of the transmississippi stroked his beard working through the orders he would have to give to make the army reverse its course first thing we need to do is send a wire to el paso letting people know whats happened next thing he glowered his discontent at the desert all around were already the other side of janos better than two days away from cananea no matter how hard we push he shook his head annoyed at his wits for working slower than they should have no most of us arc better than two days away from cananea colonel ruggles sir at that shout the commanding officer of the fifth confederate cavalry rode up on his camel stuarts horse snorted at the other beasts stink and tried to rear he didnt let it calhoun ruggles went on what can iwhat can wedo for you sir briefly stuart explained what had gone wrong in cananea he finished i want the fifth camelry to ride out ahead of the rest of the army and hit the indians and the mexicans before either side expects you if you can smash em up by yourselves if you cant manage that do everything you can you know we wont be far behind you all right sir well handle it colonel ruggles said and if the redskins light out for the mountains i reckon well chase em down before they can get there they say they can go faster on foot than troopers can on horseback id like to see em try and outrun my critters he leaned forward in his peculiar saddle and set an affectionate hand on the side of his mounts neck the camel twisted and tried to bite ruggles laughed as if hed expected nothing else as stuart had seen for himself the camelry was not in the habit of wasting time aboard their moaning snorting hideously homely mounts ruggles troopers soon headed west stuart would have sworn his horse let out a sigh of relief when the camels trotted away major horatio sellers gave stuart a sly look i notice youre not riding with the fifth this time sir he said thats right im not and ill give you two good reasons why stuart answered the first one is that anybody who gets on a camel more than once proves to the world hes a damned fool he waited for his aidedecamp to grunt laughter then went on and the second one is that colonel ruggles and his regiment are perfectly able to handle the size of the trouble theyve got in cananea without me and i dont want them thinking that i think they cant ah sellers nodded yes sir that makes good sense the men grumbled as they headed back toward cananea some of them had wives in el paso some had sweethearts all of them by now had had a bellyful of chihuahua and sonora but aside from that grumbling without which they would hardly have been soldiers they went where they were ordered when they came into janos just before sundown they found the town in an uproar the camels of the fifth cavalry had gone through and past the town two or three hours earlier a couple of companies of confederate soldiers occupied the adobe fortress that was janos principal reason for being and from which mexican troops had withdrawn when maximilian sold his northern provinces to the csa they were as indignant and almost as upset as everyone else in town the camelry had passed by so swiftly the men of the garrison had hardly had the chance to learn why they were on the move something in cananea aint it one of the confederates asked as the force stuart led got ready to camp for the night bugles roused the soldiers well before dawn stuart drank cup after cup of strong black coffee and was still yawning when he swung aboard his horse his bones ached he wondered if he was getting too old for much more campaigning if he was he wouldnt admit it not even to himselfperhaps especially not to himself he and his troopers kept to a moderate pace on the road between janos and cananea the road they were getting to know altogether too well not much water lay between the two towns and pushing too hard would have killed horses even at this season of the year major sellers remarked the apaches arent worth a single good cavalry horse you ask me and the same goes for the mexicans we wouldnt have had nearly so much fun up in new mexico territory if it hadnt been for the apaches stuart remarked since sellers could hardly disagree with that he grunted and did his best to pretend he hadnt heard it stuart waited to see if he would get more reports from confederate troopers forced out of cananea but none came back to him either they arent coming he said to major sellers or colonel ruggles is keeping them for himself if i had to bet id go the second way his aidedecamp nodded i think so too hes ahead of us so he needs to know worse than we do which doesnt mean we dont have to know at all stuart said fretfully a couple of hours later a camel rider did come back to stuarts force with news that fighting in and around cananea still was going on or still had been going on when the troopers who brought word to colonel rugglcs left the town by what everybody says sir the messenger reported theyre going at it hammer and tongs he paused to spit a stream of dark brown tobacco juice into the light brown dirt reckon they purely dont like each other stuart got another short night and woke too soon to the blare of the horns walk canter trotinstead of the ambling pace theyd set on the way east when they saw no need to hurry his troopers used the alternating gaits that kept their horses freshest while eating up the ground as morning passed into afternoon he heard one of the men say to another i hope the damn camel boys kill all the lousy sons of bitches on both sides so when we get there tomorrow weve got nothin to do but spit on their graves toward evening a thick column of smoke rose in the west silhouetted against the light sky there the troopers cheered i expect thats the camelry cleaning up the fight horatio sellers said hope youre right stuart said and rolled himself in a blanket on his folding cot as soon as he had seen to his horse sometime in the middle of the night a sentry shook him awake sorry to bother you sir the man said but colonel ruggles just rode in that was plenty to make stuart open his eyes he pulled on his boots and ducked out of the tent calhoun ruggles stood by the embers of a campfire perhaps twenty feet away i saw the smoke colonel stuart said around a yawn was that us putting down apaches and mexicans alike he expected ruggles to nod but the commander of the fifth confederate cavalry shook his head no sir that was the damned apaches burning damn near all of cananea to hell and gone just before we got there not much of the place left standing and a hell of a lot of mexicans dead jesus stuart said yawning again ruggles joined him he went on how in blazes did that happen in blazes is right colonel ruggles answered a couple of the mexicans who livedsalazar the alcalde is one of emsays the indians got hold of some kerosene some kind of way and that clever one called batsinas poured it in front of doors and such then they shot fire arrows into it and the wind did the rest of the job for em jesus stuart said again i bet it was batsinas scheme too the apache had been so eager to learn from the white man and had figured out a way to use some of the white mans products to deadly effect too stuart went on i hope you licked the redskins once you got to cananea anyway glumly calhoun ruggles shook his head again no sir time we got there theyd all hightailed it toward the mountains even more glumly he pointed southwards i put men to chasing em but they had a better than decent start on usand they can move too i tell you sir they can really move a hell of a lot faster than i ever thought they could i reckon theyre holed up in the sierra madre somewheres and ill be damned if i look forward to digging em out rain pattered down on san francisco having grown up and lived for much of his life in a place where rain was liable to fall any old time sam clemens took it in stride his wife a native san franciscan did not approve it has no business doing this she said its nothing but a nuisance especially on a day when you have to go to work not that big a nuisance clemens answered if theres one thing about your brother we can count on its that he has more than one umbrella he may even be willing to let me borrow one provided i post a bond not to stab anyone with it or use it as a swimming hole for sea gulls sure enough from an ugly ceramic vase in the front hall sprouted the handles of four or five umbrellas and sure enough vernon perkins did not complain about sams borrowing onenor did he ask for the bond sam had predicted he was so glad to see his brotherinlaw leave his house he would help in any way he could clemens strode carefully along wet sidewalks and picked his way through puddles in the streets no matter how careful he was his feet were wet by the time he got to the morning call offices if hed been a reporter he wouldnt have been too proud to take off his shoes and put his stockinged feet close by the fire till they dried out as an editor he felt that beneath his dignity that left him with dignity unimpaired and wet feet thank god for good coffee he said pulling the pot off the stove and filling a cup i never knew this horrible muddy slop was good coffee till my sisterinlaw broadened my horizons bath water with cream is what she makes he sipped and nodded this now thisll grow hair on a mans chestmaybe even on my brotherinlaws if it werent that verns daughters look like him poor things id say he was the likeliest

in earshot laugh even louder sam took another sip of snarling coffee then asked has anyone got a christmas present for me more sandpaper to keep your tongue sharp maybe herndon suggested and its coal in the stocking for the distinguished correspondent of the morning call clemens said at which herndon made as if to throw his cup at the editor sam went on what id really like is something closer to peace than this miserable ceasefire weve been enduring sooner or later the csa will get tired of it or england will and then some poor town on the border will catch hellor maybe catch hell again depending edgar leary spoke up if you look at things the right way san francisco is a town on the border no edgar sam said gently if you look at things the wrong way san francisco is a town on the border thats what worries me more than anything else i can see some british admiral down in the sandwich islands making sure his fleet has enough coal to get from yon to hither so he can leave a calling card in president blamesuh blainesfront hall just to remind him that england doesnt care to leave her business lying around unfinished trouble is the calling card would be aimed at blaine but it would land on us clay herndon said thats what war is about clemens agreed the people on top are stupidyou have to be stupid to want to be on topso you have to kill a lot of ordinary folks before you get their notice till youve done that they keep on the way they always have why not they arent the ones who are bleeding he finished the coffee poured more into the cupnot quite so much this time to leave room in case he felt like fortifying it from the whiskey bottle in his desk drawerand carried it away to get some work done edgar leary followed him he didnt look on that as a good sign leary sometimes put him in mind of a puppy slobbering on his shoeswhich he thought were damp enough already hoping to forestall the young reporter he made a production out of getting one of his nasty cigars going leary showed no signs of disappearing not even when sam close enough to accidentally he could say it was and sound as if he meant it blew smoke in his face sighing clemens gave up and asked well what have you got for me today edgar sir you remember how you told me to nose around and see what i could come up with about where the rebuilding money here was going the youngster asked oh yes i remember that clemens agreed its kept you out of my hair for weeks id hoped for longer but this isn t bad ive found a few interesting things leary said may i show them to you i hope youre not too busy sams desk was disappointingly uncluttered if he claimed excessive work hed make himself a liar so blatant even leary could see right through him yes show me what youve got edgar he said doing his best to sound enthusiastic about whatever trivial nonsense the cub would lay before him beaming leary hurried away he unlocked a drawer in his desk took from it a fat manila envelope and hurried back to clemens who manfully suppressed a groan if leary was going to show him nonsense why did there have to be so blasted much of it the young reporter pulled a stack of papers about half an inch thick from the envelope here you are he said why dont you start with these theyll give you a general idea of what ive dug up ive arranged them chronologically so you can start at the beginning and work right through thanks sam said tightly he started flipping sheets of paper the first few were invoices construction firms billing their patrons for amounts that didnt seem too far out of line considering how urgent all the repairs were and how far a lot of things had to be freighted to san francisco sam was about to start asking rude and pointed questions when the invoices gave way to letters with an editors eye he first noted the bad grammar in the topmost one then he saw it was about sharing the profits on a substandard piece of construction once hed spotted that his eyes flew down to the signature they widened my god he breathed crocker is one of sutros righthand men he shook his head no thats not right sutro is a finger or two on crockers right hand he looked up at edgar leary where in blazes did you come up with this which one are you talking about leary looked over his shoulder oh that thats not even a good one he waved his hand in disparaging fashion why dont you keep going a little longer i dont know why dont i sam murmured keep going he did now with interest kindled by the time he was halfway through the stack of papers he kept pausing every so often to stare at leary when he was all the way through he let out a long shrill whistle you realize what youve got here means the penitentiary for about half the city government of san francisco only if the other half has the best lawyers in the country leary answered and patted the manila envelope theres still a lot in here you havent seen dont forget the only thing missinghe looked disappointedis anything directly tying his honor to the graft it doesnt matter clemens answered i never thought id say that but its true it doesnt matter the only question left about our magnificent mayor sutro is whether hell poll even fewer votes in san francisco in his next election than blaine will in his i wouldnt have figured such a prodigy possible but now i see i may be wrong oh i dont know leary answered if all the buildingfirm bosses and all their labourers vote for sutro hes liable to be reelected sam shuddered thats a horrible thought edgar he paused to light another cigar then pointed at leary with it want you to write this all up for me i think youve got a weeks worth of stories here and every one of them on the front pagehell every one of them the lead story of the day unless we get a peace or go back to war or blaine drops dead or does something else useful all under your byline of course learys eyes glowed thanks he whispered he might be young but he wasnt a cub any more or he wouldnt be after these stories ran hed just put his name on the map in big letters youve earned it clemens answered he could think of editors who would have taken learys work and written their own stories from it he knew what he thought of those editors too nowbefore you go and write it up where in heavens name did you get your hands on all these papers edgar learys face tightened clemens knew what that meant sure enough the youngster said from people who dont want their names in the newspaper when you look at what theyve passed to me can you blame them edgar after this business breaks youre going to wonder why you ever wanted your name in the newspaper sam held up a hand to show leary he wasnt through i mean it these stories will yank the tails of some of the richest most important people in san francisco theyll come gunning for you and thats liable not to be a figure of speech if the royal marines couldnt get me i dont reckon the nobs on nob hill are up to the job either leary said ah the blithe confidence of youth sam murmured it was the same sort of confidence that made soldiers charge enemy lines sure the bullets would miss them youth also had another type of confidence though youre certainabsolutely certainall your toys here are the genuine article could anybody put together a sheaf that thick just to set us up for a fall leary demanded i wouldnt think so but i was surprised the day i found out babies didnt come from the cabbage patch too clemens said leary blushed bright pink he said besides ive compared the handwriting on some of these papers to ones i know are genuine and i havent seen a one that doesnt match now youre talking sam exclaimed thats what i wanted to hear from you one day a year from now a lot of rich mens lawyers are going to call you every sort of liar in the book and theyll stick in a few new pages and draw your face on every one of em radicals hire bombthrowing maniacs rich men hire lawyers theyre more expensive but they ought to be because they do more damage does that make you a socialist then leary asked his voice sly are you going to follow abe lincoln under the red flag edgar if youll recollect i didnt follow abe lincoln twenty years ago for the first time since his brief affiliation with the marion rangers landed him in hot water sam spoke of it without selfconsciousness i havent seen any reason to change my mind since bombthrowing maniacs arent good for a country for heavens sake theyre not as bad as lawyers thats all and talk about damning with faint praise its about like saying prettier than camels or wetter than the sahara or more interesting than my wifes brother still sly leary asked and what would he say about you i havent the foggiest notion clemens answered i always nod off before i get the chance to find out leary laughed think im joking do you sam said severely only shows youve never met dear vernor maybe just that you dont remember it here he handed the papers back to the young reporter get to work dont waste another minute youve got a whole city government waiting to be embarrassed leary went back to his own desk and began to write sam rose stretched and walked to the doorway it was still raining the sky gray as cement what a beautiful day he said a church bell in the town of fort benton solemnly intoned the hour a moment later a much smaller clock in the office of colonel henry welton also began to chime theodore roosevelt counted with it ten eleven twelve he looked around the office in blurry surprise midnight already doesnt hie seem like midnight merry christmas to you colonel and a merry christmas to you colonel henry weltons voice wasnt so clear as it might have been either the bottle on the desk between the two men was nearly full it was not however the bottle with which they had begun the evening welton poured whiskey first into his glass then into roosevelt s and what shall we drink to now roosevelt answered without hesitation to the true hero of the battle by the teton he drank the whiskey hardly burned as it slid down his gullet hed had a lot already welton drank too youre kind to an old man he said the reporters dont reckon youre right the war department doesnt reckon youre right and youre just a damned officer of volunteers the nearest thing to an honorary colonel as makes no difference so what the devil do you know what the devil can you know i know that if you hadnt posted those gatling guns in the front trench line general gordons men probably would have overrun the position roosevelt answered i know that general custer tried his damnedest to talk you into moving them and you wouldnt do it i know that custers taken all the credit for winning the battle and left you not a crumb no custer hasnt got all the credit welton said youve managed to lay your hands on a goodsized chunk yourself and do you know what colonel i dont think brigadier general custer likes that for hell and do you know what else i dont give a copperplated damn what brigadier general custer likes or doesnt like he sipped more whiskey youve known him a long time roosevelt said to which welton nodded without saying anything roosevelt took another drink too as if to be fair he said he is a brave man ive seen very few braver welton agreed but ill tell you something else too ive seen very few who love themselves more or who work harder to make sure other people love them theres an old saying that if you dont toot your own horn nobody will toot it for you custers got himself bigger cheeks than a chipmunk coming out of a corncrib roosevelt would have found that funny had he been sober drunk he laughed till the tears rolled down his own cheeks ill miss you colonel by god i will he said with the deep sentiment of the whiskey bottle they cant hold off much longer on releasing the unauthorized regiment from service and then i go back to being a rancher outside of helena welton yawned against the hour and the liquor wont be the same will it teddy hed never before called roosevelt that youre not only an old man of twentythree now youre a real live hero to boot imim roosevelt yawned too suddenly figuring out what he was seemed like too much trouble im going to bed colonel good night welton said vaguely by the look of things he was going to fall asleep where he sat roosevelt rose and went outside it had snowed the day before the cold slapped roosevelt in the face sobering him a little no snow nowthe night was brilliantly clear the moon had set a couple of hours before jupiter and saturn shone in the southwest mars was brilliant and red as blood high in the south slowly methodically roosevelt made his way out to the gate the camp of the unauthorized regiment was only a few yards away heres the old man back his own sentries called one to another he found his tent wrapped himself in a blanket and a buffalo robe and either passed out or fell asleep very very quickly come morning his head pounded like a locomotive going up a steep grade the dazzle of sun off snow only made him hurt worse every one of his soldiers who spotted him greeted him with merry christmas colonelgreeted him loudly and piercingly or so he thought in his fragile state he had to answer the men too which meant he had to listen to his own voice it sounded as loud and unpleasant as anyone elses after a breakfast of coffee two raw eggs and half a tumbler of brandy begged from the regimental physician on the grounds that easing a hangover was surely a medicinal use for the stuff he felt like a human being although perhaps one whose parts were not perfectly interchangeable a cigar helped steady him further he smoked it down to a tiny butt flipped that into the snow lighted another and headed into town the saloons were open as far as he could tell the saloons in fort benton never closed somebody was playing a piano not very well in the first one past which he walked several people were singing the words had nothing to do with the holiday season even so the saloon boasted a christmas tree with candles gaily burning on all the branches and a red glass star at the top why the tree didnt catch fire and burn down the saloon and half the town was beyond him but it didnt two doors down stood another saloon also tricked out with a christmas tree full of candles inside people were singing carols in the same loud drunken tones the folks in the first place had used for their bawdy song would god be happy to hear carols sung like that roosevelt chewed on the question as he made his way toward church before he got to the white clapboard building a man came out spotted him and extended a forefinger in his direction colonel roosevelt the fellow called merry christmas may i speak with you for a moment and a merry christmas to you zeke roosevelt replied zeke preston wasnt the preacher he was a reporter most of the men who had swarmed into montana territory to cover the british invasion were gone now of the handful still in fort benton preston was probably the best not only that a lot of papers back in new york state printed what he wrote thus roosevelt knew it behooved him to stay on the reporters good side what can i do for you today preston came down the steps and kicked his way through the snow can i trouble you with a couple of questions before you go in he was a lean man in his thirties who wore a walrus mustache that didnt go with his pale narrow face roosevelt wondered if he was consumptive go ahead roosevelt said youve caught me fair and square good the reporter reached into an overcoat pocket and drew out a notebook and pencil lucky i dont have a pen he remarked weather like this the inkd freeze solid as blaine s head he waited for roosevelt s chuckle then said the more time passes after the battle by the teton the more credit general custer takes for himself what do you think of that hed told colonel henry welton exactly what he thought of it welton was his friend he knew reporters well enough to know they had their own axes to grind he was the overall commander zeke if wed lost who would have ended up with the blame he says your men fought wellfor volunteers sure as hell preston was trying to goad him into saying something that would make a lively story its christmas im not going to pick a quarrel on christmas but roosevelt couldnt quite leave that one alone i will say that the unauthorized regiment was the force running gordon and his men back toward canada when word of the ceasefire reached us and made us hold in place preston scribbled coughed scribbled again whats your opinion of gatling guns colonel roosevelt had been over that one with henry welton too for the reporter he put on a toothy grin and answered my opinion is that i would much rather be behind them than in front of them if you ask general gordon i expect you will find his opinion the same ive heard some argument about how those guns should have been positioned preston remarked after an appreciative chuckle at roosevelt s comment where do you stand on that they did well where they were roosevelt said i saw no point to moving them from the front lineand they were not moved if youll recall general custer was persuaded they belonged there he waited for zeke preston to ask him about that persuading maybe belatedly colonel welton wouldnt be an unsung hero after all but preston flipped the notebook shut and stuck it and the pencil back in his pocket thanks very much colonel i wont bother you any more not today i wont merry christmas to you off he went breath smoking in the chilly air roosevelt sighed and went up into the church it was methodist which would have to do that faith certainly came closer to his own than the one preached in the two catholic churches fort benton also boasted when he walked in the congregation was singing away in the manger a good deal more tunefully than the same carol would have been managed in the saloon he added his own booming baritone to the song his voice his uniform and his upright carriage drew the notice of the folk who crowded the little church almost all of them in their holiday best roosevelt gave notice as well as drawing it some of the women were worth noticing a blonde in a deep blue princess dress with a satin jabot and laced pleated cuffsit would have been the height of style in new york city five years earliercaught his eye and held it when hed had enough of carolingand more than enough of the prunefaced methodist preacherhe made his way toward the door the pretty young woman contrived to leave the church at the same time they walked down the narrow stairway side by side she smelled of rosewater merry christmas to you miss roosevelt said when they were down on the tracked snowy ground once more the same to you colonel she kept walking along beside him his hopes rose in a casual tone of voice she went on if you care for some mince pie i baked one yesterday id be days and days eating it all by my lonesome why thats very kind of youvery kind of you indeed he smiled if your family wont mind sharing id be delighted i am a widow she answered sometimes that was a euphemism for a streetwalker sometimes it wasnt if she was a woman of easy virtue she was cleaner and by all appearances betternatured than most of her fallen sisters mince pie then roosevelt saidand if she felt like giving him more than mince pie that would be fine too she lived in a tiny astringently neat cabin next door to a saloon not that anything in fort benton was far from a saloon sure enough a mince pie sat on the table she cut roosevelt a slice it was good he said so loudly adding thank you for making a soldier far from home happy how happy would you like to be she asked and walked around the table and sat down on his lap the bed was close to the stove everything in the cabin was close to the stove which helped keep the place tolerably warm roosevelt had had a couple of other women throw themselves at him since he rode down to fort benton a hero or as much of a hero as this hash of a war offered the experience had been both new and delightful he wasnt sure whether this was another heros reward or a business transaction as he fumbled with the buttons of his trousers he resolved to worry about it later oh she said when presently he went into her she was quiet after that working intently beneath him till she stiffened again and quivered and cried out oh joe oh god joe he didnt think she knew what she was saying he hardly knew what she was saying himself then his own ecstasy came less than a minute later afterwards he decided she probably was a widow after all being twentythree he would have been ready for a second round in short order but she got off the bed and started dressing again so he did too he was left with a puzzling problem in etiquette after that if she was a streetwalker as well as a widow hed anger her if he didnt offer to pay if she wasnt hed offend her if he did he stood irresolute a rare posture for him without answering the question behind it she solved the problem for him merry christmas colonel roosevelt thank you very much he said and kissed her i dont think ive ever had a nicer present or one more charmingly wrapped she smiled at that he opened the door and grunted at the cold outside hed gone several steps back toward the unauthorized regiments encampment before he realized hed never learned her name chapter t he clock in frederick douglass parlor chimed twelve all over rochester clocks were striking twelve douglass raised a glass of wine to his wife and son happy new year he said solemnly happy new year frederick anna douglass said and drank when i was young i never reckoned id live to see such a big number as may you see many more new years mother lewis douglass said youre not drinking son frederick douglass had emptied his own glass and was reaching for the decanter to refill it no im not lewis said for the year ahead looks none too happy to me compare it to the year just past douglass said when seen from that perspective how can it fail of being a happy year lewis gravely considered that he showed the result of the consideration not by words but by downing the wine in front of him in a couple of quick gulps when douglass held out the decanter he poured his glass full again too compared to the year just past any year save perhaps would seem happy anna cocked her head to one side listening to bells ringing unconstrainedly and to firecrackers and pistols and rifles going off in the street some quite close by it dont sound the way it ought to she said it doesnt does it douglass said somethings missing lewis supplied the deficiency no cannon this year no cannon by order of the mayor and the governor and whichever soldier makes the most noise around these parts they all fear the british gunboats out on the lake will mistake the celebration for an attack on themselves and use it as a pretext for bombarding the city a happy new year indeed is it not they might do it too douglass said gloomily they might enjoy doing it the better to coerce the president into yielding to their demands he might as well anna said things aint gwine get no better on account of he dont they done licked us so they gets to tell us what to do annas grammar was not all it should have been that did not make what she said any less true lewis must have thought as much for he said mother we ought to send you to washington because you sec these things a lot more plainly than president blaine is able to what blaine can see and what he can do are liable to be two different propositions douglass said regretting every word of defense he spent on the man who had had the best chance since the presidency of abraham lincoln to do something about the confederate stateshad it and squandered it hes made his bed and now and now the whole country has to lie in it lewis broke in he reached for the wine decanter once more then yanked his hand away bitterness filled his voice as he went on id get drunk but whats the use things wouldnt be any better when i sobered up again well i dont aim to get myself drunk any which way anna douglass said its a sinful thing to go and do what i aim to do is go to bed she struggled to her feet frederick youll help me up the stairs of course i will my dear douglass rose too his body still responded readily to his will he helped his wife up to the bedroom helped her out of her dress and corset and made sure she was comfortable before he went back down to talk with his son a while longer lewis was taking short quick furious puffs on a cigar when frederick douglass came back to the parlor whats the use father he asked as douglass sat down once more what in gods name is the use why dont we all pack up and move to liberia we might accomplish something there you may if you like douglass answered evenly ive thought about it once or twicemaybe more than once or twice his son stared at him he nodded his face grave oh yes ive thought about it in liberia the pond is so small as to make meor you should you ever choose to goa very large fish indeed which cannot help but feed a mans pride but if i left i should be giving up the fight here and as much as proving the confederates right when they say the black man cannot compete equally against the white every column i write here shows the csa to be founded on a lie how could i do the same in africa lewis did not answer right away he took the cigar from his mouth and sat for some time staring at the glowing coal then savagely he stubbed out the cigar well youre right he said i wish to heaven you werent but you are he got up and clapped douglass on the shoulder happy new year father you were right about that too set next to the one weve escaped the year ahead cant be so bad good night you neednt get uprest easy douglass rested easy he heard his son take his overcoat off the tree in the front hall put it on open the door and close it after him bells on the carriage jingled as lewis drove home douglass looked at the decanter of wine like a voyage to liberia it tempted him but ever since his escape from slavery he had seldom run away and he had never been a man who drank alone picking up the cutglass stopper he set it in its place then with a grunt he rose once more and went off to bed he listened to clocks striking one he expected he would also listen to them striking two but drifted off before they did other than having a new calendar seemed little different from the vanished warships flying the union jack remained outside rochester harbor as they did outside other us harbors along the great lakes no warships flying the stars and stripes came out to challenge them that sprang in part from the ceasefire but only in part the rest was that the us navys great lakes flotilla was incapable of challenging its british counterpart one day in the middle of january the war department announced that the troops of the army of the ohio were returning to us soil by the way the announcement sounded no one would have guessed it meant the us army was abandoning the last foothold it held in kentucky the telegram made the move sound like a triumph look at this douglass waved the announcement in his sons face look at this how many dead men in louisville they wont be coming back to indiana and for what did they die for what i ask you for president blaines ambition lewis answered nothing else the abject failure of the us war effort had left him even more estranged from and cynical about the society in which he lived than he had been before the fighting started but douglass shook his head the cause for which we fought was noble he insisted as he had insisted all along the power of the confederate states should have been kept from growing the tragedy was not that we fought but that we fought while so manifestly unprepared to fight hard blaine gets some of the blame for that but the democrats who kept us so weak for so long must share it with him if we are to have a return engagement with the confederacy we must be more ready in all respects i see no other remedy i never thought id live to see the day when you and ben butler were proposing the same cure for our disease lewis said the democrats like him too that brought douglass up short butler had no more kept silent about the proposals he had made in the meeting at the florence hotel outside chicago than abraham lincoln had about his both men were stirring up turmoil all through the battered country and each ones followers violently opposed the others as lincoln had joined with the socialists so butler was indeed drifting back toward the democrats from whose ranks he had deserted during the war of secession reluctantly douglass said an idea may be a good one no matter who propounds it nero fiddled while rome burned lewis retorted you temporize while the republican party goes up in flames i am not temporizing douglass said with dignity i have done all i could to hold the party together i am still doing all i can it may not sufficei am only one man but am doing my best youd have a better chance if your skin were white lewis said douglass stared at him negroes in the us seldom spoke so openly of the handicap they suffered by being black lewis glared back in furious defiance its true and you damn well know its true but douglass shook his head not for me had i been born whitehad been born all whitehe corrected himself to remind his son they both had white blood in their veinsi suspect i would have drifted into some easy profitable trade never giving a second thought or even a first to politics being the color i am i have been compelled to face concerns i should otherwise have ignored it has not been an easy road but i am a better man for it i do not have your detachment father nor frankly do i want it lewis said i wish you a good morning he departed douglass home without much ceremony and with a good deal of anger douglass had to go out himself a couple of days later when his wife developed a nasty cough the new cough syrups infused with the juice of the opium poppy really could stop the hacking and barking that seemed such a characteristic sound of winter thanking heaven for modern medicine douglass bundled himself up and trudged off to the nearest drugstore a few blocks away he thanked heaven for the day too as january days in rochester went it was good enoughbetter than good enough it was bright and clear and he guessed a little above freezing not too much snow lay on the ground even so he planted his feet with care the sidewalks had their share of icy patches half a dollar the druggist said setting on the counter a glass bottle with the label in typography so rococo as to be almost unreadable his voice was polite and suspicious at the same time douglass furcollared overcoat argued that he had the money to pay for the medicine his being a negro argued to far too many white men that he was likely to be shiftless and liable to be a thief he reached into his pocket and found a couple of quarters which he set beside the bottle of cough elixir only after the druggist had scooped the coins into the cash box did his other hand come off the bottle that care made douglass want to laugh he was stout black and well past sixty even if he did abscond with the medicine how could he possibly hope to get more than a couple of blocks without being recognized or more likely tackled with no ceremony whatever he was carrying the bottle of cough syrup out of the store when three middleaged white men started to come in he stood aside to let them use the narrow doorway ahead of him instead of going on past though the fellow in the lead stopped rocked back on his heels and looked at him with an expression of mingled contempt and insult well looky here jim looky here bill he drawled aint this a fine buck nigger we got his friends laughed at what they and he thought to be wit douglass stiffened if you gentlemen will excuse me he said his voice chillier than the weather outside listen to him josh either jim or bill exclaimed talks just like a white man he does probably got a white man inside him that he ate up for breakfast all three of them found that a very funny sally too if you gentlemen will excuse me douglass repeated bottling up the fury he felt he took a step forward more often than not his sheer physical presence was enough to let him ease through confrontations like this it didnt work today instead of giving way before him the white man in the leadjoshdeliberately blocked his path no we dont excuse you sambo he said and looked back over his shoulder do we boys no one of jim and bill said while the other was saying hell no josh stuck a ringer in douglass face and do you know why we dont excuse you boy i dont excuse you because its all your goddamn fault i have no idea what you arc talking about douglass said now alarmed as well as furious this sort of thing hadnt happened to him in rochester for many years he knew too well how ugly it could get and how fast it could get that way carefully he said i do not know what you believe to be my fault but i do know i have never set eyes on any of you before in my life and if god be kind shall never see you again not you youyou niggers josh said hadnt been for you niggers this hered still be one country we wouldnt have fought two wars against the lousy rebels and they wouldnt have licked us twice neither yeah said jim or bill thats right bill or jim agreed they werent drunk douglass took some small comfort in that it might make them a little less likely to pound him into the boards of the floor he said black men did not ask to be brought to these shores nor did we come willingly the difficulty lies not in our being here but in the way we have been used i myself bear on my back the scars of the overseers lash ooh dont he talk fancy one of the men behind josh said reckon thats why the overseer whupped him josh replied which was a disturbingly accurate guess he didnt attack he didnt make a fist but he didnt get out of douglass way either ought to all go back to africa every stinking one of you then wed set things to rights here no now douglass let his anger show for better and for worse i am an american tooevery bit as much as you this is my country as it is yours liar josh shouted his friends echoed him now he did fold his hand into a fist had the bottle douglass held been thicker he would have used it to add strength to his own blow as things were he feared it would break and cut his palms and fingers he got ready to throw it in joshs face instead from behind him came a short sharp click it was not a loud noise but it was one to command immediate complete and respectful attention from douglass and from the three white men of whom hed fallen foul very slowly douglass turned his head and peered over his shoulder the druggists right hand held a revolver the hammer cocked and ready to fall thats enough you men he said sharply ive got no great use for niggers myself but this fellow wasnt doing you any harm let him alone and get the hell out of here while youre at it josh and jim and bill tumbled over one another leaving the drugstore the druggist carefully uncocked the pistol and set it down out of sight frederick douglass inclined his head i thank you very much indeed sir didnt do it for you so much as to keep the place from getting torn up the druggist replied in matteroffact tones like i said i dont much care for niggers especially niggers like you that put on airs but that aint the same as saying you deserved a licking when you hadnt done anything to deserve one now take your cough elixir and go on home ill do that douglass said a man who for whatever reason will not let another be beaten unjustly has in himself the seeds of justice he tipped his hat and walked out of the store once on the sidewalk he looked around warily to see whether the white ruffians might want another try at him but they were nowhere around they must have had enough his sigh of relief put a fairsized frosty cloud in the air when he got home anna was sitting in the parlor coughing like a consumptive hold on my dear he said a tablespoon of this will bring relief fetch me a glass o water with it on account of its gwine taste nasty she answered she sighed when he brought the medicine and the water i aint been out of the house in a good while now anything much interestin happen while you was at the drugstore douglass gravely considered that after a moment he shook his head no he said nothing much snow blew into friedrich sorges face as it had a way of doing in chicago the wind howled sorge clutched at his hat the socialist newspaperman had an exalted expression on his face turning to abraham lincoln he shouted will you look at the size of this crowd have you ever in all your life seen anything like it why yes a great many times as a matter of fact lincoln answered and hid a smile when sorge looked dumbfounded he set a gloved hand on his new allys shoulder you have to remember my friend that you have been in politics as an agitator a gadfly from now on we will be playing the game to win which is a different proposition altogether yes sorge still sounded dazed i see that i knew our joining would bring new strength to the movement but i must say i did not imagine it would bring so much he laughed the wind did its best to blow the laughter away until now i did not imagine how weak we were nor how strong we might become it is amazing not since i left the old country have i been part of anything to compare to thisand in the old country we were put down with guns lincoln had different standards of comparison to him it was just another political rally and not a particularly large one at that muffled against the cold and the wind men and women trudged south along cottage grove avenue toward washington park considering the weather it wasnt a bad crowd at all it was also without a doubt the most energetic crowd lincoln had seen since the war of secession red flags whipped in the wind it had already torn some of them into streamers men had to wrestle to keep the signs they held from flying away justice for the working man some said tax capitalists income others urged revolution is a right still others warned some of the people on the sidewalks cheered as the marchers walked past others hurried along intent on their own business or on finding someplace to get out of the cold policemen in overcoats of military blue were out in force they had clubs in their hands and pistols on their belts if peaceable protest turned to uprisingor perhaps if the police thought it might this gathering too could be put down with guns trees in washington park were skeletally bare what little grass snow did not cover was yellow and dead it was as bleak and forbidding a place as lincoln could imagine but it also struck him as the perfect place to hold a rally for the new fusion of the socialists and his wing of the republican party in the summer you know and when the weather is fine the rich promenade through here showing off their fancy carriages and matched teams and expensive clothes he said to friedrich sorge sorge nodded yes i have seen this he scowled it is not enough for them that they have they must be seen to have their fellow plutocrats must know they too are part of the elite and the proletariat must be reminded that they are too rich and powerful to be trifled with thanks to their money they think it is summer in the united states the year around lincoln said to the people coming into washington park now blizzards blow in january and july alike this is true sorge agreed emphatically he hesitated it is also very well said though with my english imperfect you will not perhaps find in this much praise but i think you have in yourself the makings of a poet interesting you should say so lincoln replied i tried verse a few times many years agohalf a lifetime ago now that i think about it i dont reckon the results were altogether unfortunate at least the best of them but they were not of the quality to which i aspired and so i gave up the effort and turned back to politics and the law which better suited my bent you may have given up too soon sorge said even more than other kinds of writing poetry repays steady effort even if you are right as you may well be far too many years have passed for it to matter now lincoln said if by lucky chance some phrase in a speech or in an article should strike the ear or mind as happily phrased maybe it is the poet still struggling after so long to break free more miserably coldlooking policemen directed the throng to an open area in front of a wooden platform from which more red banners flew the wind was methodically ripping them to shreds say your say and then go home a policeman told lincoln the former president judged that likelier to be a plea from the heart than a political statement the fellows teeth were chattering so loudly he was hard to understand friedrich sorgc said not too hard is it to know which of our followers came from your camp and which from mine no not hard lincoln said the difference interested him and amused sorge about four out of five people in the crowd obeyed without question the police who herded them where they were supposed to go the fifth the odd man out called the chicago policemen every name in the book sometimes angrily sometimes with a jaunty air that said it was all a game the fifth man the odd man was far more likely to be carrying a red flag than the other four some people lincoln you see truly do believe in the revolution of the proletariat sorge said i do recollect that believe me lincoln answered what you have to remember is that some people dont looking over the crowd here id judge that most of the people in it dont what we have to do to build this party is to make the people who dont believe in revolution want to join so they can reform the country and at the same time keep the ones who are revolutionaries in the fold sorges mouth puckered as if hed bitten into an unripe persimmon you are sayingyou have been saying since we first spoke that we must water down the doctrines of the party the way a dishonest distiller will water down the whiskey he sells look at the crowd we have here today lincoln said patiently with a crowd like this we can make the bosses think twice before they throw workers out in the streets or cut their pay with a crowd like this we can elect men who see things our way wouldnt you like to see a dozen or two dozen socialist congressmen on the train for washington after the elections this fall i do not know sorge said i truly do not know if they call themselves socialists but hold positions that are not socialist positions if theyre not pure enough to satisfy you you mean lincoln said and sorge nodded lincoln s sigh swirled him in fog you can stand against the wall and shout revolution as loud as you like but you wont have many people standing by you if you do if you want to get on the floor and dance you have to know the tunes the folks out there arc dancing to another policeman made his way over to lincoln and sorge he was swinging his arms back and forth and beating his hands together and still looked miserably cold he wore a bushy mustache full of ice crystals if you ducks have to go speechifying why the hell dont you do it and get it over with he said more time you waste the better the chance somebodys going to freeze to death waiting for you to get on with it me for instance thats a good idea lincoln said and sorge did not disagree they ascended to the platform together a hum of anticipation ran through the crowd the hardline socialist minority began shouting slogans workers of the world unite down with the capitalist oppressors revolution they tried to turn that last into a rhythmic chant abraham lincoln held up his hands for quiet slowly he gained it friedrich sorge had agreed with some reluctance that he should speak first lincoln s logic was that a fiery call for revolution would frighten off the more moderate members of the crowd if they heard it before they heard anything else they would think the party had no room for them lincoln hoped to show them otherwise once hed done that sorge could be as fiery as he liked my friends lincoln said let me begin by speaking to you of religion that intrigued some of the crowd and no doubt horrified the rest including the men waving red flags intrigued or horrified they listened he went on some men think god has given them the right to eat their bread in the sweat of other mens faces that is not the sort of religion upon which people can get to heaven silence persisted for another few seconds then a great roar rose up from the crowd not only from the ordinary respectable folks who had been republicans and were trying to find out why lincoln was abandoning the party he had led to the white house but also from the hard cases waving red flags friedrich sorge clapped his gloved hands together again and again here lincoln said and now the crowd hushed at once to hear him i am a poor hand to quote scripture but i will try it it is said in one of the admonitions of the lord as your father in heaven is perfect be ye also perfect he set that up as a standard and he who did most toward reaching that standard attained the highest degree of moral perfection so i say in relation to the principle that all men are created equal if we cannot give perfect freedom to every man let us do nothing that will impose slavery on any man he had to pause again for no one could have heard him through the cheers when he could speak once more he went on let us turn this government back into the channel in which the framers of the constitution originally placed it let us stand firmly by each other and let us discard all quibbling about this class and that class and the other class now sorge looked less ecstatic lincoln did not care he forged ahead let us hear no more how this man is only a labourer and so counts for nothing let us hear no more how that man is a great and wealthy capitalist and so his will must be obeyed let us discard all these things and unite as one people throughout this land until we shall once again stand up declaring that all men are created equal again he drew cheers from both factions in the crowd when they washed over him he felt neither chilled nor old as they ebbed he resumed i think this new socialist party is and shall be made up of those who peaceably as far as they can will oppose the extension of capitalist exploitation and who will hope for its ultimate extinction who will believe if it ceases to spread that it is in the course of ultimate extinction we have to fight this battle upon principle and upon principle alone so i hope those with whom i am surrounded here have principle enough to nerve themselves for the task and leave nothing undone that can be fairly done to bring about the right result it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this i shall not keep you here much longer my friends our purpose should be must be and is simple to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations he stepped back for a moment no applause came and he wondered if he had somehow lost his audience as he ended but no when the cheers and clapping thundered out he realized the crowd had granted him that moment of enchanted silence every speaker dreams of and few ever get he bowed his head in that brief stretch of time some of the bitterness of almost twenty years wandering in the wilderness left him at last and when he stood straight again he stood very straight indeed friedrich sorge tugged at the sleeve of his coat he bent down to listen to his colleague through the ongoing roar of the crowd half angrily half admiringly sorge demanded what am i supposed to say after you have said all this what you were going to saywhat else lincoln answered i spread oil on the waters where i could now you go on and stir them up to a storm again and sorge did his best it was a speech that would have set a torch under one of the small crowds of dedicated men he was used to addressing and it did set a torch under some of the crowd in washington park when he spoke of marx when he spoke of when he decried the brutal suppression of the paris commune he struck chords in many of them to many who heard him though those were foreign things of little meaning and he did nothing to relate them to the experience of the working man in the united states listening to him lincoln understood why socialism had remained so small a movement for so long it simply was not or had not been aimed at the common american labourer he aimed to change that he thought hed made a good start on and on sorge went considerably longer than lincoln had done people began drifting out of the park when the socialist finishedjoin with us you have nothing to lose but your chainssome of the applause he got seemed more relieved than inspired policemen began shouting now youve heard em now get the hell out of here shows over go on home near the platform one of those policemen turned to his pal and said anybody wants to know we ought to take all these crazy bombthrowing fanatics and string em up thatd go a long way toward setting the country to rights he made no effort to keep his voice down if anything he wanted the men on the platform to hear sorge turned to lincoln and said you see how the oppressors lackeys have learned their masters language you also see how they ape their masters thoughts when we go to the barricades but lincoln shook his head you notice he does not do anything about it the first amendment to the constitution protects our right to speak freely he let out a chuckle the wind flung away the first amendment also protects his right to speak freely however distasteful i find his opinion sorge made a sour face bah you americans i sometimes think suffer from an excess of this freedom if you feel that way you should have allied yourself with benjamin butler or with the democrats not with me lincoln answered and when you say you americans you show why the socialists have not made a better showing up until now you must remember you arc not looking at the united states and their citizens from some external perspective you arewe area part of them had he spoken angrily the union between his wing of the republican party and the socialists might have broken down then and there as it was the look sorge sent him was thoughtful rather than irate perhaps you touch here on something important perhaps you do indeed the newspaperman said in musing tones he went on socialism from france is different from socialism in germany perhaps socialism in the united states will prove different from both come on down from there you damned crazy loons said the policeman whod called a moment earlier for hanging them before you both freeze to death and before i do too sorge might not have heard him when the time comes for it to grow as the dialectic proves that time will come i wonder what face socialism will wear in the confederate states lincoln paused halfway down the steps a black one he predicted if ever there was a proletariat ruthlessly oppressed and valued only for its labour it is the negro population of the csa an interesting notion sorge said it is for now a lumpenproletariat one without an intelligentsia through which to vent its rage but in the fullness of time this too may change he suddenly seemed to realize he was alone on the platform he also suddenly seemed to realize how cold he was brr let us be off surrounded by their supporters sorge and lincoln made their way out of washington park cabs waited to take them back into chicago friedrich sorge jumped into one he waved to lincoln today the city tomorrow the world he said gaily then gave the driver his address the cab clattered off ducking his head to fit through the short narrow doorway lincoln climbed into another cab where to the driver asked him he gave his sons address the driver said nothing but flicked the reins and got rolling friedrich sorge lived in a cramped cluttered dingy south side flat lincoln had visited him there he had not visited lincoln in turn robert had made it very plain that while his father was welcome at his luxurious home his fathers political associates were not lincoln sighed he would sometime soon have to find a place of his own the idea of a socialist leader operating out of a mansion struck him as too absurd for words the cab made its slow way through the bustle of chicago the deeper into the city it got the more streaked with soot the snow on the ground was lincoln peered out through the smeary window at bustle and filth alike tomorrow the world he said softly tomorrow the world jeb stuart surveyed the magnificent terrain surrounding him with an emotion closer to despair than admiration the sierra madre mountains the extension of the rockies south of the us border were steep and treacherous and full of endless trails not wide enough for two men to ride abreastoften barely wide enough for one man on camelor horsebackand full of endless valleys where endless numbers of indians could camp and elude his men and moving guns was even harder than moving men colonel calhoun rugglcs rode only a couple of men ahead of him i wish the camelry had been able to run down the damned apaches stuart said he regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth he knew ruggles had done everything he could to run the redskinned warriors to earth the commander of the fifth confederate cavalry looked back over his shoulder sir i honest to god thought wed run em the way hounds run a coon they made fools out of me and my troopers and im not ashamed to admit it any men who can make fools out of my trooperswell theyre men in my book they made fools of the yankees for a lot of years stuart said doing his best to encourage ruggles after tearing him down they helped us make fools of the yankees too remember maybe they decided it was our turn now colonel rugglcs shook his head thats not it or not all of it anyway after they burned cananea they knew damn well we couldnt let them get by with it and so they lit out for the mountains his head went this way and that too with no sign whatever that he was enjoying the scenery and now were supposed to dig them out rrr the noise he made was very unhappy from behind stuart major horatio sellers spoke up there is one good thing about this whole business what about wandering through the mountains for more than a month with damn near the only times the apaches show themselves the times when they bushwhack some of our scouts stuart exclaimed calhoun ruggles also shook his head in disbelief but sure enough sellers came up with one saying if we do flush the apaches out of their hiding places here theres not a chance theyll ever come up with new ones because there cant be any better in the whole wide world by god major youre right about that ruggles said stuart found himself nodding too in an odd sort of way sellers words offered consolation the aidedecamp was right ground just didnt come any worse than this slowly tortuously the troopers descended into a valley where theyd camp for the night stuart did not have nearly so big a force with him as had set out from cananea in pursuit of the apaches for one thing supplying a large force in this cutup land was impossible for another guarding the supplies that did come in required a lot of soldiers some of those supplies inadequately guarded were now in the apaches hands something small and bright and colorful as a jewel hovered in front of stuart for a moment it stared at him for a moment out of beady black eyes then shot off impossibly fast at an equally impossibly angle hummingbird he said startled hed seen hummingbirds back in virginia of course the familiar rubythroats el paso had others occasionally glimpsed as they buzzed from flower to flower like oversized bees but hed never seen one with a purple crown and brilliant green throat before he wondered what other strange creatures the mountains harbored he must have said that aloud for major sellers grunted laughter well theres the apaches for starters he said he took the saddle off his horse and set it down on a round brown rock then started currying the animal as with any good trooper his horse came first a scout came up to stuart sir he said theres a trail up ahead looks like one the apaches used once upon a time anyway got mexican plunder all along it dresses saddles flour sacks things like that none of its what youd call fresh though reckon they came that way some other time when they was raidin through these parts might mean were gettin closer to em though so it might stuart scanned the peaks ahead the sun still shone on some of them though shadow filled the valley somewhere up there along those ridge lines apaches were spying on his encampment even if he had not the slightest hope of spotting them almost to a man the indians had sharp eyes they also had and knew how to use telescopes looted from the us army they were liable to know what he was up to better than he did himself that thought had hardly crossed stuarts mind before horatio sellers burst out in a storm of angry curses stuart spun around whats the matter major he asked my blasted saddles disappeared sellers answered i set the stupid thing on a rock right therehe pointedand now its gone gone it was you did put it there stuart said i saw you do it it isnt there now that was pointing out the obvious the son of a bitch goddamn well didnt up and walk off by itself sellers said if i find the bastard who lifted it ill make him sorry he was ever born he glared around at the amused soldiers who were watching and listening to him stuart would have suspectedstuart did suspectthem too the next soldier who didnt relish a practical joke on a superior would be the first one of the men pointed toward a patch of waisthigh scrub oak near the edge of the light the campfire cast sir aint that your gear sellers gaze followed the troopers outthrust finger it is by jesus he rumbled how in the damnation did it get way the hell over there he rounded on the nearby cavalrymen all right fess up which one of you blackguards went and shifted it instead of confessing the soldiers denied everything each more vehemently than the last stuart had heard a great many soldiers tell a great many lies in his day as with anything else some were good some bad some indifferent either these men were all inspired liars ormajor i think they may perhaps be telling you the truth yes sir major sellers came to attention stiff as rigor mortis respect exaggerated to the point of parody he performed a precise aboutface and stomped over to the saddle when he picked it up he let out an oath that was startled rather than furious son of a bitch did you see that several people stuart included said no most of them added what was it or words to that effect an armadillo sellers stood there holding the saddle an extraordinarily foolish expression on his face i must have put this thinghe hefted iton top of a big goddamn armadillo instead of a rock it just ran off into the bushes with a certain amount of relish stuart said the saddle didnt up and walk off by itself eh this time it damn well did sellers carried it back over by his horse and set it down with ostentatious care on a piece of flat level ground that care didnt keep him from getting ragged unmercifully by the confederate troopers the rest of the night stuart did his share of the ragging or maybe a little more if the lurking apaches wherever they were had been able to figure out what the fuss and feathers were all about they were probably laughing too when morning came though the time for laughter was gone stuarts army swung into motion once more advancing along the trail the scouts had found the evening before it was broad and easy at first but soon narrowed and climbed steeply a pack mule went over the side and rolled to the bottom of a gully it scrambled up onto its feet none the worse for wear except for a patch of hide scraped off its flank a few minutes later another mule missed a step its bray of terror cut off abruptly halfway down the rocky slope it did not get up when it stopped rolling and would not get up again its head twisted at an unnatural angle a little past noon a scout came back to stuart with a prize a tredegar cartridge an apache must have dropped has to be one of the redskins were after sir the fellow said means were on the right trail yes stuarts head came up cant mean anything else tredegars were mighty thin on the ground south of the borderback when this had been south of the border maybe well catch up with them yet he frowned and maybe they left it there for you to find so they could draw us into a trap he ordered more scouts forward and sent men to scrambling along the ridge line to smell out any ambush on either flank in the next valley they came to they found the remains of a mexican army camp the camp looked to have been abandoned in great haste a couple of years before and then plundered by the indians they did try to put them down colonel calhoun ruggles said yes and look what it got them major sellers spoke like a man passing judgment well do better stuart said the empire of mexico hasnt been what anyone would call vigorous about fighting the indians we will do it because they havent got any place to run to from here they could go up into the usa sir sellers said stuart shook his head not after they made common cause with us against the yankees the usa would sooner kill em than look at em after that you mark my words wed be the same if a comanche band comes out of new mexico and wants to take our side against the damnyankees do we let em ruggles was best qualified to speak to that and did no sir it happened once or twice not long after the war of secession some of the comanches reckoned they could play us and the united states off against each other his smile was thoroughly grim buzzards ate well for a few days afterwards two valleys deeper into the mountains the confederates came upon an abandoned apache encampment and not an old one either some of the ashes in the fire pits were still warm while flies buzzed around the bones of butchered beeves now were getting somewhere stuart said with more satisfaction than hed shown since the army plunged into the divinely beautiful hellishly rugged terrain of the sierra madre if we can get them on the run theyll start making mistakes and they cant afford that he snapped orders three trails led out of the valley mounted scouts trotted rapidly down all of them within half a minute of one another three explosions shattered the quiet all told they cost four men killed and half a dozen wounded one of those wounded one of the luckier ones told stuart it was a charge buried in the ground sir with a trip line for a horse or a man to set it off blood was soaking through the rag wrapped around his forearm i didnt think those apache bastards knew about little tricks like that stuart and major horatio sellers looked at each other both spoke the same name at the same time batsinas stuart went on whats the name of that yankee who comes up with a new invention every day before breakfast tom edison thats who i mean the apaches have got themselves a regular tom edison in that fellow if theyre going to start planting torpedoes in the road we wont be able to rush after them sellers said we cant rush after them in this country anyway stuart answered so long as we get them thats what counts unhappily sellers said damned redskins didnt even give us a clue about which way they went if theyd put a torpedo on one trail and left the other two alone wed have a pretty fair notion which one to follow not necessarily stuart said a torpedo on one trail could as easily lure us into an ambush or a false path as to show the way the indians did go theyre more than clever enough to do something like that weve seen as much major sellers looked unhappier still before at last nodding i said before we should have slaughtered them he muttered we got good use out of them up in new mexico territory stuart said if they hadnt quarreled with the mexicans wed still be on good terms with them he craned his neck to look around which of the crags ahead held apaches with tredegars behind which bushes were they crouching he couldnt begin to guess and that worried him he did some muttering of his own now we have to make sure they dont slaughter us with some misgivings he pushed his force down the trail the scouts reported to be most used the column had not got far when boulders thundered down the mountainside above them the avalanche scraped several men and horses and camels and mules off the paths into a ravine below for a moment stuart spied men up above him looking at what their handiwork had done when confederate troopers opened fire on them they disappeared he hoped his men had hit some of them but he wouldnt have bet on it come on he called to the soldiers we just after keep after em thats all perhaps half a mile farther down the trail another landslide took its toll doggedly the confederates pressed on this is the difference between us and the empire of mexico major sellers said if the apaches gave the mexicans a little licking theyd leave the redskins must reckon well do the same he shook his head wont happen no indeed stuart said we shall teach them a new reckoning maybe his armys persistence started giving the indians that new reckoning or maybe he had chosen the right trail after all and was nearing whatever encampment geronimos men had set up after abandoning the shelters his troopers had already found whatever the reason the apaches started shooting at the confederates from the slopes above them and from in back of rocks and bushes ahead soldiers who were hit screamed soldiers who were not though went into action with a fierce joy if the apaches would stand and fight they could fight back at stuarts shouted orders they went forward dismounted so they could advance over ground their mounts could not cross gray and butternut uniforms were hard to see against rock and dirt as they moved ahead stuart shouted other orders too to a runner the man dashed back along the trail breasting the tide of troopers going forward he did his job betterwhich meant fasterthan stuart had dared hope only a few minutes passed before first one and then another of the armys field guns began landing shells on the positions from which the apaches were fighting getting those guns over what passed for trails in the sierra madre had been backbreaking labourluckily not mankilling labourbut it paid dividends now the apaches did not care for coming under shellfireor perhaps it unnerved them where bullets whipping past did not because it was less familiar it made some of them break cover a mistake often fatal yelling and whooping the confederates on foot went forward us soldiers in a position like the one the apaches held would have slugged it out with their confederate opponents and made them pay a high price for every foot they gained had stuart been defending that position against the yankees he would have done the same the apaches though did not fight to spend men hed seen that before when they were under pressure they saw nothing shameful about escaping from danger firing slowly died away as the cs troopers found no more targets real or imaginary for stuart was sure his men had frequently fired at bushes and rocks and evenhe glanced over at major sellersarmadillos forward he shouted and forward the column went a few hundred yards beyond the place where the apaches had made their stand the trail led into another wide fertile valley water trickled down from springs on the hillsides even in winter everything was green birds chirped and warbled flies buzzed the apaches had had a camp there it was far more hastily abandoned than the one stuarts army had overrun early in the morning a couple of beef cattle the indians hadnt been able to take with them lowed mournfully major horatio sellers rubbed his hands together weve got em on the run now by god jeb stuart looked around as he had at the other abandoned camp he saw no one but his own men that did not mean no one but his own men saw him and he knew it theyve got enough places to run to he said not so delighted with having driven the indians from their refuge as hed thought he would be sooner or later well get em his aidedecamp said yes i figure we will too stuart agreed as you said major were a lot more stubborn than the mexicans but i hadnt realized how many hiding places this country offers till i traveled it well be a good long while at the job i fearyears most likely sellers mouth twisted i dont like that notion so very much neither do i not even a little stuart drew himself up straighter its got to be done though and i expect well do it eventually after that last word was out of his mouth he wished he hadnt said it then he looked around at the sierra madre again he sighed eventually had needed saying from a bush so small no white man would ever have imagined using it for a hiding place a rifle barked something hit stuart a heavy blow in the belly he grunted as if at acute indigestion my god horatio sellers cried the generals shot next thing stuart knew he was lying in the dirt someone was making a noise like a fox with its leg in a trap he realized it was he the pain had started it was very bad it was worse than very bad it was tremendous appalling allconsuming he writhed and moaned and then shrieked unashamed none of it did any good leaning over him sellers shouted fetch the surgeon dammit blood poured between stuarts fingers as he clutched at himself the surgeon wouldnt do any good either wishing he could lose consciousness again stuart was only too sure of that he shrieked again he couldnt help himself however long eventually was he wouldnt be here to see it brigadier general george custer threw more coal into the stove in his quarters at fort benton the fire in the stove glowed a cheery red despite that he was anything but warm a blizzard howled outside he scraped a match against the sole of his boot and lighted a cigar libbie gave him a disapproving look must you do that she demanded dashed right i must custer said and sucked in smoke he didnt cough at all now sometimes the smoke even tasted good dashed libbie set her hands on her hips her eyes sparked she was a very determined person autie you didnt just promise not to swear where i could hear you promised not to swear at all another nice thing about a cigar custer had discovered was that it gave him an excuse not to talk for a little while libbie wasnt just determined she was tenacious as a terrier tom would have known how disapproving of his new vices shed be tom had loved her too loved her like a brother poor tom custer wondered if the empty place inside him would ever disappear he didnt think so when he couldnt use the cigar to keep quiet any more he said times have changed and not for the better either and libbie went on implacably you promised your sister you would never again drink liquor and i know you have violated that pledge as well when i promised her i never dreamt my beloved country would go down to humiliating defeat at the hands of the black republicans not once but twice custer said can you blame me if i seek consolation i might not blame you had you sought consolation once though even that would be a violation of your promise libbie said but having reacquired the habit you abandoned so long ago you have indulged it not once but repeatedly the reason for that was simple after twenty years custer had rediscovered how much he enjoyed the feel of whiskey coursing through him coming right out and saying so however struck him as impolitic what he did say was i am far more moderate than in the old days if you mean you arent staggering down the street puking every few steps well yes that is true such acid filled libbies voice custer flinched from it as he never had from enemy fire inexorably she went on but if you think you are fulfilling your promise i cannot agree custer did not answer he felt trapped not only did the blizzard keep him from escaping his wife it also kept him from escaping colonel henry welton welton was a model of military punctilio nothing he did nothing he said could possibly be construed as offensive toward the newly promoted superior now residing in what had been his fort for so long all the same custer felt about as welcome as a man in the last stages of cholera libbie might have picked the thought out of his head she said that foolish infantry colonel thinks he should have more of the credit for winning the battle by the teton autie i cant imagine why but he plainly does everyone wants some of the glory that should rightly attach to you whatever she thought of custers shortcomingsand she was seldom reticent in telling him what she thoughtshe was as determined as he to wring the greatest possible advantage out of his virtues he said i still maintain and shall continue to maintain that we should have done as well against the british without the gatling guns as we did with them tom would back me i know it dear lord if only he could have then i wish the stupid things had not been on the field at all in that case no occasion for argument would have or could have arisen of course not libbie said soothingly then her brow which she prided herself on keeping smooth furrowed i wish that that colonel roosevelt had not been on the field either he has stolen much of the approbation that would otherwise have gone to you ive thought about that custer said and i have decided it does not matter it certainly does libbie exclaimed indignantly he nodded ever so slightly hed succeeded in diverting her from his flaws she continued how can you possibly say it does not matter when he has what should be yours because whether he has it or not what can he do with it custer said he is a colonel of volunteers whose regiment has been mustered out of us service so he cannot harm my army career and he is a puppy of twentythree so he cannot be my rival for any political office the constitution disqualifying him from such a pursuit on account of his age qed as my instructors in the mysteries of geometry were given to saying all that may be so libbie said and then grudgingly i suppose all that is so nonetheless i am ever so glad he has left fort benton say what you will about him enough ambition burns in that man for a hundred henry weltons deny it if you can her chin jutted defiance let him be as ambitious as he likes custer said his desires cannot impinge on mine her voice dropped almost to a whisper do you think you can be nominated for the presidency do you think you will be nominated for the presidency i can be he answered jackson was harrison was taylor was winfield scott was too though he failed of election whoever faces blaine year after next will not lose libbie said no i shouldnt think so custer agreed whether i will be nominated depends on whether i can keep my name in the publics eye between now and then and also on whether the leaders of the party decide i am the man whose name they want to put forward at the convention and whatever fame this roosevelt gained at your expense will make both of those things less likely libbie pointed out there do you see you have contradicted yourself she looked as triumphant as if she had just driven back an invading british army before custer could reply someone knocked on the door to his quarters through the yowling wind a soldier called colonel weltons compliments general and would you and your lady care to join him for supper yes well come custer said and then to libbie wrap yourself up warm my dear and well see what the cooks have done with or tosupper her coat was of angora sheep and warm his own of buffalo hide had served him well in the field even so that first dreadful breath of air once he left his quarters almost froze him from the lungs outwards his teeth chattered a moment later he heard libbies clicking away too snow swirled around him making even the short walk to the officers dining room an adventure the way was made more uncertain because the diningroom shutters like most of the rest at fort benton were closed to help hold in heat custer had to grope for the latch only when he opened the door did yellow lamplight spill out and illuminate the endlessly blowing snowand no sooner had he opened the door than shouts of close it rang out from within he waved libbie in ahead of him then went into the dining room and shut the door after himself the first breath of warm air inside was nearly as stunning as the first frigid breath outside had been sweat sprang out on his forehead he got out of his overcoat in a hurry so did libbie good evening general custer maam henry welton said he rose and saluted custer returned the salute good evening colonel he said yes everything was perfectly proper perfectly correct and colder than the blizzard outside everything had been that way since hed brought the fifth cavalry down to fort benton after the first of the year he sniffed and smiled whats for supper he asked whatever it is it sure smells good sometimes his pretense broke the ice for a little while today was one of those times henry welton actually smiled back and answered in civil tones fried potatoes from our own garden boiled beans and salt pork and roast prairie chickens he even essayed a small joke not too hard keeping meat fresh this season of the year no indeed custer tried to joke back not too hard keeping meat hard cither this season of the year welton smiled again so did a couple of his junior officers so did custer with some effort it didnt help much he and the officers of weltons seventh infantry were smiling past one another like carriages going by on opposite sides of the road custer was fond of fried potatoes though he would have liked fried onionsor onions of any sorteven more the beans and pork were beans and pork hed been eating them for so many years he hardly noticed them on his plate except insofar as they helped fill his belly he enjoyed the prairie chickens they were all dark meat and full of flavor a couple of whiskey bottles and a pitcher of lemonade from concentrate went around the table most of the officers drank whiskey libbie filled her tin cup with lemonade and pointedly passed the pitcher to custer wouldnt you like some autic that would have sounded harmless to anyone who didnt know her well to custer it was anything but with the weather like this i do believe id sooner have something to help keep me warm he said one of the whiskey bottles sat within reach he poured somenot an enormous tot by any meansinto his cup then raised it high confusion to our enemies not even welton and his officers could find fault with that toast they drank with custer as the liquor ran down his throat libbie gave him a look that should have completely counteracted its warming effect but somehow didnt quite she did no more than that in public she stood foursquare behind custer for behaving in any other way might have harmed his chances what she was liable to say when they went back to their quarters was another matter custer didnt care to think about that to help keep him from thinking about it he poured more whiskey into the cup libbie sent him another glacial glance confusion to our enemies indeed henry welton said he was drinking whiskey too and making no bones about it its the best thing that could strike them from our point of view and the only thing that could bring them down to our level when it came to politicswith no doubt the exception of custers political ambitionscuster and the officers of the seventh infantry were not so far apart almost to a man they loathed the administration currently in washington or rather in philadelphia having been shelled out of washington only the presence of libbie custer and some of the other officers wives kept them from expressing their opinion in terms even more forceful than the ones they used custer said we didnt know what the devil we were doing when we made war and we dont know what the devil were doing now that were trying to make peace either blaine cant stomach giving away half of maine welton said scornfully if he does itll make the state we ship him back to smaller we should have hanged lincoln look at the rabblerousing hes doing nowand we should hang that dashed idiot blaine too custer said even with whiskey in him he would not curse in the presence of women thats what comes of electing republicans libbie said there her opinions marched with her husbands once we finally do have peaceif we finally do have peacethatll be a sham too nothing but a hoax and a humbug custer said it always has been sooner or later the fifth will go back to kansas and well ride along the border with the csa and sure as the devil the kiowas and the comanches will ride up and burn a farm and kill the men and do worse to the women and then theyll go back down into indian territory where we cant follow em its been going on ever since the war of secession and what can we do about it not a blasted thing i can see a considerable silence followed into it custer added thats the way its always been and i dont sec it changing any time soon i wish i did but i dont not quite quietly enough one of henry weltons officers muttered i wish to jesus the fifth would go back to kansas and get the devil out of our hair another considerable silence filled the room this one not nearly so sympathetic nor companionable as the first custer might have blown up instead and he saw libbie looking at him in surprise he sipped his whiskey and affected not to hear when the fifth did go back to kansas he would not be going back with it at least not as regimental commander that was too small a position for a brigadier general to hold maybe as john pope had been doing before being sent to utah he would take charge of several regiments maybe the war department would send him back to washington to help clean up the mess there whether or not he did that someone would have to take care of it and maybe when rolled around he would lay down his commission take off his uniform put on a civilian sack suit and top hat and campaign not against the british or the confederates or the indians but against the manifest and manifold iniquities of the republican party that though was not entirely up to him he would have to see whatand whomthe leaders of the democrats had in mind henry welton said general when you do go back to kansas would you arrange to leave behind some of your gatlinggun crews as a defense against another british invasion why certainly custer said as a matter of fact he was about to say you re welcome to every blasted one of them before he could he saw libbie looking intently at him that look reminded him of the slaughter the gatlings had wreaked on the kiowas they might do the same again tom would surely have thought so he softened his words as a matter of fact you can have several of them thank you sir by weltons tone hed expected custer to give him all the contraptions maybe the whiskey helped fuel custers chuckle being too predictable didnt do see me tomorrow colonel and well see if we cant settle on how many can stay here and how many will go with us yes sir ill do that welton answered i do wish you all the best on your return to kansas that was more polite than the way his junior officer had phrased it but meant the same thing henry welton did not care for having a bigger chief in the teepee with him when supper was over custer and libbie made their way back to their quarters it was cold outside and had got colder since theyd come to the dining room inside it was nice and warm libbie spoke one word whiskey all at once it was chillier in there than out in the snow custer wanted another drink chapter a s it then agreed general alfred von schlieffen asked you will send officers to berlin to study the methods of the german empire you will send officers to berlin to learn how to do things right was what he meant but although no diplomat he knew better than to phrase it so major general william s rosecrans scratched the end of his long nose then nodded it is agreed colonel he told the german military attache or rather the president the secretary of state and i agree to it the royal navy unfortunately has other ideas schlieffen said had president blaine made peace some time ago the british would not have found it necessary the blockade of your coast to resume i am painfully aware of that rosecrans said and his voice did indeed hold pain the entire country i would say is painfully aware of thatthe entire country less one man what can be done to persuade him schlieffen asked even if he would for more war make ready he cannot fight more now he needs to win time in which the united states can get over this fight so it has always been so i think it will always be do you know the fable about the goddamn donkey dithering between two bales of hay colonel rosecrans asked after schlieffen had nodded the us generalinchief went on well sir james g blaine is that donkey except both bales are poisoned if you were one of my colonels instead of one of the kaisers colonels id say he was a prize horses ass too but you arent so i wont but you just schlieffen broke off realizing exactly what rosecrans had done the military attache sniffed as if he had a cold hed smelled liquor on rosecrans breath before he didnt smell it now anger and frustration could also drive a man into indiscretion rosecrans went on one bale of hay is making peace with the bastards who beat us but that means admitting they beat us and he cant stomach it the other bale is going back to war with cm but if we do the only thing thatll happen is that theyll lick us some more he knows as much but he keeps trying to sick it up too and that leaves him nothing to do but dither stupid fools got pretty good at it too wouldnt you say hes had practice enough lately anyway this dithering though schlieffen liked the sound of the word and repeated it this dithering cannot last president blaine must remember he is not the only one who can begin again the war come soon or come late your enemies will force you to fight if you do not obey now this blockade is only a small thing much more could come much more would come rosecrans wrinkles got deeper i know that damn it youll have a friend in richmond your attache to the confederate states i mean aber naturlich a colleague schlieffen made the correction without noticing hed done it since his wifes deathto a large degree before his wifes death toohed so immersed himself in work that he had no time for friends then youll have got word from him one way or another that the confederate states are moving troops toward the potomac rosecrans said i had heard this yes schlieffen said nodding i was not going to speak of it if you did not such is not my place theyre moving a good many troops rosecrans voice was sour heavy the railroad makes it easy to move a lot of troops in a hurryhell of a lot easier than moving em on roads kneedeep in mud would be they arent coming up toward the border for their amusement or for ours you are also moving troops i know schlieffen said oh yes the us generalinchief bobbed his head up and down if they hit us well give em the best damn fight we candont doubt it for a minute colonel the best fight we can but what you may not have heardhe was almost whispering now like a boy talking about some bugbear or hobgoblinis that general jackson is back in richmond no i had not heard that schlieffen said on hearing it he heard also that rosecrans was a beaten man no matter how many men the usa moved down to the potomac jackson would find a way to beat them because rosecrans thought jackson would find a way to beat them someoneschlieffen annoyed himself by not recalling whether it was napoleon or clausewitzhad wisely said that the moral was to the physical in war as three was to one as austrian and prussian armies had for so long gone into battle against bonaparte convinced before the fighting started that they would lose so rosecrans faced the prospect of confronting jackson well its true god damn it to hell its true rosecrans said schlieffen listened with half an ear trying to remember which military genius had come up with the maxim he couldnt like a bit of gristle stuck between two back teeth it would bother him till he did he became aware that rosecrans had said something else something hed missed entirely excuse me please he said embarrassed at piling one professional failure on another i said a few friends in the world sure would come in handy about now rosecrans repeated for this war you have no friends who can give you help schlieffen said this was i hear from every american the idea of your president washington this man has not been your president for many years maybe it is time to think that matters have perhaps changed since his day ill tell you what im starting to think rosecrans said savagely im starting to think washington was nothing but a stinking virginian and the rebs can damn well keep him and his ideas both schlieffen did not smile he made a point of not smiling not only would smiling have been against his interest and his countrys he was such a resolutely moderate man that smiling did not come easy to him anyhow in his usual careful way he said i hope you will also say this to your president and to your foreign ministerno secretary of state you call him ive been saying it since things started going downhill without any brakes rosecrans answered ive been saying it to anyone who will listen colonel if you think president blaine is inclined to listen to me you had better think again if you think hes inclined to listen to anybody you had better think again this is not good schlieffen said the telephone jangled rosecrans jerked as if a horsefly had bitten him guess who that is he said with a martyred sigh he may not listen but by jesus he likes to talk schlieffen left the office of the generalinchief behind him rosecrans bellowed into the newfangled instrument as schlieffen came out into the outer office captain saul berryman looked up from his paperwork with a martyred expression auf wiedersehen herr oberst he said goodbye captain schlieffen answered he had more than a little sympathy for rosecrans adjutant a capable young man trapped in a position where his ability did his nation less good than it might have in the field the calendar said spring was only a few days away freezing rain pelted down in spite of what the calendar said schlieffen hardly noticed as he walked to the carriage waiting for him and climbed in his mind was elsewhere napoleon or clausewitz clausewitz or napoleon that he could not make a fact he knew spring up and stand to attention infuriated him back to the consuls establishment colonel the driver asked yes schlieffen snapped he paid no more attention to the drivers chattering teeth than he had to the weather that caused them the wheels of the carriage slipped a little on the icy paving stones but then the toe calks on the horses shoes bit and the carriage began to roll despite the weather some sort of political demonstration was going on not far from the war department building socialists schlieffen thought seeing the red flags that hung sodden from their staffs hed seen more socialist demonstrations than he liked back in germany but never till now one of this size in the united states when he reported what he had seen to kurd von schlozer the german minister to the usa nodded one faction of blaine s own party has made common cause with the socialists schlozer said really i had not heard save as they affected military affairs schlieffen paid little attention to politics schlozer gave him a look that said he should have heeded them more closely if we have no peace soon we shall have fighting in the streets with the socialists now stronger we may have revolution red revolution he said this is a land of revolution and the socialists the new socialists i meanknow it and exploit it god forbid schlieffen said if they try to raise a revolution may they be met with iron and blood after using bismarck s famous phrase he nodded to schlozer you know i feel the same about the socialist movement in the fatherland oh yes my dear colonel of course schlozer said no man of property no man of sense could possibly say otherwise but too many americans like too many germans have neither property nor sense and the leaders of the socialists here like the leaders there have an oversupply of cunning if not of sense this has not been true in the united states schlieffen said so much i knowotherwise the socialists here would have stirred up far more trouble than they have now though men who really know something of politics have started waving red flags for purposes of their own the german minister said in matters of politics blaine is now as dead as a salt herring even if he could have been reelected beforewhich would have taken an act of godhe has no hope whatever with a large part of his party going over to the radicals he must understand as much this is not good schlieffen said as he had to rosecrans a man without hope will do irrational things since blaine did irrational things even when the situation for himself and his country looked better who knows how crazy and wild he might become now we shall see kurd von schlozer sounded less gloomy than schlieffen would have schlieffen wondered if his superior was deluding himself about how sensible president blaine could be from what the german military attache had seen expecting common sense from americans was like looking for water in a desert you might find some but even if you did it would be only an oasis in a vast stretch of hot dry burning sand napoleon he exclaimed suddenly and felt much better about the world hot sand had made him think of egypt which had made him think of bonapartes campaign there which in turn had reminded him of whose adage had crossed his mind during his conversation with rosecrans kurd von schlozer gave him a curious look a couple of days later after a cable from berlin schlozer requested an audience with blaine when the request was granted the german minister asked schlieffen to accompany him of course your excellency schlieffen said if you think my being there will do some good if not i have other matters to occupy my time he was still refining the plan for movement against france whose basic idea hed borrowed from lees campaign in pennsylvania hed had wires of his own from berlin the general staff was enthusiastic about the outline hed sent but schlozer said military affairs are likely to be discussed so your place is with me however much schlieffen would have liked to go on burrowing through his booksinadequate though his research tools here in philadelphia werehe could only obey hiding a sigh he set down his pen and carefully locking the door to his office behind him followed schlozer downstairs to the carriage bright sunshine made him blink the bad weather had blown past philadelphia the day before now he could believe spring was at hand soonall too soonsummer would grip the eastern seaboard of the united states in its hot sweaty fist down from germantown the carriage made its way dodging among others like it rumbling wagons men on horseback men on bicycles with improbably high front wheels and swarms of men and women on foot and then as had happened to schlieffen coming back from the war department a political rally snarled traffic that would have been bad without it now red flags rippled in a friendly breeze now not only the most dedicated socialists those fearing neither catarrh nor pneumonia assembled under the flags now nervouslooking soldiers helped police route buggies and horses and pedestrians around the streets the demonstrators clogged schlieffen and schlozer never came within two blocks of the rally even so the socialists shouts rose above the clatter of horses hooves the rattle of iron tires on paving and the squeals and groans of axles needing grease can you make out what they are saying your excellency schlieffen asked i believe the cry is justice schlozer clicked his tongue between his teeth if i were petitioning the almighty or even my government i would sooner ask for mercy but then i am an old man and well aware of how much i need it waving flags in the street is not an old mans sport because of the rally they got to the powel house fifteen minutes late president blaine brushed aside kurd von schlozers apologies dont trouble yourself about it your excellency blaine said i want to tell you that i received yesterday a telegram from the us minister in berlin informing me that his talks with chancellor bismarck continue to go well and that prospects look bright for increased cooperation in all spheres between our two great countries i am delighted to hear this mr president schlozer said and schlieffen nodded knowing all spheres included the military but the german minister looked grim as he continued i also received yesterday a telegram from berlin whose contents i wish to discuss with you now i must tell you that the governments of britain france and the confederate states are most dissatisfied with the dilatory pace of negotiations with your government since germany is neutral in this conflict they have united in asking chancellor bismarck to make me the channel through which they express to you their dissatisfaction if you refuse to meet their demands i cannot answer for the consequences blaine flushed his large bulbous nose went redder than the rest of his face their demands are outrageous impossible he shouted as if he were on the rostrum rather than sitting in his office how am i to yield so large a portion of my home state to the invaders how am i to acquiesce in the confederacys acquisition of lands to which that nation has no right if you had yielded sonora and chihuahua before you would not now the loss of part of maine face schlieffen said you have lost the war vae victis as brennus the gaul said to the romans he had beaten blaine glared at him the romans ended up whipping the gauls so that woe to the conquered applied to the conquerors we can fight on too sadly schlieffen shook his head no your excellency not in this war you are defeated kurd von schlozer said the reason we were tardy mr president was the large socialists demonstration that forced traffic to make a detour around it blaine s complexion darkened once more socialists he said as if pronouncing an obscenity most of them are traitors to the republican party nothing else as may be schlozer said would you not agree though that they leave your own political future more uncertain than it was before the schism in your party took place now blaine had heard blunt talk from both the german attache and the german minister you tread close to the edge sir he growled schlozer sat impassive waiting for a more responsive answer at last obviously hating every word blaine said you may be right that was the response for which schlozer had waited being now without hope and so without fear your excellency can you not act as a disinterested statesman and serve with a whole heart the needs of your country you have the chance mr president and a rare chance it is for an elected official to do just that without considering your own future political advantage for you can have none had blaine not been in the room schlieffen might have smiled schlozer could not have urged a more sensible more logical course on the president of the united states the only question remaining was whether sense and logic could still reach james g blaine schlieffen added a few words of his own if you do not do this your excellency your country will only suffer more in your heart you must know this is so again blaine stayed silent a long time at last very low he repeated you may be right he let out a long shuddering sigh making peace with the enemies of my country is like looking into my open grave but as you say i am already dead so what does it matter how i am buried think of your country schlozer said think of the future and what your country and mine may do there schlieffen said slowly blaine nodded philander snow spat a brown stream into a drift of the stuff whose name he bore theodore roosevelt had changed the calendar from march to april a couple of days before hed seen spring snow in new york state seeing it in montana territory did not delight him but it did not surprise him either his mind had a way of running toward what would be weve got to plant as soon as we can phil he said we shant have a long growing seasonwe never do not here but it will be even shorter this year everything must be in readiness to move the moment conditions permit snow spat again it will be colonel hed taken to calling roosevelt that since his boss return from commanding the unauthorized regiment having been mustered out of the us army roosevelt no longer had any formal right to the title the next time he corrected the ranch hand about it would be the first thats good phil thats what i want to hear he said now adding for about the hundredth time i know i can rely on you if id ever had any doubtswhich i haventthe way you and the rest of the hands who didnt join my regiment brought in the harvest last fall would have shot them right between the eyes thats white of you colonel we reckoned it was the least we could do seein how you and the unauthorized regiment was doin everything you could to keep them goddamn english bastards from comin down and burnin us out snow loosed yet another stream of tobacco juice ask you somethin you may ask roosevelt said i dont promise to answer fair enough snow nodded all kinds of talk been goin around about how youll up and sell this here ranch and go back to new york to do some politicking there is it so or is it a pile of humbug id love to go back to new york and politic there roosevelt answered the only trouble with the notion is that in order to run for the state assembly i must have attained the twentyfifth year of my age i am old enough to have fought for my country and to have commanded men in battle but not old enough to help legislate for my state plumb crazy you ask me philander snow opined course nobody asked me crazy it may be roosevelt said the law of the state it is and so i shall stay here in montana territory here on the ranch a while longer at any rate he did his best to speak lightly as if that mattered to him only a little inside he seethed with worry lest the fickle populace forget him before he reached the age where he could offer himself for approval well im powerful glad to hear that snow said powerful glad ive been pleased with my situation here and id hate to have to go looking for another one on account of you was sellin the place for no better reason than to go back east and tell lies to people the rest of your days is that what politics means to you roosevelt demanded the ranch hand nodded without hesitation roosevelt s sigh loosed a cloud of steam into the chilly air i give you my solemn word i shall always tell the truth to the people ive heard a lot of people say that snow spoke in ruminative tones maybe youre telling the truth colonel i hope to jesus you are matter of fact but it wouldnt startle me out of my stockings if i found out you wasnt i shall always tell the truth to the people roosevelt repeated always do not doubt me on this phil i mean every word i say you are right when you assert that the american people have already heard too many lies snow cocked his head to one side and studied roosevelt for a while before saying its a young mans promise colonel maybe theres a reason a fellow has got to be twentyfive before he can run after all you get older you figure out theres a deal of gray between black and white a man who will see gray once will see gray all the time theodore roosevelt scornfully tossed his head a man who sees gray will never see black nor white either even when they are there that i think defines your runofthemill politician to a t i may be a politician one dayi would be lying if i said i didnt fancy the notionbut whatever else history may record of me it shall never say i was runofthemill philander snow gave him another measuring appraisal punctuating it by putting another brown spot in the white by his feet i dont reckon anyone will call you that some other things maybe but not that one there i hope no one does roosevelt said even those who were great in their time are so easily forgotten who now recalls the deeds of lysander the spartan or frederick barbarossa not me thats for damn sure snow said at once just so roosevelt said just so i want my name to live to be a possession for all time phil wouldnt have heard of thucydides either so roosevelt didnt bother explaining where hed got that last phrase but even if the ranch hand hadnt heard of him a lot of what the greek historian had to say about the war between athens and sparta in the fifth century before christ could as readily have been written about the modern struggles between the usa and the csa just as sparta had got aid from rich persia against athens which otherwise was probably the stronger so the confederate states had used help from england and france to put down the united states which alone was the larger richer and more populous of the two snow said good shootin the breeze with you boss im headin off to check on the stock he trudged down toward the barn his boots crunching as each step broke the crust on the latest snowfall roosevelt went inside to catch up on the bookkeeping no sooner had he got to work than dark clouds rolled across the sun he lighted a lamp in the study a few minutes later it went dry filling the room with the stink of kerosene when he went to put more into it he discovered the ranch house was almost out he went to the door and shouted for philander snow eventually snow stuck his head out of the barn when roosevelt asked him if there was any kerosene in there the ranch hand answered sure as hell aint we should have bought some the last time the handbasket went down to helena only we forgot damnation roosevelt muttered none in the hands quarter either sure as hell aint snow repeated oh maybe enough for a day or two you spread it out amongst there and the barn and the ranch house but maybe not even that much neither damnation roosevelt said again then he brightened well hitch up the horses to the handbasket well just have to go down to helena again and get some any excuse to get into town even his own absentmindedness was a good one as far as he was concerned here on the ranch he was feeling isolated again the year before hed been part of great events now unless he went down to helena he didnt even know about them till long after they happenednot till someone chanced to bring word up to the ranch thinking along with him snow said we got the chance to find out what in hells gone wrong the past few days swear to jesus sometimes i laugh till im like to bust listenin to you cuss old blaine and the socialists and whoever else you aint feelin happy about of a mornin im so glad i amuse you roosevelt said i wish i amused myself you do know that what youre laughing about is the humiliation of the united states oh no colonelwhat im laughin about is you cussin the humiliation of the united states snow said a distinction a jesuit might have envied before roosevelt could remark on it the hand went back into the barn presumably to hitch the horses to the farm wagon when he brought the wagon out he gave roosevelt a wistful look dont suppose youd want some company on the way down to helena i alone committed the sin of omission roosevelt answered i alone shall atone for it philander snow let out a gusty sigh hed done his best to get out of several hours work done his best and failed in which he resembled his country having failed he went back to the unending chores that bulked so large in farm life roosevelt rattled down the road by himself in the back of the wagon the fivegallon milk cans in which hed bring back the lamp oil did considerable rattling of their own they had kerosene painted on them in big red letters to make sure no milk went into them by mistake with snow on it the ground was still hard before long the snow would melt and everything would turn to mud getting to helena through the resulting morass was liable to be an allday job as opposed to a couple of hours each way a horseman came up the road toward roosevelt as the fellow trotted past he took off his hat and waved it saying good day to you colonel and to you magnussen roosevelt answered you look well hows that leg of yours feeling i remember your captain saying you fought bravely oh thank you colonel the former trooper of the unauthorized regiment blushed like a girl the leg is good how do you recall all your men and who got hit in the leg and who in the arm and so on how you just do it roosevelt saw nothing out of the ordinary in carrying a flock of details in his head its no harder than memorizing the multiplication tableeasier for men have faces and voices and numbers dont magnusscn laughed easier for you maybe colonel but not for the likes of me he lifted his hat again then rode on a man can do anything he sets his mind on doing roosevelt called after him magnussen gave no sign that hed heard though he wasnt out of earshot roosevelt shrugged too many men would not set their minds on anything worth doing that to him was why they did not succeed he loosed an angry snort at the absurdity of abraham lincolns socialist notions when he got to helena he took some little while reaching the general store men whod served in the unauthorized regiment were thick on the ground in the territorial capital if roosevelt had taken all of them up on the drinks they wanted to buy him he would have forgotten his name let alone such minutiae as where he lived and what hed come into town to buy he filled the milk cans from the big wooden barrel behind the counter at the store the proprietor a big redhead named mcnamara said i reckoned you was runnin low last time you was in colonel but you always know your own business so good figured i was crazy myself even jove nods roosevelt said which meant nothing to the storekeeper grunting roosevelt carried the full milk cans out to the wagon he turned down another drink while he was doing that virtue unalloyed would have sent him straight back to the ranch his virtue turned out not to be quite free of admixture instead of riding out of town with the kerosene he went over to the offices of the helena gazette as usual a crowd had gathered in front of the building to read the newspaper on display under glass roosevelt hitched the wagon and started working his way through the crowd toward the paper he didnt worry about the kerosene nobody could inconspicuously amble off with a fivegallon milk can full of the stuff men made way for him so he got to the gazette far sooner than he would have before hed recruited the unauthorized regiment they reached out to shake his hand or slap him on the back if helena had anything to say about it he could have been elected president tomorrow what he read though made him grind his teeth the arrogance of our enemies he burst out but for maine they hold not a single square inch of our sacred soil yet they presume to order us around as if we were beasts of burden what are we going to do to them somebody asked what can we do to them were too busy squabbling among ourselves to hurt anybody else he pointed to a story about a socialist parade in boston that had got out of hand the police had opened fire and four were dead including one policeman red is the color of the blood of martyrs a socialist spokesman was quoted as saying to hell with abraham lincoln roosevelt ground out custer was rightpope should have hanged him while he had him under lock and key in utah territory hes ten times as much trouble as all the mormons and all their wives put together he heard himself in some surprise he hadnt thought he might agree with custer on anything about half the crowd in front of the copy of the gazette loudly approved his words the other halfminers mostlyas loudly told him where to go and how to get there helena he remembered had broken out in riots after one of lincoln s speeches while great falls had stayed calm to a man who had nothing to offer but the sweat of his brow class warfare was a seductive strumpet indeed i dont think lincoln s is the best way for the working men of this country to get a square deal he said sticking out his chin and besides if we fight one another who wins do the capitalists win do the workers win not a chance in hell either way ill tell you who wins the british and the french and the confederates nobody else that got him a thoughtful silence he was happy enough to gain even so much hed been wondering whether helena would erupt again on account of him he knew where the gatling guns were colonel welton had kept most of them even after custer returned to kansas they were the most telling argument yet prepared against the rise of socialism but then a miner said colonel you can talk about winners and losers as much as you likewhen youre one of the winners when youre putting in twelve fourteen hours underground six days a week and you dont make enough to feed yourself let alone your wife and children well hell youve already lost how are you worse off then if you try and do something different what can you throw away that aint already gone the miner drew applause from people who had booed roosevelt those who had agreed with him stood silent waiting to hear what he would say he picked his words with care do you want to burn down the timbers that arc holding up the roof of the tunnel thats what red revolution means if you want to shore up the roof so it doesnt come down on your head peaceably petition the government for redress of grievances and a hell of a lot of good thatll do the miner said they only listen to the bastards with money no roosevelt said they listen to the bastards with votes and you mark my words sir they will go a hell of a long way to keep the revolution from coming a man will do a great many startling things if all his other choices look worse on that you may rely lincoln said the same damn thing and you were going on about hanging him the miner said lincoln pays lip service to peaceable redress but he doesnt believe in it roosevelt said i do the miner looked him up and down you dont mind me saying so theres a hell of a lot of difference between what some pup who was a cavalry colonel for a little while thinks and what goes through the head of a fellow who was president of the united states and whos been trying to help the little fellow the labouring man his whole life long some little pup who was a cavalry colonel for a little while a flush heated roosevelt s cheeks and turned his ears to fire now he knew what came after hero hasbeen savagely he said lincoln is the past i am the future and socialism sir socialism is the road to ruin if he impressed the miner the manwho had to be at least twice his agedid not show it talk is cheap he said you get to be as old as lincoln is nowadays you look back and see what youve done see if you measure up you ask me it aint likely i will take that wager and i will take that chance theodore roosevelt said and there is one thing lincoln has done that i swear before almighty god i shall never do yeah the miner laughed what is it if the chance should come my way to fight the confederate states of america i shall never lose a war to them roosevelt promised the miner laughed again roosevelt didnt care general thomas jackson had just finished the last piece of fried chicken on his plate and was wiping his fingers when someone knocked on the door of his richmond house who could that be his wife said in some annoyance i had looked for a quiet evening at home since the war took you away from your family for so long i think i am entitled to look for a few quiet evenings at home with you let us hope it is some traveler who has lost his way and seeks directions then jackson said but if it is not mary that too is as god wills cyrus the butler came into the dining room general jackson suh senator hampton say he wish to have a word with you the slave reported hampton jackson s eyebrows rose so did he of course ill see him youve put him in the parlor cyrus nodded jackson headed in that direction i wonder what on earth he can want with me though when he went into the parlor wade hampton iii rose from a sofa to shake his hand the senator from south carolina was five or six years older than jackson portly but erect balding with a neat beard once brown but now mostly gray and splendid mustachios he and jackson had known each other for twenty years since the days when the former planter commanded a cavalry brigade under jeb stuart after the greetings were done after hampton had declined food and drink the south carolinian closed both doors into the parlor having first looked up and down each hallway to ensure that no one lurked nearby that bit of melodrama accomplished he said i must have your word general that come what may what we say and do here tonight shall remain solely between the two of us well sir that depends jackson said if you are contemplating treason against the government of the confederate states im afraid i cannot help you hed meant it for a joke a piece of light badinage the last thing he expected was for wade hampton to look as if hed just taken a gunshot wound slowly hampton said treason against the government of the confederate states is not the same as treason against the confederate states of this i am convinced down to the bottom of my soul if you disagree tell me at once and i shall bid you a good evening and beg your pardon for having disturbed you you had better tell me more jackson said also slowly i must confess i have not the faintest idea of what you are talking about do you believe that i in my recent conversation with general rosecrans and mr hay am somehow betraying our country if so sir we would be wiser to continue this conversation through our friends dueling had been illegal in virginia for many years from time to time though gentlemen still traded fire on the field of honor but hampton hastily held up a hand by no means he exclaimed you do not tarnish the honor of the confederacy your every action brightens it would to god others might say the same instead of trampling our beloved constitution in the dust take a seat sir take a seat jackson urged after hampton sat so did the confederate generalinchief on a canebacked chair well suited to his rigid posture you still have the advantage of me for i know of no plots brewing against our government you have a sizable army in northern virginia ready to compel the yankees to obedience hampton said after jackson nodded the senator went on i trust the men would also obey you if you called on them to preserve our republic from those who would destroy the principles on which it was founded speak your mind if that is what you came for jackson said wade hampton did nothing of the sort but sat mute jackson s bushy eyebrows came down low over his eyes the scowl that made soldiers quail had no effect on the senator sighing jackson did something out of the ordinary for him he gave ground very wellyou have my promise i knew you were a true patriot hampton breathed here then i shall ask my question which is thisif you order your men to defend the constitution of the confederate states will they move against the men here in richmond who set it at naught when hampton spoke of setting an army in motion against richmond that was liable to be treason though jackson could not imagine his old comradeinarms disloyal to the csa from whom in your view does the constitution want defending he asked and at last the senator from south carolina brought his fear and anger out into the light from president longstreet general and from any other man who would tamper with the structure of society we have so long maintained in our beloved nation ahh jackson let out a long exhalation you oppose him because he intends to manumit the negro of course i do hampton said what rightthinking white man in this country does not my home state was first to leave the usa because of the federal governments continued interference with slavery as our ordinance of secession clearly shows shall we tolerate from richmond the tyranny that led us to break with washington jackson sighed again this time with deep regret i am afraid we shall senator he said hampton stared at him he went on the president has persuaded me that his policy is in the best interest of our country if not for the intervention of britain and france we might well have failed in the war of secession if not for their intervention we should have had a far more difficult time in this war if we forfeit their support by maintaining an institution they despise how shall we fare against the yankees the next time we have to face them well lick em of course wade hampton iii replied at once we always have we always will i wish i shared your certainty jackson said from the bottom of my heart i wish i shared your certainty but i do not i cannot since i do not and cannot and since i know the president purposes giving the negro the name of freedom but not much of the thing itself i am willing to suspend my disagreement with him on this matter and to believe him better acquainted with what will best serve us than i am myself hampton s countenance darkened general you are making a mistake if you choose to side with a man who would cast down our peculiar institution senator you are making a mistake if you seek to suborn me into treason against the duly elected head of my government jackson answered evenly the army will stand behind the president sir you may take that to be as much a given as one of euclid s axioms of geometry this being so have we anything further to say to each other i think not senator hampton headed for the door you need not accompany me general i can find my own way out he opened the door from the parlor to the front hall then slammed it shut another windowrattling slam marked his departure from jackson s home good heavens his wife exclaimed when he returned to the table you sent the senator away unhappy tom she took a longer look at jackson and you are unhappy most unhappy yourself what happened between the two of you nothing i much care to discuss jackson answered least said soonest mended he hoped with all his heart that his flat rejection of hampton s overtures would persuade the senator any attempt at a coup detat was foredoomed to failure if it didnt force of arms would persuade hampton and whoever backed him of the same thing we had a disagreement thats all and the senator from south carolina is and has always been a man of somewhat hasty temper his sons eyes glowed hampton s redhot for holding the nigger down and putting a foot on his neck jonathan said ill bet he was trying to talk father into going against manumission jackson rolled his eyes up to the heavens senator hampton is a fool he growled jonathan grinned an enormous grin convinced his fathers words meant he was right so they did though not quite for the reason he thought jackson himself paid as little attention to politics as he could hampton s appeal had taken him by surprise but if his purpose was so obvious that even a youtha youth more politically alert than the confederate generalinchiefcould see it people of greater prominence than that youth also would see it and sure enough when jackson went to the war department the next morning to continue discussion with general rosecrans and minister hay he was not altogether astonished to have a young lieutenant take him aside and lead him down the hall to a small room where president longstreet sat waiting without preamble longstreet said you had a visit from wade hampton last night yes your excellency i did jackson said he asked you to help overthrow the government if i persist in moving us toward manumission longstreet did not phrase it as a question by his request mr president what passed between us last night is a private matter jackson said you need not tell mei know hampton s mind longstreet said i also know you sent him away with a flea in his ear how do you know jackson paused you are having him watched spoken so baldly it sounded like a transgression but longstreet nodded unembarrassed i most certainly am if he were actor enough to simulate the fury he showed outside your home he would do better before the footlights than in the senate i assure you general i do not intend our nation to be torn asunder in the hour of our greatest triumph our greatest triumph jackson sighed a great pity general stuart cannot now enjoy it with us that it is longstreet agreed still he fell in action as he no doubt would have wished to do and we have avenged and shall avenge ourselves upon the apaches manyfold for his assassination but nothing not even the death of a friend of many years could derail longstreets train of thought for long believe me general i am glad you share my views on the integrity of our nation i do indeed jackson said on the other hand abraham lincoln had not intended the united states to be torn asunder either but longstreet almost as if in response to jackson s thought went on and i shall not allow hampton and his fellows any opportunity to do us mischief either i shall steal their thunder easter has come and gone the end of april approaches still blaine delays and delays and delays he shall delay no more is the army gathered by the potomac in readiness you know it is your excellency jackson replied as if he had been insulted of course i do the president said soothingly still the question had to be asked at todays session with the yankees you and minister benjamin are to tell them the war will resume in fortyeight hours unless we the british empire and france have the full acquiescence of the united states to all demands made against them before that time shall have expired yes sir jackson s voice bubbled with enthusiasm we shall punish them as they deserve he thought for a moment and in so doing we make hampton and his complaints into smaller matters than they would be otherwise just so james longstreet said i have told you before i believe that you are or you can be more astute in matters political than one might suppose you natter me beyond my deserts sir jackson said like you my son had no trouble ciphering out the reason on account of which senator hampton paid me a call though i did not realize what it was until he made himself unmistakably plain jonathans a clever lad longstreet said smiling remember the united states are to have fortyeight hours from the moment you deliver the ultimatum make careful note of the time that we may not unduly delay their punishment should its infliction prove necessary i shall carry out your orders in every particular mr president jackson said you may rest assured on that score i do general believe me longstreet got to his feet and now lieutenant latham will take you to mr benjamin i leave to the two of you the manner in which you present the ultimatum to the united states i am confident that between your ingenuity and his you will devise a plan more likely to meet our needs than any my poor wits might conceive i am confident i know a man hiding his light under a bushel when i see one jackson said ignoring longstreets modest little wave he went on i also have great faith in mr benjamins ingenuity he rose and followed the young officer to the room where the confederate minister to the usa waited ah general jackson judah p benjamin exclaimed in delight or an artful counterfeit thereof the president has told you of his intention he has jackson knew how abrupt his nod was benjamins round smiling semitic face framed by hair and beard dyed a black that defied and denied his years never failed to make the confederate generalinchief nervous the statesman was too openly successful too openly clever a jew to suit jackson s stern christianity my view general is that you should be the one to deliver the ultimatum benjamin said now coming from your lips it will possess an aura of authority i could never give it were i to present it to hay and rosecrans they would the more readily assume it to be negotiable so they would jackson agreed benjamins smile never wavered jackson did not think to wonder if he had insulted the jew by assuming him to be flexible in all circumstances drawing out his pocket watch he said the yankees should be here in a few minutes another young confederate lieutenant escorted the us representatives into the room after polite greetings john hay said i should like to bring to your attention a new proposal president blaine has authorized me to no jackson interrupted i beg your pardon the us minister to the confederate states said no jackson repeated the time for proposals from president blaine has passed he is in no position to offer them he has in fact but one choice left peace on our terms or war he delivered longstreets ultimatum in tones as fierce as he could muster having done so he noted down the time on a scrap of paper twentyseven minutes past ten in the morning hay and rosecrans both stared at him the one with something like horror on his handsome face the other in a sort of weary resignation rosecrans found his tongue first and what happens if president blaine makes no reply saying neither yes nor no that is a well he has drunk dry it will be construed as rejecting the ultimatum jackson replied if we do not hear that he has accepted our terms within the space of fortyeight hours now lesshe looked at the watch againtwo minutes the war shall begin again and where it shall end is known but to god general this is a brutal and most unreasonable way of forcing your will upon us john hay said yes it is isnt it jackson agreed placidly he said no more than that leaving the us minister to the confederate states nothing on which he could hang a further protest judah p benjamin spoke for the first time gentlemen i would suggest that in view of the present circumstances you might be well advised to communicate this ultimatum to president blaine as soon as is practicable to give him the greatest possible amount of time in which he can decide under his breath general rosecrans muttered blaine s had months to decide what the devil difference will two more days make jackson and benjamin both started to speak at the same time the confederate minister to the usa caught jackson s eye benjamins own eyes dark and all but fathomless glinted jackson inclined his head allowing his clever companion to say whatever he intended turning another of his woundingly bland smiles on the us representatives benjamin remarked i believe it was samuel johnson gentlemen who observed when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully hay winced rosecrans muttered again this time unintelligibly gathering himself hay said i hope you will permit us an adjournment then to wire your demands to our president now judah benjamin nodded to jackson i not only permit it the confederate generalinchief said require it rosecrans comments to himself sounded sulfurous even if jackson could not make them out in detail with a sigh hay asked may we have a written copy of the ultimatum to be sure it is communicated accurately to president blaine jackson shook his head no for i have not got one the terms are of the simplest however either your government shall yield within fortyeight hours less thirteen minutes now or there will be renewed war war a ioutrance benjamin added rosecrans who plainly did not understand the french phrase glared at him hay who plainly did also glared in a different more nearly desperate way the two us representatives rose shook hands again with their confederate counterparts and took their leave from now on sir these talks will be in your hands alone i expect jackson said to benjamin i shall shortly travel north to the potomac to take charge of operations against the united states in that region in my opinion general you need not be overhasty the minister to the united states replied i dare not take the chance of your being mistaken jackson said however you like benjamin habitually looked amused at the moment he looked more amused than usual whether we do go to war or not though the president has effectively spiked senator hamptons guns would you not agree you know about senator hampton jackson blurted and then felt extraordinarily foolish whatever went on in the confederate states without judah p benjamins knowledge could not be worth knowing benjamins laugh made his big belly shake oh yes general i know about senator hampton a great many people know about senator hampton that you did not until last night speaks well of your devotion to duty the jew was indeed a statesman jackson thought he had never been called blind more politely in musing tones he asked could he have raised a revolution with my help with your help general anything would be possible judah benjamin answered without it he is bound to fail benjamin hesitated then went on had president longstreet reckoned your help likely to be forthcoming the distinguished senator from south carolina would have found himself unfortunately unable to call on you yesterday would he jackson murmured benjamin gave him a solemn nod he nodded back unsurprised after a moments consideration he nodded again this time in firm decision good samuel clemens woke with the bed shaking he sat bolt upright ready to run if it was an earthquake by the way alexandra smiled at him it wasnt he could barely see her smile the sun hadnt risen yet what time is it he asked around a yawn a little before five his wife answered you wanted me to get you up early thoughremember philadelphia sun time is more than three hours ahead of us here clemens grimaced and nodded which means that whatever blaine aims to do hell do it too early in the morning he got out of bed with a martyred sigh light the lamp will you my dear gas hissed alexandra struck a match yellow light filled the bedroom sam sighed again as he walked to the closet were finally back in a home of our ownin a bed of our own by godand blaine routs me out of it on a saturday morning there is no justice in the worldand no clean trousers either by the look of things there are so alexandra declared by then sam was getting into a pair of them she gave him a dirty look he affected to ignore it but from then on aimed his barbs at the administration rather than his wardrobe he shouldnt have started the war in the first place once hed botched it he should have quit when longstreet gave him the chance that would have saved san francisco and saved us the torture of living with your brother you cant blame the president for that alexandra said who says i cant i just did clemens warmed to his theme he dithered till he lost half of maine too and now that the ultimatums landed on him he still cant make up his blasted mind if he doesnt give in before half past seven or so were going to take another licking and for what for what i ask you his wife said why dont you finish dressing ill go downstairs and make some coffee for you it was not a responsive answer but sam doubted james g blaine could have given him a better one and heaven only knows what sort of coffee blaine makes he thought rummaging in a drawer for a cravat fortified with coffee bread and butter and a slab of ham left over from supper the night before he headed east along turk street toward the morning call not all the houses in the neighborhood had yet been rebuilt empty lots gave the street the aspect of a barroom brawler who led with his teeth instead of his left every few paces clemens looked back over his shoulder hills hid the pacific from his eyes whether he could see it or not though he knew it was there somewhere on it probably somewhere not far from san francisco sailed a royal navy flotilla he was sure of that the pacific squadron of the us navy or what was left of it was out there too but he had no faith in its ability to halt the british warships or even to slow them much when a fast steamer from the sandwich islands gave them the word to move since the british attack on san francisco colonel sherman had brought in many more guns to defend the coast clemens didnt think they would do much good either they were smallcaliber field pieces which had the twin advantages of being common and mobile but were hardly a match for the huge cannon the ironclads of the royal navy mounted still sherman was making an effort which put him ahead of most of the us government market street was quiet as sam turned onto it not only was saturday a half day for most people he was earlier than usual getting to the office he walked in just before a quarter to seven he wasnt the first man there either not by a long chalk reporters clustered round the telegraph clicker like relatives round the bed of a sick man who was not expected to live no news yet eh clemens asked not a word clay herndon answered before anyone else could speak the only question left is whether the wire comes from philadelphia or the potomac will blaine see sense or will he throw away washington city and maryland to go along with maine blaine will let the war go on edgar leary spoke with great assurances his whole manner had changed since his stories on corruption in the rebuilding of san francisco ran in the morning call now he seemed to reckon himself a man among men a pup no longer he had reason for that newfound confidence too thanks to those stories several prominent men were presently occupying small rooms with poor accommodations and unpleasant views he went on hes dragged his heels all the way through this mess why would he change now no one argued with him clocks in the office and outside struck seven less than half an hour to go herndon muttered big story coming one way or the other bastards somebody said softly clemens wondered whether the fellow meant the enemies of the united states or the blaine administration after a moment he realized the curse could be inclusive at nineteen minutes past seven the telegraph receiver began to click its early edgar leary noted have the rebs jumped the gun or has blaine thrown in the sponge my bets on the rebs but the telegram came out of philadelphia clay herndon who happened to be closest to the machine read the morse characters emerging word by word on the tape as readily as if they were set in fourteenpoint garamond president blaine accedes to confederate ultimatum he said and then through a burst of startled exclamations and cheers president blaines complete statement follows read it out clay sam said read it on out lets see how he puts it in the best light he can he promptly regretted that for blaine went on at greater length than hed expected but neither he nor anyone else in the offices of the morning call interrupted the reporter as he gave voice to the words flowing from the clicking receiver finding no hope for the successful employment of our arms against the enemies who ring us round and who have unjustly combined against us i am compelled at this hour to yield to the demands imposed upon the united states by the confederate states great britain and france i do this with the heaviest of hearts and only in the certain knowledge that all other courses are worse this surrender offers a fitting occasion to present ourselves in humiliation and prayer before that god who has ordained that it be so we had hoped that the year just past would close upon a scene of victory for our righteous cause but it has pleased the supreme disposer of events to order it otherwise we are not permitted to furnish an exception to the rule of divine government which has prescribed affliction as the rule of nations as well as of individuals our faith and perseverance must be tested and the chastening which seems grievous will if rightly received bring forth its appropriate fruit it is meet therefore that we should repair to the only giver of all victory and humbling ourselves before him should pray that he may strengthen our confidence in his mighty power and righteous judgment then we may surely trust in him that he will perform his promise and encompass us as with a shield in this trust and to this end i james g blaine president of the united states do hereby set apart today saturday the twentysecond day of april as a day of fasting humiliation prayer and remembrance and i do hereby invite the reverend clergy and people of the united states to repair to their respective places of worship and to humble themselves before almighty god and pray for his protection and favor to our beloved country and that we may be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us and i do further urge and direct the citizens of the united states to observe the twentysecond day of april in each succeeding year as a day of humiliation and remembrance so that the infamous defeat we have suffered on this date shall never be lost from the minds of the said citizens until such time as it may by the grace of god be avenged a hundredfold the clicker fell silent several men sighed sam realized he wasnt the only one whod been holding his breath toward the end clay herndon said well well who would have thought it even james g blaine can read the writing on the wall provided only that you make the letters big enough the writing on the wall eh sam said that must be why he blamed god for our losing or one reason for it anyhow the other two that spring to mind are that god doesnt vote and he hardly ever stands up on his hind legs and calls someone a damned liar outside church bells began to ring out noise on the street swiftly swelled shouts and cheers and snatches of song here and there gunshots rang out one of them sounded as if it came from right outside the offices somebody yelled thats the boy reuben shoot em all offwe aint gonna need em no more another shot shattered the morning presumably from reubens gun we arent the only ones with the news herndon observed that one would have gone to a whole raft of telegraph instruments everybody who has it likes it too edgar leary said samuel clemens made himself stop thinking like an american delighted the war had indeed endedregardless of the terms on which it had endedand start thinking like a newspaperman again half the people whove got the word print papers of their own he growled out of that bunch were going to be the ones who put the news on the street first or ill know the reason why that blunt announcement sent people flying away from the telegraph clicker as if it had suddenly become redhot one of the typesetters yelled well need a transcript of what blaine had to say if somebody writes it out itll be a hell of a lot faster to set than if weve got to do it from the morse clay you take care of that sam said youve already read it through once so youve got a head start on everybody else headline above it will be war endsscreamer type of course you want seventytwo point the typesetter asked no ninetysix charlie clemens answered hell if youve got it thats not a headline we get to use every day if only we could write blaine tarred feathered and ridden out of philadelphia on a rail underneath it everything would be perfect he hesitated well almost perfect wed have to drop the type size a good deal to fit that on one line boss youll give us an editorial to run alongside of blaine s statement leary said what sam frowned oh yes i suppose id better hadnt i he went back to his desk swept a snowdrift of papers out of the way so hed have room to write and set a fresh sheet down in the middle of the space hed cleared after hed inked a pen he stared at the blank paper for a man who wrote for a living getting started was always the hardest part of the job words did not want to come hed set everybody else on the morning call running like a dog with a tin can tied to its tail and the words did not want to come he glared at the paper he glared at the pen the fault was not in them he knew where the fault was he did not have a mirror at his desk so he could not glare at himself he took out a cigar scraped a match afire and lighted the malodorous stogie neither the harsh smoke he held in his mouth nor the stinking fogbank with which he surrounded himself helped concentrate his mind on the business at hand as they often did he smoked the cigar down to a dank soggy butt with quick angry puffs then lighted another nothing even vaguely resembling inspiration struck setting the second cigar in the grimy brass ashtray that held the corpse of the first he opened a desk drawer if inspiration wasnt lurking in tobacco today maybe it was hiding somewhere else he pulled the cork from the bottle with his teeth and took a long swig whiskey ran molten down his throat his eyes opened very wide he took another drink it exploded in his stomach like a teninch shell from a british ironclad he felt ready to whip his weight in wildcats he picked up the pen and poised it above the paper no words came out he was as silent and frustrated as a veteran actorsay one of the booth brothers whose careers went back before the war of secession and whose tours had crisscrossed the usa and the csa ever sinceinexplicably stricken with stage fright in front of a packed house clay herndon trotted up to him carrying a sheet full of words from edge to edge and top to bottom sam ground his teeth even though he knew the words were blaines and not herndons heres the transcription of the statement herndon said waving it about ill give it to the typesetters what are you going to say in your most of a sentence too late his eye fell on the stillblank page in front of clemens sams eye fell on it too balefully damned if i know he ground out even if its only mary had a little lamb youd better say it fast herndon said you were rightwe cant be the only paper getting a new edition to press as fast as we can set the type i know god damn it but im dry sam said i havent been this dry since the stagecoach ride through the desert from salt lake to virginia city youve got to say something herndon insisted yes but what clemens said what the devil can i say that blaine didnt already the wars done we lost any fool can see that and even a fool can see it now or blaine wouldnt have given up the thing is so obvious its impossible to write about without sounding like an idiot herndon didnt say anything sam caught him not saying anything when has that ever stopped me before eh you cant prove thats what i was thinking the reporter answered with a grin and a damned lucky thing for you i cant too sam said go on get that set ill come up with something in the next few minutes or else we just have to go on without me he didnt like that it was embarrassing but getting the news out on the street third would be a lot more embarrassing herndon dashed away to the typesetters its over almost of its own will clemens pen set down two words he stared at them they came close to serving as an editorial by themselves what else did he need to say he thought about that for a few seconds then wrote one more sentence thank heaven he nodded picked up the paper and hurried after clay herndon authors note t his is a novel about the aftermath of a confederate victory in the civil war it is not in any sense a sequel to my earlier novel about a confederate victory in the civil war the guns of the south here the confederacy is imagined to have won by natural causes so to speak rather than by intervention from timetravelers with an agenda of their own and to have done so in rather than the differences are crucial the civil war is and deserves to be perhaps the most intensely examined period of american history for better and for worse all that the united states is today even that we say the united states is not the united states are it is because of what happened in and immediately after the civil war change anything there and subsequent history changes drastically take the three cigars around which lees special order was wrapped in real history two union soldiers corporal barton mitchell and first sergeant john bloss discovered them after a confederate courier lost them learning lees battle plan and how widely lee had divided his army while invading us territory let general mcclellan win the battle of antietam that victory in turn let lincoln issue the emancipation proclamation which changed the moral character of the war it effectively made sure that britain and france which were at the time trembling on the brink of recognizing the confederate states and forcing mediation on the united states did not do so had those cigars and that order not been lost the world would be a different place today i need to make a couple of remarks about my handling of the characters in this novel all speeches and writings attributed to samuel clemens in particular are of my own devising the same does not apply to the political speeches i have put in the mouth of abraham lincoln in them i have frequently used his own words on the relationship between labour and capital and between employee and employer sometimes verbatim sometimes adapting his thought on slaves and owners to apply to workers and owners i have done this not only for dramatic effect but also to show the plausibility and what more can one demand of a novelist of the views i have ascribed to him in the changed circumstances i have envisioned here
