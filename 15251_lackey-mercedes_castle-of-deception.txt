castle of deception bards tale book mercedes lackey and josepha sherman v lots of scanning errors many fixed spellchecked chapter i roong the lute string snapped whipping across kevins hand he yelped just barely managing not to drop the lute instead he placed the instrument gently down on his cot then brought his stinging hand to his mouth blast it all that had hurt of course it had he knew better by now than to try tightening a string too far after all hed been a bardling an apprentice bard for what seemed like all his nearly sixteen years the welt finally stopped smarting kevin got to his feet with an impatient sigh he didnt really mind practicing it was something every musician had to do every day even his master he didnt even mind being stuck in his cramped little room or at least he wouldnt mind practicing and being cooped up in this stupid room in this stupid inn if only he knew this was all leading somewhere if something doesnt happen soon something exciting picking his way across the piles of clothes and music scrolls uttering the floor the bardling stared out the one window down to the blue swans cobblestone courtyard a merchant was climbing onto his fine bay horse his traveling robes rich purple in the springtime sunlight with him rode his bodyguard two men and a woman in plain leather armor straightbacked and alert as falcons hands never straying too far from the swords at their sides kevin sighed in envy they were probably nothing more heroic than common mercenaries and the journey they were taking was probably nothing more exciting than a ride to the next town but at least they were goingsomewhere they were doing something while he blast it the bardling swore under his breath he couldnt stand being stuck here a moment longer clattering down the inns wooden staircase kevin hurried across the common roomempty at this early hourand headed out into the courtyard but then he stopped short on the cobblestones what was he hoping to see the merchant and his party were already out of sight riding down the old north road that ran just outside the inns gateway and there probably werent going to be any more travelers today discouraged the bardling turned and went back through the inn to the back entrance stepping out into town ha some town bracklin was little more than a collection of a dozen small thatchedroof houses clustered behind the inn a neat pretty orderly place one where nothing different had ever happened and nothing ever would and people here actually like it thatway kevin leaned back against the inns halftimbered side the wall chilly on his back the sun warm on his face there had never been a day he could remember when he hadnt dreamed of being a bard of singing wonderful songs and traveling to wonderful places maybe even working the rare powerful bardic magic healing people with his music or even banishing demons how could those dreams have turned into something so unbearably dull morning kevin a womans cheerful voice called from across the unpaved street the bardling started uh good morning ada thats just like you bardfolk always off in a world all your own ada was a round chubby middleaged hen of a woman right now her brown hair was tucked up out of her way in an untidy bun and the sleeves other plain white blouse were pushed back above the elbows as she filled a washtub full of soapy water come for master aidans clothes have you told you they couldnt be ready till this afternoon had to spend all day yesterday washing the travel dust off the robes of his nibs adas jerk of the head took in the departed merchant and his party eh wont badmouth the fellow paid me down to the last coin with extra added her bright black eyes studied kevin whats with you lad nothing oh dont give me nothing what is it kevin sighed ada you remember when i first came here the woman smiled warmly dont i though you were such a little boy almost too small for the lute on your back clinging to your music teachers hand and all wideeyed with wonder mistress malen was very kind well of course she was imagine after all the years of having to teach merchants kids without a drop of talent to them coming across someone like you with the true gift for music no no dont start blushing like that you know its true ada plopped a shirt into her washtub and started scrubbing look you lad before she left mistress malen told me all about you how you were plucking at the strings of your familys old lute the minute you were old enough to hold it making up your own little tunes till they didnt have a choice but to hire her kevin had to smile mistress malen had been a wonderful first teacher endlessly patient with her eager pupil she had also been honest enough to admit his talent was more than she could shape a little shiver of wonder raced through the bardling as he remembered how shed shaken her head and told him you have the makings of a bard boy a true bard adas chuckle dragged him back to the present so there you were poor chick standing in the courtyard of the blue swan fall of wonder yes but maybe just a touch scared too and no surprise being apprenticed to master aidan like that a bardan a hero as well kevin glanced up at his masters room you remember how it was dont you when my master helped king amber keep his throne i mean bless you child how old do you think i am that was a good thirty years ago i was a chick myself back then much younger than you she paused thoughtfully but i do remember all the celebrating my yes everyone couldnt stop chattering about how it had been a bard your bard whod used his magical songs o stop that witch of a wouldbe usurper princess carlotta oh she might have been a princess the nasty little creature but she was a sorceress all right darkhearted as they come she turned our good king into stonestone can you imagine that and if it hadnt been for master aidan stone king amber would have remained bah good riddance to her i sayand all praise to master aidan for stopping her kevin sighed that must have been a wonderful time wonderful those were the most dangerous days nobody ever wanted and dont blame your master for coming here after it was all over if anyone ever earned some peace and quiet it was he that wasnt what kevin wanted to hear at first every day with his master had seemed wild with excitement after all with a hero bard to teach him why shouldnt he too do great deeds someday but it hadnt taken long to learn that his master had somewhere over the years forgotten all about heroism ada youve lived here in bracklin all your life havent you you know it never left this town never saw any need to but dont you ever want to meet new people i do enough travelers come into the inn for that thats not what i mean dont you ever get bored want to see new places do new things ada looked at him as though hed gone mad why should i want something as foolish as that i have a nice house good steady work love you lad i think the springs gotten into you she shooed him away with soapy hands now get along with you kevin i have work to do the bardling wandered on down bracklins one street to the end it didnt take long he stood looking out over the fields beyond the edge of town each neatly plowed strip of land exactly like the next and shuddered making his way back towards the blue swan kevin politely returned the greetings of baker and seamstress and butcher all of them he realized were quite peacefully going about their various tasks just as they did every day and not a one of them seemed to mind suddenly frustrated to the point of screaming kevin hurried back into the inn and his room at least he could learn a new song there wasnt a sound out of his masters room of course not the old bard probably had his nose buried in old manuscripts just as he had whenever he wasnt playing himself or giving the bardling a music lesson just as he had for almost all the time kevin had studied with him i know hes hunting for something important but he wont tell me what it is and while he hunts through all those dusty books im stuck here in bracklin with him fm not a child anymore i cant be content like this the bardling snatched up his lute and struck a few savage chords but he couldnt play anything with that broken string blast it all to darkness kevin rummaged through the mess on floor and table till he found a replacement string this was ridiculous all master aidan had to do was say the word and king amber would gladly name him the royal bard they could be living in the royal palace right now and wouldnt that be grand kevin pictured his master in elegant bardic robes people bowing respectfully as he passed he would be a major power in court and his brave young apprentice would be a figure of importance too right kevin muttered and pigs could fly his master had tremendous musical talent no doubt about that every time the old bard took his own wellworn mandolin and showed the boy how a song should be played a little shiver of wonder ran through kevin and with it a prayer ah please please let me someday play like that with such grace suchsuch glory of late he had begun to hope that his prayers if not answered had at least begun to be heard but even ada insisted master aidan was also an adept at bardic magic i dont understand it if i had such a gift id be using it not not hiding it away in the middle of nowhere oh yes if kevin thought darkly it wasnt as though every bard had the innate gift for bardic magic after all master aidan seemed to believe he possessed it had assured kevin over and over that in some bardlings the gift blossomed fairly late but surely if he was going to show any sign of magic it would have surfaced by now after all he was nearly a man yet so far he hadnt felt the slightest angle of power no matter how hard hed tried to him the potentially magical songs his master had taught him remained just that songs the bardling gave the lute an impatient strum then winced sour lute strings went out of pitch all too easily as he retimed them kevin admitted to himself that yes he did take a great deal of joy in creating music and in creating it well but aside from that music what did he have of course it was true that a musician seldom had time for much else if he was to succeed at all a musician must give himself totally to his craft kevin could accept that but did the rest of life have to be sodrab what did he do from day to day really but run his masters errands like a little boy keep all those old manuscripts dusted see the same dull town and the same dull people i might as well be apprenticed tooa baker kevin a weary voice called from across the hall and the bardling straightened listening come here please yes master now what maybe he was supposed to order their supper from the innkeeper or go find out from ada exactly when their wash would be done but when the bardling saw the old bards pale face his impatience slipped away replaced by a pang of worry he had never known the master as anything but a whitebearded old man but surely hed never seen him look quite this tired quite this fragile its because he never goes out kevin tried to persuade himself never even gets any sunlight cooped up in here with his books master isis something wrong no kevin not exactly but a hint of fire flickered in the mans weary blue eyes and kevin tensed all at once so wild with hope he nearly cheered youve found what you were looking for alas no then what is it are we going somewhere oh please oh please say yes we no boy you kevin felt his heart thunder in his chest yes at last something new was going to happen you wwont regret this he stammered just tell me what the quest is and i the old bard chuckled faintly im afraid it isnt a quest my fine young hero more of an errand a longer one than usual and further away than most but an errand never the less oh kevin struggled to keep the disappointment from his face i should have known better just another stupid errand what i want you to do the bard continued is go to the castle of count volmar and deliver a message from the king at least that would be something halfway dramatic and copy a manuscript for me his master corrected looking down his long nose at the bardling youre to copy itcopy it exactly understandand bring the copy back to me kevin barely silenced a groan is it very long i believe so and it was probably unbearably dull too but master kevin asked desperately why dont you just ask them to send the manuscript to you no its too valuable to be moved naturally if you want it copied exactly the bardling said as casually as he could why not hire a trained scribe no for a startling moment the bards face was so fierce kevin could almost believe the heroic talesbut then the fierceness faded leaving only a weary old man behind i have given you your orders the manuscript you are to copy is known as the study of ancient song it is approximately three hands high and one and a half hands wide and is bound in plain dark brown leather that i imagine must be fairly well worn by now the title may or may not be embossed on the spine but it should be printed clearly enough on the cover he pausedin brief the manuscript cannot be moved from the counts library and only you are to copy it each days work must be hidden it must not be shown to anyone is that understood kevin frowned had the old bards mind turned or more likely was he simply trying to enliven a dull job for his apprentice with a touch of the dramatic the bardling bowed in resignation yes master he muttered good now heres a letter of introduction to the count from me he should recognize my seal be sure you keep it safe in your belt pouch nobles are suspicious sorts and unless they know youre really from me youll never get past the castle gates kevin obediently stuffed the parchment into his pouch ah well hed try to make the most of this at least it meant getting out of this dull old inn for a few days yes and he would be staying in a castle hey now maybe even rubbing elbows with the nobility the bardling fought down a sudden grin imagining himself at court impressing somebody important maybe even the count himself with his talent who knew if he was really lucky he might get a chance to really prove himself he might even end up being named a true bard oh right if he didnt wind up spending all his time stuck in the counts library kevin kevin listen to me boy his master fussed you must hurry i have a way to get you to the count safelyfriends are coming throughbut time is short cant have a lad your age traveling all by himself the bardling straightened insulted your pardon master but im not a baby ill be all right dont worry its not you im worried about boy its what you might meet along the way youre a bardling not a trained warrior i can handle a sword but you wont the bard ordered bluntly a musician doesnt dare risk injuring his hands well yes of course but i repeat you are not a trained warrior if someone attacked you you wouldnt stand a chance of defending yourself im nearly sixteen kevin began body i can take care of myself but the bard was no longer listening to him head cocked the old man murmured well now do you hear that singing the bardling said in surprise who in that quiet town would suddenly be frivolous enough to burst into song and raucous song at that i wonder the bard murmured to himself can it be so soon he moved slowly to the window kevin followed looking over the mans shoulder at a laughing group of folks on horseback clattering into the courtyard surrounding two gaudy red and blue wagons the riders cloaks and tunics fluttered in the wind their many colors so bright he could have sworn they were cut from scraps of rainbows the man who seemed to be the leader driving the first wagon wore a robe that edit tiered like the sun itself its just a troop of minstrels kevin began but his master was already calling out the window berak the leader glanced up his sharpfeatured greeneyed face suddenly alert so it was your summons old man he yelled back youre still alive and kicking i see kevin gasped but his master only laughed and youre still the same disrespectful soul as ever come up here if you would berak brought his whole troop with him twenty men and women and their offspring all with sharp suntanned faces and bright wild eyes chattering and laughing they filled the small room almost to overflow their gaudy clothing making it look even shabbier than it was berak held up a hand for silence what would you old bard he asked making the man a fantastic bow the bard didnt seem at all disturbed by the curious stares a favor berak if you would my apprentice here young kevin needs to travel to count volmars castle a far way for such a child a woman murmured and kevin gave her an indignant glare exactly his master said i doubt you restless butterflies will be staying here longer than one night not in this dull town then since your route seems to be taking you along the north road anyhow if you might happen to see your way to the counts castle and take kevin with you when you go for a moment the bards eyes met beraks fierce green gaze almost kevin thought in sudden confusion as though theyre exchanging secret information but in the next moment berak laughed and bowed another of his intricate bows and kevin told himself not to be ridiculous the man was nothing more than a common minstrel of course old man berak said kevin bardling we leave at sunrise tomorrow whether i like it or not the boy thought drily that night the troop of minstrels sang for their supper standing to one side of the open fireplace the gaudy colors of their clothing turned muted and glowing by the flickering firelight kevin listened to their music for a long time trying to figure out exactly what they were doing no two singers seemed to be following the same tune and the two harpers three fiddlers and one flutist all seemed to be playing their own melodies as well and yet somehow all that wild sound managed to blend into one whole intricate song he couldnt say whether or not it was a beautiful song he couldnt even say whether or not he liked it but the bardling had to admit it certainly was interesting he innkeeper and his wife didnt seem to know what to make of the music either nor did their guests when the troop had finished there was a fair amount of applause and everyone agreed they had earned their dinners but kevin suspected from their uncertain glances that the rest of the audience was as confused as he how did you like it the old bard had appeared so suddenly at kevins shoulder that the bardling had to bite back a yell im not sure i mean it was music all right not just sound but well it was wild like something the forest would sing if trees could onlyi meanim sounding stupid arent i his master chuckled no not at all you sound like a youngster whos suddenly realized that the worlds a good deal wider with a good deal more strangeness in it than he ever suspected he patted kevins shoulder come along bardling the nights growing late and you must be up early in the morning kevin stood in the courtyard of the inn dad in good serviceable tunic breeches and boots the whole thing covered by a woolen cloak its warmth welcome in the chilly morning air his lute was in its waterproof traveling case slung across his back because no bard not even a bardling ever traveled without his instrument all around the bardling the minstrels were chattering and scuttling about somehow never getting in each others way reloading their wagons scooping up giggling children tightening a saddle girth here readjusting a pack there but kevin didnt really notice all the bustle he was too busy staring at the animal placidly looking back at him his heart sank a mule the master hadnt even trusted him with a horse an adventurer needed a stallion a destrier a war horsenot a stupid old longeared mule eh bardling berak called from his wagon seat mount up boy we have a long way to travel my name is kevin not bardling kevin muttered but berak didnt seem to hear him thats a wise old mule bardling hell carry you safe and sound to count volmars castle if he doesnt decide to dump you in the mud instead the minstrels all burst into laughter his cheeks flaming kevin made sure the saddle pack with his spare clothes was secure then climbed into the saddle as he did the lute whacked him painfully across the back the mule wiggled a long ear back at him as though it coo was laughing at him if you bray at me ill whack you kevin warned it but the mule only shook its head ears flapping as the minstrels rode out of the inns courtyard hoofs clopping and wagon wheels rattling against cobblestones kevin glanced up at his masters window but if the old bard was watching the bardling couldnt see him feeling abandoned and very sorry for himself kevin kicked the mules sides to get it moving the mule rolled a reproachful eye back at him but started grudgingly forward heyho off to adventure berak laughed and burst into song some adventure kevin thought bitterly chapter ii as the minstrel troop rode and rattled along the wide dirt road the day was as bright and cheery as something out of a story full of bird song and pleasant little breezes kevin hardly noticed he was too busy struggling with his mule to keep it from lagging lazily behind here boy one of the musicians a reddad fiddler with instrument case strapped to his back like kevin handed the bardling a switch broken from a bush wave this at him hell keep moving the fiddlers eyes were kind enough but it seemed to kevin that his voice practically dripped with condescension thanks ive never ridden before kevin thought but he managed a tight smile and a thanks it didnt help that the man was right as long as the mule could see the switch out of the comer of an eye it kept up a nice brisk pace the north road cut through brushland for a time then through stands of saplings then at last through true forest green and lush in the springtime this was royal land not ceded to any of the nobles and the road was kept clear kevin knew by the spells of royal magicians but those nice neat spells hardly applied to the wildness on either side the bardling trying to pretend hed traveled this way a hundred times couldnt help wondering if bandits or even dark creatures ores or worse were hiding in there oh nonsense he was letting his masters fussing get to him it was forest only forest no one could see anything sinister in that tranquil greenery hed let the switch drop and the mule was lagging again kevin waved it at the beast yet againwhen that didnt seem to do any good he gave it a good whack on the rump the mule grunted in surprise and broke into a bonejarring trot overtaking the wagons and most of the riders the equally surprised bardling jounced painfully in the saddle lute banging against his back for a moment kevin wished hed kept it in its case rather than out for quick playing struggling to keep his stirrups and his balance he was sure he heard snickers from the troop then just as suddenly the mule dropped back into its easygoing walk kevin nearly slammed his face into the animals neck this time as he straightened himself in the saddle he knew hed heard muffled laughter without a word he pulled the mule back into the troop although the minstrels kept up a steady patter of cheerful conversation and song all around him kevin damped his lips resolutely together after that he had given them enough entertainment already it wasnt helping his increasingly sour mood that every time someone looked his way he could practically hear that someone thinking poor little boy out on his own im not a baby he muttered under his breath whats that a plump motherly woman bright yellow robes making her look like a buttercup brought her mare up next to his mule is something wrong child i am not a child kevin said the words very carefully i am not a full bard yet i admit it but i am the apprentice to oh well bardling then her smile was so amused that kevin wanted to shout at her leave me alone instead he asked as levelly as he could just how far away is count volmars castle oh two days ride or so weather permitting not more and were going to stay on this road well of course we can hardly go crosscountry through the woods with the wagon besides that would be a silly thing to do the north road leads right to the castle very convenient very kevin agreed mind busy he hadnt dared hope that the castle would be so easy to find even far someone whod never been there before even for someone who just might happen to be traveling alone that night the minstrels made camp in a circle of song and firelight that forced back the forests shadow dinner had been cheese and only slightly stale bread from the inn water from a nearby stream and rabbits the older children had brought down with their slings now kevin sitting on a dead log to one side nearly in darkness watched the happy noisy circle with a touch of envy what must it be like to be part of a group like that they were probably all related one big wild merry family but then the bardling reminded himself that these were only minstrels wandering folk whose musical talents just werent good enough to let them ever be bards he should be pitying them not envying them maybe they even envied him no two of the women were gossiping about him he was sure of it glancing his way every now and then hiding giggles behind their hands kevin straightened trying to turn his face into a regal mask unfortunately the log on which he sat picked that moment to fall apart dumping him on the ground in a cloud of moiety dust predictably every one of the troop was looking his way just then predictably they all burst into laughter kevin scrambled to his feet face burning hed had it with being babied and laughed at and made to feel a fool hey bardling berak called where are you going to sleep kevin said shortly out there in the dark youll be warmerand saferhere with us kevin pretended he hadnt heard wrapping himself in his cloak he settled down as best he could the ground was harder and far colder than hed expected he really would have been more comfortable with the minstrels but then he didnt really intend to sleep not really it was just that he was weary from the days riding kevin woke with a start almost too cold and stiff to move whatwhereah around him was forest still dark with night but overhead he could see patches of pale bluegray sky through the canopy of leaves and realized it wasnt too far from morning he struggled to his feet jogging in place to warm himself up wincing as his body complained then picked up his lute safe and dry in its case it hadnt suffered any harm stop stalling he told himself any moment now one of the minstrels was bound to wake up and then it would be too late kevin ducked behind a tree to answer his chilly bodys demands then tiptoed over to where the horses and his mule were tied one horse whuffled at him but to his relief none of them whinnied although his hands were still stiff with cold the bardling managed to get his mule bridled and saddled he hesitated an uncertain moment looking back at the sleeping camp wondering if he really was doing the right thing of course i am i dont want the count to think im a baby who cant take care of himself kevin led the mule as silently as he could down the road till the camp was out of sight then swung up into the saddle come on mule he whispered we have a lot of ground to cover the minstrels would be discovering his absence any moment now but encumbered with their wagons and children as they were they would never be able to overtake him kevin kicked the mule frisky from the still chilly air it actually broke into a prance the bardling straightened proudly in the saddle at last he finally felt like a hero riding off into adventure by nightfall kevin wasnt so sure of that he was tired and sore from being in the saddle all day and hungry as well if only he had thought to take some food with him the mule wasnt too happy with its snatches of grass and leaves but at least it could manage but the few mouthfuls of whatever berries kevin had been able to recognize hadnt done much to fill his stomach overhead the sky was still clear blue but the forest on either side was already nearly black and a chill was starting up from the cooling earth kevin shivered listening to the twitter of birds settling down for the night and the faint mysterious rustlings and stirrings that could have been made by small animals or other things he shivered again and told himself not to be stupid he was probably already on count volmars lands and there wasnt going to be anything dangerous this close to a castle he hoped were not going to be able to go much further today he told the mule reluctantly wed better find a place to camp for the night at least he had flint and steel in his pouch after stumbling about in the dim light for a time kevin managed to find enough dead branches to build himself a decent little fire in the middle of a small rocky clearing the firelight danced off the surrounding trees as the bardling sat huddling before the flames feeling the welcome warmth steal through him the fire took off the edge of his chill but it couldnt help the fact that he was still tired and so hungry his stomach ached the bardling tried to ignore his discomfort by taking out his lute and working his way through a series of practice scales as soon as he stopped the night flowed in around him iris small fire not enough to hold back the darkness the little forest chirpings and rustlings not enough to break the heavy silence kevin struck out bravely into the bouncy strains of the millers boy but the melody that had sounded so bright and sprightly with the inn around it seemed chin and lonely here kevins fingers faltered then stopped he sat listening to the night for a moment feeling the weight of the forests indifference pressing down on him he roused himself with an effort and put his lute back in its case safe from the nights gathering mistthose nice dull safe days back at the inn didnt seem quite so unattractive right now oh nonsense what sort of hero are you afraid of a little loneliness hed never kevin realized been alone before really alone in his life battling with homesickness the bardling banked the fire and curled up once more in his cloak after what seemed an age weariness overcame misery and he slipped into uneasy sleep scornful laughter woke him kevin sat bolt upright staring up into eyes that glowed an eerie green in the darkness demons no no whatever these beings were they werent demonic after that first terrified moment he could make out the faces that belonged with those eyes and gasped in wonder the folk surrounding him were tall and graceful a touch too graceful too slender to be human pale golden hair framed fair fineboned coldly beautiful faces set with those glowing slanted eyes and kevin whispered in wonder elves he had heard about them of course everyone had they were even supposed to share some of king ambers lands with humansthough every now and then bitter feelings surfaced between the two races but kevin had never seen any of the elffolk white or dark good or evil never even dreamed he might why how clever the child is the elvish voice was dear as crystal cold with mockery clever in one way at least said another so stupid in all other ways a third mocked look at the way he sleeps on the ground like a poor little animal look at the trail he left so that anyone anything could track him look at the way he sleeps like a babe without a care in the world a human child a careless child the elf man whod first spoken laughed softy a foolish child that anyone can trick so alien a light glinted in the slanted eyes that kevins breath caught in his throat everyone knew elvish whims were unpredictable it was one of the reasons there could never be total ease between elf and human if these folk decided to loose their magic on him he wouldnt have a chance of defending himself my lords he began very very carefully if i have somehow offended you pray forgive me offended the elf echoed coldly as if anything a child such as you could do would be strong enough to offend us that stung my lord ii know i may not look like much to someone like you to his intense mortification his empty stomach chose that moment to complain with a loud gurgle kevin bit his tip sure that those keen pointed elf ears had picked up the sound ah he could do was continue as best he could butbut that doesnt give you the right to insult me h how brave it is the elf man rested one foot lightly on a rock and leaned forward fierce green gaze flicking over kevin head to foot bah look at yourself sleeping on bare ground when there are soft pine boughs to make you a bed aching with hunger when the forest holds more than enough to feed one scrawny human leaving a trail anyone could follow and carrying no useful weapon at all how could we not insult such ignorance the elf straightened murmuring a short phrase in the elvish tongue to the others they laughed and faded soundlessly into the night but not before one of them had tossed a small sack at kevins feet our gift human the elf man said inside is food enough to keep you alive and no it is not bespelled we would not waste magic on you with that the elf turned to leave then paused looking back over his shoulder at the bardling with inhuman bluntness he said i hope child for your sake that you are simply naive and not stupid in time either flaw will get you killed but at least the first can be corrected the alien eyes blazed into kevins own for a moment longer then the elf was gone and the bardling was left alone in the night more frightened than he would ever have admitted hes wrong kevin told himself defiantly once his heart had stopped pounding just because im a bardling not a q woodsman whos never known anything but the forest doesnt make me naive or stupid deciding that didnt stop him from rummaging in the little sack the elvish idea of food that would keep him alive seemed to be nothing more exciting than flat wafers of bread but when he managed to choke one of the dry things down it calmed his complaining stomach so nicely that the bardling sighed with relief and actually slipped back into sleep kevin stood with head craned back sunlight warm on his face feeling the last of last nights fears melting away how could he possibly hold onto fear when it was bright dear morning and all around him the air was filled with bird song maybe the whole thing had been only a dream no the sack of wafers was quite real kevin gnawed thoughtfully on one then gave another to his mule which lipped it up with apparent delight he saddled and bridled the animal then climbed aboard still trying to figure out what the purpose of that midnight meeting had been a last he shook his head in dismissal all the stories said the elf folk being the nonhuman race they were had truly bizarre senses of humor sometimes outright cruel by human standards what had happened last night must surely have been just another nasty elvis idea of a joke come on mule lets get going at least he wasnt hungry the road sloped up first gently then more steeply much to the mules distaste when it grew too steep kevin dismounted now and again to give the animal a rest climbing beside it but at last after a quiet day of riding and walking they reached the crest kevin stared out in awe at a wild mountain range of tall gray crags some of them high enough to be snowcapped even in spring they towered over rolling green fields neatly sectioned into farms on the nearest crag surrounded by open space stood count volmars castle kevin cried triumphantly it has to be the castle hadnt been built for beauty heavy and squat it seemed to crouch possessively on its crag like some ancient grey beast of war staring down at the counts lands but kevin didnt care it was the first castle he had ever seen and he thought it was wonderful a true war castle dating from the days when heroes held back the forces of darkness bright banners flew from the many towers softening some of the harshness and the bardling could see from here that the castles gates were open by squinting he could make out the devices on those banners the counts black boar on an azure field weve done it he told the mule that is definitely the castle of count volmar he forgot about elves and hunger loneliness and mocking minstrels excitement shivering through him the bardling kicked his mule forward soon soon the real adventure was going to begin chapter iii the closer kevin got to count volmars castle the more impressive it seemed looming up over him till he had to crane his head back to see the tops of the towers the north road ran right past the base of the crag but the counts own road led its winding way up and up to the castle gates just when the bardling had almost reached the top riding all the way this time in case someone in the castle was watching him the mule stopped short long ears shooting up in the next moment two knights in gleaming mail faces hidden by their helms came plunging skillfully down the steep road on their powerful destriers trailed by two younger more cautious riderssquires kevin guessedon smaller horses get out of the way boy they shouted kevin hastily kneed his mule aside with a shout of peasant fool the riders were past him showering him with dirt and pebbles and gone peasant fool is it kevin muttered brushing himself off at least i know better than to force a horse down a steep hill at full speed the bardling glanced down at himself he had saved his best tunic and breeches for now the neat red tunic and brown breeches and cloak might not be of the most noble quality but they were he thought quite suitable definitely not what a peasant would wear not even a rich one who owned his farm the doth might in such a case be finer but there was such a thing as style and taste feeling better about the whole thing kevin prodded his mule up the last few feet to the open gates huge heavy brasssheathed things which were slowly shut in his face hey he yelled indignantly servants use the postern gate an officious voice called down from one of the narrow tower windows but im not use the postern gate the voice repeated kevin sighed he was hardly about to shout out his business here for everyone to hear this is just someones mistake he told himself theyll correct it once im inside he rode around the massive base of the castle to the humble little servants entrance which was sealed by a heavy brassbound oaken door standing in the stirrups kevin gave it a solid rap with his fist then when that got no results managed a more satisfying thump with a foot hey anybody in there a tiny window creaked open high in the door state your business a voice demanded this one kevin thought sounded more bored than officious my business he said firmly is with count volmar i have a message here from my master the bardling drew out the sealed parchment the old bard had given him and held it up so whoever was behind the door could see it there was a long moment of silence then kevin heard the sound of a heavy bolt being drawn the door creaked open enter at last the bardling muttered and kicked his mule through the doorway as hed expected he was faced by a long stone tunnel the outer walls of a war castle could hardly be anything but thick fu never get the nude in there but the animal after a brief hesitation about entering this narrow shadowy cave sniffed the air and moved eagerly forward so eagerly kevin suspected it must have smelled oats as they came out from the tunnel the bardling found himself in what looked almost like a small town tucked into the outer ward the space between the ring of the outer walls and the inner walls of the counts keep to one side was the castle stables and the mule did its best to get kevin to let it head off that way but the bardling kept a tight hold on the reins trying to see everything without making it look like he was gawking so many people hed never seen so many crowded into so small a space not even on market day here was the blacksmiths forge the smith hard at work shoeing a restless gray destrier calmly avoiding the war horses attempts to bite there the carpenters workshop echoed with hammering and next to that the armorer sat in the sunlight before his shop mending the links in a mail shirt a tangled crowd of castle folk chattered away as they did their tasks while their children ran squealing and laughing all around the ward maybe the whole place did smell a hit too strongly of horse and dung and humanity but it was still such a lively place that it took kevins breath away he drank it all in only to come back to himself with a shock when someone asked shortly name and business kevin glanced down to see a guard watching him warily mail glinted under a surcoat embroidered with the counts crest and the weatherworn face held not a trace of warmth uh yes mymy name is kevin im a bardling and my master has sent me here with a message for count volmar he showed the guard the sealed parchment to his dismay the man snatched it from his hand hey leave your mule with the stable hands your bags will be brought to youam a small boy a page clad in the counts blue livery came running sir take this bardling to the squires quarters but my message kevin protested it will be given to count volmar the guards contemptuous stare said without words did you really think a mere bardling would be allowed to bother a count go get your mule stabled with that the man turned and disappeared into the keep kevin hesitated toying with the idea of hurrying after the guard and insisting he be admitted to the oowxt at once oh no not only would something like that destroy what little was left of his dignity it would probably get him thrown out of the castle kevins shoulders sagged so much for being able to rub elbows with nobility im supposed to wait here thats what i was told little am answered in the squires quarters but here the bardling repeated theres nobody am wait the boy had already scurried away kevin feeling helpless stood looking uneasily about the squires quarters was nothing more than this long dark chilly hall broken up by a row of cots and clothes chests the high roof was supported by thick columns and the only light came from narrow windows set high in the walls the silence was heavier than anything back in the forest the bardling sat down on he edge of one of the cots to wait and wait and wait kevin had just about decided hed been abandoned and was wondering what would happen if he went hunting for count volmar himself when he heard a sudden rush of cheerful voices and sprang to his feet a crowd of boys in their late teens came ambling into the hall all of them in blue livery these must surely be the missing squires kevin watched them in sudden uneasiness painfully aware that his secluded musicians life hadnt given him many chances to spend time with anyone his own age a stocky blond boy stopped short staring at kevin with bright blue eyes holla whos this my name is kevin the bardling began and i youve got a lute you a minstrel no you seem kinda young to be a bard the boys voice was brusque but a hint of respect shone in his eyes for a moment kevin toyed with the idea of claiming that yes he was a bard but he could picture his masters disapproval only too well a bard after all was always supposed to be truthful with a sigh kevin admitted im not not yet im apprenticed to a bard but a bardling someone said in a scornful voice hes nobody the squires turned away blatantly ignoring him they set about changing their clothes or cleaning their boots chattering and joking as though he wasnt even there did you see me in the tilting yard sure did saw you fall off too the saddle slipped sure it did like this he pounced on the other boy and they wrestled laughing watching them totally excluded kevin ached with a loneliness more painful even than what hed felt in the forest as the horseplay broke off he heard the squires argue over which of them was most skilled with sword or lance or who would be the first to be knighted a great surge of resentment swelled up within him listen to them boast i bet there isnt one of them who knows anything but weaponry and fighting the emptyheaded idiots but as the squires began to boast instead about the exploits of the knights they served of sir alamar whod taken on an entire bandit band and bested them or sir theomard who might be aging but who had still managed to slay three enemy knights in battle one right after the other kevins heart sank these boys who were his own age had already done more than hed even imagined as squires to their knights they had almost certainly shared in those mighty deeds they would probably soon be heroes themselves kevin bit his lip as resentment turned to envy no wonder the squires scorned him here he was a bardling a mere music apprentice someone who hadnt done anything he must seem like a weakling to them a coward no better than a peasant a small hand shook his sleeve and he started bardling it was little arn follow me if you would master dkrikas count volmars seneschal wishes to speak with you dkrikas what an odd name who cares how odd it is at least i havent been forgotten the bardling followed am through a maze of corridors across the rushstrewn stretch of the great hall and up a winding stairway stopping before a closed door here we are am said and scurried away once more kevin took a deep breath and knocked on the door enter a scratchy voice commanded within was a cozy room hung with thick hangings of deep red velvet and furnished with a scrollfilled bookcase and a massive desk behind which sat a truly bizarre figure although it sat upright and had the right number of arms and head it most definitely was not human kevin stared at the shiny chitinous green skin set off by a glittering golden gorget and the large segmented eyes and gasped out youre an arachnia the boy is a marvel of cleverness the insectoid being chittered if he has satisfied his curiosity oh uh of courseim sorry ii didnt mean to stare why not you have plainly never seen one of my kind before why should you not stare i kevin blinked the arachnia had snatched what looked like a handful of sugar cubes from a small bowl on the desk and popped them into its beaked mouth the crunching sound reminded him uncomfortably of praying mantises devouring beetles in fact now that he thought of it the being did look a good deal like a giant mantis now you wonder anew the dry chitter might have been a laugh have you never heard that my kind are always hungry for logic as well as food boy time is a precious thing and we have already wasted enough of it i am as i am sure you have already realized dkrikas seneschal majordomo if you wish to count volmar my lord belatedly kevin bowed but dkrikas writing busily in a huge open ledger hardly seemed to notice here are the arrangements that have been made for you yes yes i know why you are here you are to be housed and fed with the squires and you will be permitted to copy the manuscript in the library between dawn and dusk you are not to intrude upon the counts private quarters you are not to bother any of the knights you are not to interfere with any of the castle personnel you are not to handle any weapons you arc not to enter the tilting grounds you are not to interfere with any of the servants you are not to steal food from the kitchen as the list of prohibitions went on and on kevin thought wryly he could almost wish he was back with his masterat least thered been fewer rules i cant stand this place he decided suddenly the sooner i finish the stupid job the better master dkrikas kevin asked as soon as the being fell silent is there any reason i cant continue my copying after dark i mean he added cajolingly it would save precious time no no no the seneschal snapped have you no idea of how expensive candles are have you no burning candles so a human can do some copy work would be a waste of good wax dkrikas stood gray cloak swirling tall thin body towering over kevin and no one your age boy can be trusted with open flame around so many fragile manuscripts the seneschal folded himself back behind the desk once more writing in the huge ledger dkrikas said curtly that is all you may leave kevin hardly wanted to return to the squires quarters but where else was there by now it was too late to start copying the manuscript and after dkrikas neverending list of prohibitions he hardly dared go exploring since am didnt seem to be anywhere around kevin retraced his steps as best he could and didnt get lost more than once or twice dinner he suspected wasnt going to be any brighter than anything else that had happened this day it wasnt dinner was a miserable affair served on rough trestle tables set up in the squires quarters even though the bardling had been assigned a seat among the squires hed might as well have been in the middle of a desert because no one would talk to him kevin busied himself in trying to chew the stringy beef and in trying to convince himself the squires coldness didnt matter as soon as hed finished copying that cursed manuscript he would never have to see any of these idiots again once they had finished eatingand the food scraps and trestle tables had been cleared away the squires disappeared still without a word to kevin he gathered from the bits of their conversations he overheard that they were going off to wait on their knights who are probably just as brainless left alone in the now empty hall the bardling shivered grabbing for his cloak the place seemed even more silent than before and twice as chilly evidently count volmar didnt believe in pampering youngsters because there wasnt a fireplace anywhere in the hall never mind kevin told himself a true hero doesnt mind a little discomfort or a little loneliness the silence was getting on his nerves the bardling took out his lute and practiced for a long long while trying to ignore everything but his music at last warmed a little by his own exertions kevin put the instrument back in its case and stretched out on the lumpy cot hed been assigned the hour he thought was probably still fairly earlynot that there was any way to tell in here without so much as a water dock or hourglass but there wasnt anything else to do but sleep the pillow was so thin it felt as though the feathers had been taken from a very scrawny bird he one blanket was too thin for real comfort but by adding his cloak to it the bardling was almost warm he had nearly drifted off to sleep when the squires returned kevin heard their whispers and muffled laughter and felt his face redden in the darkness they were laughing at him he knew they were laughing at him miserable all over again kevin turned over and buried his face in the pillow interlude the first count volmar tall lean and graying of brown hair and beard sat seemingly at ease in his private solar before a blazing fireplace a winefilled goblet of precious glass in his hand he looked across the small room at the woman who sat there and raised the goblet in appreciation she nodded at the courtesy her dark green eyes flickering with cold amusement in the firelight carlotta princess halfsister to king amber himself could not volmar knew be much younger than his own midforties and yet she could easily have passed for a far younger woman not the slightest trace of age marred the pale flawless skin or the glorious masses of deep red hair turned to bright flame by the firelight sorcery he thought and then snickered at his own vapid musings so that he nearly choked on his own wine of course it was sorcery carlotta was an accomplished sorceress and about as safe for all her beauty as a snake about as honorable too not that he was one to worry overmuch about honor the boy is safely ensconced i take it carlottas smile was as chill as her lovely eyes yes he has a place among the squires who i might add have been given to understand that hes so far beneath them they neednt bother even to acknowledge his presencethat to do so in fact would demean their own status by now the boy is surely thoroughly disillusioned about nobility and questioning his own worth he suspects nothing then good we dont want him showing any awkward sparks of initiative carlotta sipped delicately from her goblet we dont want him copying his master volmars mouth tightened oh yes the bard that cursed bard he could remember so clearly even though it was over thirty years ago how it had been himself just barely an adult and carlotta only how old only thirteen maybe so but she had already been as ambitious as hemore so already mistress of the dark arts despite her youth the princess had attempted to seize the throne from her halfbrother and almost made it volmar thought then corrected that to we almost made it amber had been only a prince back then on the verge of the succession his father had been old and there hadnt been any other legal heir carlotta as the court had been so eager to gossip was only ambers halfsister her mother quite unknown but there were always ways around such awkward little facts once amber had been declared deador so it had been believedin heroic battle when actually volmar thought wryly carlottas magics had turned him to stone the poor old king would surely have pined away volmar grinned sharply why the shock alone would have finished him carlotta wouldnt have needed to waste a spell the people even if they had by some bizarre chance come to suspect her of wrongdoing would have had no choice but to accept carlotta with her halfshare of the blood royal as queen ambitious little girl volmar thought with approval what a pity she didnt succeed sorceress or no she would have been too wise to try riding alone she would have taken a consort and who better than one of her loyal supporters even one whose role in the attempted usurpation had never become public volmar suddenly realized he was grimacing and forced himself to relax his late father had been an avid supporter of the old king and if he had ever found out his own son was a traitor but he hadnt and of course if only carlotta had safely become queen it wouldnt have mattered the only traitors then would have been those who failed to acknowledge her if only bah carlotta would have become queen if it hadnt been for the boys master chat accursed bard and his allies forget the past volmar the count started thrown abruptly back into the present you have learned to read minds if the sorceress suspected he planned to use her to place a crown on his own head he was dead worse than dead you must learn to guard your expressions my lord your thoughts were there for anyone with half an eye to read not all my thoughts the count thought giddy with relief carlotta got restlessly to her feet dark green gown swinging about her elegant form volmar since she was after all a princess and he only a count stood as well politic courtesy she never noticed enough of the past the sorceress repeated staring into the flames we must think of what can be done now volmar moved warily to stand beside her and caught a flicker of alien movement in the flames faces ah carlotta was absently creating images of the boy the bardling why do you suppose he sent the boy here the princess murmuredand why just now what purpose could the old man possibly have youve convinced me the manuscript is merely a treatise on lute music she glanced sharply at volmar it is isnt it of course volmar said easily hiding the fact that he wasnt really sure which of the many manuscripts stored in the library it might be his father had been the scholar not he my father collected such things yes yes but why send the boy now why is it suddenly so urgent that the thing be copied ah it could be merely coincidence no it couldnt the flames roared up as carlotta whirled eyes blazing volmar shrank back from her unexpected surge of rage half expecting a sorcerous attack but the princess ignored him returning to her chair and dropping into it with an angry flounce youre the only one who knows how ive been in hiding all these years lulling suspicions making everyone think i was dead of course though volmar never had puzzled out why carlotta had hidden for quite so many years oh granted she had been totally drained after the breaking other stonespell on amber but even so maybe thats it carlottas musings broke into volmars wonderings maybe now that ive come out of hiding begun moving again the bard has somehow sensed im still around he is a master of that ridiculous bardic magic after all volmar was too wise to remind her it was the bardic magic she so despised that had blocked her path so far eh well the bardling is safe among the squires he soothed ive been debating simply telling him the manuscript isnt here and sending him away dont be a fool sorcery crackled in the air around carlotta her hair stirring where there was no breeze the boy was sent here for a purpose and we will both be better off when we find out just what that purpose might be but how can we learn the truth if the boy becomes suspicious hell never say a thing and i can hardly order the imprisonment or torment of an innocent bardling my people volmar added with a touch of contempt wouldnt stand for it dont be so dramatic the boy is already quite miserable you say no one will talk to him no one will treat him kindly and hes faced with a long boring lonely task carlotta smiled slowly just think how delighted he would be if someone was race to him how eager he would be to confide in that someone i dont understand an adult no you idiot dont you remember what its like being that young the boy is only going to confide in someone his own age as usual volmar forced down his rage at her casual insults ah carlotta you superior little witch if ever i gain the throne beside you you had better guard your back as innocuously as he could he asked who are you suggesting one of the squires oh hardly that her shape blurred altered volmar rubbed a hand over his eyeshed known from the start that carlotta was as much a master of shapeshifting as any fairy but watching her in action always made him dizzy you can look now poor volmar her voice was an octave higher than before and so filled with sugar he dropped his hand to stare where the adult carlotta had sat was now a cloyingly sweet little blonde girl of volmar guessed the bardlings own age though it was difficult to tell age amid all the golden ringlets and alabaster skin and large shining blue eyes how do i look she cooed honest words came to his lips before he could stop them sweet enough to rot my teeth she merely threw back her head and laughed her teeth of course were flawless i am a bit sickening arent i let me try a more plausible form the sickening coyness faded the girl remained the same age but the blonde hair was now less perfectly golden the big blue eyes a bit less glowing the pale skin just a touch less smooth as volmar grit his teeth determinedly watching despite a new surge of dizziness he saw the perfect oval other face broaden ever so slightly at the forehead narrow at the chin until she looked just like charina the count gasped charina the princess agreed your darling little niece too amazed to remember propriety volmar got to his feet and slowly circled her marvelous he breathed at last simply marvelous i would never know you werent the realbut what do we do with the real charina her voice was deceptively light im sure youll think of something ah yes volmar smiled thinly poor charina she always has been a bit of a nuisance wandering about the castle like a lonely wraith how unfortunate that my sister and her fool of a husband had the bad taste to die poor little creature too far from the main line of descent to be of any use as a marriage pawn no political value at all just another useless girl not so useless now carlotta charina dimpled prettily poor charina volmar repeated without any warmth at all so easily disposed of she never will be missed chapter iv kevin woke with a jolt as something smothering landed smack across his face molding itself over his nose and mouthgasping he clawed the monster aside and found himself holding a damp towel very funny he began angrily only to find himself talking to empty space the last of the squires was just leaving the hall laughing with the others fuming kevin got to his feet and found the garderobe facilities grateful that at least the count didnt insist his underlings use lowly chamber pots going to the communal washing trough he discovered the squires hadnt left him more than a few inches of water barely enough to splash on his face grumbling he dressed pulling his clothes from the chest at the foot of his bed and sat down to a solitary breakfastat least theyd left him something to eatof a roll and some scraps of cheese washed down with a lukewarm goblet of khafe now all he had to do was find the counts library easily said kevin wandered helplessly through the castle corridors for a time sure he was going to be shouted at by dkrikas for being where he shouldnt be at last to his relief he intercepted a page a wideeyed boy even younger than am who shyly gave him directions then hurried away at last the bardling thought wryly someone whose status here is even lower than mine the library was a large dusty room lined with tall shelves piled high with scrolls and books of all sizes it was so redolent with the scent of dusty old parchment and leather that kevin sneezed obviously scholarship wasnt high on the counts list of priorities as he glanced about the crowded room the bardling shook his head in gloom the room faced onto an inner courtyard safely away from attack so at least the windows were large enough to let him see what he was doing but there wasnt a title anywhere not on books or scroll cases there wasnt any sign of a librarian either there probably wasnt one judging from the dustiness of the room all right the sooner he started looking the sooner hed get this whole stupid job finished by midafternoon kevin was dusty weary of climbing up and down the rickety library ladder and sick to death of the whole room ha by now he probably knew more about the contents of the counts library than anyone including the count and what a weird collection it was without any logic to it why in the world would anyone want to keep not one but three copies of the agricultural summaries of kendall county for the first twenty years of king sendaks reign and what was a treatise on politics doing tucked in between two volumes of rather bad love poetry how can the master even know for sure the manuscripts in here by bardic magic of course kevin started to sigh then coughed instead blast this dust the bardling stopped his hunt long enough to snag some lunch from a startled page then dove into the library once more a book about farm tools another a catalog of cattle diseases one on swine wild and domestic a book on ow kevin nearly fell off the ladder just barely managing to catch his balance in time something in the shelves had bit him no no it hadnt been a bite at all more of a weird tingling in his fingertips kevin looked warily at the last book hed touchedand let out a whoop of joy yes yes yes hed found the manuscript he needed at last the bardling scurried down the ladder clutching his prize and took it over to the librarys one desk wiping off dust from the manuscripts leather binding as he went a good chunk of the day was already gone but at least he could get the copying started someone presumably at dkrikas command had left him supplies kevin found an inkwell and two quill pens on the desk and a nice stack of parchment in a drawer sitting with the manuscript open before him the bardling paused for one anticipatory moment then dove into his work but after a moment kevin straightened again blinking in confusion he could have sworn the whole manuscript had been written in the common script used by most of the human lands here in the west yet now some of the words seemed to be in a different language completely the bardling rubbed his eyes hed spent too much time in this dusty place peering at old books manuscripts did not change themselves from one language to another yet when kevin took a second look he saw without any doubt about it that some of the letters were actually slowly and gracefully changing before his eyes altering from the human script into elaborate beautiful alien figures elvish he realized with a shock recognizing the script from some of his masters music books kevin bit back a groan as he realized what lay ahead he could only read a few words in elvish that meant hed have to copy the symbols line for line much more slowly and carefully than he would the script of a language that meant something to him oh wonderful more tine wasted but as the bardling started copying the manuscript word by word and symbol by symbol a sudden little shiver of wonder raced through him even though the elvish wasnt miraculously translating itself for him even though he had no idea what he was copying the very fact that hed been able to see the letters transform could only mean one thing his longsleeping gift for bardic magic had finally started to wake up his fingers fairly itched to try his lute and see if the magical songs finally had some power to them first things first there was still the manuscript to finish maybe his magic was starting to wake but his eyes were beginning go ache it was getting more and more difficult to see the pages kevin looked up mildly surprised to realize how dark the library had become he hadnt been aware of the passing hours but by now it was very obviously too late to do any more copying still hed made a good start and magic he thought with a renewed thrill of wonder bardic magic was going to be his kevin got slowly to his feet but in the middle of stretching stiff muscles he froze acting on an impulse he didnt quite understand the bardling warily hid the manuscript behind a shelf of books there that should keep it safe till tomorrow he scooped up his copy returning to the squires quarters the bardling followed his masters orders though they seemed unnecessarily wary and hid the copy in a secret pocket in his saddlebags which in turn he hid under his clothes in the chestwith a dred sigh he sat down on the cot and picked up his lute warily he tried one of the magical songs nothing much happened except for a faint yet very real ringing in his fingers it was true grinning kevin knew he really did have the gift for bardic magic and who knew where that might lead bard kevin whispered joyously in the morning not even noticing how the squires continued to snub him kevin ate and dressed in a rush and hurried to the library eager to start the days copying lets see hed hidden the manuscript behind this row no oh no the manuscript was gone thats impossible ii must have just mistaken which row it was the bardling started searching in the next row and then the next carefully at first then more and more franticallyit had to be here elvish words or no manuscripts just didnt get up and walk kevin was on his knees facing denuded shelves and surrounded by piles of books when a gentle cough made him start he whirled so sharply he lost his balance sitting down hard on some of the books and stared up at at one of the loveliest girls hed ever seen her long plaits of hair were such a beautiful gold her eyes were the clearest blue the same shade as her silky gown while her face and figure were were reddening kevin scrambled to his feet trying to brush off as much dust as possible i uh was working in the library oh you idiot she can see that for herself i mean i was copying out a manuscript for my master hes a bard and iim kevin i mean his apprentice i mean a bardling the lovely eyes widened how wonderful ive never met anyone studying to be a bard before you must be very wise uh well i dont know about that its not easy being a bardling though i can imagine all that musk to learni never could manage to do more than pick out me simplest tunes on the harp no matter how my tutors insisted arc you a harper too no what instrument do you play for a moment staring into those warm blue depths kevin couldnt remember to save his life thethe lute he stammered out at last my goodness she said respectfully thats a very difficult instrument isnt it not for me wonderful now instead of an idiot i sound like a braggart id love it if youd play for me if you want to that is oh i do kevin exclaimed the girl gave the most delightful little giggle but im forgetting my manners here im asking you to play for me and you dont even know who i am my name is charina and i am count volmars niece kevin hastily bowed my lady please her sweet laugh sent a little shiver through him i hear enough formalities at my uncles court but i didnt mean to startle you or interrupt you in her glance took in the empty shelves and piles of books in whatever it is youre doing please continue how could he with such a wonderful creature watching him one eye on charina kevin did his best to look for the missing manuscript but at last sank back on his heels with a groan i cant find it to his wonder she knelt by his side in a feint sweet cloud of perfume he heard himself say youll get your gown all dusty even as he was hoping she wouldnt listen charina shrugged impatiently gowns can be cleaned now if youll tell me what the manuscript looks like ill help you look he couldnt concentrate with her face so close to his her eyes so earnest her lips to his horrified embarrassment his body was responding kevin turned hastily away praying she hadnt noticed its ccalled the study of ancient song but i dont think thats its real name and its about so big so wide in a worn brown leather binding you dont think thats its real name charina echoed softly why ever not kevin felt her warmth like a fire against his arm he hastily moved that arm away and the girl laughed why bardling are you afraid of me she made it sound so ridiculous that kevin found himself starting to laugh too no of course not he said but i you quickly he changed to a safer subjectthe manuscripts too weird to be just a study i mean part of its in elvish how odd but i said id help you look and i will it was kevin thought as they searched together easily turning out to be both the worst and the most wonderful day of his life a day that ended all too soon im sorry we couldnt find the manuscript charina said a smudge of dirt covered the very tip of her nose and kevin had to fight down the impulse to brush it away to touch her soft cheekno he didnt dare if he touched her once he wouldnt be able to stop and she was the counts niece after all yes uh right he got out blast the thing it has to be here somewhere i know what you need charina told him with a smile you need a day away from this dusty old place i cant you can youll be more likely to find the manuscript if you get out in the nice fresh air i know im going riding tomorrow why dont you join me you do ride dont you he wasnt about to tell her about the mule of course well then meet me by the stables tomorrow morning and well make a whole day of it i shouldnt i should stay here and find the manuscript and finish copying it andand and a day away from it couldnt possibly matter ill be there kevin promised and smiled of course they werent allowed to ride out alone a dullfaced groom went with them several tactful strides behind so they could at least pretend to be alone kevin hardly noticed the man charina sat her pretty white palfrey with graceful ease her deep blue riding gown matching the little mares bluedyed bridle and saddle her hair tucked neatly up under a feathered cap as for the bardling well he was mounted not on a mule but on a horse a real spirited horse maybe it wasnt so easy to keep his seat maybe he nearly fell a dozen times but at last he was riding a proper heros mount they didnt ride very far only as far as a flowery hillside i thought this would make a lovely picnic site charina said jumping lightly down before the embarrassed kevin could help her as they munched on fresh buttery bread and the first peaches of springtime the girl coaxed eyes bright but theres so much more in my uncles demesne tomorrow is market day we can ride down into the town and see all the sights well oh you cant say no please itll be such fun besides i see so few people my own age there are the squires kevin said hating himself for reminding her to his delight she dismissed them all with a contemptuous wave of the hand mere boys servants no better than their masters while you are almost a bard you are going to be somebody you are somebody besides she added shyly i like you another day away from the library cant hurt either kevin told himself but two days stretched into three then four a full week passed then another without him noting it a rime out of time during which kevin and charina rode together all over the counts lands hunting out pretty glades and awesome mountain vistas he played his lute for her searching for the most romantic songs he knew half amazed to hear how wonderfully alive his music sounded how full of strength this was the true dawning of his bardic magic kevin realized with a touch of awe and surely charina just by being her own sweet wonderful self was helping it awaken surely he wouldnt have long to wait before it woke completely when it did kevin smiled seeing himself released from apprenticeship seeing himself returning in triumph to charina no longer a mere bardling but a full bard the equal of almost any rank of nobility kevin his master was facing him looking so reproachful the bardling asked warily whats wrong what have i done its what you havent done kevin where is the manuscript boy where is the copy i asked you to make ill make it master dont fear you must your life depends on it do you hear me kevin your life depends on it no kevins eyes shot open staring up at a stone ceiling high overhead whatwhere a dream he realized sinking back in relief he was in the squires quarters in count volmars casde and hed merely had a bad dream and yet kevin thought uneasily there had been a germ of truth to it he really had been neglecting his duty for how long had it been mentally adding up the days the bardling gasped to realized he hadnt even thought of the manuscript for nearly two weeks overwhelmed by guilt he sprang to his feetand gasped anew someone in the night had most thoroughly gone through his belongings my lute to his immense relief though its case had been opened the lute hadnt been harmed but what about the copy of the manuscript if anyones taken it the bardling hastily knelt by the clothes chest his clothes were strewn all about but nothing at all seemed to have been taken suddenly wary kevin deliberately didnt grab at the saddlebags instead he slipped his hand casually into the hidden pocket just in case he was being watched as though he was merely rummaging through the clothing ah the copy was still in there undisturbed the bardling straightened glaring about at the squires all right whose idea of a joke was his look at the poor little boy someone jeered musta been sleepwalking sleep rummaging you mean someone else yelled just like some ragpicking peasant the squires all burst into raucous laughter and kevin turned away in disgust he wasnt going to learn which one of them was the jester not without fighting the whole pack which would be truly stupid every one of these buffoons practiced combat daily besides although he burned to wipe some of those grins off a few of those jeering faces hed been a bardling too long to risk damaging his hands in a fight particularly not now when his magic was starting to blossom i wish i could really use it then wed see who had the final laugh no a true bard never used his talents for harm blast it to darkness clenching his jaws in frustration kevin set about putting his belongings back in place by the time he was done he was alone in the hall and by the time he had eaten and dressed hed gotten his emotions under control after all he had been spending his time with count volmars niece equal to equal nothing these silly boys these mere servants could do was worth his notice at least kevin thought he believed all that as he was on his way to the library determined once and for all to find the missing manuscript and copy it a sweet voice called to him where are you going in such a hurry why did he suddenly feel so guilty charina i the weathers so nice and warm today and i have a wonderful idea for a picnic just the two of us oh how could he resist those lovely blue eyes grimly kevin reminded himself of the dream and his neglected duty im sorry charina he said with very real regret i cant i really would love to go riding or picnicking or anything else with you truly but well i have a job to do and id better do it charina stared at him as though hed just told her something obscene youd turn me down she gasped please i didnt mean you would no no dont try to argue i quite understand youre bored with me no yes you are she tossed her head if you dont want to come with me you dont have to i can do very well without you youyou boy with that charina flounced angrily away leaving kevin standing lost and unhappy behind her interlude the second count volmar looked up in surprise as carlotta stormed into the solar shedding the persona of charina like a cloak and throwing herself down in a chair eyes wild red hair crackling about her i cannot bear being that simpering little fool of a girl a moment longer she raged she looked so totally inhuman in her sorcerous fury that volmar shuddered i cant say i blame you he said soothingly and saw just a touch of that fury fade i never did like little girls all sweetness and cutenessbah he moved to the small table by the wall that held decanters of wine without asking her volmar filled a goblet and handed it to her as carlotta sipped he took his seat again and asked do you really need to be her any longer the princess glared at him over the goblets rim in suddenly renewed anger sorcerous hair like wildfire about her i dont know she snapped i feel as though i dont know anything any more warily like a man tiptoeing on the edge of a fiery pit volmar asked you havent been able to find the manuscript i take it curse the thing no you either obviously obviously ambitious though he was volmar admitted to himself he was not about to do anything as reckless as trying to hide a probably magical artifact from a sorceressparticularly one who right now was ablaze with rage and frustration youre sure the boy isnt deliberately hiding it somewhere in the library carlotta shook her head he may have tried to do so at first but he was quite definitely on the verge of panic while hunting for the thing when i entered as charina no she added thoughtfully he has nothing to do with its disappearance there is almost certainly a spell surrounding the manuscript a spell i thought you could detect such things oh its a very subtle one if even my sorceries havent been able to sense it and since the manuscript seems to be designed to deliberately hide itself even from me it must be a very powerful spell indeed volmar fought down a new shudder bad enough to have a sorcerous ally he understood carlotta and the dangers she represented after all these years or at least he hoped he did but the thought that there might be some new unknown alien magic lurking in his castle as well magic even carlotta couldnt identify just waiting to strike what about the boy that came out more sharply than hed intended he was struggling to keep his voice from shakingyou told me he has the rudiments of bardic magic about him could he have somehow the rudiments its a nuisance that it should have begun waking now but the boy hasnt yet mastered even the least powerful of magic songs he still might know more than he admits i doubt it carlotta sighed impatiently ive seen more of him in the past two weeks than i ever want to see of anyone still he is the only due we have to the manuscript but what if his magic does come to life volmar stirred uneasily in his chair i dont like the boy hes too too honest carlottas voice was sly unpredictable the count countered i think we should be rid of him now while we still can not yet her glance held a disconcerting hint of contempt volmar you always were a nervous sort let me try to explain this to you as dearly as i can the boy is not a threat to us not yet the count echoed darkly carlottas eyes flashed challenging my wisdom she asked ever so softly volmar dear little volmar dont try to cross me i could destroy you little man with a glance the count froze all at once very much aware of how close death could be one wrong word why princess he forced the words from a mouth that suddenly seemed too dry for speech have i ever been anything but your loyal ally to serve your own goals well yes i wont lie about that but in doing so i serve yours as well for both our sakes someday my princess you will wrest the throne from that fool that fool as you so charmingly put it is my brother your halfbrother only carlotta we both know you arent bound by any misguided sisterly love someday you will take the throneand when you do my dear princess i know you will remember your friends friends carlottas glance flicked over him the contempt now only just barely hidden but then she shrugged we shall watch the boy a bit longer i will make one last effort to win him body and mind and if i still cannot subvert him to my side i give you permission to rid us of him she paused even as you did our poor sweet charina volmar waved that off a girl hadnt any business being up on the ramparts anyhow not without even a guard for company let alone doing something as foolish as leaning over the edge of the crenellations to watch birds fly by it had almost been too easy to help her join that flight however briefly and not a soul could say it had been anything but an accident we shouldnt wait the count insisted i have a feeling come now leave prescience to me we cant be rid of him just yet we still may need him to find the manuscript if we cannot she shuddered delicately even if it means i must once more take on the persona of that pretty little fool of ano wait the princess straightened in her chair eyes fierce that may not be necessary the boy has a head full of wild romance what if ha yes of course i already laid the groundwork without realizing it when i told him i would go riding alone my princess what are you talking about youll learn soon enough yes i do believe that i shall go riding alone again tomorrow her smile was all at once so alien so full of dark sorcerous promise that volmars heart turned chill and then carlotta added softly we shall see what we shall see more than that she would not say leaving count volmar cold with nameless dread chapter v kevin sat on a wobbly pile of books head in hands hed searched the library from end to end the manuscript just wasnt here no one could have taken it not even the count knew which manuscript i was copying right no one had taken the thing the dust that covered much of the floor showed pretty clearly that save for that one brief visit by charina no one other than he had even been in the library recently her neat footprints were in a direct line in and out of the room his were all over the place but had a distinctive cleft in one sole if anyone else had entered theyd done so in midair this was insane nobody around here could flybut manuscripts didnt up and vanish all by themselves i should have gone riding with charina kevin thought in misery he had passed her in the hallor rather she had passed him on her way for another solitary ride sweeping regally by with her head in the air as if he hadnt even existed kevin winced wondering if she would ever even speak to him again he had been right of course painful though it was he was here to do a job not enjoy himself with a beautiful young woman a job he couldnt do because the cursed manuscript was gone a sudden frantic pounding on the library door brought kevin to his feet in alarm bardling a voice shouted count volmar wishes to see you the count the bardling stiffened in sudden panic why did count volmar want to see him now was it something about the manuscriptor about charina kevin hastily smoothed his hair with his hands and brushed the dust off himself as best he could wishing he had time to make himself more presentable then hurried out of the library his first impression was of an anthill someone had kicked the usually quiet corridors were packed with people rushing back and forth panic in their eyes and voices what is it he asked areare we under attack no no the servant whod knocked on the door was in a frenzy of impatience no time to talk bardling hurry kevin had expected count volmar to be holding court in the great hall as was usual for the lord of a castle instead to the bardlings surprise he was rushed up to the counts private solar and practically shoved inside a tall lean richly dressed man who could only be count volmar was pacing restlessly back and forth he stopped short as kevin entered staring at the bardling with frantic eyes good good youre here bardling i know you and my niece have become friends no no dont look so guilty i know you havent done anything dishonorable the count resumed his nervous pacing its charina the words were choked out shes gone gone whathow charina went riding this morning count volmar said softly with only her groom to protect her ii never should have let her go but he held up a helpless handcharina can be so very persuasive and i never really believed she could come to any harm never not on my lands my lord please kevin cried what happened her horse returned without her its coat all sweaty with fright i thought there had been an accident that charina had been thrown and the groom was staying with her but when i sent men out to hunt for my niece they returned whitefaced and trembling they had found the groom all right dead killed by sorceryelvish sorcery the count shuddered there was no sign at all of charina elvish kevin protested remembering the elves whod appeared to him back in the forest he never doubted those sosuperior beings could have been capable of great cruelty if the fancy moved them but surely they never would have committed murder they were alien not evil are you sure i mean why would elves dont you know anything count volmar snapped dont you have the slightest idea of what the world is like out there bardlings all wound up in your musicdid you think that everyone in the land is loyal to the king i suppose not but there are rebel elves throughout the kings realm yes and not just white elves either at least those have a code of honor even if a man cant understand it but there are others far worse dark elves you mean kevin wanted desperately to show he knew something about the world of course dark elves necromancers the lot of them the count shook his head in disgust should have been exterminated years ago i dont understand i always thought the elffolk even thethe dark elves kept pretty much to themselves why would they they arent human the count exploded these are others who can comprehend anything they do they hate humans bardling every one of them particularly any who try to rule their country and they have powers we cant hope to understand the dark elves with their foul foul sorceries he shuddered yes and even the white elves wield magic strong enough to twist human minds they can turn child against parent friend against friendthey can even destroy a human mind and soul leaving nothing behind but an empty shell to be filled with whatever they will volmar broke out abruptly turning sharply away after a moment he muttered forgive me i didnt mean to shout at you bardling its simply that ii am so very worried about charina they wouldnt dare harm her kevin said inanely you think not look you at first i hoped she had simply been kidnapped but there have been no ransom demands no messages at all i fear they hate humans so much theyre not going to even try to get anything from me no ah no theyll hurt her just because she is who she is they cant kevin cried in anguishiuh we wont let them the count let out a long shuddering sigh no he said we wont bardlingkevin is it kevin i plan to mount several expeditions to find her and i want you to lead one me yes you and charina became such good friends in so short a time that there must be some psychic link between you and that will certainly help you use bardic magic to find her somehow kevin forgot that what magic he happened to possess was only now starting to wake its range still unknown ill do it he cried when do we leave tomorrow the count smiled faintly thank you kevin im sure a talented young man like yourself will succeed where knights with all their brainless heroics would only fail a small part of kevins mind wasnt so sure of that what he an untrained bardling succeed over battleproven warriors but he didnt dare let himself start to doubt for charinas lovely sake your niece will be safely returned to you count volmar the bardling said somberly and bowed his most courtly bow that night kevin slept not at all his mind kept insisting on conjuring dreadful images of charina in her captors hands he couldnt shake the counts dark words they can destroy a human mind and soul the thought of charina left so hopelessly empty bit at his soul no i wont let that happen to you ill save you i swear it or die trying he wanted to shout it but such hysteria would only bring the casde folk rushing around him wanting to know why he was making so much noise so kevin lay still aching with impatience and waited as the slow slow hours passed as soon as the sun was just barely lightening the sky he was down in the courtyard so wild with excitement he couldnt stand still eager to meet his fellow searchers and get going his lute was slung across his back since no bard could work bardic magic without the aid of an instrument and the few pages hed managed to copy from the missing manuscript were safely tucked into the case as well but now a mail shirt burdened kevins shoulders with unaccustomed weightthough fortunately it was dwarven work lighter than humanmade armorand a sword from the casde armory hung at his side kevin closed his hand about the hilt trying to feel like a seasoned warrior but guiltily remembering his masters warning a musician must always be careful of his hands i will he promised the old bard silently but well this is something that i must do odd he had expected the courtyard to be full of knights and squires preparing to set out on their own rescue missions yet there didnt seem to be anyone around but himself suddenly panicky kevin wondered if early though the morning was he was already too late had everyone left without him no that was ridiculous even the boldest knight wasnt going to try riding down the castles steep hill in the dark evidently the count meant to send the different parries out at different times during the day his must be the firstand that had to mean the count truly trusted him yes but where were his you the bardling said in dismay youre my troop you a throaty voice echoed in wry humor youre our leader the woman whod spoken was tall and rangy a hunter and warrior quiver on her back sword at her side her short curly black hair was held back from her face by a leather thong and her dark eyes were the most devilish kevin had ever seen her olive skin was deeply tannedand a good deal of that skin was revealed because her leather armor and breeches didnt seem to be hiding very much of her lithe form kevin realized how and where he was staring and reddened the woman only laughed never mind boy nothing to be ashamed of not you not me she held out a rough hand for him to shake for all her undeniably feminine shape there was nothing fragile about her grip im lydianalanthis but lets make things easier on you call me lydia im kevin he added with reluctant honesty a bardling a bardling huh count couldnt afford a full bard she grinned at his look of dismay teeth dazzlingly white against her skin dont look so hot and heavy boy im only teasing i knew that he muttered he is paying you isnt he lydia asked with a note of genuine concern in her voice i mean a kid like you he isnt trying to cheat you the bardling straightened indignantly yes the count had given him a purse of coins but it had been for traveling expenses not payment im not aa kid or a mercenary lydia shrugged in other words hes not paying you powers save me from idealistic youngsters the counts niece is in terrible danger how can you possibly be worried about money because the woman drawled ive gotten into the habit of eating regularly cant do that very well without coin in the purse youre not one of count volmars subjects powers no im subject to me boy not to any count i was making my way across the worldnever did it before thats why she added before he could ask anyhow i got as far as this castle when i heard the news about the counts niece and a reward for her safe return oh lydia grinned again but this time kevin thought it looked more like a snarl than a smile lets set things straight from the start yes im a mercenary but dont you look down your nose at me boy i earn my own way give good value for service bought honor my agreements and sleep nice and sound at night you find anything wrong with that or with me best get it out in the open now i dont and i didnt mean to insult you its just that well ive never met anyone like you before she gave a bark of a laugh bet you havent look kevin im not angry at you its just ive seen too many menand boys like youtry to take advantage of any woman who isnt under some mans protection im lucky my people believe in letting a girl grow up knowing how to defend herself but ive traveled enough to know it sure as hell isnt an easy world for most of my sex and so youre trying to protect other women hell no im trying to protect any helpless soul damned if im going to let anyone male female or whatever be turned into aa thing to be used not if i can do something to stop itbesides she added her quick grin back so suddenly kevin wondered if she was ashamed of having been serious for even a moment the pay is good but what look she interrupted brusquely here comes the rest of our party the bardling watched them leaving the keep first one then another then two only two staring in dismay kevin realized that despite all those encouraging words the count couldnt have trusted him that much after all ah well what was as the saying went was trying to keep the disappointment out of his voice he waited till they were within earshot then began as firmly as he could welcome i am kevin a bardling and this warrior is lydia as the first figure shook back the hood of its graygreen cloak revealing slanted green eyes pale silken hair and fairskinned ageless features so fineboned and elegant they never could have been human the bardling added with a gasp youre an elf the elfman looked at him without expression except kevin thought glumly for a hint of contempt in those slanted eyes you are observant oh yes this was an elf all right the sarcasm in the cool voice reminded kevin all too well of that night in the forest im sorry the bardling said as courteously as he could i didnt mean to be rude i was just surprised that earned him the barest dip of the head from the elf understandably i am eliathanis of the moonspirit clan of white elves he was also obviously a warrior his lithe figure dad in silvery scales of elvish armor a straight sword with an intricately wrought silver hilt at his side my people do not enjoy being accused by humans of harm i was here at court when the girl was stolenand i intend to prove those accusations wrong i bet you havent got a crumb of humor in your whole body kevin thought eyeing that rigidly controlled face stealing from one of the old ballads the bardling said formally we shall be glad of your help good warrior and gave a formal little bow but will you be so glad of my help the second figure wondered softly slowly with a fine sense of drama it drew back the hood of its black cloak revealing a face just as inhumanly fineboned and elegant as that of eliathanis framed by a fall of straight silveryblond hair but this face was so dark of skin it was nearly as black as the cloak the elf was dressed entirely in black as well tunic hose boots all save for a chin silver belt the clasp kevin noted uneasily was worked in the shape of a skull blue eyes eerie against so much darkness glinted coldly a dark elf lydia yelped hand flying to the hilt of her sword nithathil the white elf hissed eyes blazing the dark elf bowed so very graciously it was an insult yes he said in his soft voice nithathil dark elf indeed the blue glance flicked lightly over kevin and lydia then back to the other elf call me naitachal if you must have a specific name for me i have a name for you eliathanis snapped necromancer kevin stepped hastily between the angry elves hoping he wasnt about to get blasted by either side uh might we ask what you wish my uh my lord nahachal why i am here to help you return the lost human girl to her uncle even as you the dark elf purred but kevin being as close to the elf as he was caught the barest glint of pain in the eerie blue eyes he expects us to hate him the bardling realized in surprise and the idea hurts him f didnt think dark elves cared what anyone thought of them as kevin hesitated uncertain naitachal drew back the barest step drawing his cloak about his lean form i do not wish to force myself on you he murmured to kevin but even as you white elf i will not see my people accused of a crime that is not theirs since when did your kind worry about what others thought eliathanis challenged since the humans have become so numerous the dark elf answered even the mightiest of dragons can be brought down by a large enough pack of hounds ah well yes kevin said great here was his first big decision as a leader and he was stammering like an idiot lydia eliathanis we can hardly deny a man the right to defend the honor of his people they have no of his people kevin repeated hastily before the white elf could finish his insult whatever we may think of each other weve been thrown together on the orders of count volmar do any of you wish to back out now well do you youd better speak now because i dont want to find myself in the middle of of what thinking frantically the bardling continued almost smoothlyof some heroic battle only to see my supposed comrades battling each other instead or running away like little boys yelling i dont wanna play with him how dare you eliathanis began in outrage but kevin continued using his trained musicians voice to swell over the white elfs words look at you two elves you think yourself superior to us humans well maybe you arebut i havent seen any sign of that superiority yet bravo murmured lydia but the bardling ignored her continuing hotly while you two waste precious time by bickering an innocent girl may be suffering may even be dying we all want the same thing and thats to free her i ask you all three of you will you or will you not stay with me there was a long tense silence then hell im willing lydia said with a shrug and i murmured naitachal eliathanis hesitated a moment longer glaring at the dark elf then shrugged no one has spoken of abandoning you human besides i would not have it said was less brave than a nithathil kevin nearly laughed aloud all at once so shaky with relief he wasnt sure he could move good and together we shall stayuntil the lady charina is returned safely to her uncle chapter vi what do you mean this is all we get lydia thundered at the startled stable hand butbut my lady there are four of you the counts offering you four horses and what about grain for those horses and supplies for us hell i can hunt down enough meat to keep us going and im sure the boy or one of these elves knows how to find nuts and berries but i am not going to sleep on bare ground or go without a change of clothes you throw in at least one pack horse fully provisioned mind youand do it now as the terrified servant scurried off lydia winked at kevin thats the way to do it she murmured act as if you know what youre doing keep em off balance and theyll give you anything you want ii see the bardling struggled to imitate eliathanis and keep his face an impassive mask but he was sure everyone knew exactly how inept he felt here he was supposed to be the leader of the group and it hadnt even occurred to him to ask for grain dont worry kid the woman gave his shoulder a light punch ill look out for you wonderful just what he wanted a babysitter kevin tried not to scowl as he watched lydia prowl up and down the rows of stalls which is lady charinas horse she called out this should have known dainty little creature a real ladys palfrey couldnt stand a day on the trail hold still horse she lifted a foreleg examining the hoof and shoe then waved the others to her side distinctive shoeing see the slight ridging here and here if this beast left hoofprints i can follow them my uh lady lydia glanced up and grinned ah here we go as she had ordered the stable hand had brought them not only their horses but a laden pack horse as well as they rode down from the casde and out over the fields lydia crouched low over the neck other horse studying the ground finally dismounting to study what looked like a perfectly unremarkable patch of earth to kevin this is where the girl was seized all right she said see how the grass has been torn up eliathanis dismounted as well then drew back in distaste it stinks of sorcery it does naitachal agreed softly joining him sorcery cold enough to slay a man wrapped in his black cloak hood up against the sun which must be uncomfortably bright kevin thought to someone used to darker lands the dark elf was a sinister faceless figure do you not feel the echo of his death naitachal sighed in regret were it only a tiny bit stronger i could call his spirit to us and learn the truth necromancy eliathanis spat oh indeed kevin thought he caught the barest hint of a sardonic smile from under that black hood what was worked here the dark elf continued softly was not the magic of my folk nor yours nor even that of the humans not quite at any rate intriguing but i cant pick up a clear enough trace for it to be very helpful what of you white elf eliathanis shook his head whoever it was took great pains to cover his tracks his or hers or even theirs i cant be sure lydia glanced from one elf to the other then shrugged we didnt expect things to be easy did we bending to examine the ground the woman gave a soft laugh of triumph maybe there arent any clear magical traces but at least there is a physical track see heres where charinas palfrey bolted back to its stable but here these are the tracks of a different horse bigger heavier maybe a destrier she swung lithely back into the saddle it has to be the horse the kidnapper was riding look the tracks are faint enough as they are lets get going before something destroys them altogether as the small party rode on out of field into scrubland then forest following an overgrown trail that must originally have been cut by woodsmen kevin wondered bitterly if he really was the leader lydia was doing the tracking and the two elves had their magic to help them while hehe was nothing but an untried bardling who didnt even know about hey wait a minute naitachal the dark elf had pushed back his hood as soon as the first trees had screened off the sunhis fair hair gleamed startling bright against the darkness of skin and clothing as he brought his horse up beside kevins yes naitachals eyes disconcertingly glinted red in the dim light sending echoes of every eerie tale hed ever heard flashing through kevins mind dont be stupid he scolded himself hes an ally for now anyhow were you in the castle when the grooms body was brought in was naitachal said softly and yes i did ask to be allowed to examine it eliathanis keen elf ears caught that murmur to work your spells on it you mean the dark elf smiled without rancor exactly i have been well trained in the sorceries that can draw back the dead one would think count volmar would have been anxious to learn anything that might have helped him recover his niece and yet i was refused not surprising the white elf snapped he didnt want anything tainted by darkness in his castle ah my touchy cousinelf you dont understand one would also think the groom would have been buried with honor having died defending his lady but there was no public burial and even i have no idea what became of his body odd kevin admitted to himself uneasily very odd but before he could continue chat thought a small shrill voice called out here you are it cook you long enough with a laugh lydia reined in her horse well forgive me tichki you knew it was going to take some time i went as fast as i could a fairy kevin cried a human the fairy mocked in return my my what a clever little boy the bardling tried in vain not to stare as with all her kind tichki was small barely coming up to his horses knee she was undeniably female an adult woman other kind almost beautiful in a sharpedged predatory wild creature way her bright sharply slanted eyes green as those of a white elf seemed enormous in her triangular face her hair was caught up in a tangle of auburn braids and even her iridescent wings seemed to have a predatory glint to them like those of a dragonfly she was if half the stories about her kind were true just as likely to stab a human with that gleaming little spear she bore as talk to one that didnt seem to bother lydia i never heard of any human making friends with a fairy kevin thought but friends they did seem to be or at least acquaintances were off on an adventure the warrior woman said noo tichki drawled really i drought you were just out for a ride in the woodland her green gaze sharpened with a white and dark elf together no less so lydia are you going to give me a hand up youyoure going with us kevin asked then had to hold fast to his startled horses reins as tichki darted upward in a blur and buzz of wings landing lightly behind the warrior woman you going to stop me no no of course not its just well i never knew one of your people to be friendly with one of mine no and youre not likely to again lydia laughed tichki and me were a lot alike dont like staying cooped up in one place too long i first met her when she was pinned down by a hunting hound and i saved you later from the angry hunters tichki gave the woman a sharp little pinch so dont go getting all superior she squirmed about to stare at kevin with her hard green gazethats it boy lydia and me we sometimes travel together but dont think because i tolerate her i have a love for all you humans ah for a fairy to be out on her own like this travel lust or no could only mean shed been cast out from her peoplepossibly for associating with a mere human not knowing what else to say kevin stammered uh welcome to our group were searching for the niece of i know all that tichki said impatiently wings stirring i have every bit as strong a scrying talent as those hulking elfmen the only reason i wasnt up there in that castle with you is because i didnt want to get stepped on by some clumsy lout of a human more likely kevin thought the humans wouldnt let such a perilous little creature in tichki settled herself more comfortably sidesaddle behind lydia folding her wings too small to ride astride i want to find out what happened to that simpering little girl too she doesnt simper kevin said hotly then stopped short at tichkis sly grin too late he remembered another nasty little trait about fairies they delighted in tormenting humans one way or another and i fell right into her trap now we are five naitachal murmured wryly tichki glared and youll be glad of it dark elf all right enough of this lets go as they rode deeper into the forest dense brush all but engulfed the trail forcing them to ride single file thick canopies of leaves shut out more and more of the tight at last surrounded by dim green twilight lydia swore under her breath and dismounted peering at the ground in disgust damn whats wrong kevin asked youve lost the track no no the tracks still therei just cant see it in all this gloom a torch torches flicker too much create too many distorting shadows she glanced up at the elves one of you give me some nice steady light eliathanis hesitated then admitted reluctantly i cant im a warrior not a magician the only magic i possess is that innate to my race no lightspells eh tichki i know you dont have any either the fairy shrugged cant know everything better things to do with my time than waste it studying spells a fairy who wasnt too much of a magician kevin had never heard of such a thing maybe that was why shed been cast out by her people lydia was turning to naitachal what about you dark elf naitachals eyes glinted eerily in the darkness my people have no need for tightspells oh great lydia got to her feet might as well make camp then were not going anywhere wait heart racing kevin took out his lute tuning it carefully one of the magical songs his master had taught him was known as the watchwood melody and its purpose was to create tight i dont know if this is going to work but he cleared his throat took a deep breath and started to sing at first nothing happened but halfway through the melody kevin felt a tingle run through him head to foot magic he prayed let it be magic and it was for the first time in all the weary years of study he felt the song felt each syllable each note as a separate wonder ringing in his mind listening to that wonder he slid more and more deeply into his music though he was vaguely aware of something outside himself being different the darkness surely it wasnt quite as dark powers he and his lute wereglowing they were actually glowing with a pale steady light terrific lydia yelledkeep it going just like that but all at once kevin was terrified of what he had done a childish part of his mind jibbered that he should stay what hed been ordinary unimportant safe the bardlings concentration slipped his fingers stumbled on the strings breaking the spell as the pale light began to fade his voice faltered to a stop kevin slumped suddenly so weary from he energy loss of a failed spell he could barely stay in the saddle sorry he muttered sorry lydia echoed that was amazing no it wasnt if id done it right the light would have lasted even after i stopped singing well never mind the woman said cheerfully youll get it right next time kevin clenched his jaws before he could say something hed regret the last thing he wanted right now was to be patronized even by someone who meant well what was i trying to prove i couldnt hold onto even the simplest songspell fin not a bard maybe i never will be at least the two elves werent trying to be kind but it didnt help to hear tichki chortling to herself just like a human disappointed because hes been delighted once the party had fed and watered the horses and picketed them in a line and eaten a dinner of cold meat and bread there wasnt much else to do kevin tried to start a conversation with the others but nobody else seemed to want to talk he sat back disgruntled this camp was hardly like those in the old songs those songs in which a cheery group of comrades on the road gathered beneath the stars if there were stars they were totally hidden by the roof of leaves and except for lydia and tichki the comrades were strangers to each other and not in a very cheery mood naitachal sat as silently as a blackwrapped statue a darker part of the night just outside the ring of firelight eliathanis polishing his silvery elfsword with slow methodical strokes light glinting off the blade with each upstroke was almost as silent though he kept shooting wary hostile glances at the dark elf kevin attempted a few practice scales on his lute not daring to try any magic lest it fail just keeping his fingers limber but he gave up after tichki sneered every time he missed a note and lydia prowled round and round their camp like some cautious wild thing until the bardling couldnt stand it any longer what are you doing checking came the short answer just checking dont like the idea of something sneaking up on us without us having some way out nothing lurks out there naitachals soft voice made everyone start nothing living with superb timing the dark elf waited till the others had a chance to imagine undead horrors before adding lightly except of course for the small normal creatures of the forest oh thank you lydia muttered naitachal glanced up as the woman passed him in her circlings there is a rather large skeleton under the leaves just to your left it was a wolf i believe and it is still in fairly good condition if you wish lydia i can summon it up to stand guard she gave him a look of sheer horror uh no that wont be necessary i we will have none of your foul sorceries eliathanis sword glinted in his hand you melodramatic fool naitachals voice was quietly deadly dont ever point a weapon at me not unless you intend to use it push me too far dark elf and i will go ahead white elftry i stop that kevin snapped and both elves turned to him in surprise you sound like little boys daring each other to fight look i know you two dont like each other but were stuck with each other for the sake of our mission cant you declare a truce eliathanis frowned sternly is not in elf natures to lie well then at least pretend and you lydia will you please stop paring naitachal told you theres nothing dangerous out there we have three faeriekin here and five horses surely one of them will be able to warn us if anythings approaching he glared at them all is that all right with everyone yes fine and now goodnight there was startled silence amazed at his own boldness kevin wrapped himself in a blanket turned away and curled up to sleep i didnt mean to explode like that but i couldnt stand listening to that stupid bickering any longer charina would have laughed and said charina who might not even still be alive kevin swallowed hard you are alive ii know it charina you are alive and well find you i promise bit by bit he managed to relax all around him was quiet save for the peaceful chirpings and rustlings of a forest at night soothing sounds but just as the bardling was drifting off timed to exactly the right moment to annoy him the most tichki murmured cute little puppy dog thinks he has fangs kevin sat bolt upright the fairy was watching him from beyond the banked campfire her green eyes the eyes of a sly predator as he stared she smiled sleep well tichki whispered and blew him a kiss kevin woke disoriented somewhere in the small hours of the night there just barely visible in the darkness were naitachal and tichki talking softly together in the elvish tongue as though they were old friends but as though they felt him watching them they turned as onetwo pairs of alien eyes glowing eerily looked at him sending a shiver through the bardling at the thought that the darkness was no barrier to them why had they been whispering together the dark elf and the perilous fairy what could they be plotting kevin swallowed drily trying to find an innocuous way to ask them but before he could open his mouth naitachal murmured go back to sleep kevin a trace of sorcery must have hidden behind the simple words because for all his sudden worry kevin found himself sliding helplessly back into slumber chapter vii oh hell lydia said for two full days they had been riding through forest so dense kevin thought that any one of them could have followed the trackthe trail had been so overgrown a horses body could hardly have kept from breaking telltale branches there had been no way for the kidnapper to avoid leaving a track let alone to leave the trail but the forest had been thinning for some time as the land grew increasingly more rocky and now they had broken out of forest altogether the trail melted into a series of paths and one true road winding their way through a limestone wilderness a timeeroded maze of tall graywhite stone walls are we out of luck kevin asked lydia shrugged cant follow a trace over solid rock still its not all rock she dismounted searching with her face so close to the ground that the bardling was reminded of a hunting hound searching for an elusive scent yes the woman said at last this way i think they rode on following the road the only sounds the creak of saddle leather and the dick of their horses hoofs against stone kevin glanced at lydia not at all happy about the uncertainty he saw on her face the walls of the gorge towered over them as they rode weighing down his spirit staring up at the narrow slash of sky kevin couldnt shake the sense of being a very small insignificant creature in the middle of a very small insignificant partynow that he wasnt so overwhelmed by the mere thought of adventure he had to admit that five ah beings hardly seemed a big enough group to have any hope of success yet if the count had sent out any larger expeditions the bardling hadnt seen any sign of them i dont understand that dont understand any of that we dont even know for sure that whoever were following actually has charina kevin sighed none of his doubts were going to matter if he couldnt hold his team together long enough to accomplish something team ha the last thing they were was a team oh everyone was nicely polite to each otherif you ignored the subtle snipings of white and dark elf at each other or the jibes of lydia at these silly males or the nasty little jokes of the fairy the bardling gritted his teeth tichki seemed to have decided he was the best butt for her humor shed ever seen she never said anything outandout hostile oh no that would have been too simple instead the fairy would wait till hed finished practicing a particularly difficult melody on his lute then ask innocently are you going to actually play something now or worse when are you going to work some bardic magic knowing he was too scared of failure to risk trying another spellor perhaps she would simply wonder aloud what it was like co be a leader when he hadnt really had a chance to be one anything kevin thought to undermine what little selfconfidence he had left the only two who did seem to be getting along were naitachal and tichki after that first night kevin was still keeping a wary eye on those two but so far they hadnt done anything even remotely suspicious except last night there had been that bizarre whateverithadbeen kevin frowned remembering how he had caught the dark elf and the fairy huddling together mysteriously so involved in what they were doing they hadnt even noticed him the bardling had gotten close enough to hear tichki urge try it again and naitachal had actually responded with pick a card any card at that moment theyd spotted him the dark elf had suddenly straightened looking important and mysterious but kevin could have sworn naitachal was embarrassed and hadnt he caught a glimpse of tichki hastily hiding a fairysize deck of cards card tricks a necromancer learning card tricks it made about as much sense as anything else so far were not still on count volmars lands are we kevin asked warily hardly lydia glanced up at the sky judging direction im pretty sure were on the outskirts of crown lands if we keep riding east like this well probably wind up in the city of westerin if we get that far eliathanis glanced up at the steep brooding walls on either side his usually unreadable eyes glittering with uneasiness i dont like this place anyone could be lurking up there claustrophobic el tichki taunted scared of the shadows in his mind the white elf glared at her im not imagining things westerin is an important trading city is it not thanks to the rocks this must surely be one of the only roads available for anyone who wishes to reach the city from the west what better place for an ambush dont say something like that lydia snapped its bad a savage shout from overhead cut into her words luck she finished ironically whipping out her sword kevin didnt have a chance to act to think before a heavy body hurtled into him hurting him from his horse my lute the bardling twisted frantically sideways to save it as he fell by luck slamming into earth rather than rock mail shirt bruising his ribs aching and breathless kevin struggled to draw his sword handicapped by the lute cases strap the bandits face leered into his own foulsmelling and ugly as an ogreand as deadly kevin saw the man raise the dub that was going to bash out his brains but he couldnt get the stupid sword free so the bardling did the only thing he could smashing his fist up into the ugly face owhdamn he hadnt been able to get much force into the blow not tying sprawled on the ground but it was enough to send pain flaming up his arm because hed connected with the mans battered helmet not his face the bandit grunted in surprise falling back just enough for the bardling to wriggle free he squirmed out of the lute case leaving the instrument safeplease let it be safe behind a rock as kevin frantically tugged at the hilt of his sword the weapon came free of its scabbard so suddenly he nearly dropped it hearing the bandit rushing him the bardling whirledand the man impaled himself on the blade for what seemed like an eternity kevin stared helplessly into his foes disbelieving eyes too horrified to move then those eyes glazed and the bandit slowly sagged nearly dragging the sword from kevins hand the bardling swallowed hard and pulled the blade free trying not to look at the blood darkening it trying not to think about how dreadfully easily metal had slid into flesh his hand still throbbed with pain and part of his mind was yammering its broken it has to be broken but it wasnt not if he could grip the sword hilt so tightly and there wasnt any time to worry about what other damage he might have done panting kevin glanced wildly about for one confused moment he was reminded of a dog pack dragging down its prey but these dogs were armed with clubs knives and homemade spearsand this prey was fighting back lydia swearing fiercely sword hashing still sat her horse caking advantage of its greater height or trying to the confused frightened animal unused to battle was more of a hindrance than a help at least its frantic whirling and kicking kept anyone from closing with the womantichki her wings a blur darted in and out of the battle with waspish speed her spear jabbing savagely at bandit eyes the two elves had given up their mounts and stood fighting back to back white and dark forgetting their differences for the momenteliathanis blade shone dear silver mere human blood unable to stain it while naitachal kevin stared naitachal was wielding a nightblack sword that seemed to swallow up the light and that laughed softly every time it struck a foe after the first few blows the bandits understandably cringed away putting themselves within lydias reach he didnt have that sword before i know he didnt but the sight of that eerie sorcery reminded the bardling that he too had some combat magic granted the songspell wasnt strong enough to hurt anyone all it could do was confuse a foes attack but surely that would helpif the magic would only work for him no no there wasnt time to doubt kevin dove for his lute for a moment terrified that his bruised hand wasnt going to let him play forcing his stiff fingers over the strings he started at full speed into the opening bars his voice was almost too dry for song rasping out desperately and he knew that even if he did summon his bardic magic it wasnt going to last long it didnt even seem to be coming out right but something was happening because the whole battle was beginning to glow a faint but very real blue oh great all im doing is making pretty colors damned sorcerer a voice muttered before kevin could turn a harsh arm was about his throat choking him the bardling lost his grip on the lute heard it hit the ground please please dont let it break he kicked back and felt his boot hit bone the bandit swore losing his strangling grip kevin felt a jolt against his already sore ribs as the man tried to stab him but hit the mail shirt instead the bardling pulled free lunging for his sword then cried out in pain as the bandit kicked it viciously away tearing the hilt from kevins aching hand the sword came to rest wedged between two rocks kevin and the bandit both scuffled after it but the bandit got there first stomping down hard tb the bardlings horror the sword snapped halfway up the blade for a moment kevin and his foe stared at each other frozen then the bandit slowly grinned revealing a mouthful of ugly teeth too bad boy i win you lose with that the man leaped at him kevin scrambled to his feet looking frantically about for another weapon out of the corner of his eye the bardling saw the bandits knife flash again this time aimed at his unprotected neck he twisted about just barely managing to catch the mans wrist in time but i cant hold him hes just too strong the bandit continued to grin slowly he began bending the bardlings wrists back and back kevin gasped as renewed pain shot through his bruised hand and lost his grip the knife began its plunge but then the bandit froze as a darkskinned hand closed on his neck the mans eyes widened gaping in sudden blind horror as kevin stared in sheer disbelief he saw the mans hair fade from black to gray to white the leathery skin sagged wrinkled the bandit let the bardling go so suddenly kevin fell dragging himself frantically away as what had been a living man a moment before crumbled to ancient dust naitachal stood revealed eyes still blazing red from the force of his spell but in those eerie eyes kevin saw such bitter despair that for a moment the bardling could do nothing but stare in helpless fascination then with a quick flip of his wrist me dark elf pulled up the hood of his black cloak hiding his face only then did kevin realize what was happening around them that last horrific sorcery had been coo much for what was left of the bandit gang yelling in terror they fled back down the gorge lydia started to knee her horse after them then reined the animal in again nah she muttered not worth it everyone all right tichki fluttered to a landing behind lydia cleaning her spear with a scrap of cloth from a bandits tunic she grinned fiercely no problems here i am unhurt eliathanis was disheveled golden hair wild cloak gashed and elven mail darkly stained but his voice was as calmly formal as ever and i added naitachal softly what of you kevin the bardling snatched up his fallen lute examining it carefully then let out a sigh of relief its only scratched a little yes bardling but what of you i saw how carefully you moved your hand reaction set in as abruptly as though the words had been a spell kevin clutched the lute to him trying to hide his sudden trembling realizing only now how narrowly hed escaped permanently damaging his fingers powers oh powers master aidan had been right to warn him hed come so close to ending his bardic career before it had started its nothing the bardling said gruffly just a bruise he retrieved what was left of his sword glancing ruefully at the fragments then slipping them back into their scabbard ccome on lets get out of here before the bandits recover theyre not going to recover so quickly tichki jeered pointing with her spear at crumpled bodies but the boys right lets go wait eliathanis said softly approaching the dark elf naitachal stiffened murmuring something in the elvish tongue that was plainly a wary question but the white elf shook his head no let the humans understand this as well naitachal i have always believed that the nithathil the dark elves hated life that they cared nothing for any but themselves well you had no need to risk yourself guarding my back yet you did you had no need to risk yourself saving the bardling yet you did what are you laying to say eliathanis just that i the fair skin reddened i may have been too hasty in judging you he held out a hand the dark elf hesitated for a long moment then raised his own hand as they pressed palm to palm in the elvish version of a handshake tichki snickered touching she said now can we please get going a lilting call in the elvish language coaxed the strayed horses back to them as they rode off kevin resolutely refused to look at the dissipating mound of dust that had been a living man to the bardlings relief the gorge widened again after a short time of uneasy riding the stone walls dropping off into a tangle of greenery dazed by shock and exhaustion he sank into a weary stupor clinging blindly to the saddle barely aware of the world around him hey kevin kevin lydia was calling him the bardling roused himself realizing with a start that night had stolen up on them they were stopped in the middle of a small meadow their horses grabbing greedily at the lush weeds and grass were stopping for the night i think thats a good idea boy dont you oh he did indeed lydia experienced traveler and adventurer that she was carried a pouch of healing herbs with which she treated everyones cuts and bruises including the bardlings sore hand now lets try to get some sleep she ordered after theyd finished a brief meal of cold rabbit and stale bread its been one hell of a tiring day but for all his weariness kevin couldnt sleep he kept seeing death and blood and a man dying on the point of his sword another man withering to dust at last he moved away from the others to sit wrapped in darkness without and within after a time a shadow stirred naitachal moving silently to join him whats wrong kevin the dark elf asked softly nothing i just cant sleep youre still thinking of the battle arent you noyes the bardling broke off with a choked little gasp naitachal tthis isnt going to mean much to you i mean youre a dark elf and a necromancer youre used to death and all that but i killed a man today so you did kevin stiffened at the casual reply that really doesnt mean anything to you does it oh it does it was the barest whisper i cannot remember the first time i was forced to take a life but have never totally forgotten the horror of it you ccant remember how could you not remember kevin i dont know how much you know of my people humans tell some truly bizarre stories about the nithathil those you call the dark elves but one thing they say of us is quite true we are indeed raised without love without anything that might weaken us i was singled out early in my childhood as one who held sorcerous promise that means only one thing to the nithathil for all the years of my life i have studied dark magic the magic of death necromancy as you call it but ah powers i am so very weary of it kevin glanced at the dark elfin surprise then i was right wasnt i you were every bit as horrified as i was when that bandit died fromfrom age when i killed him you mean that lifedraining spell is called archahai necrawch spectre touch in your language naitachal shuddered ever so faintly it is a very dark thing indeed but there wasnt much time to act not with that knife about to slay you and i couldnt think of any other way to save you you had a sword a death sword kevin a temporary thing drawn from sorcerys heart you heard its joy in taking life did you not that soft and empty laughter i couldnt run the risk of even scratching you with it hearing the bitter selfloathing in the dark elfs voice the bardling cried i dont understand if you dont want to work deathspells why do it why not try something else there is nothing else not for one of my kind not yet at any rate the dark elf added softly i meant it when i told you intended to prove my people had nothing to do with the stealing of count volmars niecelove or hate they are my people but i have no intention of ever returning to them what will you do aye bardling i dont know not yet naitachal paused you dont know how i envy you me you know what you want from life you have the joy that is your music and with it the promise of bright happy living magic i dont understand surely your people have music too i mean theyre elves and i thought all elves we are not like the other elven races we alone have no music no music bbut thats terrible oh it is listening to your songs bardling has been untold delight for me the dark elf gave a soft rueful laugh ay me here i try to help you and end up telling you my problems instead kevin blinked all at once realizing that somewhere during this strange conversation the specter of the bandit hed killed had ceased to haunt him you haw helped misery loving company eh whatever else he might be naitachal was still dark elf enough to be ashamed of showing weakness ah enough of this he said abruptly getting to his feet the night is late boy go get some sleep but then naitachal paused teeth flashing in a sudden grin and if you tell anyone about this conversation he said a touch too lightly i shall deny it all chapter viii something damp was hitting his face for a sleepy moment kevin thought he was bade in the castle with the squires playing one of their pranks on him he opened his eyes with a cry of will you stop the rain lydia cut in wryly dont think any of us can manage that kevin sat up in dismay clutching his cloak about him it wasnt much of a rain more of a light but persistent drizzle but its going to wash away the tracks probably lets get going boy i want to get as far as we can before that happens gathering up his damp belongings the bardling muttered it never rains in the songs at least the day wasnt cold but the ride was still going to be an unpleasant one he hadnt guessed just how unpleasant as though the previous day had never happened the two elves began bristling towards each other once more and naitachal showed not the slightest sign of the lonely musichungry soul of the night before i give up kevin thought i just give up of course the weather had a good deal to do with deteriorating tempers kevin knew that not that such wisdom helped him any discovering that even a relatively lightweight mail shirt became incredibly uncomfortable when wet the bardling had to keep a tight rein on anything he said particularly when tichki made some waspish remark she cant help it he forced himself to accept the fairy after all had to be the most uncomfortable of them all constantly fluttering her wings in a vain attempt to keep them dryno wonder she was snapping at elf and human indiscriminately too waterlogged for flight she must fed frighteningly helpless lydia meanwhile fairly radiated angry frustration bent nearly double over her horse muttering under her breath as she hunted for the rapidly fading trail it didnt help uncertain tempers to realize that they were almost out of supplies for people and horses both granted the animals would probably be able to find enough forage to keep them going but it wasnt going to be much fun hunting for game in this weather at least kevin thought struggling for any sign of good humor the drizzle did seem to be letting up who knew maybe the sun would even deign to put in an appearance and dry everybody off but even as the first feeble rays did at last break through the clouds lydia threw up her hands in disgust that does it i take it the rain washed away the cracks naitachal asked hell no they arent washed away they simply disappear just like that as though horse and rider up and vanished into the air lydia let out her breath in an angry hiss ive had trails go cold on me before but ive never had one juststop wonderful tichki said flatly now what what indeed after a moment kevin began i think were going to have to go on to westerin lydia said just as if he wasnt there eliathanis shook his head theres no evidence they rode that way theres no evidence they didnt besides the horses need grain and a hot meal and a bath wouldnt hurt any of us either ah i think kevin began again but naitachal cut in lydia has a point we would be more likely to learn something important in a city than out here in the middle of open country thats a human city eliathanis snapped how willingly do you think theyre going to admit a dark elf naitachal shrugged about as willingly as they would a white elfin these uncertain days but our cloaks are hooded after all no one need know our races as long as were careful huh no ones going to bother a fairy tichki boasted no ones going to bother with a fairy lydia corrected with a grin not a little thing like you little is it tichki pinched lydia so hard the woman jumped little is it well you ore littleaie stop that i apologize hey remember me the bardling asked ive got some say in this too and i this is nonsense eliathanis shook his head again stubbornly i think we should continue to search out here search what lydia exploded i tell you there isnt the slightest due there isnt even the slightest trace of a clue in the city itll be a different matter give em enough money and well be able to bribe nearly anyone to tell us whatever we need to know the white elf straightened staring at her as though shed uttered an obscenity humans lie he said shortly how much truth do you think you will get out of anyone who can be bought hes scared tichki taunted poor elf is scared the humans will throw things at him dirty his pretty face eliathanis took a furious swipe at her but the fairy fluttering heavily because of her stilldamp wings soil managed to evade him mocking him with temper temper stop that tichki lydia caught one small foot and pulled the fairy back down behind her on the horse i say we go to westerin and i naitachal voted me too tichki grinned sharply i lake human dues so many folks careless with their belongings so many opportunities huh lydia muttered just dont get us thrown into prison have i ever yes the fairy ruffled her wings thought youd forgotten all about thatit wasnt my fault the gems fell into your pouch oh no the pouch just happened to come open at just the right time well it might have had a little help and its not going to have any more help if i find your fingers anywhere near that pouch tichki i swear ill cut cm off spoilsport i sure hope so what about you eliathanis are you with us or not after a reluctant moment the white elf nodded not that it will do any good hey kevin shouted with all his breath and the others stared at him as though seeing him for the first timeremember me i get some say in this too all right kevin lydia said a little too cheerfully as though shes humoring a child kevin fumed what do you say what could he say no matter what count volmar had said kevin knew he certainly wasnt the leader of this group i say the bardling grumbled we go to westerin kevin reined in his horse without even being aware hed done it staring in sheer wonder westerin he breathed oh he had been taught his geography as a child he knew that the walled city lay at the junction of two trading routes on a wide fertile plain fed by a tranquil river but hearing about it and actually seeing it were two very different things westerin was a beautifully picturesque sight beneath the dramatically cloudy sky the thick crenellated wall that girded it broken at regular intervals by pointed towers topped in bronze that gleamed like gold in the shifting rays of sunlight the city was also much larger than the bardling had ever imaginedno no he thought it wasnt merely large it was enormous particularly kevin added wryly to himself compared to quiet little bracklin the others were riding on the bardling urged his horse after them trying to ignore tichkis mocking boy acts like hes never seen a city before well all right maybe he hadnt what of it with an indignant sniff kevin straightened in the saddle doing his best to pretend there was nothing at all amazing about those thick stone walls towering over them as they approached nothing at all amazing about the mass of buildings he glimpsed through the open gates but for all his attempts at keeping calm the bardlings heart had begun pounding wildly westerin westerin why the very name rang with adventure chapter ix despite eliathanis worries they had no trouble at an getting into westerin in fact the city guards hardly glanced their way waving the party inside with bored indifference kevin struggled to copy that indifference but how could he possibly keep from gawking the street up which they were riding was wide enough to hold them easily even if they had been riding abreast and it was paved with cobblestones only the innkeeper of the blue swan back in bracklin had been able to afford those expensive things and how could kevin not stare at all the buildings hed never seen so many in one place hed never dreamed so many could exist they seemed to have been set out helterskelter as though each owner had put his house wherever he wanted it without worrying about how the whole thing was going to look the casual jumble of buildings created a maze of smaller streets branching out in all directions kevin shook his head in confusion not only was there no pattern to the way the buildings were laid out no two houses looked alike some of those he glimpsed were small low to the ground looking somehow meek amid all the bustle of the homey wattleanddaub sort familiar to him from bracklin even if their roofs here were of red tile rather than thatch other houses were eccentrically painted halftimbered buildings their upper stories leaning drunkenly together over their narrow streets only wooden props keeping them apart kevin gave up trying to be aloof and stared openly when he saw a row of out and out mansions of beautifully worked stone some of them amazingly three or four stories high and the people there must be thousands here inside the encircling city walls all of them speaking a jumble of languages their tunics and gowns and cloaks were a dazzling confusion of colors red blue gold even some hues he couldnt name and despite the white elfs uneasiness not all those folks were human in one block alone kevin saw two haughty elegant white elves stride arrogantly by acting as though humans didnt even exist a couple of more relaxed people whose notquite human features and ever so slightly pointed ears revealed them as halfelven three hulking guards who almost certainly were nearly fullblooded ogres even a pair of arachnia dressed in priestly robes chittering together in a language that seemed made up only of consonants rows of shops lined the street and the air rang with the cries of merchants bawling out their wares in half a dozen dialects the bardling ached to examine the pile of scrolls one dealer offered or the harps and lutes hanging in another booth but he didnt dare let the rest of his party get too far ahead hed never be able to find them again in this crowd it stinks eliathanis muttered well maybe it did of animal and cooking oil and too many people of all sorts crowded in together but overwhelmed by wonder as he was kevin hardly minded lydia unerringly led the way to a livery stable a wellkept place warm with the friendly smells of horses and hay smells better than the city the white elf muttered stop complaining as kevin dismounted the woman asked in an undertone before we start spending you do have the bribe money with you dont you the bardling started to pat the purse count volmar had given him but lydia caught his hand in an angry grip dont be a fool you want to bring every thief in town down on us stung he straightened i am not a fool but lydia bargaining with the stablekeep ignored him only after she was finished and she and the stolid man had shaken on the deal did she turn back to kevin i dont like the idea of you wandering around without a weapon the first thing we do kid is get you a new sword she glanced at the elves well be back as soon as we can okay they nodded lydia grinned come on kevin as they stepped back out onto the streets of westerin the bardling was overwhelmedand this time not by wonderwhile hed been up on a horses back hed been raised up out of the worst of it but now the crowd surrounded him like a noisy smelly ocean trying to drown him this way lydia called and he struggled after her after the first few excuse mes and pardon mes kevin gave up and pushed and shoved his way like everybody else elbows jabbing his ribs and feet tromping on his toescity life might be exciting but he guessed it wasnt so glamorous after all looks like a likely place lydia noted kevin frowned puzzled the only indication that this might be a weaponry shop was the sign creaking back and forth over the door roughly painted with a weatherworn picture of crossed swords ah of course with all the different races in westerin who knew how many of them could actually read the common tongue or read at all but anyone could figure out what a simple picture meant he followed lydia inside and found himself in a small crowded room facing a counter piled with a staggering variety of knives behind the counter a curtained doorway presumably led to a storeroom and axes and swords and the occasional shieldits surface left blank so it could be painted with a customers coatofarmscovered most of the walls what can i do for ya a rough but undeniably female voice asked kevin jumped he could have sworn the room was empty except for lydia and himself down here boy he looked the look became a stare a woman she most certainly was but one who barely came to his waistand who was definitely not of humankind buxom and brawny she was almost as wide around as she was tall but kevin suspected that little of that roundness was fat her flat highcheekboned face was no longer young and gray streaked the red braids coiled in an intricate knot on her head but she looked about as fragile as a boulder im grakka owner of this place the woman stopped with an amused snort whats the matter boy never seen a dwarf before i uh no i mean yes i mean one of your race stopped in bracklin once mymy village but he was axx and all the songs say that dwarves only come in one kind male she gave a sharp bark of a laugh whered ya think we came from jumped up outa rocks all fullgrown bah humans ya come to gawk boy or to buy to buy lydia said the kid needs a new weapon kevin shook the fragments of the broken sword out of the scabbard can you fix this what dya take me for a miracleworker grakka lifted the broken blade to the light squinting along its length piece a junk a count gave it to me then his armorers been cheating him she pulled aside the curtain yelling into the back of the store elli yo elli wake up girl we got customers get me the rack of onehandersyeah thats the one a slightly smaller figure staggered out with an armload of swords which she dropped on the counter with a clatter kevin stared all over again but this time in appreciation elli was almost certainly grakkas daughter but even though the bardling couldnt deny she was almost as squat and powerfully built as her mother she was still as pretty in her own nonhuman way as any girl in bracklin her eyes were big and blue sparkling with mischief as she looked at him her nose was pertly upturned and her long yellow braids curved smoothly down her simple blue tunic and skirt and the curves of her buxom young body in a way that made kevin swallow hard he froze in panic as she swayed that curvy body to his side im elli but you already know that whats your name iiim uh kevin uhkevin she teased nno just kevin thats a nice name she fixed her big blue eyes on his face do you think my name is nice too i elli her mother snapped stop bothering the boy you boy come here elli flounced away pouting deliriously sheepishly kevin went up to the counter here grakka said shortly try this kevin looked at the sword in dismay its so plain grakka finished pretty never won battles go ahead try it out kevin took a few practice swings then tried an experimental pass or two he straightened smiling i like it it feels right good because from what your warrior buddy here tells me theres no time to design a sword specially for you she gave him a speculative glance too bad its always a challenge to make a sword thatll be useful for a reasonable while for you younglings who are still changing build almost every day grakka shrugged ah well some other time thatll be five gold crowns five go wait outside lydia murmured to him ill take care of this kevin knew that an adventurer as professional as lydia would know how to bargain much better than someone from a small town but that didnt stop him from feeling a surge of annoyance at being sent away like a little boy hi kevin a voice purred uh hi elli she smiled up at him as brightly as a sunny day i have to spend all my time in this dull old place i never get to go anywhere but an adventurer like you must have seen all kinds of wonderful things westerin rfaff i uh kevin wasnt about to confess the truth about bracklin and his drab life to this lovely creature sure why dont we sit down he patted a bench along the wall and ill tell you all about them maybe this wasnt going to be such a painful wait after all kevin began weaving a tale of bardic wonder about his adventures in count volmars casde and on the road to westerin as elli stared at him adoringly he turned the skirmish with the bandits into epic adventure spinning it out until he and his party had overcome a whole army of outlaws why thats wonderful elli breathed edging closer to him she was he discovered wearing some sort of sweet flowery perfume a heady scent warily he let his hand slide towards her and felt a shock race through him when her own small hand rough with work but delicate all the same closed about his fingers breathless the bardling sat frozen not daring to move wondering what would happen if he tried to put an arm around her about him the bustle of westerin seemed as distant and remote as a dream kevin nearly yelped when lydia tapped him on the shoulder wake up lover boy heres your sword blushing kevin released ellis hand and scrambled to his feet you owe grakka two gold crowns four silver lydia continued blandly and you erri thats elli the dwarf girl said indignantly whatever your mothers calling you heres the money we owe her now scoot elli scuttled into the shop but she paused just long enough in the doorway to blow kevin a kiss lydia chuckled pretty isnt she cant be a day over fifty fifty young for a dwarf momma grakka has to be pushing a hundred if not more yup little ellis got to be fifty all right just about the dwarven age of puberty hot for marriage too or ah whatever grakka has her hands full she glanced at kevin who was still staring towards the weapons shop and chuckled anew forget it kid these humanother romances never work out besides in a few more years sweet little elli is gonna be all grown up and look just like her tough old momma oh well the bardling sighed disillusioned come on kevin the elves must be bored out of their minds and who knows what mischief tichkis working what tichki had been doing was trying to teach the two elves how to play cards she had already it turned out won one nights free lodging for their horses from the stablekeep never even noticed the cards were marked eh lydia murmured wryly and dont give me that innocent little me look either my dear i know you far too well lets get out of here before we wind up in prison if anything the crowds seemed to have gotten worse as the day progressed kevin one hand on his new sword the other on his purse struggled his way along beginning to long for the nice peaceful open countryside all at once a particularly rough body barreled into him hey the bardling yelled why dont you watch where a second man hurtled into him nearly sending the bardling sprawling for one horrifying moment he was sure he was going to go down and be trampled by the heedless crowd but then naitachals hand closed about his arm pulling him back to his feet the dark elf gestured the whole party into an alcove where they could be out of the stream of traffic are you all right yes i kevin broke off abruptly something didnt feel quite right wait a minute oh no oh no this couldnt be the bardling searched himself frantically then cried in panic its gone the purse count volmar gave me is gone chapter x oh hell lydia muttered i knew this was going to happen that man kevin gasped out the one who jostled mehe must have stolen my money we have to have to what do you see him anywhere no but the guard did you see his face no can you tell them anything about what he looks like no lydia let out her breath in a gusty sigh give it up boy the moneys gone but kevin struggled to keep his voice from shaking from sheer panic all about him the city continued its busy life not caring whether he lived or died and he had nothing left but the few small coins in his own purse they werent enough to let him survive let alone bribe anyone hed failed the count worse hed failed charina hopelessly the bardling asked what are we going to do well we cant do anything without money thats for sure lydia said brusquely then its foolish to remain here eliathanis pulled his cloak about himself adjusting his hood with fastidious care i said we should never have come to westerin but weve wasted enough time i am going to do what i should have done from the start and explore on my own no kevin cried you cant abandon but the white elf had already vanished into the crowds the team the bardling finished helplessly naitachal you cant leave too no the dark elfs eyes glinted from beneath his hood cool and unreadable as blue ice there is more to be learned here if im not burdened with anyone else butwait kevin whirled to lydia i suppose youre going to go off on your own too hell no i dont abandon the helpless remember all at once she grinned hey cheer up kid its not so bad not so bad we dont have any money ive been stuck penniless in cities before some of them a lot nastier to strangers than this one and ive always managed to land on my feet let me think a minute ha yes tichki what do you think of this she murmured in the fairys eartichki laughed and yanked a lock of the womans hairah yes of course all right then come on kevin where are we going she didnt answer kevin struggling to keep up with the woman who was knifing her way skillfully through the crowd hardly noticed the buzz of fairy wings in his ear but he did notice tough little fingers snatching the pouch holding his last few coins hey tichki give that back the fairy ignored him dropping the pouch into lydias hands kevin hurried after her lydia come back here where are you going what are youlydia he stopped staring up at the building blocking his path where in the world a temple oh yes such an overblown stone and plaster monstrosity couldnt be anything but a temple kevin glanced briefly up at the busy brightly painted facade over the door was an ornately carved and gilded relief of a very smug group of merchants kneeling in prayer praying to whom in this city the bardling thought drily it could only be the great god money ach no that wasnt nice besides the last thing he could afford right now was getting heavenly powers angry at him tichki didnt have any such qualms she vanished into the temple with such an evil titter that kevin stared after her particularly when lydia chuckled and followed oh powers theyre going to rob the temple i know it how can i possibly stop them before but lydia strode boldly down the length of the vast inner chamber without pause her boot heels clicking on the smooth stone floor ignoring the busy religious murals on walls and columns at least kevin assumed they were religious murals ignoring the few worshippers and the gaudy gilded shrine the bardling still couldnt figure out to whom the temple was sacred she pulled aside a curtain shrouding the far wall revealing a tiny door the woman rapped on it three times then two then three again and kevin cried in sudden comprehension youve been here before lydia grinned the boys a genius how do you think i found the livery stable and grakkas shop so easily oh feeling exceedingly stupid the bardling muttered of course the door swung open soundlessly come on kid lydia saidchurches are always where the money is lets go kevin warily followed her down a short flight of stairs he paused halfway down glancing about the room at the bottom of the steps was small and windowless but elegant enough with walls and tables of sleekly polished wood it was full of people sitting at or standing around those tables some of them so richly or gaudilyclad the bardlings eyebrows rose in surprise the only sounds were the faint rustle of cards the clink of coins and an occasional sigh or smothered oath this is a gambling house kevin exclaimed feeling a wicked little thrill of excitement run through him they hardly had this sort of thing back in bracklin lydia what do you think youre doing earning us some funds bbut those are the only coins weve got left if you lose them lydia shrugged whatever the fates decree as a man threw down his hand and stalked off in disgust the woman flopped down onto the vacant chair whats the game no one even glanced up fivecard tarot someone muttered pentacles wild fine to kevins horror she dumped all his coins out on the table in front other im in the bardling had no idea what the rules of fivecard tarot might be hed never even heard of the game before chewing anxiously on his lower lip he watched as lydia thoughtfully kept or discarded the brightly colored cards or glanced every now and then at her equally pensive fellow players three middleaged human men and an elven halfblood of indeterminate age and gender with each round the bardling saw with a shudder more and more of his precious coins were added to the pot im out one of the humans muttered suddenly throwing down his cards and leaving the others never even noticed after another hand me too said the halfelf with a shrug vanishing into the crowd lydia and the two remaining men never flickered an eyelash one of the men kevin noted was a bushybearded fellow in somber red robes while the other was a thin cleanshaven man smooth of skin and dressed in an elegant tunic of blue velvet but they were alike in their impassive concentration the game went on cards being selected discarded the pile of coins in the center of the table grew ever larger if she loses now the bardling thought with a shudder well have nothing left but without warning lydia threw down her hand with a cry of triumph there be at that kevin saw that the cards shed been holding were the king queen knight and page of swords and the five of wands it was obviously a good hand because bushy beard and smooth skin threw down their cards in disgust smiling sweetly lydia raked in the pot come on kevin whispered weve got our money back lets get out of here are you joking she whispered back thats not enough to bribe anyone besides ive just begun what do you mean lydia if you lose im not going to loseall right gentlemen the woman added in a bright voice shall we try one more time bushy beard and smooth skin grumbled but to kevins horror they agreed this time as the winner of the last round lydia was the dealer sending the cards flashing out in neat colorful piles to the other players same stakes same stakes they muttered almost as one shes going to lose i know shes going to lose we wont have a coin left andoh i knew it bushy beard impassively raked in his winnings lydia kevin whispered frantically thats enough lets get out of here while we still have something left hush one more round gentlemen smooth skin nodded bushy beard fingering his winnings was slower to agree all right he muttered at last lydia smiled but weve been playing a kids game so far how about some real risks eh major arcana and double stakes this rime and winner takes all both men hesitated this time then bushy beard shrugged why not what about you my friend lydia crooned smooth skin sighed all right but just this one hand i have other engagements well try not to keep you too long lydia said drily fuming and terrified kevin watched bushy beard shuffle the entire deck this time major and minor arcana together and deal out the brighthued cards fists clenched he watched lydia thoughtfully pick up then discard card after card her face a studious blank raise she said after a while pushing a few coins towards the center of the table raise echoed smooth skin doing the same bushy beard hesitated a long time but at last added his share of coins the game went on and on each time it was lydias turn she studied her cards for a time then called out raise thats the last of our winnings kevin realized if she loses this hand well be beggared it was smooth skin who hesitated this time hand toying with the coins in front of him raise he said at last bushy beard swore under his breath too rich for me he muttered throwing down his cards and stalking away lydia smiled show em she said smooth skin showed his teeth in a sharp grin beat this he held the emperor the empress the fool the knight of swords and the five of wands interesting lydias voice was grim shes lost i know shes lost were lost but then the womans gloomy face broke into a grin what a shame you didnt have another major arcana card beatllis her hand held the magician the hanged man the sun the tower and the lovers all major arcana cards does that mean it did with a snarl smooth skin got to his feet and stormed off leaving lydia to rake in the entire pot now can we please get out of here kevin asked sure smooth skin was going to return with thugs hey kid know when to quit lydia paused just long enough to make the bardlings heart race then grinned and now my friend is definitely the time only when they were outside and halfway down the block did it occur to kevin that he hadnt seen tichki since theyd entered the temple as though just thinking of her was enough to conjure her up the fairy suddenly appeared at his side wings fluttering grinning her feral grin and waving a colorful piece of parchment wait a minute kevin said thats a tarot card two points to the clever lad with the lute butlet me see that the bardling snatched the card from tichkis hand before she could dart away this is one of the cards from the deck lydia was using its the high priestess one of the major arha no wonder that man couldnt get all the major arcana cards lydia you were cheating shh you want the guards after us butbutyou were you and tichki were in it together werent you what did you do tichki use fairy magic so no one would notice you thats it isnt it you looked at the other players hands and slipped lydia the right cardsyou were both cheating lydia stopped placing her hands firmly on the bardlings shoulders she told him my naive young friend what did you think the others were doing hell boy we were all cheating i realized that from the first hand i just cheated better thats all grinning she released him you know who those two men were the fellow with the beardwell i dont remember his name its been a while but he is a very successful gem merchant the other one the beardless guy hasnt changed much at all his name is selden and he sits on the city council neither one of them are going to miss what we took from them you stole from a city official hes not going to let anyone know he waslets see how does the formal term goparticipating in an illicit gambling operation come on kevin smile weve got our funding back and more now lets go bribe ourselves somebody useful but just then an angry voice shouted there she is thats the woman who robbed me guards after her oh right kevin said sarcastically hes not going to let anyone know and then he and lydia were running for their lives chapter xi as the guards charged tichki leaped straight up into the air wings a blur see you later she darted off at top speed as kevin and lydia raced through the crowded streets of westerin weaving in and out of knots of people the guards heavy footsteps pounding behind them the air rang with cries of thieves stop them but no one even tried to block their path of course not kevin realized nobody wants to risk getting involved this way lydia gasped pointing to a narrow alley but kevin stumbled to a stop staring in there the place stank it was filthy with piles of garbage and who knew what else worse it also looked like a dead end he almost hesitated too long got him a guard yelled a rough hand grabbed at the bardlings arm nearly pulling the lute from his back kevin kicked out savagely and heard a grunt of pain the guard lost his hold and the bardling dove into the alley wonderful now rveassatiuedacitygtwrdjuwcmder trying not to breathe too deeply he raced after lydia struggling to keep his footing on the slippery muddy earth telling himself the puddles he couldnt help splashing through were water only water none of it seemed to bother the guards they came pounding after him swearing armor and weapons dashing as they ran kevin lydia whispered snatching at him where did she think she was going that didnt even qualify as an alley it was only aa crevice a space where the backs of two buildings didnt quite meet come on kevin well if she could fit the bardling hurried in after her trying not to let his lute bang against a wall how weird none of the houses in this area seemed to meet exactly and as a result there was a whole little maze of notquite alleys back here he hoped the woman knew where she was going because if she didnt they were going to wind up good and lost lydia stopped so suddenly kevin nearly crashed into her she held up a hand listening damn theyre still after us right they dont usually follow anyone in here must be an election year the woman shrugged well have to try something else she started off again kevin who had just barely caught his breath groaned and followed they suddenly came out into a wider way the back alley of a street of shops the bardling noticed the rickety piles of storage crates and barrels and thought in sudden inspiration what if lydia wait he pointed she stared then grinned in comprehension youre catching on fast kid as the guards charged out into the alley they yelled to see their prey standing as if winded leaning helplessly against a wail there they are take them but the boy kicked at a crate and the woman at a barrel and a whole avalanche of crates and barrels came thundering down nearly burying the guards and totally blocking the alley that does it lydia crowed lets get out of here before they can dig themselves out the small open square might have been grand at one rime but westerin had grown out and away from it long years back now it was a shabby little place cobblestones cracked and broken where they hadnt been stolen outright in the center of the square stood a fountain so chipped and worn kevin guessed water hadnt flowed in it since westerin had been founded its rim made a fine place for two fugitives to sit and catch their breach no sign of the guards lydia said after a time guess they finally lost us what do you suppose happened to tichki lydia shrugged she can take care of herself no ones going to find a fairy who doesnt want to be found she glanced at kevin that idea with the barrels was pretty clever howd you think of it i didnt the bardling confessed i remembered it from an adventure ballad ha looks like musics good for something more than just pretty notes oh no he wasnt going to fall into her trap biting back his indignant reply kevin asked instead where are we lydia the woman glanced about pretty much where we want to be in theshall we say less elegant section of town the section that every city has where the guards dont go too often and never alone and where no one asks too many questions at his raised eyebrow the woman added jauntily just trying to talk like a proper bard i will not let her bait me in other words were in the slums exactly just the spot for a few carefully placed bribes here of course here you dont find the weasels and rats we need in palaces whats to keep those rats from calling the guards lydia laughed the kind of folks were going to meet are hardly going to be on the best of terms with guards theyre not going to call em down on us sure just like that city official wouldnt huh this adventures turning you too cynical kid come on lets go rathunting the first tavern was small and crowded and stank of stale beer and staler humanity but at least kevin thought warily the men inside looked reasonably normal sweaty thickset laborers and dock workers whod stopped in for a quick drink lydia shook her head in disapproval this wont do too honest come on the second tavern hid in the basement of a halfcollapsed tenement it was so dark in there that for one nervous moment kevin poised on the top of a short rickety stairway couldnt see anything at all as his eyes adjusted to the gloom he swallowed drily this cluster of men and notquite humans lurking down there in the shadows couldnt have had anything honest to them at all better muttered lydia her busy eyes checking out the clientele and scouring out possible escape routes at the same time stay here she moved easily through the crowd stopping a moment here to ask a question or two slapping away a roving hand there never losing her smile or her patience after what seemed an eternity to the bardling lydia returned to kevins side three invitations to ah bed two to sic and party a while one to buy you she grinned at his outrage but no useful information besides the woman added teasingly the price for you wasnt nearly high enough she scurried out before he could find an answer the third tavern was almost as murky the furnishings consisted only of a few splintery tables and chairs and the thin layer of sawdust covering the floor was sticky with what kevin prayed was only beer the customers were an ugly lot quite literally hunched over their drinks like so many bitter predators making the crowd in the last place look almost wholesome not a one of them showed the slightest interest in kidnappers or a missing noblewoman but before lydia and kevin could leave a hulk of a man big and ugly enough to be almost all ogrelurched to his feet and staggered towards lydia hllo bootful come n have uh drink some other time handsome i said have uh drink and i said some other time as she turned to leave the man caught her arm in a meaty hand you aint goin nowhere bootful lydia sighed they never learn she murmured before the bardling could even start to move the woman whirled on her captor knee shooting up with devastating force and deadly accuracy as the man doubled over in speechless agony lydia pulled free and smiled sweetly at kevin fluttering her eyelashes at him shall we leave she asked the bardling glanced warily around the room no one seemed to have noticed what had just happened even so he had to fight the urge to back out of there hand on sword hilt once they were safely outside on the street kevin exploded what in the name of all the powers did you think you were doing avoiding an unwanted drink butbut he might have been armed he might have killed you and the roof might have caved in on us all it didnt he didnt kevin credit me with enough wit to know when someones carrying weapons or is sober enough to be dangerous the poor idiot had it coming to him and i just hope his lessthanfriends back there dont slit his throat while hes helpless butyou look kid this son of thing happens all the time when you happen no be both a warrior and a woman well maybe it wouldnt happen so often if you just didnt dress soso so what kevin he shook his head miserably embarrassed wishing hed kept his mouth shut you know ah our little bardling is a prude i am nod but you go around asking for it is that what youre trying to say listen to me and listen well i am a woman in a mans world im not complaining thats just the way things are and as a woman sure i could wear a nice proper gown that restricted every step i took the sort of thing a lady wearsand get killed the first time i needed to move quickly i could wear full armor too always assuming i could afford the expensive stuffbut i spend a lot of my life on board ships people who wear full armor on ships tend to have really short lives if they fall overboard i uh never thought of that i realize that all at once lydia grinned besides when i do have trouble the fools are generally so busy looking at my ah endowments that they never see my knee or fist coming so now enough lecturing we still have some rathunting to do she strode boldly away kevin gulped and followed deciding that lydia wasnt as dumb as she looked she might be rough in manners and languagebut she certainly wasnt dumb at all kevin sank wearily to a bench hardly caring that the cheaply made thing creaked alarmingly and threatened to collapse how many taverns had it been now ten fifty a hundred by this point hed seen so many roughnecks so many weird ugly humans and others so much emptiness or depravity in so many eyes that he didnt think anything could shock him any more if death itself came up to this table the bardling mused listlessly hed probably just tell it to go have a nice day somewhere else lydia who in the course of their hunt had dealt with a halfdozen wouldbe suitors showed not the slightest sign of weariness well sure shes probably used to tavernhopping this is probably tame to her he looked down in dismay at the warm watery beer in the flagon before him at least he wasnt expected to finish the stuff how anyone could actually want to hey kid look who ive found lydia was returning pulling someone with her kevin stared an arachnia but clearly one that had fallen on hard times where dkrikas had been an elegant figure spotlessly dean dark chitin shining with health this being was downright shoddy its compound eyes lacking any trace of animation its tall body folded into a weary stoop chat left it no taller than the woman the gray cloak that seemed to be an arachnia trademark was worn and ragged so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed and the beings chitin was so dull and scaly kevin wondered if it was possible for an arachnia to have the mange lydia didnt seem to care slapping the arachnia on its back making the thin being stagger she said heartily this is what did you say your name was pal driksin the being murmured driksin lydia echoed sit you down here driksin my friend and have a drink with us she pushed the arachnia sat with a thump as though already too far gone to resist kevin glanced sharply at the woman wondering what was going on but she was busy flagging down a barmaid a bottle of mereot for my friends and me mereot turned out to be a dark red wine so sweet that kevin nearly gagged on his first sip he noticed that lydia wasnt drinking much other flagon either but driksin guzzled down the sweet stuff with undisguised delight good the being murmured have another pal on kevin here driksin clicked its beak in what was presumably an arachniad smile thank you friend it swilled down the second flagon almost as quickly as it had the first and clicked its beak with more abandon good stuff good friends not like some others someone betrayed you huh lydia leaned forward elbows on the table resting her head on her fists thats tough betrayed me the being echoed why dont you tell us all about it pal lydias voice oozed concern troubles are a lot lighter to bear when theyre shared the arachnia helped itself to more mereot its the kings fault driksin whined all his fault how so shouldnta supported himbig mistake no onell hire me cause they know i backed king amber huh that doesnt make sense they wont hire a supporter of the king but westerin is a crown city there cant be that many foes of king amber here lydia didnt seem to be bothered by the weird logic or lack of logic i know how it is she purred cant trust anybody can you here pal have some more mereot don min if i do driksin chittered an arachnia giggle show em show em all know something they dont know any of them none of the fine humans sure you do the arachnia straightened slightly do it insisted know all about the girl kevin tensed what girl hee hee the girl the one who was swiped course the daughter of that fool of a count charina driksin tried to shrug hampered by the lack of true shoulders eck whatever know who took her it paused staring at them with the idiot slyness of the truly drunk it was princess carlotta thats who thats impossible kevin snapped carlottas been dead for over thirty years no no no no thats what she wants everyone ta think dead dead dead whee sorceresses dont die not so easy not she driksin took another long swig of mereot then leaned forward as much as stiff chitin would allow whispering confidentially it was rebels took the girl rebels led by princess carlotta but why the arachnia chittered to itself then tried to pour itself another drink nothing happened it upended the bottle looking blearily inside empty it said sadly no more mereot for poor drikishdrishkin dtfffaw but lydia had already ordered a new bottle here pal drink up tell us why princess carlotta stole the girl driksin chittered and drank wheeee it laughed she wants to use the girl against king amber thats ridiculous kevin said charina may be count volmars niece but shes not all that important the arachnia blinked and leaned forward again studying the bardling closely kevin stared back trying not to flinch at this closeup view of the beings compound eyes youre the one was copyin the manshu manshithe book how would you knowow lydia had kicked him under the table she glared at the bardling warning him to keep quiet driksin continued heedless wanna know a secret bet you don know the stuff you were copyin had a spell hid in it the being nodded pleased with itself yup did it fell silent staring moodily into its flagon lydia asked very gently what kind of a spell pal chidden spell well yes she said with more patience than kevin would ever have believed we gathered that what fund of a hidden spell don think i should tell ya maybe you dont know maybe youre making this all up lydia folded her arms in pretend indignation a fine thing when you cant even trust a drinking buddy to tell the truth i am tellin the truth driksin whined not sure yunnerstand but rumor is its a spell to keep princess carlotta from changin shapecause if she did if the spell works shed be stuck in her true self forever n ever her true self kevin said warily sure dincha know shes not human not altogether naw shes more fairy n anythin else and shed be stuck as a fairy the arachnia chittered in laughter no way a fairy can sit the throne not legal gotta be a human you sure about that spell lydia asked eck who knows things never been tried never been tested might work might blow up in the users face the arachnia swayed in its seat i was there it said confidentially i was in the guard you know guard of count volmars daddy yup his daddy thats who it was count dalant saw the elves give the book to him to ole count dalant told him to keep it safe guess they figured if princess carlotta went lookin for the thing shed think the elves had it but why leave it with the counts father kevin asked driksin started to pour itself another flagon full then stopped blinking thoughtfully i member they said something bout it bein too dangerous to leave with anyone who could actly use the thing yeah just in case princess carlotta did think to look there yeah sright its keyed so only two folks can see it one of em a bard ardan aydan somethin like that the bardling tensed heart racingaidan yeah thats it itll only appear to him or to his suchsecshuchessorsuccessor the arachnia finished triumphantly wheeeee it added in glee and fell flat across the table so much for that lydia muttered she glanced up uh kevin i think wed better get out of here yes but now kevin startled at the urgency in her voice the bardling looked up oh six ugly things were peering through the gloomy tavern looking for something things kevin decided was definitely the word none of the six was truly human or a member of any other recognizable race except for their leader who was the most depravedlooking elf the bardling could ever have imagined pastyskinned and gaunt the mans fair white elf hair hung lankly to his shoulders and his green white elf eyes were flat and cold and empty kevin wondered what depravities could have so corrupted a creature of light and shuddered guess not everyone liked the idea of driksin talking to us lydia murmured you dont know theyre looking for us kevin whispered back just then the emptyeyed elf pointed their way and yelled something at the others all six started stalking forward radiating menace sending customers scrambling out of their way hell i dont lydia said drily chapter xii all right lydia said under her breath ive been in tighter fixes than this gotten out of them too follow my lead kevin ready here we go she stood up grabbed a customer at random and flattened him with one mighty punch the man staggered back into another table which collapsed spilling their drinks all over the men whod been sitting there hey watch it you stupid frticft frticft is it growled an ogre at the next tableim anfrticll you idiot humans he dove into the humans swinging wildly sending men and chairs flying for one shocked moment kevin froze then he realized exactly what lydia was doing and grabbed another man about to imitate her no no i nearly wrecked my hand the last time i tried to punch someone cant risk that again what to do the bardling snatched up a halfempty flagon instead and whapped the man soundly over the head mereot splashed all over a heavyset scaly whateveritwas at the next table the creature sprang up with a furious hiss only to collide with one of the men from the first table who was blindly throwing punches right and left the creature flattened him and went looking for other prey those customers who hadnt already taken cover found themselves caught in the middle of an evergrowing meleeand joined in with savage glee the emptyeyed elf and his men swore helplessly as the brawl engulfed them in a whirlwind of fists and bottles lydia standing safely out of the way gave a sharp laugh nothing like a good oldfashioned tavern brawl for a diversion come on kevin lets get out of here she slipped out through the tiny kitchen kevin close behind her struggling past harried servants who were heading out into the brawl armed with dubs and broom handles hey where had lydia gone out here the woman called and the bardling scrambled out the narrow window after her now you know why im always scouting for ways out of places come on lets put some distance between ourselves and those guys more running kevin thought wearily they made it all the way back to the shabby square the bardling sank gladly to the lip of the dry fountain panting the lute an awkward weight on his back he shifted it around in front of him leaning on it think were safe lydia straightened listening to nothing but silence she shrugged for the moment by the time old empty eyes fights his way out of that tavern our trails going to be cold we hope now what do we do look for the others i guess and there you are a shrill voice snapped kevin glanced up to see the fairy fluttering fiercely overhead hello tichki never mind hello tichki ive been flying all over the city where the hell were you two hunting rats lydia grinned learned a lot from them too the fairy landed lightly beside her and nearly got bit by them i see oh yes i heard all the fuss whats the matter the guards werent good enough for you robbing a councilman wasnt exciting enough ah youre a fine one to scold it wasnt me who set that inn on fire back in elegian an accident i never knew the spell would backfire like that or dropped the chamber pot on the mayors head in smithian the fairy grinned nearly tore a wing lifting the thing worth it though besides lydia added you know i didnt rob selden not exactly look tichki you were there it was a game of cards thats all he wasnt any more honest than me tell that to the guards the fairy glanced sharply from one human to the otheryou reek of excitement havent just been eluding guards have you uh no lydia admitted we seem to have gotten somebodys gang after us too huh and you tell me to keep out of trouble tell me just how do you plan to get out of westerin lydia shrugged well think of something we cant leave without the rest of our party kevin cut in sure but they could be anywhere theyre both still in the city tichki restlessly folded and refolded her wings wouldnt have left without their horses and those horses are still here i checked kevin straightened hands tightening on the lute casetichki youre friends with naitachal well all right all right maybe youre not friends but at least you two must have something in common i saw you doing those card tricks together whats this lydia asked eyebrow raised tichkis dusky skin flushed he asked me what was i supposed to do tell him he wasnt bright enough to learn teaching him tricks eh card tricks of course its true and was that all you were doing hmm lydia thats ridiculous look at the size of me hes more than twice my height why tichki arent your people wonderful shapechangers i should think you could be any size you want to be kevin stared from lydia to tichki i dont understand you two weve got all sorts of people out to get ushow can you possibly waste time inin banter they both looked at him in surprise lydia shook her head would anything be changed if we acted like scared little kids no but morale kevin got to keep up morale just as she added slyly tichki was keeping naitachals morale up cornered the fairy took to the air still blushing she yelled down you know i dont date outside my species since when are elves and fairies separate all right all right ill go look for him you stay here as the fairy darted up and away lydia murmured a bemused card tricks thats all it was really kevin said oh i figured that but how often do i get a chance to rib a fairy all at once she frowned eh i know i said something about keeping up morale but this hardly seems the time for a song why are you taking out your lute im going to try something kevin paused one hand caressing the polished wood i only hope it works what are you talking about theres a song thats supposed to draw someone you know to you im going to try it on eliathanis you dont exactly know him well no but hes an elf after all even if i cant manage the whole force of bardic magic he should have enough innate magic to sense something always assuming he wants to listen if the song works properly he uh wont have a choice lydia raised an eyebrow only hope you dont call up empty eye from the gang as well hes an elf too more or less she added in distaste oh well kevin hadnt thought of that it should work only on eliathanis i hope bending over the lute the bardling tuned it carefully then took a deep breach and began his song trying to picture the white elf and only the white elf hearing the coaxing strains soar out and out the bardling came back to himself with a start startled to realize he didnt know how much time had passed it must have been quite a while because his fingers were weary and his throat was dry what naitachal the dark elf bowed wryly surprised to see me returning was the only way i could get that fairy to stop pestering me huh tichki said indignantly you were the one who kept asking me questions and you were the one who wouldnt answer any of them naitachal grinned i confess tichki kept after me till shed roused my curiosity im sure lydia murmured kevin nearly choked but then the urge to laugh faded as he realized i guess my song didnt work oh it did an angry voice snapped and the bardling shot to his feet it did indeed eliathanis you just would not stop pulling at my mind i was in the middle of learning some important information and you whats this tichki wondered fluttering around the white elf youre such a fairhaired fellow what are red hairs doing on your shoulder never mind that eliathanis hastily brushed them from him mmm and whats this she sniffed audibly you taken to wearing perfume elf no his fair skin reddened iti oh you were learning something all right the fairy taunted and im sure it was pretty important too maybe nothing to do with the stolen girl but i was talking to a troop of dancing girls the white elf said with immense dignity struggling to ignore lydias delighted whoop he continued they travel all over the country i thought they might know charinas whereabouts and they really hated talking to such a pretty fellow tichki teased then darted sideways in the air as eliathanis his face a fiery red by now took a swipe at her you never will catch me like that elf she mocked cant you be serious for even a moment now now eliathanis naitachals voice was studiously serious but his eyes glinted under the black hood seems to me youre hardly the one to accuse anyone else of frivolity tsk should have known there was something warmer than ice under that grim facade dont you dare criticize me necromancer oh for powers sakes lydia cried you two arent going to start that again are you what do you expect of elves tichki laughed theyre almost as bad as humans hey whose side are you on fairy my own of course eliathanis frowned at lydia woman i dont need to be defended from the likes of her this is getting out of hand kevin knew if we dont work everything out now were going to wind up in prison or dead kevin licked his dry lips thinking feverishly maybe he hadnt acted like a leader up to now maybe that was because he had been trying too hard to imitate the leaders in the heroic songs those miracles of bravery who were gifted with unfailing charisma well that was nonsense the boy who had left bracklin might never have accepted it but he was no longer so naive such marvelous infallible heroes like that could never have existedbut those like master aidan most certainly did master aidan and those other good sensible downtoearth people whod saved king amber people who tried to understand those they were supposed to lead who brought them together and got them to concentrate only on their goal all right kevin began nobody noticed i said right as the others turned to him he added sternly arent you ashamed of yourselves did you really mean to rob count volmar ha that made them start what do you mean eliathanis asked coldly i am not a thief no you certainly arent earning your keep you were hired to rescue the lady charinanot to fight with each other but bickering seems to be all you can do now kevin lydia began thats hardly fair let me finish he glared at them all you eliathanis and you naitachal i know there are long hatreds between white and dark elves know those hatreds go back for generations i dont expect either one of you to settle such ancient grudges overnight i dont even ask you to try but i dont think elves of either race had anything to do with the kidnapping and if you really mean to show your peoples innocence the way you boasted you had better stop fighting and show some of that famous elvish selfcontrol or is that just a myth to make humans respect you its not naitachal said shortly and you do have a point bardling tichki snickered such a daring boy and you kevins finger stabbed at her with such fervor that she flinched youve done nothing so far but snipe at everyone elsei dont care about your background i dont care what unhappiness youre trying to hide im not she protested but i m beginning to wonder if youre in the pay of the enemy the fairy froze in midair i most certainly am not then stop acting like it lydia cleared her throat dont you think thats going a bit far kid kevin whirled to her and as for you lydia look i know im young i know that compared to you im as ignorant of the world as they come but one thing i am not is an idiot oh i never said but you think it and as long as you go on thinking it youre not letting me do my job which is the same as all of us freeing charina they were getting restless these werent naughty children after all if he didnt change his tone kevin realized he was going to lose them listen to me the bardling pitched his voice as smoothly as ever hed been taught lydia and i learned something truly alarming something that makes all our quarrelling the petty thing it is carlotta is alive the sorceress eliathanis exclaimed but thats impossible everyone knows she died years ago so we were led to think carlotta i repeat is very much alive and you and i know there is nothing she would like better than to discredit king ambers reign kevin look a deep breath stalling trying to figure out what he was going to say next look you we all know theres always been an undercurrent of uneasiness of mistrust between the different races in the realm thats not so surprising it may not be logical but elf or human we fear the unknown and if that unknown takes the form of someone with a different shade of skin he glanced at naitachal or a different way of life this time his glance took in lydia well its all too easy to let fear turn to hate true enough muttered the dark elf and eliathanis nodded but for thirty years the bardling continued those different races have managed to live in peace and why is that because king amber has been such a just impartial ruler this time it was lydia who nodded well carlotta doesnt like that kevin said the more popular a ruler her brother becomes the more difficult its going to be for her to replace him she tried to kill him once before we all know that we also know how she failed but carlotta has had thirty years to think things over i guess shes decided to be more devious the bardling paused to catch his breath glancing at the others they were watching him quite seriously even tichki showed no sign other usual mockery carlotta has to know exactly how things stand between the races kevin continued what better way for her to destroy king ambers reign than to use a kidnapping to stir up all that latent hatred once the land is torn by strife what better way for her to seize control could be tichki muttered not could be kevin corrected will be if we dont do something to stop her why us lydia asked why indeed he couldnt blame the womanwho after all was a mercenary not a subject of the king for asking but before kevin could find a good argument naitachal said thoughtfully i believe i can guess why carlotta would choose count volmars niece to kidnap his father was a true diplomat he was eliathanis agreed someone who tried his best to reconcile grievances among the races but count volmar the dark elf continued is shall we say a bit less friendly towards both our races the white elf nodded wryly thats just it kevin exclaimed carlotta knows about him she must thats why she kidnapped charina and thats why she made it look as if elves were to blame ha yes and she probably plans to plant hints in the counts earyou know that his handpicked team isnt having any success because the elves in the party are deliberately hindering the hunt because they dont really want to find charina yes lydia agreed but youre still not giving me a good reason to risk my neck these arent my people or my land after all no kevin admitted but if carlotta wins here do you think shes really going to stop with one realm shes a sorceress lydia who can muster the forces of darkness to her side but why us kevin how can we possibly make a difference ah well because of the manuscript im sorry master aidan but i dont dare keep it a secret any longer hastily kevin told the others the reason hed come to count volmars castleand what hed learned about that manuscript you mean carlotta is part fairy tichki yelped her mother mated with a human so it seems bbut thats disgusting thank you lydia gave the fairy a sarcastic bow kevin go on tell us more about this manuscript my master must have realized carlotta had returned then why didnt he go straight to the king he didnt dare thinking it out as he spoke kevin added not while carlotta had her full powers anyhow no that would be putting king amber in direct danger so he sent me after the spell you being expendable eh naitachal asked uh well i wouldnt put it quite that way but the kings life is more important of course eliathanis agreed a little more emphatically than kevin would have liked kevin what do you want us to do whathey theyre listening to me they really are ive won sure but what was he going to do about it i think were going to have to return to count volmars casde the bardling said slowly we have to retrieve that manuscript if carlottas people really do have charina they might be willing to trade her for it what no the white elf cried thats insane im not going to give them the real manuscript no no ill work up a forgery theyll surely know the difference naitachal argued they wont you see i had already started copying the manuscript before charina was kidnapped ill put a few pages of the real copy in with the fake and only carlotta will be able to tell the difference but by the time she learns the truth charina will be free yes and while were in the castle we can tell count volmar what weve learned who knows it just might force him to rethink how he feels about elves sooner force a stone to walk the dark elf murmured but its worth the attempt i agree eliathanis said lydia shrugged me toohey tichki you in the fairy shrugged why not now all we have to do is get out of the cityeasy theres only one gang out to get us and guards watching for us at every gate she grinned sharply if we can escape all that why anything else will be a laugh ha lydia said dourly interlude the third count volmar sat brooding before the fireplace in his solar chin resting on fisted hand how could things have gone so wrong so quickly as soon as that stupid bardling that kevin was safely gone from the castle the count had ordered the library emptied down to the bare stone walls under the guise of giving the place a good cleaning he had personally examined every volume no matter how useless or bizarre the contents by now the newly cleaned books gleamed in the newly cleaned library but volmar was willing to swear on every sacred relic that not one of the whole lot was the missing manuscript nobody took it it didnt walk out of there by itself there is no place in that library for the thing to be hiding then where is it not that it mattered none of his plans mattered not now not when carlotta was you idiot you utter idiot count volmar leaped back from his chair with a startled yell flattening himself against a wall staring in horror at this sudden apparition inin the seven holy names he began tracing holy signs in the air with a hand that shook i bid you begone oh stop that im not a ghost you cant exorcise me carlotta are you real of course im real the sorceress threw herself down in a chair in a swirl of green silk flaming red hair crackling in a cloud about her what nonsense are you spouting now i ththought you were dead volmar took a deep steadying breath carlotta i really did think you were dead returning to his chair he sat a little more abruptly than hed intended when your horse returned without you when the court sages all swore something terrible had happened something sorcerous bah well what did you expect me to think youre a sorceress dammit anything powerful enough to overcome you wasnt going to be content at stopping at a mere kidnapping i was sure youd been killed by a demon struggling for control the count continued if you had only deigned to share your plans with me you never would have been able to play your role so convincingly carlottas eyes glinted with scorn the boy never would have believed you this way there was genuine terror in your voice when you told him of poor little charinas disappearance but you were gone so long poor frightened little boy carlotta i didnt have time to hold your hand do you imagine it was easy to leave a false track halfway to westerin uh no i would think not ha you dont think theres the truth of it carlotta sprang to her feet green gown rippling about her as she paced how could you be so hopelessly totally stupid volmar nearly choked himself in the battle to keep from shouting back at herwhat do you mean he managed how could you choose that arachnia what arachnia surely the woman couldnt be referring to his seneschal driksin the count asked warily carlotta waved an impatient hand whatever it calls itself the arachnia in westerin ahyes coldness settled in volmars stomach choosing his words very carefully he began granted driksin isnt always the most reliable of my agents but reliable driksin is a drunken oaf well yes the creature does drink too much its a shame that alcohol affects the arachniad system as it does our own but driksin has never failed me before besides it was already in place in westerin it had its orders and and it ignored them completely yes yes carlotta added impatiently i was watching the whole thing with my magic that stupid drunken insect was supposed to lead the boy and his party away from this castle not towards it and it was not supposed to tell them anything about the manuscript volmar stared in disbelief was that a glint of uneasiness he saw in carlottas eyes or could it possibly even be fear just what strange magic was in that manuscript frustrating to have to rely only on one little scrying crystal oh yes the count knew it was as potent an artifact as someone with no innate magical ability could use but it was still such a maddeningly inferior thing hed only been able to guess at what driksin had been babbling something about a spell a fairy a fairy the count stiffened in sudden comprehension struggling to keep the shock from his face he thought of course no wonder carlotta had been in hiding for so many years once she had recovered her strength after the failed attempt on ambers life she would have sensed the existence of the magical manuscript ha how that must have alarmed her volmar supposed carlotta had been struggling to control the thing from afar terrified that if she came too close she would spark the magic into life and end everything for her and then nasty old master aidan decided to up the stakes as the gamblers say and send forth manuscript that forced you out of hiding carlotta didnt it imagine that all these years he had been wondering at carlottas uncanny precocious gift for sorcery when the answer had been so very obvious her mysterious unknown mother hadnt been human at all volmar only barely stifled a triumphant laughif news ever got out that the high and mighty princesssorceress wasnt truly human that she was half fairy the law stated quite firmly that no one of fairy blood could ever wear the crown if she were unmasked it would turn a sure thing into a very dicey proposition well now isnt that interesting ill keep your little secret carlotta after all if you fail i fail too but once she gained the throne once he sat beside her why then some changes would be made they would indeed carlotta was still pacing so restlessly volmar ached to order her to stand still you still havent found the manuscript she said without warning and he started dont look so surprised man i was watching you too all at once the sorceress did stop staring into the flames eyes fierce with impatience has to be somewhere in the library of course it does even if we cant see it there are such things as spells of hiding after all but what can be enchanted can be disenchanted with time and without interference such as that fool of a bardling will provide damn him we must keep him away from the casde but hes stuck in westerin volmar soothed my hirelings are hunting for him ha that gang of failures if theyre anything like your arachnia they probably cant find their own feet theres no way the boy can get out of that city the count said flatly if my men dont catch him hell wind up in prison or i dont believe that for a moment so far the boys had uncanny luck and theres no reason for things to be different now cant you ah remove him kill him you mean from this far away carlotta gave a fierce little laugh im not a goddess man no mortal can throw a deathspell that far besides she added thoughtfully im not sure i want him dead not quite yet not till i have rime to lay a proper trap for him one to catch both the boy and the manuscript yes she whirled to stare at the count eyes wide and radiant with a cold alien light you may watch this volmar but do not move from that spot do not utter one word on your life do not seek to interfere interfere with sorcery did she think him insane of course not the count said fervently what it was carlotta murmured volmar had no idea he wasnt even sure of the language but each precisely uttered syllable seemed to ring in his ears long after it was spoken seemed to prickle along his arms and ache in his bones till he longed to turn and run but that volmar knew would be the end of him so he stood and watched and endured and just barely kept from crying out his shock when the firelight all at once went hard and slick as ice or a mirror a mirror indeed though what it reflected not daring to move from where he stood volmar peered over carlottas shoulder to see a the figure of a man suddenly come into sharp focus seen as clearly as though through an open window now who no youngster thishe was a fully human manor at least appeared to besomewhere in late middle age his thickset powerful form halfhidden by the folds of a black cloak its hood nearly hid the severe harshly planed face and its graying beard the strangers eyes were gray too blazing out from the hoods shadow with sorcerous force but an ageless weariness was there as well as though volmar thought uneasily their owner had tried and been bored by every depravity known to humanity whoever whatever he was the man plainly knew carlotta no warmth lightened the terrible eyes but he dipped his head almost reluctantly in reverence princess the words were faint but clear what would you you have not forgotten have you alatan you have not forgotten your debt to me the gray eyes flickered angrily no i have not the fools would have burned me as a sorcerer had you not intervened name what you would of me princess carlotta it shall be done it shall indeed the sorceress purred listen then she slipped back into the alien language with which shed created the flamemirror the language of sorcery volmar thought and wished with all his heart he was somewhere else but he didnt dare be squeamish not if he meant to sit beside carlotta on the throne as the sorceress continued to give her orders to the reluctantly obedient alatan count volmar forced himself to stand proudly as any king but once carlotta had banished the mirrorspell and the flames were nothing more than flames he let himself sag who is this alatan he dared ask anally willynilly he said you saved him from burning as a sorcerer volmar said it doubtfully charity hardly seemed pan of carlottas charactersomeone falsely accused him i take it carlottas smile was deceptively sweet oh no alatan is a sorcerer indeed a most powerful most unpleasant one poor kevin she added i find i almost pity him chapter xiii kevin sighed he and the rest of his group had been trying for what seemed like an age to find a gate out of westerin a gate that wasnt watched over either by the gang or the guards so far they hadnt succeeded after all this hunting his feet hurt his lute seemed to have picked up extra weight his stomach was clamoring for foodand now the night was coming on i think all we can do he said wearily as they regrouped in the small ruined square is find a place to spend the night and try to see if we cant figure out a way to get out of here in the morning good idea lydia grinned ruefully i can go all day on sea or land but these cobblestones are cursed hard on the feet it is going to look rather suspicious if we all march into an inn together naitachal pointed out were not exactly an ordinary mix of people thats no problem to me tichki laughed fluttering her wings all i need is a window and im in the same is true of naitachal and me eliathanis added we are elves not clumsy humans ill remind you of that the next time you trip over something lydia muttered i never the bardling held up a warning hand first we find an inn then we quarrel that got grudging chuckles from everyone well what do you know the pleased kevin told himself maybe i am starting to get the knack of being a leader but before he could congratulate himself too much a shout from the far side of the square made them all start and whirl ohno not now well well murmured lydia look who found us its the gang of things ugly arent they tichki mocked bet they make even uglier corpses kevin couldnt be so casual about it somewhere along the way empty eyes had picked up a few more supporters there are ten of them he pointed out to lydia and tichki and only five of us they are also the warrior woman reminded kevin nicely within bowshot she nocked arrow to bow in one swift fluid movement come on lydia taunted the enemy come and die you have only the one bow woman empty eyes purred and i have some tricks of my own faster than a striking snake he thrust out his hand shouting out a savage word of power lydia cried out in shock as her bowstring snapped in two thats better empty eyes said take them kevin had barely enough time to whip out his sword before the gang was upon them theyve got swords a startled part of his mind noted whats a street gang doing with something as expensive as swords they had to be in someones pay selden no he had the guards at his beck and call then who no time to worry about it ten against five was terrible odds no matter what lydia and tichki thought naitachal had summoned up his sorcerous black blade againbut empty eyes only laughed moving to counter its attack with a dead gray blade of his own naitachals eyes widened in surprise and the other elf laughed anew thats right dark elf some of us have played with sorcery too kevin lost the rest of chat conversation as a sinuous being that seemed some unholy cross of man and snake lunged at him sword in scaly hand the bardling parried twohanded just in time the shock of impact shivering all the way up to his shoulders he staggered back closely followed by his foe who moved every bit as fluidly and unpredictably as a serpent i dont know what style of fencing hes using iive never seen it before and i dont know how kevins frantic thought ended in a gasp as he came up hard against the rim of the fountain the being grinned at him a flash of alarmingly sharp fangs and lunged yet again trapped kevin did the only thing he could and leaped up onto the rim slashing down at the being who was cutting savagely at his legs suddenly inspired kevin sprang aside and down into he wide basin of the fountain just as the being lunged the creatures blade danged harshly against stone and kevin remembering the bandit back in the rocky gorge hastily brought his foot down on the flat of the blade as hard as he could there was a gratifying snap the being hissedhis tongue narrow and forked as that of a snakeand hurled the broken sword at kevins head the bardling ducked tripped over rubble in the basin and went flat narrowly missing cracking his skull against stone before he could catch his breath the being came hurling down at him the bardling grabbed a sinuous wrist slippery with scales and kicked upward the being went flying over kevins head landing with a crash on the cobblestones the bardling scrambled out of the fountain thinking in delighted wonder hey that really does work he wound up just behind the grim naitachal and empty eyes even as the dark elf countered a vicious cut at his head as sorcerous black and gray blades clashed together fountains of blood red sparks flew up casting an eerie fiery glow over the square sorcerous games naitachal panted some of us havent let those games destroy our souls souls empty eyes taunted what are human things like souls for such as we you are not like me you pathetic thing you whove forgotten your own kind no more than you dark elf empty eyes retorted and lunged once more fiery sparks lit up the square kevin glanced up at the surrounding houses didnt anyone hear or see what was going on didnt anyone care someone did from one side came the sound of running footsteps and the dashing of mail oh hell lydia said just what we needed the guards come on guys no time for heroics now lets get out of here the gang equally illegal thought the same thing scattering in all directions empty eyes panting paused long enough to hurl his gray sword at naitachal but the dark elf struck it cleanly with his black blade both sorcerous things blazed up in a blinding surge of bloody light and were gone oh blast kevin thought why was i looking that way just then vision dazzled afterimages dancing before his eyes kevin staggered away as best he could stumbling over the broken cobblestones he gasped when someone grabbed his arm and tried to strike out but a familiar voice said its me lydia its all right kid i had my head turned away i can still see where im going unfortunately so could the guards and a whole troop of them was flooding into the square weapons drawn far too many to fight damn lydia muttered selden really is out for blood no worse damage to a politician than injured pride she looked over the grim wellarmed troop and sighed i hate to simply surrender particularly since selden isnt going to make things comfortable for us but then dont tichki snapped hovering in midair wings a blur she stared at the guards shouting out twisting intricate commanding words in the fairy tongue her eyes blazing green fire and to kevins amazement the guards stopped in their tracks blinking in confusion whered they go coulda sworn they were here a minute ago who who are we looking for dont know cant remember hey come on guys days not getting any younger and we have a city to cover with that the guards turned and marched away i dont believe it the bardling gasped tichki what did youtichki she came tumbling down into his arms pantingfor a moment kevin gingerly held her small body astonished at how light she was even for her small size of course shes light he realized tichkis a winged creature she has to be lightweight if shes going to get off the ground probably has hollow bones like a bird or a sudden sharp stab in his arm made kevin gasp and drop her the fairy whod pinched him with her hard little fingers fluttered away grinning in mischief even though her eyes were weary hoodoo that i dont mind telling you was hard work what was that lydia asked that influencetheirminds spell of yours tichki nodded you know it and you know the thing works sure if you can get enough force into it for once tichki didnt argue right its not the sort of thing i want to do too often but then her sharp grin returned its so much easier lifting purses im sure thats true eliathanis cut in coolly but rather than discuss thieving triumphs dont you think we had best find shelter before one or another of our enemies returns excellent idea lydia said with a wry little bow i need to repair my bowstring anyhow curse that filthy excuse for an elf eliathanis stiffened indignantly plainly torn between the evidence of his own eyes and his refusal to accept that one of his people could sink so low have you any idea where we should be heading yup lydia pointed north guysthe inns called the flying swan youll know it by the sign innkeeper doesnt ask awkward questions of his guests and keeps the beds verminfree what more could we possibly want naitachal asked wryly lydia shrugged kevin and i will register as she glanced the bardlings way mischief in her eyes as friends good friends very good friends right my lover boy she grinned as he reddened and took his arm see you later everyone ah well the bardling told himself resolutely let her have her fun not much you can do to stop her anyhow lydias teasing aside it would be wonderful to be in a nice dean room again with a nice hot meal and maybe evenoh miracle of miraclesa soft bed chapter xiv a halfturn of the hourglass later kevin wasnt feeling quite so smug lydia the bardlings cloak draped not quite concealingly about herself and her scanty garb was clinging to his arm giggling all too convincingly as he signed the register and tried to act as though estban eitar checked into inns with attractive older women all the time he was still blushing even after they had settled into their roomparticularly when he saw that the furnishings consisted mostly of one large bed you could hardly have asked for two beds sweetie lydia cooed not and keep up this cuddlywuddly pretense to his utter mortification she snuggled up against him fluttering her eyelashes elaborately and pinched his cheek cute lil lover boy stop that my my you do blush prettily aw dont a sharp rap on the closed shutters of the single window interrupted him with a silent sigh of relief kevin unlatched the shutters and let in the rest of their party lydia might be a warrior but she was far too attractive for his nerves and you complain about clumsy humans do you naitachal was murmuring to eliathanis as they climbed into the room the white elf glared how was i to know the drainpipe wasnt secure you did make a most convincing spider clinging to the wall with every digit you could have helped me what and spoil your acrobatic demonstration as naitachal removed and neatly shook out the folds of his black cloak he gave kevin a secret but undeniable wink a pretty thing it was too eliathanis straightened i dont think a pity uh fellows the bardling cut in i know youre enjoying this bickering but can we please leave it for some other time weve had a rather busy day agreed oh agreed naitachal raised an eyebrow i think wed best keep watch tonight if eliathanis and i could climb up here so could someone else empty eyes kevin asked ah i mean that elf the leader of the gang the bardling paused whatever he is empty eyes naitachal echoed darkly well put kevin empty he most surely is i dont know what his problems might be what hes doing here why hes an exile from ha danoh dont give me that haughty stare white elf you know im right about that and frankly i dont care about those problems i felt death hovering over him between drugs and alcohol and botched attempts at sorcery he hasnt much longer to live botched the dark elf shrugged youve seen my conjured blade his should have been just as impressive but it was as dull and nearly dead as the fading life force within him naitachal shrugged enough about him id just like to know who hired him kevin cut in eliathanis glanced at the bardling in respect the swords those thugs were carrying bothered you too swords are expensive things most brigands just cant afford them or the time needed to learn how to use them great lydia muttered just what we need another enemy the sooner we get out of here the better were going to sleep exactly and kevin added sternly thats why we cant waste any more time we have to start working on exactly how were going to manage to escape bossy human tichki ceased but for once there wasnt much sting in her voice aiyi im getting pretty tired of westerin myself she confessed too many touchy guards for my taste lets see now i can not control every blasted guard thats going to be watching the city gates anyone else here able to work invisibility spells silence i guess not the fairy said with a sigh what about illusions though lydia asked what if we cast some really terrifying illusion something that would scare the guards away from one of the gates by we you mean me i take it naitachal said drily he shook his head oh i probably could work up something to frighten a human mind even if illusioncasting is a bit outside the scope of my art but these are trained warriors not children some of them might run yesbut the rest would almost certainly attack i dont care to test my body against their spears we need something more tangible than illusion kevin mused shapeshifting except only one of us can shapeshift he glanced at the dark elf what about disguising us by magic naitachal held up a helpless hand now that really is out of the scope of my sorcery anyone else hey dont look at me tichki said i cant change anyone but myself i have no such talent eliathanis admitted well i certainly dont lydia added besides ive heard those spells are just as easy to break as illusions the last thing wed want is to suddenly change back right in the middle of the guardsand you know fate being the fickle lady she is thats just what would happen no we need some more mundane disguises something that doesnt depend on magic naw any ordinary disguises would be too easy to penetrate would they kevin wonderedgo on lydia what of roid physical disguises she gave him a doubtful glance but continued well lets see by now both the gang and the guards know theyre looking for three men and a woman two humans and two elves one dark one white dont have to worry about disguising tichki the fairy stretched her wings right i can always shrink and hide in your hair the way we did when we were getting out of smithian but its hard to hide elves not too easy to disguise such a charmingly endowed woman either naitachal added gallantly lydia raised a brow flattery from a dark elf his smile was wry it does happen yes yes i know youre full of surprises kevin interrupted but can we please get back to the subject jealous tichki prodded no i just dont want to spend the rest of my life in a westerin prison or a westerin graveyard either right lydia returned to her musing all right we agree that its hard to disguise elves naitachal held up a hand to disguise male elves he corrected slowly particularly serious combative types he turned to look at eliathanis who narrowed his eyes i dont think i like what youre thinking naitachal shrugged youre the one who was interrogating the dancing girls im sure theyd be happy to help their dear elfywelty they didnt call me that and i canti wont the dark elf smiled alarmingly you can you will they did listen to me my friends i think were about to find a way out of westerin kevin squirmed uncomfortably in the saddle of the riding mule trying to get the yards and yards of gauzy gaudy skirts to spread out properly grimly trying to ignore the pretty chiming of little silver bells every time he moved dont squirm dear lydia cooed it tears threads kevin glared at her the warrior was a sugarsweet confection her tanned face softened with powder and paint her lithe muscular form disguised by a frilly bodice and layer after layer of gauzy skirts in a dozen shades of pink a silky cloak of dusty rose shot through with gold threads was thrown over the whole thing her black curlsand tichkihidden under its cowl yes but at least shes a woman i feel like an idiot what made it worse was that he knew he looked rather alarmingly like a girl in all this frippery a slightly scrawny one perhaps a bit too athletic even for a dancer but a girl nevertheless the bardling rubbed a reflexive hand over his chin not sure whether to be discouraged or glad right now that at almost sixteen he still didnt need to shave very often smooth cheeks would help the illusion if only the illusion wasnt quite so good eliathanis riding beside naitachal was plainly feeling the same way sitting his mule in silent misery kevin bit back a laugh what a pretty girl the white elf made both elves were of course slim and beardless as all their kind and despite eliathanis martial calling their long silky hair and elegant fineboned faces made it quite easy for them to pass as women naitachals dark skin had been lightened to a more nondescript tan with judicious use of powder making him look more like a halfelven hybrid than a perilous dark elf unlike the unhappy eliathanis he seemed to be having a wonderful time after all kevin mused how often does a necromancer get a chance to act silly it had been eliathanis dancing girls of course who had lent them all this gear with the understanding that it would be left for the dancers to gather up again outside the walls the dancers the bardling decided were definitely getting the better of the deal winding up with what was left of lydias not quite honestly gained coins as well as getting their gear back well actually it was councilman selden who was paying for the whole thing in a manner of speaking anyhow kevin censed suddenly there to one side stood empty eyes the elven leader of the street gang gently naitachal murmured youre a harmless dancing girl thats all you are the dark elf straightened slightly startled then chuckled well now what do you know he continued softly our disguises really do work did you feel that slight tingling just now yes that dissipated shame of an elf tried casting a dispel magic spell on us naitachal leaned sideways in the saddle to give empty eyes a flirtatious wink and a blown kisskevin exploded into laughter just in time managing to turn it into girlish titterings llook at his face hehehe doesnt know what hit him naitachal swept back his silky hair with a toss of his head too skinny for my taste he declared in a light tenor so unlike his usual baritone that kevin burst into laughter all over again eliathanis shot the dark elf a dour glance stop that show somesome selfcontrol naitachal grinned loosen up dear you look ravishing leave me alone will you or are you really enjoying this the dark elfs grin widened of course i am come now cousinelf wheres the harm in it its rather fun to play pretend eliathanis only growled kevin wiped his eyes trying not to smear his makeup hearing tichki there in lydias hair tittering so hard she was having trouble catching her breath straighten up dears lydia cooed here are the guards look pretty now kevin tensed all over again seeing the mens grimfaced competence the weapons never far from their hands hearing the guards muttering something about selden and those thieves arent going to get past us sure their disguise had been good enough co fool empty eyes who had probably been drunk or halfdrugged anyhow but these were sharpeyed professionals could it possibly fool them as well apparently it could look at the girl in pink one said nudging another bet shed warm a cold night warm it hell shed set it on fire the one next to hers not bad either mortified kevin realized they were discussing him now awfully stringy someone muttered but theres something to be said for those acrobatic types the guard whod first spoken leered up at the bardling come on sweetie give us a kiss for the road feeling tike a prize idiot kevin managed to work his lips into what he hoped was a flirtatious smile to his horror the guard reached up trying to pull his head down before the bardling could panic naitachal leaned down to whisper conspiratorially you dont want to kiss her oh i dont do i heavens no the last man she kissed got so hot and worked up he followed her for days we finally had to throw him in a lake to cool him off you would not have believed the steam all the guards laughed bet you could raise some steam one of them shouted oh darling you wouldnt believe what can do naitachal gave them all a dazzling smilemy my my what handsome fellows you all are what a shame we have to leave just now the very essence of a delighted dancing girl the dark elf laughed and simpered and blew kisses at them allonly kevin caught the faint hint of contempt flickering in the kohlrimmed blue eyes now we really must say goodbye naitachal said pretending to poutwe have such a long way to go stay here then oh darlings id adore that but he waved a helpless hand what would the troop do without me they would be simply lest the poor dears tata darlings fun was fun but once they were safely out of sight of the city walls the party was of one mind searching until theyd found a small pool screened by a grove of trees kevin practically threw himself from his mule and gladly stripped off his girlish finery scrubbing and scrubbing till hed washed every last trace of paint and powder from his face ugh cant see how women can stand wearing all that stuff frankly neither can i lydia straightened shaking out her damp black hair and tousling the curls dry with her hands i mean i like looking nice as much as any other woman she winked at kevin you should see me when i dress up pretty but all that stuff i was wearing just now made me feel like i was carrying a prison around with me in the middle of strapping on her sword she paused looking out over the lake eyebrows raised my isnt that a pleasant sight naitachal some distance away had stripped to the waist to wash off the last of the disguising powder his body was inhumanly slim and graceful but undeniably male smooth muscles rippling and dark skin gleaming with every move realizing the others were watching him he disappeared into the bushes emerging shrouded once more in his black cloak and now every trace of frivolity was gone its almost as though he was drunk before and now hes sober again kevin thought maybe that wasnt so bizarre an idea after all for a dark elf a necromancer used to a grim world of sorcery and death being suddenly thrown into the middle of so much vibrant busy life really must have been intoxicating as the bardling retrieved his lute from the pile of dancing girls gear he heard naitachal mutter powers im glad thats over i thought you were enjoying yourself eliathanis voice was cool with disapproval naitachal glanced sharply at the white elfup to a point one moment more though and i think i would have thrown up from fright kevin asked in disbelief hardly the dark elf gave him a fierce little grin from a surfeit of sugar chapter xv as the party rode up the gentle slope from the river plain in which westerin lay kevin suddenly reined in his mule lydia if we have to retrace all our steps back to count volmars castle were going to waste too much time agreed besides i dont want to risk going through that gorge again either one ambush is more than enough thank you the woman hesitated chewing thoughtfully on her lip i do know a much shorter route the only thing is well lets put it this way anybody have any objections about riding through a battlefield a what an ancient one im not even sure what the whole thing was all about it happened so long ago shouldnt be anything left to bother us she shot an uneasy glance at the dark elf unless of course someone tries to disturb things naitachals eyes glinted coldly i am not in the habit of rousing that which should not be roused lead on kevin struggled against the urge to keep looking over his shoulder this was ridiculous an easy ride a nice bright sunny day a smooth grassy meadow stretching out before him without any obstructions at all and a splendid array of mountains in the distance there was not the slightest thing to fear then why oh why was his mind insisting on sending these constant thrills of nervousness through him naitachal the bardling asked uneasily is this was this the battlefield the dark elfs voice sounded strained and distant yes you would sense that too wouldnt you bardtobe that you are so many lives lost human and other i can feel their auras even now calling to me well dont answer them lydia snapped and naitachal blinked like someone suddenly shaken from a dream no he said and then more confidently no but as they rode on across the meadow the others could see shudders racking his slender frame the dark elf was plainly fighting some terrible inner battle of his own struggling against all the long cruel years of childhood conditioning screaming at him you are a creature of the darkness leave the light behind you unexpectedly eliathanis brought his mule alongside take my hand he said softly what take it hold fast yes like that think of sunlight naitachal think of life and joy they are the only realities here kevin saw the white elf wince with the force of naitachals desperate graspbut eliathanis refused to let go as though willing peace into the dark elf through that link and little by little the tension left naitachals body he shuddered one last time then released the white elfs hand looking at eliathanis in confusion thank you the dark elf said after a moment i hardly expected you to wish to help me butthank you ah well eliathanis flushed embarrassed by his own kindness i didnt want you rousing anything undead against us i wouldnt willingly then naitachal added very softly but it was a near thing alatan sorcerer necromancer paced impatiently back and forth on the ramparts of his small square keep glancing now and then out over the smooth treeless expanse of meadow without really seeing it he was alone up there the only living being in all the keep alone save for a few silent soulless aides damn her he hissed and damn him for a fool for ever letting himself be forced to be responsible to her so much time had passed without a word from her hed almost let himself believe the rumors that the sorceress was dead or so far from here that shed forgotten all about him and the debt he owed her the debt of his life oh no she hadnt forgotten all at once there had come that summons and with it the infuriating knowledge that he still wasnt free any more than hed been free so many years ago when the peasants had caught him weak from the aftereffects of a failed spell had caught him and condemned him to death by fire the sorcerer stopped short black cloak swirling about him unbidden his mind conjured up the hardwood stake as clearly as though it were with him now instead of far in the past the stake and the chains pressing him cruelly back against it his hands bound so he couldnt gesture his mouth sealed with a wooden gag so he couldnt call out the slightest spell and the flames crackling at the wood beneath him the heat already starting to eat at his feet his legs alatan spat out a savage curse forcing his mind back to the present it was done he was safe and he should have banished such ridiculous memories long ago the sorcerer resumed his angry pacing what nonsense this was he had seen and done and summoned horrors enough during his career horrors that would have sent any other man screamingaye and hed seen many of those horrors do him homage too he would not act like some raw boy haunted by his own mind ah no fear wasnt the problem what truly rankled what stayed in his mind after all this rime was having to admit chat for all his power he hadnt been able to do a thing to save himself oh no if carlotta hadnt chanced to see what was happening chose stupid fearful peasants would have won and he would be ashes in the wind spirit lost in the outer dark if she hadnt seen and thought and realized what a fine tool was about to be lost damn her alatan repeated aloud but by now most of the anger was gone from his voice a tool he was and a tool he would remain till the debt of his life was repaid no successful sorcerer survived by denying what must be and he dare not fail grimly resigned alatan went down from the ramparts to his private chambers to a dark room crowded with sorcerous implements a few careful words of power sparked a silverrimmed scrying mirror into life alatan focused his will bringing into sharp focus an image of the boy the bardling and those with whom he rodea woman a warrior by the lithe look other and quite human he smiled coldly no threat there the others the sorcerers mouth tightened a white elf that one but again a warrior not a mage and again no threat to him but that other figure draped all in black alatan frowned and leaned forward staring whoever whatever was shrouded under that cloak knew at least enough to block anything more than this casual scan you may yet be trouble my mysterious friend and then again there might not be any trouble at all for look at the direction in which they rode tensing in sudden predatory delight hardly believing his good fortune the sorcerer urged them further ride just a little further with a sharp crack the mirror shattered alatan sprang back in shock dodging shards of glass no doubt about it that blackdad figure was another sorcerer no no more than that the stranger could only be a necromancer no one else could have forced his spell back on itself so powerfully alatans laugh was sharp as the glass so now it had been long and long rill hed found an enemy worthy of combat burning with eagerness the sorcerer sprang to his feet calling for his undead servants and hurried down to the meadow below to the field of battleoncewas and battleyettobe naitachal straightened as sharply in the saddle as though hed been slapped eyes blazing with sudden sorcerous force he gestured imperiously shouting out savage alien words that tore at kevins ears and sent the mules shying wildly naitachal lydia yelped struggling to keep her seat what the hell do you think youre doing reining in his own panicky curvetting mule the dark elf said shortly someone was spying on us through sorcery i turned his spell back upon him eliathanis tensed then it wasnt my imagination just now i really did sense something his hand tightened on the hilt of his sword do you know who the sorcerer is or where who no where nearby but ive shattered his scrying tool thats not going to be the end of it i doubt it naitachal glanced sharply about a predator hunting elusive prey the sooner we are dear of this battlefieldthatwas the bettor and then the earth shook kevins mule screamed in terror rearing up so violently the bardling went flying he twisted frantically in midair landing with a jolt on his feet lute smacking him in the side noting out of the corner of his eye that only naitachal had managed to keep his seat and staring as the meadow writhed tearing itself apart out of the shattered earth rose no thats not possible his mind insisted over and over climbing up into the land of the living were the longdead the skeletons of humans and others the fallen victims of that nowforgotten battle returned fleshless skulls grinning fleshless hands gripping swords and axes sightless sockets stared blankly at the horrified living behind them wrapped in a cloak as black as that worn by naitachal stood a figure who could only be the necromancer whod dragged them forth all kevin could see of the face under the dark hood were a gray beardproof the man at least was humanand fierce pitiless gray eyes sorcerous eyes in the mans hand a wooden staff topped with a serpentine carving crackled with bluewhite force to his right the bardling heard naitachal let out his breath in a long hiss so the dark elf said softly i thought as much he flung himself from his frantic mule slapping it out of the way of his magic get out of here all of you eliathanis sword glinted in his hand are you mad we cant leave you here alone you cant fight what isnt alive get out of here but it was already too late the other sorcerer thrust out his staff and the undead army charged you shall no with that naitachal shouted out fierce ugly commanding words in the harsh language of sorcery hurling his arms up in denial the skeletal enemy stumbled back from the force of his willbut behind them the human necromancer cast up his own arms staff raised shouting out his own dark spell kevin nearbard that he was saw the psychic flames of sorcery that blazed out from both foes crashing together in a shower of blinding bluewhite sparks he heard naitachal gasp at the impact but the dark elfs will held firm so unfortunately did that of the human foe but as the sorcerers stood locked in their savage silent battle both lost their hold on the skeletal warriors they empty things that they were followed the only command they had received and resumed their interrupted charge look out lydia cried here they come kevin gripped his sword as tightly as he could trying not to let it shake in his hand powers powers how do you hurt a skeleton all at once the arch of sorcery vanished with a roar of whirling air naitachal shouted out new words of command the sound alien hating the essence of dark elf necromancy the words enfolding the undead bending them to his will for a moment the deadly things hesitated caught quivering with the strain then slowly they turned to threaten the human necromancer instead his eyes widened in shock and for a moment kevin thought the man was going to break from sheer surprise but after that startled moment the gray eyes blazed up in renewed fury the necromancer thrust out his staff with such force the undead reeled and fell backonly to be caught anew in the net of naitachals power ththeyre fighting each other the bardling gasped theyre fighting their own battle all over again well and good but not all the skeletal army had found foes some of them came spilling up towards the living lydia loosed an arrowbut it passed harmlessly through a fleshless rib cage damn try for their joints eliathanis said grimly cut those apart and the creatures cannot move kevin didnt have time to worry about it he just barely had a chance to put his lute aside before a skeleton headed right towards him axe raised the bardling could have sworn that fleshless grin had sentient malice behind it cant parry an axe with a sword but an axeman cant be as quick as a swordsman once hes swung it has to take him a moment to recover andnow as the axe came whistling down kevin threw himself to one side slashing out sideways with his sword he missed the knee joint the blade clanging harmlessly off bone but at least the impact staggered the skeleton slightly it might be an undead thing but it was still subject to the force of gravity kevin swung again hoping to knock it over completely but to his horror a skeletal hand shot out and closed on the blade of course of course heitdoesnt have any fingers to get cut the thing was far far stronger than anything mortal kevin struggled helplessly with it clutching the sword hilt with both handsonly to have the skeleton still grinning its inane grin begin reeling him in bony hand over hand up the blade if he kept holding onto the hilt kevin realized he was going to be dragged into the skeletons reach so he suddenly let go to his relief the skeleton which had been braced against his weight went right over backwards kevin kicked it as hard as he could and heard ribs crack but the thing was already climbing back to its feet apparently unhurt and its still got my sword and its axe now what the bardling backed away looking about for a branch a rock anything he could use as a weapon he found a rock all right he stepped on it and the treacherous thing turned under his foot sending him sprawling as the skeleton lunged down at him kevin did the only thing he could think of he caught the bony arms and kicked his legs up with all his force just as he had with the swordsman back in westerin to his amazed wonder he sent the skeleton sailing neatly over his head to land with a satisfying crash it lost his sword in the fall and the bardling snatched up the weapon hacking and hacking at the undead thing before it could rise till hed cut right through its skeletal neck the skeleton collapsed in a bony heap i laid it i won fierce with triumph the bardling looked about to see how everyone else was faring lydia and eliathanis were surrounded fighting back to back skeletal hands snatching at them from all sides while tichki swearing savagely tried in vain to ward off the undead with her spear ive got to help them before a bony hand closed with painful force about his ankle headless or not the skeleton was still very much animated no curse you no no nearly sobbing with panicky strain kevin hacked and hacked and hacked at the hand till it shattered releasing him but the headless horror was getting to its feet once more this is impossible the thing is never going to give up no it wouldnt the bardling realized none of the undead would not while the human necromancers spell bound them panting kevin glanced to where the dark elf stood naitachal was still battling his foe as fiercely as ever eyes blazing with will but to the bardlings alarm signs of strain showed all too clearly on the elegant face of course determined though he was strong magician though he was the dark elf had no sorcerous staff to feed him extra power nothing but the strength within his own slim body he ccant hold out much longer kevin realized not without help but i dont know any spellsongs to help him wait a minute maybe he didnt know any useful bardic magicbut maybe he wouldnt need it didnt all the old ballads claim when magic failed plain common sense would save the day there was one very practical thing he could do before the headless monstrosity could grab him again kevin snatched up the rock that had tripped him hefting its weight experimentally in his hand as he ran racing past the battle of undead against undead till nothing stood between him and the enemy sorcerer if he sees me now im dead but the necromancer absorbed in his magical trance showed not the slightest sign he knew the bardling was there please oh please let this work kevin threw the rock with all his strengthha yes it hit the necromancer smartly on the side of the head the man staggered helplessly back trance shattered and from the other side of the field naitachal gave a hoarse cry of triumph as his magic blazed free a bluewhite bolt of magic slashed through the air engulfing his human foe in flame frozen with shock kevin heard the necromancer give one wild scream of pain and terror then that sorcerous flame flared up so fiercely the bardling flung his arms protectively up over his eyes it took no more than a few heartbeats rime the fire vanished as swiftly as it had begun kevin warily lowered his arms fearful of what he might see but there was nothing not man not cloak not staff nothing but a small swirling of ash the necromancers death shattered the binding spell as simply as puppets with cut strings the undead fell where theyd stood the jumble of their bones melting quietly back into the earth in only a few moments the meadow had returned to grassy serenity and nothing at all remained of the horror that had just been i dont believe i couldnt have seen kevin hurried back to eliathanis lydia and tichki suddenly wanting nothing so much as to be near other warm living mortal beings ah he was glad to clasp their hands glad to let lydia hug him and to hug her back glad even to feel tichki tousle his hair with rough affection all three started at the same time are you hurt im im not not really just bruised and tired and they broke off at the same time too then burst into laughter hey naitachal lydia called dont you naitachal a rigid figure swathed in his somber cloak the dark elf never moved from where he stood naitachal eliathanis echoed hesitantly are you without a sound the dark elf crumpled to the ground and lay still interlude the fourth my lord my lord count volmar hurrying down the corridors of his castle grit his teeth trying to ignore that dry precise voice but it continued relentlessly count volmar please stop for a moment the count sighed silently when dkrikas got an idea in its insectoid head nothing would do but to hear the arachnia out reluctantly he turned to ask yes what is it you told me yesterday that you would read and sign these scrolls today curse it an arachnia never forgot anything i dont have time for this nonsense now carlotta was hidden in the counts solar studying her scrying mirror and if he wasnt there when she learned whatever she learnedhe didnt dare let the sorceress gain any advantages over him these are nothing volmar said glancing at the scrolls small matters sign them yourself dkrikas silence held a world of disapproval all right all right the count held up a helpless hand ill sign them later i dont have time now no i can see that something in the dry voice made volmar stare up at the arachnia and all at once the count felt the smallest prickle of unease run through him usually he managed to ignore the fact that his seneschal wasnt human dkrikas kept pretty much to itself after all so quietly efficient volmar could almost forget the being was there efficient yes meticulously so the castle was never going to be short so much as a single copper coin or a loaf of bread as long as the arachnia was in charge but in this narrow close corridor dkrikas seemed co loom over him volmar had never stopped to realize just how tall an adult arachnia grew how tall and thin and alien so alien the great compound eyes studied him without blinking the shiny chitin half hidden by the beings cloak gave off a faint spicy scent that was never a human scent and volmar all at once overwhelmed forced out a brash you dont like me do you dkrikas drew back slightly in surprise what has like or dislike to do with matters when my home hive grew overcrowded i left co ease the burden of feeding all i swore the proper oath to your father you know that i keep my oaths you know that too i served your father the count and i serve you as i will continue to serve the master of this castle whomever that may be as long as honor is not compromised was there a hint of warning in the precise voice volmar fought down a shudder he had once seen dkrikas save a servants child from a rabid dog by calmly tearing the beast in two with those segmented fragileseeming arms neatly and effortlessly as a man would tear a piece of parchment and that precise arachnia beak could sever bone everyone knew the one thing no arachnia could endure was a loss of honor if dkrikas somehow suspectedno no that was ridiculous no arachnia wielded magic and without magic even clever dkrikas would never be able to learn how his master was aiding the crowns worse foe your honor will not be compromised volmar said shortly he sent a page for pen and ink and signed the scrolls one after another hardly bothering to read them and hurried off dkrikas speculative gaze hot on his back carlotta never looked up from her scrying mirror as he entered but volmar knew she could tell perfectly well by her arcane senses who he was i dont believe it the sorceress straightened in her chair voice sharp with disbelief i simply dont believe it dont believe what volmar craned his neck trying his best to see past the woman to the mirror but to his frustration what he could see of the images looked to his nonsorcerous sight like nothing more than blurs of color swirling on the smooth surface whats happening whats wrong that ridiculous nuisance of a boy just killed alatan the sorcerer volmar gasped but thats impossible the boy is just a bardling a nothing come now carlotta from what ive seen of him he couldnt have managed enough bardic magic or any other kind of magic strong enough to he threw a rock each word was savagely bitten off it was the dark elf who did the rest ann damn him damn them both she glanced sharply up at volmar you would include a dark elfin the party hey now dont blame me the count exclaimed it wasnt my idea not mine alone anyhow we both agreed having one of that cursed breed in the group would help discredit the unholy elven lot unholy is it carlotta purred her eyes narrowing to green slits in all the years ive known you volmar youve never yet been able to shed this obsessive hatred of the elfkind it is beginning to grow quite wearisome oh powers hed forgotten all about her being half of fairy blood horrified volmar remembered the womans quick temper and realized he might just have doomed himself i ddont he stammered struggling to find the words to soothe her i didntii mean ignoring his helpless attempts at placation she returned to studying her mirror poor alatan carlotta murmured after a moment without a hint of softness in her voice poor fool for all your power you never could control the weaknesses within your own mind you let yourself be haunted all these many years by the memory of flame and now the fire has snared you after all her chuckle was soft and chillingly cold what a pity she was silent for a moment longer staring into the mirror volmar stood frozen hardly daring to breathe wondering what other bad news the woman was going to announce he jumped when carlotta straightened with a sharp little cry soo is that the way of it she glanced quickly up at the count again one eyebrow raised in surpriseit appears that at least the late alatan managed to take the dark elf with him did he now volmar breathed an inner sigh of relief one less wouldbe hero to concern us with a wave other hand and a commanding word carlotta banished the images and got restlessly to her feet yes one dead elf but the others remain and with that cursed hunter that warriorwoman to guide them such a small party is going to be able to elude almost anything well now wasnt this interesting for once the mighty carlotta seemed to actually be at a loss her pet necromancers death must have shaken her more than shed admitted volmar straightened in dour delight good let her know for a change what it felt like to be uneasy and unsure and in the meantime let him at last take charge of the situation never mind the count said his voice gentle with false concern let them come she glared at him have you gone mad please hear me out dont hinder them i say volmar smiled at her enjoying her confusion who knows while the boy is here perhaps hell find that elusive manuscript for us yes but carlotta my dear princess you worry too much dont patronize me it was all the more alarming for having been quietly said i didnt mean ah but you did he could have sworn she hadnt done anything more than raise a hand but suddenly volmar was nowhere floating helplessly in empty grayness with no sense of up no down no light or dark or life choking the count fought in vain to breathe but oh gods there was no air here either his lungs were aching his heart was pounding painfully he was dying carlotta no please no all at once there was a real world about him once more all at once he was fallen to hands and knees on a hard stone floor able to think of nothing but drawing air into his lungs after a time volmar realized he was back in his casde with carlotta standing over him face impassive never underestimate me either she murmured the count dragged himself to his feet collapsing into a chair bathed in cold perspiration never he echoed weakly illusion it had to have been illusion he couldnt have actually left this realm he couldnt really have just been trapped inin that deadly emptiness volmar took a deep breath you misunderstand me he forced a ghost of sincerity into his voice i never meant to belittle you nor the count added honestly to deny your powers she raised a skeptical eyebrow then smiled sweetly no you wouldnt dare would you all right continue this is my castle these are my people what did you think id been idle all this while little by little volmar felt selfconfidence stealing back into him of course it had been illusion once the boy and his misguided comrades are actually here i have a few surprises of my own to spring on them and i dont believe the count added with dark humor that they will enjoy them chapter xvi naitachal eliathanis raced to the fallen elfs side closely followed by the others kevin got there an instant before lydia and the fluttering tichki dropping to his knees beside naitachals still form the white elf glanced across at the bardling green eyes wide i ddont think hes breathing oh no that cant be right he has to be kevin hastily snatched up a dark wrist for a panicstricken seemingly endless while he couldnt find any pulse at all come on come on you cant he dead not now all at once the bardling felt yes kevin released naitachals wrist with a sigh of relief hes alive i think hes just asleep deeply asleep that sorcerous duel must really have worn him out eliathanis shuddered faintly yes he straightened slowly fussing with the set of his now sadly tattered cloak plainly struggling to regain his composure of course it did i should have realized that well what do you know kevin stared at the white elf in surprise you really were worried about him not that such revelations mattered right now kevin glanced doubtfully down at naitachal sleeping like this on bare ground couldnt be doing the dark elf any good particularly not on this ground everybody else seemed to be too battledazed to suggest anything so the bardling said as firmly as he could eliathanis why dont you see if you can coax our mules back here ah yes and lydia can you help me lift naitachal the sooner we get himand usaway from here the better right for all his worry and evergrowing weariness the bardling couldnt help but feel a little thrill of wonder at the way they were obeying him without question maybe i am o leader after all sort of anyway he added wryly for now anyhow naitachal slept without stirring all during eliathanis finally successful efforts to persuade the snorting stilltrembling mules to return he slept during that entire days ride through field and forest alternately supported in the saddle by kevin lydia and eliathanishe continued to sleep while they set up camp for the night lost in so deep and still a slumber that kevin began to worry hell wake up soon enough of course he will but naitachal continued to sleep and at last kevins worry grew to the point where the bardling couldnt stand it any longer glancing uneasily at the others he burst out with the question he suspected they were all thinking what are we going to do if naitachal doesnt wake up hell wake eliathanis tending the campfire didnt sound quite sure about that but what if he doesnt he will tichki said firmly look im the only other one of us who has any real magic and believe me this isnt the first time ive seen a magician overtax himself tothe point of collapse theres only so much strength in a body you know yes but very true it was little more than a whisper so unexpected a sound that they all started naitachal so i am the dark elf sat up very slowly and carefully as though he wasnt quite sure his body would obey him lydia made an abortive little move towards him then stopped with a cautious how do you feel like something dragged up by one of my own spells naitachal admitted wryly but youll be all right eliathanis eyes were oddly wary indeed this is ridiculous this is naitachal the comrade whos been riding with us all along he hasnt turned into a monster but even as he thought that kevin knew they were all a little leery of naitachal now this dark elf who had suddenly revealed himself as a fearful necromancer who could destroy a foe with one blast of sorcerous flame i will not be afraid of him after all how could he forget how the dark elf had comforted him after hed killed that bandit whatever else naitachal might be that hadnt been the act of a cruel being or an evil one the bardling deliberately moved to the dark elfs side and received a faint smile in return that was a marvelously clever thing you did kevin hurling the rock at the sorcerer to break his concentration oh well it was the only thing i could think to do the bardling couldnt stop himself from adding in a rush even if i didnt expect what was going to happen after that dont shed any tears for him naitachals voice was suddenly cold i touched his mind during our battle and it was foul the man had deliberately killed all goodness within himself all hope of joy deliberately turned himself into a being almost as empty as those poor dead ones he conjured so it can be he added almost reluctantly with many necromancers not with you anyone who could enjoy being silly with those guards the way you did hasnt given up on life that earned him a chuckle no i havent nor will i powers willing the dark elf paused eyes glinting he was strong though that stupid evil man so strong with nothing but hatred left within him to drive him with that hellish staff of his to aid him without your help kevin i dont think i would have survived he glanced at the bardling but the memory of that fire is still shocking you isnt it ha yes you others it shocks you all well hell yes lydia exclaimed after a moment i never thought you could didnt not deliberately what do you mean i saw what i saw you dont understand naitachal hesitated then sighed i dont know if i can put this so easily into human terms look you our power was trapped his and mine stalemated each against each what happens when a dam breaks lydia shrugged the water bursts free andoh exactly when his sorcery all at once gave way mine yesburst free even i didnt expect it to explode quite so fiercely though a pity it did naitachal added grimly i meant only to stun the man in the name of all the powers why the dark elfs eyes glinted in the gloom why do you think kevin straightened you dont believe he was working on his own do you hardly even a necromancer such as that isnt chaotic enough to attack at random then do you think he was in carlottas pay something like that the dark elf stretched wearily but we seem to have drawn the ladys fangs at least for now kevin thought and fought down a shudder i bet youre hungry a hint of returning humor danced in the dark elfs eyes ravenous as would think we all are its been a shall we say rather strenuous day it has indeed eliathanis was rummaging in their packs coming up with a fair amount of smoked meat and some rather squashed bread he looked ruefully at his catch its not going to be an elegant meal lydia rubbed sore muscles in her arms ive had worse worse days too though i have to admit i cant remember when most of the guys ive fought she added with a wry grin had more flesh to em they rode all the next day still sore and weary from the battle nerves tight but what they rode into was nothing more alarming than a mild sweet spring day the land sloped gently up and up towards the mountains so gradually that the mules climbed it without complaint a gentle breeze played with hair and clothes birds darted cheerfully all about them and there was not the slightest sign of trouble anywhere it was so very uneventful a day that by nightfall kevin was amazed to find himself almost disappointed whats the matter with you you idiot do you want to be attacked no of course he didnt what he was feeling kevin knew wasnt anything so foolish after all they had gone through so far this sudden peacefulness simply seemed too anticlimactic to be believable now that was silly maybe it was true maybe carlottas fangs had been drawn maybe she couldnt attack them herself for some arcane reason maybe shed had nothing to do with the attack at all ah well kevin told himself he would try to enjoy anticlimax or an almost anticlimax the only thing chat was jarringly wrong in all this quiet was the way lydia eliathanis and even tichki still radiated uneasiness every time they glanced naitachals way i cant let that go on if carlotta does attack us again we had better be able to present a united front or shes going to destroy us but kevin admitted reluctantly that he just didnt know what to do about it sitting by the campfire that night the bardling sighed overwhelmed by a surge of guilt that had nothing to do with their quest what with all the excitement of the past few days he had pretty much forgotten about his music now imagining master aidans reproachful stare for his neglect kevin took out his lute and tuned it gently since it hadnt been played for a while then tried a few practice scales ugh his fingers were stiff but as he kept after them they finally limbered up and remembered what they were supposed to be doing kevin ran through his scales from the simplest to the most complex and back again several times till he heard lydia give a not so subtle yawn with a grin the bardling switched over instead to a cheerful little springtime song common to almost all the human lands the maidens garland as he played kevin felt eyes on himhe glanced up and caught naitachal in the ace of staring at the lute the slanted blue eyes were for the moment unguarded so full of yearning that a pang of pity shot through the bardling he remembered naitachal admitting that the dark elves had no music of their own what a horrible thing what a horrible lonely thing naitachal suddenly realized kevin had noticed him and turned sharply away pretending to be fixing some bit of his gear oh no you dont the bardling murmured and scrambled over to sit beside the dark elf moved by an impulse he didnt quite understand kevin held out the lute here take it ii cant i mean i wouldnt know how ill show you take it naitachal took the lute as gingerly as though it was a baby kevin sighed not like that its not that fragile honest you hold it like this here and here right now give it back to me for a minute and ill show you something this is how you get single notes he strummed a single string running his finger up from fret to fret see the pitch gets lower the further my finger gets from the body of the lute you try it warily naitachal touched a string when it twanged he almost dropped the lute in shock then gave a rueful grin at his own reaction but then to kevins surprise the dark elf ran up and down through the notes without missing a one you have a good ear now shall we try a chord or two naitachal shrugged uneasily whatever you say showing the dark elf the proper fingering kevin strummed the basic chords then handed the lute back naitachal stumbled over the strings the first time then echoed kevin flawlessly hey terrific the bardling said the dark elf grinned this time in selfconscious delight and to the bardlings amazement naitachal began to pick out very slowly and carefully the melody to the maidens garland thatthats wonderful and you only heard me play it once kevin fought down the faint irrational little touch of jealousy that didnt like anyone else being able to play his lute and added honestly do you know how long it took me to figure out what youre doing in one tiny lesson the bardling stopped mind racing naitachal listen to me you cant stop here the words came tumbling out of kevin in his eagerness i mean it when this is all over youve got to get musical training you must no no dont shake your head at me music would be such a wonderful comfort for you and youve got talent true musical talent thats the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard but for all his protest naitachal didnt surrender the lute as though driven by some inner demon he bent over it once more playing the maidens garland again and yet again gradually bringing it up to proper speed suddenly the dark elf stopped with an embarrassed delighted little laugh he tried to give the lute back to kevin but kevin was aware of how the others were staring at them in sheer confusion the terrible necromancer wasnt supposed to be acting like this oh yes this was too good a chance to waste the bardling waved naitachal on the dark elf frowned but obligingly played the maidens garland yet again and this time kevin sang the light silly happy words along with the music as i was walking one spring day i saw a maiden fair come gathering the fragrant may the lilac and the roseso the daisies and the violetso to make a pretty posyo to wear upon her hair at first naitachal stumbled distracted by trying to listen to what kevin was singing but all at once he caught the performers knack of hearing but not really listening to the words and played on smiling faintly as the bardling had hoped the bouncy cheerful melody and lyrics quickly reached out to snare the others first lydia hardly aware of what she was doing started tapping her foot in time to the music then tichki began humming along fairy voice high and sweet as birdsong eliathanis fought it for a time but at last gave up murmuring the words in his dear elven tenor oh come on kevin teased you all can do better than that they could they did pushed on by the bardlings taunts they laughed and set the echoes ringing with their singing and kevin leading them on grinned as he sang watching the walls of suspicion come crumbling down dissolved by the sheer joy that was music at last breathless they had to stop eliathanis coughed nervously made a few abortive movements then got to his feet and moved to the dark elfs side i seem to be forever begging your pardon he told naitachal but i must do it yet again the white elf shook his head im a warrior not a magician but thats no real excuse even so should have recognized liathama safainias when i saw it naitachal glanced at the bewildered kevin that doesnt translate very well into your human tongue it means mmm explosion of pentup power is as close as i can get with the implication that the explosion wasnt the magicians fault exactly eliathanis cut in naitachal weve fought enough foes togetherand each other as wellfor me to know something of who and what you are a dark elf naitachal said drily a necromancer bah forget that the white elf waved a dismissive hand you had no choice in either he paused and kevin could see his fair skin reddening even in the dim light prejudice isnt a logical thing eliathanis began anew but its damnably difficult to forgetas ive been proving so far we are as we are dont mock me this is difficult enough to say as it is naitachal i well look you i admit ive had things fairly easy all my life i was raised with love and light i never had a moments doubt about who i was or about the career i chosebut you can only guess at the struggle you had to be you to be your own free soul what are you trying to say ah i dont know maybe that the you youre creating is a being of whom you should be proud maybe that no matter what my people think of yours or yours of mine i know you naitachal are not you cannot be my enemy agreed the dark elfs teeth flashed in a sudden smile agreed great came lydias wry voice from the darkness now can we all kiss and make up and get some sleep that created such a silly picture in kevins mind that he started to chuckle the bardling was still chuckling as he settled down for the night but mixed in with the humor was sheer relief peace at last he thought and added a silent thankyou to whatever spirit of music might be listening chapter xvii by the second day of peaceful riding through peaceful fields and forest climbing ever higher into the mountains with nothing to be seen but countryside kevin felt his tight nerves beginning to unwind he started to relax in the saddle enjoying the quiet beauty of the scene around him almost daring to hope maybe carlotta really hadnt had anything to do with the necromancers attack maybe she wasnt after them after all the rest of the party were obviously feeling just as relaxed as he naitachal and tichki were busily murmuring together as they rode from what scraps the bardling could make out they were trying to figure out a way to combine fairy magic with the dark elfs own to trace the missing charina and enjoying the challenge lydia and eliathanis were trading war stories arguing goodnaturedly over the comparative merits of sword and bow kevin smiled and let his mind wander over various bits of music puzzling out how he would transcribe this piece for lute or add counterpoint to that piece it would be nice to show off some new musical skills once they were back in the casde all at once the inanity of his thoughts hit him like a blow kevin sat bolt upright what in the name of all the powers did everyone think they were doing this is ridiculous kevin look at us were all acting as though wed been out for aa pleasant little ride in the country without a care in the world well yes lydia admitted but but we know carlotta is alive we know she had something to do with charinas disappearance what do you think were going to find when we get back to count volmar eh look you all of you were talking about a sorceress who thought nothing of trying to murder her own brother shes not going to stick at getting rid of nothings like us nothings tichki said indignantly kevin ignored her glaring at the others think about it for all we know carlottas already figured out where were going ha for all we know she already has agents in place in the castle oh youre not saying the counts in her employ lydia protested he paid us to go on our hunt for powers sake im not saying anything except that we dont know what were going to be facing so lets not be soso so fat and lazy lydia drawled she straightened in the saddle adjusting the angle other quiver you have a point kid much as i hate to admit it you do have a point tichki came fluttering down to land panting on lydias saddle all right i scouted ahead as best i could and she shrugged and all i could see was a perfectly normal casde full of perfectly ordinary humans from what i could overhear no one seemed to be talking about anything interesting but you cant be sure kevin prodded no i cant be sure tichki snapped im a fairy not one of your heavy earthbound breed i dont know how you think kevin sighed never mindjust sic and get your strength back he looked at the others i guess all we can do is go on they rode up the steep road to the castle in renewed tension all of them wondering just how accurate tichkis report might be could a fairys judgment be trusted was this to be a refugeor a trap youre on your own tichki told them once in that castle was enough im not going to risk being trampled underfoot by some hulking human see you later she took wing darting off without another word eh well here we are lydia said staring up at the watchtowers guarding the main gates here they were indeed kevin licked suddenly dry lips and called out their names to the tower guards there was a brief pause during which he had far too much time to wonder if theyd have time to get away if someone threw spears down at them or boiling oil the gates creaked open and a storm of shouting castle folk came rushing out to meet themfor one panicky moment the bardling fumbled for his sword sure he and his party were under attack but before he could do anything to defend himself kevin made out some individual shouts amid the sea of noise theyre here they made it oh you brave brave heroes kevin glanced at the rest of his party seeing on their faces the same shocked disbelief he felt uh yes the bardling began warily were here all right but why are you the rest of his question was drowned out in a storm of cheers eager hands reached out to grab his mules bridle and lead it through the entryway into the crowded outer bailey if it will please you to dismount my lords lady no it doesnt please me kevin thought this is all just too weird but he couldnt think of any convincing argument that would let him turn around and ride out of here exchanging uneasy looks with the rest of the party he dismounted and followed their guides they were led into the shadowy depths of the counts great hall the sound of their footsteps muffled by the carpeting rushes the vast torchlit room was fairly stuffed with courtiers and servants alike at the sight of kevin and he others they all burst into a frenzy of murmuring at the far end of the hall sat count volmar himself splendid in robes of somber blue there on his redcanopied chair of state on its dais and beside him was charina the bardling gasped kevin she came scurrying down the steps to kevins side in a wild swirling of blue velvet and long golden hair and caught the startled bardling in a passionate hug oh you brave brave hero you saved me chcharina kevin stammered too shocked and embarrassed for anything else overwhelmed by the soft sweetness other at last he managed to disengage himself gasping out im delighted to see youre free and ii wish iwecould take credit for it but we didnt dont be so modest young man count volmar stepped down from his chair to shake kevins hand the elven traitors whod captured my niece released her as soon as they learned just who i had sent out to track them down the count smiled heartily if it hadnt been for your reputation all of you and the diligent search i know you undertook my poor dear charina would still be a captive if it hadnt been for their reputation what reputation unless lydia and the elves had been holding out on him but they looked every bit as baffled as he before any of them could say or do anything though the counts servants swarmed down on the party hey wait kevin cried the last thing he wanted was to be separated from the others but he didnt have much of a choice still trying to protest kevin was almost dragged away by the flock of eager servitors chapter xviii to kevins momentary surprise the servants deposited him not back in the chilly barren squires hall but in a luxurious suite of rooms whose expensive the floors and tapestryhung walls marked them as the counts prized guest quarters but i dontim notyou canthey isnt anybody listening to me the servants who were busy dragging out a hip bath and hanging the room round with heavy linen draperies so the hero will not be bothered by drafts stopped to stare at him my lord one asked glancing at kevins wellworn clothing and mulescented self do you not wish to bathe before meeting with count volmar again uh yes of course i do but too late they were already off in a new flurry of excitement almost before kevin could catch his breath he was bathed and hustled into the most elegant silken hose and velvet tunic he could ever have imagined a rich sky blue trimmed with gold thread somewhat to the overwhelmed bardlings relief the whole thing was ever so slightly too big for him especially in the shoulders at least something wasnt totally bizarreat least the clothing hadnt been conjured up specifically for him a gold chain was draped about his neck an ornamental dagger was fastened at his side and kevin was hurried back down to the great hall the rest of his party was already down there arrayed in similar splendor lydia was truly beautiful in an amberdark gown kevin could imagine what shed had to say about having her legs hindered by skirts her curly dark hair caught up in a net of gold thread while the two elves looked inhumanly elegant like some princely brothers light and dark out of the dawn of magic eliathanis pale coloring was exquisitely set off by the softest of blue silk robes while naitachals dark complexion was made yet more exotic by the deep red of his velvet robes not one of the party looked any more comfortable in all that borrowed finery than kevin felt ah here you are count volmar cried heartily he coo was more richly dressed than before a rich blue robe trimmed with costly ermine about his shoulders the gold chains of his office glinting across his shoulders a jewelencrusted velvet cap glittering on his head at his side in a chair only slightly lower than the counts own sat charina her eyes modestly downcast her hair caught back by a crystal circlet and an elegantly outfitted semicircle of the counts warriors stood behind the dais now the count announced we may begin the ceremony ceremony you dont mind swearing fealty to me my boy do you just a formality of course but appearances must be kept up uh yes i mean no i mean good im glad thats settled now come along we must do this thing properly what thing what are you no no questions later now if you volmars sweep of arm included lydia and the elves will go back to the head of the hall and reenter at the trumpeters signal kevin glanced at the others in confusion lydia shrugged why not the sooner we get this over with whatever this is the sooner we can ask questions exactly naitachal agreed come my friends the trumpets blared the blasts of sound certainly did fill the hall kevin acknowledged even if he noted painfully the instruments were all ever so slightly offkey feeling like an idiot the bardling marched solemnly back towards count volmar stopping at the foot of the dais uneasily eyeing that semicircle of menatarms one of them he noticed held a small gilded lance a ceremonial thing topped by a glittering pennon of clothofgold now what count volmar stood dont look so worried lad he murmured just follow my lead come up here and kneel sure he was going to do something stupid like tumble over backwards down the steps kevin climbed the steps and carefully went down on one knee the count extended both hands go on lad take them the bardling obeyed feeling volmars palms as soft as those of any pampered nobleman but so cold he had to wonder if the count was really as at ease as he looked following volmars prompting wondering if he was getting himself into some binding oath he might regret later kevin parroted my lord count i herein enter into your homage and become your man by mouth and hands i swear to keep faith and loyalty to you saving only the just rights of his majesty king amber and i swear to guard your rights with all my strength there that didnt sound so bad nothing in there to compromise his honor or his loyalty to king amber count volmar was returning his own part of the vow we do promise to you our friend and vassal kevin that we and our heirs will guarantee to you with all our power ail the rights due to you let there be peace between us let there be peace kevin echoed then tried not to start in surprise as volmar kissed him on the cheeks get up the count whispered take the lance kevin obeyed and everyone cheered there now volmar exclaimed thats finished sorry i cant cede you any lands my boy but that unfortunately is the way of things but from here on in you may sign yourself as a courtbaron i uh thank you kevin said helplessly now can we now my boy the count cut in slapping him so heartily on the shoulder the bardling staggered we celebrate and celebrate they did even if kevin and his party still had no clear idea what they were celebrating so quickly it seemed positively magical the great hall was filled with long trestle tables spread with fine white linen and covered with elegant gold ewers drinking cups and plates plates too kevin was used to the far more common thick bread trenchers count volmar really was trying to impress them as guests of honorfor whatever reason the bardling thoughtkevin and his party were seated at the high table with count volmar to the bardlings embarrassment he found himself seated beside channa so close to her that he could smell the faint flowery scent she wore costly stuff imported from the lands far to the east and feel the warmth other whenever she reached for food or drink somehow their hands always managed to brush each contact seemed to burn through kevin like flame pleasant flame that sent heat surging through his whole body he knew the count sitting on charinas other side was asking him questions he knew he must be answering but kevin dazed by charinas presence was hardly aware of what he was saying any more than he was aware of what out of the interminable courses offish and meat and poultry he was eating the air in the great hall rapidly grew heavy with the varied smells of food torch smoke and too many people crowded into one place kevin was vaguely aware of eliathanis fastidious distaste and for all charinas allure the bardling found himself struggling not to yawn ah at last here came the subtleties the spun sugar confectionsat this dinner a castle upon a marzipan hall and a swan swimming through a marzipan sea that marked the end of a feast soon kevin thought with longing he would be able to escape and get some rest no he wouldnt dinner was followed by a seemingly endless procession of jugglers acrobats dancers and an illusionist mediocre enough to make naitachal snort in contempt charina oohed and ahhed over each performer applauding vigorously jarring kevin awake every time he started to drift off powers if this interminable celebration didnt end pretty soon he was going to end up snoring away with his head in the crumbs at last though the ordeal did come to an end the last of the performers bowed his way out of the hall and count volmar got to his feet looking as crisp as ever the hour is lace and so my friends i bid you good night beaming he held up both arms in benediction declare a week of celebration as all the courtiers cheered kevin bit back a groan i dont know if i can survive a week of this struggling not to stagger the bardling followed a bevy of obsequious servants back to the guest quarters blinking wearily as they fussed over him and removed his borrowed finery as they finally left him alone kevin yawned mightily sure he was going to fall asleep the moment he fell into bed but of course as soon as he was settled comfortably in the big canopied bed his mind and body perversely woke up after a time of restlessly tossing about kevin gave up trying to sleep altogether pulling back the canopies so he could get some fresh air the bardling sat alone in the dark puzzling over the weird events of the day charina free himself a hero but i havent done anything nothing made sense oh sure there had been the fight with the bandits and that necromancer but everything else about their quest had been soso easy so ridiculously frustratingly easy that kevin froze listening to the sudden faint creak of wood that was the door someone was sneaking into his room the bardling shot off the bed groping blindly for a weapon his hand closed about a heavy candlestick and he hefted it experimentally heart pounding trying to figure out exactly where the intruder might kid hey kid lydia come on kevin added a high shrill voice we know youre in there wings buzzed in the darkness now that had to be tichki kevin put the candlestick back on the bedside table from which hed snatched it and fumbled with flint and steel till hed gotten the chick expensive beeswax candle burning by its flickering light he saw lydia grin and tichki come to a graceful landing on the bed two more figures moved silently out of the shadows eliathanis and naitachal the latter nearly invisible shrouded once more in his cloak of necromantic black we must talk the dark elf said softly we certainly must kevin agreed i dont know about you but i feel like all this glittery splendor is going to explode in my face eliathanis grimaced oh indeed the whole affair stinks as you humans would say like old boots kevin nodded eagerly what it is is that theyre all trying their best to dazzle us but just who are they the white elf wondered and why are they doing this why indeed naitachal mused i wonder could someone have deceived count volmar perhaps told him of heroics we simply didnt do why would anyone bother lydia asked that doesnt make sense tichki shrugged a weird sort of human joke kevin shook his head not with charina here her disappearance was hardly a joke the only other possibility naitachal said slowly is that the count himself is involved lydia stirred impatiently involved in what all we know is he hired us to find his niece we returned to find said niece already free everyone thinks were heroes yeah its a weird situation but wheres the crime in it oh powers kevin what is it he stared at them all i just had a horrible thought remember what the arachnia back in westerin told us about carlotta well what if what if that isnt charina after all i know shes no illusion i sat next to her at dinner and all but he shook his head in misery you mean the dark elf murmured that she might be no one else but carlotta in disguise i ddont want to believe it but what if thats the truth then this whole thing all this ridiculous empty celebrating starts making sense it could all be part of her plot naitachal swore under his breath could be no it is and here i thought i sensed something odd about that girl a hint of sorcery hovering about her but i told myself no that couldnt be i had to be mistaken let myself get just as bedazzled as the rest of you the dark elf straightened resolutely what happened happened if that really is carlotta the count is almost certainly under her sway and that means theyre both probably waiting for me to find the manuscript again kevin added after all im still supposed to be copying it so i can bring the spell back to master aldan well you can forget about all that lydia exclaimed the last thing we want to do is play into carlottas hands weve got to get out of here before its too late yes and warn king amber too no wait eliathanis voice was thoughtful if this really is carlotta we cant risk her finding the manuscript that means we cant just go running off like so many frightened children she probably wouldnt let us go anywhere anyhow kevin added particularly not in the direction of her brother he hesitated biting his lip nervously ii think we have to go along with the deception let charinaor whoever she really isget close to me again and then well i guess then well see what happens for all his brave words the bardling was half hoping someone would talk him out of it but to his dismay the white elf only nodded that seems like the best idea but since youre going to be playing the bait in what could be a most complicated trap someone bad best armor you against the weapons youre likely to encounter someone naitachal muttered that someone of course is going to be me unless one of you has miraculously gained some useful protection spells no i didnt think so tichki grinned unabashed now why would a fairy deign to protect someone why indeed the dark elfs voice dripped sarcasmlet the weak get what they deserve eh ha the fairy exploded never knew your folks to be concerned with protecting anyone either point taken tichki lydia cut in couldnt you use fairy magic though against carlotta how by influencing her mind the way i did to those guards tichki shivered wrapping her wings about her not a chance look you i know my limitationsif that really is carlotta shed shrivel me like a moth in a flame never mind naitachal glanced at kevin im sure you realize that when our white elf friend mentioned armor he didnt mean armor against anything as simple as swords uhno i admit im not the most experienced of magicians when it comes to protective spells as our dear tichki so kindly reminded me she uttered but i shall do my best the dark elf continued and he added wryly i promise not to damage you in the process naitachal paused then gave a heartfelt sigh its not going to be an easy thing if i make the spells too obvious charina carlotta will be sure to sense them heyho who needs sleep he glanced at the othersbut those spells are for defensive purposes now lets plan what were going to do about fighting back kevin shouldnt be left alone for a moment eliathanis suggested thats easy to say lydia retorted i have a feeling that if charina carlotta or whatever she wants to call herself really is worried about that manuscript shes some to concentrate all her attention on kevin all we can do is our best the white elf said simply and tichki snickered might have known youd say something ail fine and noble and useless never mind the pretty words elf weve got some concrete plans to make what were going to do if the ah witch tries to isolate our boy here what were going to do if she asks him about the manuscript or makes him go get itthat sort of thing all the nice practical details kevin nodded in fervent approval by all means lets be practical he and the others sat and plotted for some time at last satisfied with the results naitachal straightened in his chair all right enough of this we all know our roles now i have work to do lydia eliathanis tichki if you cant help me cast spells you can at least raid the kitchen and castle gardens and get me the components ill need the dark elf rattled off a list of ingredients some of them like rosemary kevin recognized it was a common element of the protective amulets people wore back in bracklin other items bewildered him totally naitachal i didnt know aaoi had any magical properties naitachals smile was wry thats for me boy not for you this is going to be one long nights work and i dont want to risk falling asleep in the middle of it oh and by the way he added sharply catching the others in a warning stare once i begin that work i do not wish to be interrupted understood totally lydia grinned after all some of us have to look pretty in the morning she dodged as naitachal threw a pillow at her and scurried out of the room her laughter trailing behind her interlude the fifth the night was late at the very witching hour and very dark moonless and still without the faintest breath of wind not a sound was to be heard without count volmars casde save for the faint footsteps and chinking of mail of the guards wearily trudging back and forth up on the ramparts their torches were small flickering things barely cutting through the vast mass of darkness within the casde silence reigned as well all slept or almost all cloistered in count volmars solar two people sat in secret conference sharing a midnight flagon of mulled wine hands cupped about his warm goblet volmar chuckled suddenly now you have to admit he said glancing over at carlotta that things are going nicely very nicely indeed the sorceress in her rightful form once more red hair pouring over her shoulders and green gown like a stream of flame stared broodingly down into her own goblet so far oh my dear princess dont be so wary kevin may bear the seeds of bardic magic as you say but he is still only a boy so far its been ridiculously easy for me to quite overwhelm him with riches and the trappings of power you must admit carlotta glanced up at that her smile wry granted between the two of us he hasnt even had a chance to think exactly and i intend to go right on overwhelming him the sorceress stretched wearily graceful as a predator ay me and i will endure being simpering little charina a bit longer and continue casting my beguilements and lovespells on the boy volmar pursed his lips thoughtfully now thats something i dont understand carlotta you know theres such a thing as too much caution why dont you just enthrall the boy in one quick burst of sorcery and be done with it her eyes flashed in sudden angry warning dont be ridiculous the only spells i dare use are subtle ones but why surely you can surely i can tell you not to meddle have you forgotten about that dark elf the one you thought dead volmar thought but didnt dare say aloudno of course not but carlottas hands tightened about her goblet magic leaves a distinctive feel if one has sufficient training to identify it one magician can almost always recognize another in action no matter which sorcerous disciplines are involved no matter how many cloaking spells are used i had a nervous enough moment when that elf first saw me i swear he nearly sensed who and what i am on the spot i only just managed to project enough girlish innocence to distract him the sorceress paused staring at volmar i dont have to remind you that i dont want my true identity discovered yet not by anyone the elf is a skillful necromancer no doubt about it and that makes him talented enough to detect the working of any strong magics by anyone and so i must limit myself to subtle spells i see oh dont misjudge me carlotta smiled without humor the spells may be subtle but that doesnt mean they arent powerful and their effect i might add is nicely accumulative ah clever between the two of us we should have the boy beautifully cooperative before the week is out the womans smile thinned ever so slightly i should think so assuming of course that you dont make some mistake i wont volmar said as casually as he could and once hes under our control of course hell go fetch us his manuscript ah yes thats going to be the true test of his enthrallment rather than doing the copying himself the boy must be persuaded to surrender the manuscript to one of your scribes then let our messenger carry that copy off to his cursed master the count frowned thats not going to be easy hes such a disgustingly honorable boy he raised a hopeful brow that isnt something thats going to change once hes enthralled is it no such spells delude and lull the will but they cant change a persons inner self carlotta paused but the boy is as you say still very young if were careful we should be able to so beguile him that he forgets duty then hell be quite willing to let the messenger have the copy of the manuscriptso that he himself can continue enjoying this so very flattering noble hospitality volmar sat bolt upright ha i have it if he seems reluctant all we need to do is propose that he marry charina hewfwtr volmar laughed the poor fool is too unworldly to realize id never let my ward marry a mere nothing hell take the whole thing quite seriously and then of course there will be no way he can take the copy of the manuscript back to his master hell be too busy with wedding preparations even to consider doing the copy himself carlotta raised her goblet in a wry toast i like it a maximum of result from a minimum of effort oh yes i like it ah poor kevin she crooned poor little bardling you dont stand a chance chapter xvix something that sounded like a giant mosquito was droning away in his ears kevin came awake with a start ready to swat whatever but then he sank back in his chair realizing it was just the residue of yet another spell the bardling rubbed a tired hand over his face naitachal had been right it was turning into a long weary nights work even if it was the dark elf who had to do most of that work whatever it is that hes doing there had been a confusing barrage of spells so far some of them briefly entangling kevin in a whispery net of sound some of them blanketing him in comforting warmth some of themthe bardling shook his head he couldnt even interpret how some of them had felt naitachal stay still the dark elfs voice was thick with fatigue only a few more to go cant you stop and rest i mean i know ive been asleep half the time but you havent had a chance to so much as close your eyes naitachal smiled wryly thank you for your concern but the sooner i finish the lot the happier ill fed he began murmuring incomprehensible spellwords once more and kevin sighed feeling a new tingling traveling all through him a soothing sort of sensation odd but not at all alarming not at all as the bardling relaxed his eyes slid closed once more this time it was the total absence of strange sensations that woke him kevin straightened in his chair blinking in confusion at the faint gray light of notquite morning morning powers had the dark elf been working through the whole night without a pause he glanced towards where naitachal was slumped in his own chair eyes shut wish i could just let him sleep hes certainly earned it but theyd both agreed it wasnt such a good idea for anyone to think theyd been conspiring together naitachal kevin whispered then repeated a little more forcefully naitachal the dark elf opened his eyes with a groan yes im awake he staggered up from the chair straightening carefully adding with wry humor so weary i could sleep on my feet like a horse but awake you look terrible i wish you didnt have to wear yourself out like this aeye no one ever said magic was easy at least this way the sorceress isnt going to be able to turn you into her love slave kevin assumed that was meant to be a joke naitachal stretched every muscle plainly trying to force some energy back into himself then ran his fingers through his pale tangled mane remember though that these are only faint copies of true protective spells ive cast over you dont expect too much of them i dont dare put too blatantly powerful magics upon you carlotta would be sure to sense them but what may be lacking in force im making up in volume the weary blue eyes suddenly darkened with worry i hope i can do it the bardling assured him trying to sound more certain than he felt again i hope naitachal hit back a third yawn ay me id best get back to my own room before i fall over or before the servants start wondering whats going on till later kevin till later the bardling echoed uneasily whats wrong with naitachal lydia whod shed her finery for more comfortable tunic and breeches whispered that to kevin as they stood on a wide casde balcony pretending to be engrossed in an archery contest taking place in the courtyard below kevin stole a wary glance back to where the dark elf sat in as much concealing shadow as he could find up here on this sunny morning naitachals black cloak was wrapped tightly about his slender form the hood pulled forward to hide his face making him look like a truly sinister figure a sliver of darkness amid the light but kevin suspected the dark elf was actually just asleep with his eyes open what do you think the bardling retorted softly he applauded politely as one of the archers down in the courtyard below scored a near bullseye he was up all night casting spells on me ah right of course feel any different no but oh nice shot the woman called out she added so softly only kevin could hear not a decent archer in the lot huh and look at the way charinas eying you from the doorway like a cat watching a tasty little fish this fish has some surprises in store kevin thought or at least i hope i do the idea that the pretty young woman approaching him might really be a murderous sorceress seemed impossible on such a bright sunny day and yet a sudden nervous prickle racing up his spine kevin got courteously to his feet to bow to charina or whoever she really was my lady my so formal charinas glance at lydia was ever so subtly edged with contempt as she took in the womans warrior garb whats this i should think you would be down there too lady lydia are you not an archer to kevins ears she made that occupation sound as unsuitable for a lady as pigfarming lydia couldnt have missed the snub but she only laughed oh i hardly thought it fair to compete i mean im not one of the counts people but surely you would like a chance to demonstrate your skills it was a very thinly veiled command lydia only shrugged nope much nicer just to sit and watch besides at such a short distance how could i miss right kevin thank you lydia he thought gratefully the last thing he wanted was to be left alone with charina uh right ah but i think you really should go down there a suave voice purred kevin saw lydia tense as count volmar stepped forward to take her arm my dear young lady you would hardly wish to deprive us of the pleasure of watching a true professional at work now would you she shrugged free of the counts grip ill say the same thing i told the lady charina it doesnt seem fair i mean how is it going to look if a mere mercenary like myself beats your guys that hardly seems likely the count muttered miffed my archers are not exactly children but please he added urbane smile returning do give us a chance to judge your skill for ourselves it wasnt a request with a sigh and a glance at kevin lydia shouldered her bow and went down to join the other archers charina moved closer to the bardling with a pleased little coo but before she could take his arm a cheerful voice called out how goes it my lords my lady eliathanis kevin cried in relief the white elf swept down into a bow far more graceful than any human could have managed slanted eyes glinting with wry amusement he said what a fine day for an archery contest ah i see our own lydia is among the contestants you would have a better view of them down there charina suggested but eliathanis only smiled why no lady if you will forgive me for correcting you i have a much better view from up here a better view of everything fair face impassive the elf crossed his arms with the air of someone who has no intention of moving or being moved thats all well and good kevin thought uneasily seeing the anger flickering in charinas eyes apparently she and the count thought more forceful measures would be out of character just now but you and lydia and naitachal cant keep watching over me forever sooner or later danger or no the bardling knew he was going to have to face the sorceress all by himself it was sooner that night kevin found a guard at his door to protect him from unwelcome disturbances in the days that passed the bardling caught no more than distant glimpses of his friends but he tried to convince himself there was something comforting in knowing that they were taking turns watching over him even from afar not that mere watching was going to do any good if the sorceress decided to attack ah yes but charina wasnt showing any more interest in the bardling than a properly broughtup young lady might show in a young man she fancied in fact if it hadnt been for the undercurrent of uneasiness running through his mind kevin knew he probably would have enjoyed her attention or even amazing thought to have become a little surfeited by it somehow charina was managing to almost always be at his side the very image of a slightly spoiled but charming niece to a count cooing and fluttering until the bardling found himself wondering just why hed been foolish enough to be attracted to her in the first place but then i didnt really have a choice about it itwasnt realty charina i was attracted to after all or at least f dont think it was or ach he didnt know what to think any more kevin wandered blindly through the castle gardens for the moment blessedly alone the gravel path crunching under his shoes sweet spicy herbal scents filling his nose and puzzled over the fact that the girl or woman or whatever she was hadnt tried anything blatantly sorcerous on him or had she now chat he thought about it kevin could have sworn that from time to time during the week hed felt the eeriest tingling as though naitachals protective armor of spells was being tested again and again so far that armor had held up oh nonsense the whole thing was probably the product of his own overwrought imagination how could charina be anyone but charina she couldnt but then again maybe kevin shook his head impatiently enough wavering whatever was happening or not happening he didnt dare let his guard down the week of celebration was over today and if charina really was carlotta this would be her last chance to try ensnaring him and if she couldnt get the manuscript from him then she would surely try to the bardling nearly jumped straight into the air when a soft hand brushed his arm kevin charinas sweet voice asked is anything wrong uh nno no of course not trying to get his to shout to her that he wasnt under her power as she believed thank the powers that naitachals antibeguilement spells had workedand that theyd been too subtle for carlotta to detect thank the powers as well that carlotta too had been constrained to subtlety otherwise even his feigned cooperation would have been transparently false i only hope eliathanis can let the others know i might be in trouble the bardling glanced at carlotta and caught just for an instant a suspicious glint of hardness in those lovely blue eyes a hardness all out of place for one other supposed youth and innocence a hardness that smacked of sorcery really big trouble kevin amended unhappily chapter xx come on kevin carlotta batted her eyelashes at him in a way the bardling might have found adorableif it wasnt such an incongruous gesture on the part of a sorceress whod kill him if he made one wrong move why if i didnt know better she chirped id think you were trying to avoid being alone with me carlotta giggled girlishly thats not true now is it uh noof course not yes dear powers yes how am i going to get out of this alive not by letting carlotta think there was something wrong with her beguilement spells that was sure but what else could he do there wasnt much time to waste yet his thoughts seemed to be racing around and around his mind like so many terrified wild things the only thing kevin could decide to do was play the befuddled bumpkin ha that shouldnt be so difficult right now it was going to be far easier to fake stupidity and bedazzlement than to say or do anything clever arent there any servants around anyone who might suggest that the niece of a count shouldnt be alone with a young man no of course not that would be far too simple the casde corridors were as empty as though there wasnt anyone else alive in the whole place besides kevin thought wearily all the servants were probably under carlottas control anyhow all too soon they reached the library kevin tried the handle the door seems to be locked he said stalling desperately for time no its not its never locked here let me see carlotta tried the handle which turned with treacherous ease she glanced sharply at kevin and the bardling gave her a weak smile must have been stuck well it isnt stuck now come on but kevin stopped short in the doorway hunting frantically for some other excuse cacharina gods hed almost called her by her real name charina i uh i chink im getting a headache maybe tomorrow really would be a better rime to dont be silly the sooner we take care of the manuscriptoh dont look at me with such horror kevin i meant to a scribe she smiled teasingly what did you think meant iuh anyhow the sooner we get rid of the manuscript the sooner we can do what we want whatever we want like this without warning carlotta threw her arms around his neck her lips all at once temptingly close to his temptingly the bardling thought in panic her body pressed against his the sweet scent other perfume filled his nose at any other time he would have done almost anything to be embraced like this by a lovely young woman but nowpowers id be safer fussing a spider but if i dont fuss her shell know somethings wrong just before he forced himself to choose the lesser peril charina pushed him away giggling you havent got a headache or if you do it will go away now that were out of the garden its just the result of breathing in the smells of all those herbs her smile was a marvel of fake innocence some of them make me sneeze every time i go near them if the cook didnt need them for his recipes never mind lets find that silly old manuscript and get out of here oh please kevin told the manuscript hide from me the way you did before he couldnt pretend not to search not with carlotta watching his every move oh no even chough kevin realized she didnt really know what the manuscript looked like she certainly could tell what it didnt look like he couldnt try to fool her with the wrong tide and so the bardling did the only thing he could and examined each and every item in the library as slowly and carefully as possible delaying like this was a dangerous game kevin was all too well aware that carlottas sweet expression hid barely restrained impatience if he pushed her too far an age passed or so it seemed while he searched the library then a second age this one surely long enough to wear away rock but at last to kevins despair he realized he had gone through every manuscript in the library save one as though his hand had a life all its own the bardling watched with fascinated horror as it pulled the manuscript from the shelf feeling the strange magical tingling that told him what he held even before he read the title the study of ancient magic of course you pick a wonderful time to come out of hiding he told the manuscript with bitter sarcasm kevin carlotta snapped what do you chink youre doing why are you staring like that at an empty shelf but its not oh stop clowning there was very little of the innocent young girl in that sharp command i dont want to spend all day here get on with your search bewildered kevin turned to face her the manuscript in his hands carlottas eyes widened in shock youyou have it she gasped in the next moment the sorceress had herself back under control here let me have it she hadnt been able to see the manuscript until he took it off the shelf stunned by this new bit of magic the bardling couldnt find a thing to say except an awkward uh sorry charina kevin im not in the mood for games give it to me iuh cant kevin give it to me the bardling backed away towards the door stammering the first words that came into his head ii have to keep it tototo take it to my room and i dont think so suspicion flickered in her eyes youve figured out the truth little boy havent you iddont oh but you do a pity there wasnt the slightest trace of youth or innocence in her voice now as kevin watched in fascinated terror he saw charinas form grow and alter in a swift dizzying blur of shape and color the woman who stood before him now looked nothing like the girl shed been a few moments before she was tall and coldly exquisite efface and form her long hair flaming red her green eyes hard and chill and of course she doesnt look anything like charina his mind gibbered charinawas carlotta all along what had naitachal said aiee yes if she changed to her right shape it was probably the prelude to her casting some major spell because powerful spellcasting shattered illusions no time to think but in that last midnight session the bardling and the others had worked out every detail of what they were going to do and oh he was glad of that preparation now if he stood staring at her like a fearparalyzed fool shed strike him down if he tried to run with the manuscript like the naive boy whod first left bracklin shed strike him down instead kevin simply tossed the manuscript out the librarys open window praying tichki had had time to get into place that was obviously the last thing carlotta had expected she let out a shriek of disbelieving rage her sorcerous concentration broken by shock nows my chance kevin broke into a run praying he could get away before she regained control and blasted him behind him the bardling heard her scream again this time in sheer frustration and felt his skin prickle as she gathered power to her before she could blast him kevin darted out the door slamming it behind him knowing that wasnt going to stop her for more than a moment he wasnt a fighter he wasnt a magician powers powers the others had better be ready to help out they were as carlotta tore the door open eliathanis appeared seemingly from nowhere moving with inhuman speed he pounced pinning carlotta in his arms muffling her attempts to scream with a hand but of course he couldnt hope to hold her for long get out of here kevin the white elf shouted then he gasped in pain as the sorceress bit him kevin glanced back over his shoulder and saw with a chill of horror that now her mouth was free for spellcasting a shouted word sent eliathanis flying the bardling stumbled to an anguished stop sure he was about to see carlotta slay the white elf she spat out a short twisting sentenceand a bolt of dark fire flashed from her hand but before it could strike the fallen elf naitachal sprang forward out of the shadows cloak swirling dramatically behind him arms raised in denial the sorcerous fire recoiled from a sudden unseen wall of force smashing instead into a wall with a roar like thunder sending broken stone crashing down in a wild cloud of dust that forced carlotta back into the shelter of the library before she could recover eliathanis had scrambled to his feet the two elves slapped palms in a quick moment of triumph then took to their heels catching up with kevin that noise is going to rouse the whole castle naitachal cried hurry to the gates lydia should have fast horses ready shed better eliathanis added if we dont get away now too late carlotta had left her refugebut shed left it as charina dusty and disheveled pathetically calling for help sheshes saying we assaulted her kevin gasped and used sorcery to boot wonderful naitachal muttered just what we need as they came out into a courtyard beneath a dramatically overcast sky eliathanis stopped short here come the guards no ones going to believe us against poor sweet little charina weve got to split up he gave kevin a shove up that stairway hurry naitachal you go that way ill go this see you outside we hope kevin scrambled up the steep stone stairway a stone wall on his left open space on the right hearing a troop of guards clattering up behind him and wound up on a narrow rampart between two towers which way which way he turned left at random and dove through the narrow door into the tower staggering to a walk half blinded by the sudden darkness his foot found the lip of a narrow staircase spiraling down but then kevin stopped so sharply he nearly went tumbling down the stairs guards were climbing up this way too the bardling raced back out across the rampart blinking frantically in the sudden return to daylightand nearly ran into the arms of the guards whod followed him up the first stairway he kicked and squirmed and twisted wriggling his way through so swiftly none of them had a chance to grab him and dove into the second tower oh dawn oh damn theyre among up this stairway too he wasnt going to surrender he didnt dare not with carlotta awaiting him so kevin took the only option open and raced up the spiraling stairway stumbling on the narrow steps banging knees and elbows struggling up and up till at last gasping he burst out into the open on the towers fiat top powers now what do i do the bardling glanced wildly this way and that a surge of vertigo overwhelming him as he realized just how high up he was the tower top suddenly felt impossibly narrow and insecure while the casde was spread out in a dizzying panorama far below him swarming with frenetic life kevin tensed as he recognized two people out of that swarm naitachal and eliathanis two dollsize figures from up here looked like they were having a wonderful time they moved with elven speed and grace almost like a matched pair of dancers one dark one fair far swifter than the merely human guards trying to catch them the bardling could have sworn he saw eliathanis grin heard naitachals laugh come trailing thinly up to him the elves took a moment to slap palms yet again then scurried off in opposite directions kevin didnt have a moments doubt that they were going to escape and enjoy doing it sure great now they can admit theyre friends fm glad theyre having funbut meanwhile fm trapped up here here came the guards kevin turned to face them back against the low balustrade bracing himself sick at heart knowing that throwing himself to his death would be a kinder fate than letting himself fall into carlottas hands jump wonderful now he was hearing voices kevin jump strong little fingers pinched his arm so hard he yelpedtichki come on you idiot bardling trust me jump powers what if this was some truly sadistic form of a fairy jokesee the trusting human go splat but the bardling knew he had to trust her what other choice was there all at once dreadfully calm kevin climbed up onto the towers narrow balustrade the world a dizzy blur around him as the guards cried out in sudden shock the bardling jumped blindly into space chapter xxi kevin jumped as far out and away from the casde as he could for one wild terrifying thrilling moment he was falling free the earth surging up to meet him and was sure he was dead then tichki was beside him shapechanged to human size catching him in her arms her wings backwatering frantically those wings didnt have the strength to actually carry her weight and his together but slowly painfully slowly the fairy began to check his fall but it wasnt going to work kevin thought in panic they were running out of time and space tichki cried go limp its not going to be a soft landing kevin hit not as hard as he had feared and started helplessly rolling down the steep hill from the castle sky and ground whirling in a dizzy circle the bardling frantically snatched at grass and rock trying to slow his fall only to end up with a jolt against a tough little patch of bushes aching trying to remember how to breathe deeply afraid of what he would find when he tried to move kevin rolled over onto his back eyes shut wanting nothing but to be left alone to die but strong hands were about his shoulders forcing him to his feet he opened his eyes to find himself supported by eliathanis and clutching the manuscript that had somehow wound up in his hands again during his fall are you all right the white elf asked worriedly then added without waiting for his reply come on lydia has our horses down there where the hill levels outweve got to get away before the guards have a chance to mount and come after us before carlotta comes after us naitachal corrected wrylyas good a team as we make cousinelfw he flashed a quick grin at eliathanis who grinned back id just as soon not tackle her again kevin let all that pass without really listening to it at least he realized trying to muster his stunned thoughts hed landed on grass not rock and nothing seemed to be broken after all tucking the hard weight of the manuscript securely inside his tunic the bardling struggled down the hill to where lydia waited and pulled himself into a saddle wincing as strained muscles complained tichki here shrunken back to her normal size she was draped wearily in front of lydia were all here ive got your lute the warrior woman added as the bardling quickly slung it over his back lydia added sharply now lets ride they went down the rest of that steep hill at breakneck speed kevin praying none of the horses slipped or caught a hoof behind him he could hear alarm gongs starting to tear the air apart but weve got a good head start we should make it into the forests shelter before a brilliant flash of light made him start so violently he almost lost his seat thinking sorcery but when the flash was followed by a vicious dap of thunder he realized the threatening storm was upon them a wild wet gust of wind slammed into the horses making them stagger were saved lydia shouted gleefully no eliathanis cried his eyes all at once wide and unseeing there is no safety except in the grave dont say that naitachal snapped ive seen quite enough of graves thank you eliathanis seemed to come back to himself with a rush i fear you may see yet another my friend what are you saying naitachal laughed ive never yet seen a white elf who was worth a copper coin at prophesy but to kevins surprise he thought he caught a trace of fear behind the mockery and the very real hint of otherworldly sorrow lingering in eliathanis eyes sent a chill through the bardling and made him add in a panicky rush its all right really youll see well be able to hide out from anyone even an army in the forest will you the sudden sharp voice made the horses shy whinnying in fright or will you die with beautifully dramatic timing a second bolt of lightning split the sky deafened by the following crack of thunder kevin stared at this sudden apparition in stunned disbelief there was no doubt at all who it was her elegant face was set in its cold sorcerous lines her green gown whipped about her in the everrising storm wind that made the locks other long hair writhe like flame carlotta bbut how she is a sorceress naitachal reminded the bardling drily the dark elfs blue eyes were flickering with their own sorcerous red embers i thought we were escaping just a bit too easily listen to me lydia murmured when i give the signal kick your horses into a gallop dont be silly naitachal began but lydia was already shouting and now the startled horses shot forward as one but before they could reach carlotta she shouted out savage words of powerand a huge wall of flame roared up the horses screamed in terror shying wildly fighting their riders kevin lost a stirrup nearly smashed his nose against his animals neck hanging on for all he was worth told you naitachals words were chopped off as his horse reared making him look like a dark legend against the dark sky his cloak billowing out like bat wings wheres carlotta lydia shouted clinging to her plunging horse like a burr who knows tichki wings beating frenetically couldnt quite climb high enough to see over the magical flame thermals from the suddenly heated air pushing her away every time she tried somewhere behind all that illusion the bardling yelled even though he could feel the fires heat and smell its smoke struggling with his hysterical horse its got to be illusion no illusion the dark elf finally managed to bring his mount back to all four feet she doesnt care if she bums down the whole forest as long as she stops us long enough foryes curse her here they come a new bolt of lightning blazed out over what looked like every one of the counts menatarms knights and common guards alike the wall of flame didnt seem to be giving them pause not having seen it created they probably just thought it lightningstrike we cant fight all of them lydia cried over the crash of thunder naitachal how far does this fire extend the dark elf shrugged angrily i dont know the spell carlotta used it could extend for leagues then well ride for leagues dammit the woman kicked her horse into a run riding parallel to the fire and the others followed but a new wall of flame roared up before them cutting off their escape kevins horse screamed in panic and the bardling nearly lost his seat all over again struggling to stay in the saddle he shot an anxious glance up at the cloudheavy sky the rain curse it wheres the rain it would put out this fire and give us a fighting chance to get out of this trap before hey no his horse had suddenly decided it had quite enough of flames the animal whirled before kevin could stop it and bolted blindly back towards the castleand the waiting enemy the bardling frantically sawed at the reins wait wait hed heard somewhere that if a horse ran away with you you were supposed to pull it around in one big circle oh sure easily said but the animal had the bit in its teeth and a neck like iron and in another moment horse and rider were going to be within bowshot he was already close enough to see the fiat madness in the soldiers eyes to wonder with a quick thrill of horror how carlotta had managed to subvert a whole casde sorcery something as simple as drugs in the communal water supply oh powers it didnt matter now because this idiot of a horse was going to get him killed kevin was all set to jump from the animals back and hope he didnt break his neck when the drumming of hoofs sounded behind him and a second horse came rushing up beside his the bardling caught a quick glimpse of an elegant profile silky golden hair eliathanis but then the bardling got a better look at the white elfs face and nearly gaspedeliathanis eyes were blank green flame and his teeth were bared in a fierce inhuman grin hes gone fey just like a hero in an old ballad hes gone deathmad fey and doesnt care what happens to him no no that was ridiculous because being fey meant being doomed and surely eliathanis wasntnone of them were the white elf flattened himself along his horses neck hand snaking out to catch kevins mount by the bridle eliathanis sat back in the saddle forcing both animals out of their frantic run turning them in a half circle back towards the fire he never had that strength before never and the illomened word fey returned to the bardlings mind no he would not accept that still grinning that strange fierce alien grin eliathanis released kevins mount with a slap on the side of its neck both horses raced as one as the enemy gave chase and ahead of them kevin saw naitachals lips move in what was surely the beginning of a spell they were almost out of range of the archers almost without warning lightning flashed and thunder rumbled directly overhead as kevin and eliathanis rejoined the others the skies at last opened a heavy curtain of rain plunged down and the walls of fire hissed under the impact sending up vast clouds of steam but theres still too much flame lydia cried naitachal cant you do something the sharpness other voice made the dark elf start i was doing something he said biting off each word till you broke my concentration naitachal glanced back at the dying flames forward at the charging enemy and swore in his native tongue we need more timebut theyre not going to give us any suddenly his dark sorcerous sword was in his hand terrible odds my friends but theyre not going to get any better so arent they whateliathanis no kevin gasped oh no dont you cant with a wild shout in the elven tongue eliathanis charged the foe his hair flamed out behind him blazing gold against the darkness his mail and outthrust sword and the hide of his rainslick horse were molten silver and time seemed to stop there was nothing living save for that one shining rider on a shining horse so stunned was the enemy that they made no effective move to defend themselves eliathanis sword was a brand sweeping through their ranks and wherever it struck a soldier fell the fires low enough to cross naitachal muttered hands clenched on the hilt of his sword come back you idiot youve bought us enough rime come back before they realize youre only fleshandblood as if hed heard eliathanis turned and forced his horse back into a gallop but the horse was weary from fright and effort it stumbled on the slick grass caught itself stumbled again hes still within bowshot naitachals voice was tight with alarm hes not going to make it yes he is kevin heard his own voice come out high and shrill like the voice of a child begging for a happy ending no the dark elf murmured and then in wild anguish eliathanis no even as naitachal forced his horse forward kevin saw an arrow flash saw eliathanis fall heartsick he watched the dark elf lean low over his horses neck urging the animal to greater speed naitachal dropped the knotted reins on the horses neck then bent out and down catching the fallen elf and pulling him up across his saddle bow as kevin watched breath caught in his throat the dark elf came thundering back in a storm of arrows to the bardlings horror he saw naitachal suddenly seem to falter in the saddle hes been hit too dear powers almost directly before them the dark elfs horse went down naitachal fell free eliathanis in his arms lydia was first to reach their side kneeling in the mud staring at the white elf kevin heard her sharp inhalation and saw her face pale beneath its tan naitachal come on weve got to get out of here the dark elf glared up at her we cant leave eliathanis we must no naitachal look at him her voice quivered with pity look more than one arrow caught him hes dead naitachal eliathanis is dead he must have died almost instantly the dark elf was too well acquainted with death to deny its presence now damn them it was so low a growl kevin almost didnt hear it ann damn them very carefully naitachal let eliathanis body sag to the ground then looked up and for once his eyes were the terrible cruel empty eyes of a true dark elf if they want death he murmured then death they shall have oh dont the bardling cried in sudden panic terrified that they were about to lose naitachal forever bo darkness terrified of what evil he might release but the elf was already on his feet striding boldly forward into the open heedless of the arrows raining about him he called out harsh ugly commanding words catching the storm winds twisting them to his use heightening them focusing them turning them to a savage terrible frenzy the attacking army was swept back by the whirlwind horses screaming men shouting as they were hurled off their feet and still the winds fury grew until no naitachal stop it struggling beneath the weight of wind tearing at him whipping the hair painfully into his face dragging the very air from his lungs kevin fought his way to naitachals side youve got to stop this the dark elfs eyes were blazing with sorcerous power totally wild totally without mercy he showed not the slightest sign hed heard kevin naitachal listen to me kevin shouted with all his might to be heard above the roar of the storm those men arent evil they dont have any choice in what theyre doing carlotta enslaved them they slew my friend the dark elfs voice was inhumanly chill i shall slay them and me kevin grabbed naitachals arm only to be flung aside as if he was weightless gasping the bardling forced his way back to face the dark elf directly are you going to kill me too are you going to kill lydia and tichki you will if you dont stop this storm do you want us to die well ddammit answer me do you want to kill us a glimmer of life flickered in the terrible eyes no naitachal said and all at once his voice was his own again and infinitely weary no of course not as he removed his will from them the unnaturally fierce winds faded faded were gone in the sudden stillness naitachal staggered and kevin cried out youre hurt not badly not as badly as as hhe cant be hurt now kevin said awkwardly but we can he put a tentative hand on naitachals arm and when the dark elf didnt push him away began to pull naitachal with him its going to take some time for the soldiers to regroup but weve got to get into the forests shelter before they do yes the dark elfs voice was dull with exhaustion but he stopped by eliathanis body we cannot leave him here lydia tried to take naitachals free arm only to let go when he hissed with pain theres no time to bury him she said gently we dont have a choice naitachal come on tichki added i dont think carlotta hung around to watch but she could be anywhere and her guys are going to come after us weve got to get out of here we cannot leave him here not like this but what stand back the dark elfs eyes were wild with anguish stand back i say so fierce was that command that lydia and kevin hurried aside and even tichki kept still naitachal began his harsh spell once more but this time the bardling could have sworn some of the words were different he was right lightning lanced down out of the stormy sky enfolding eliathanis body in blinding bluewhite fire naitachal gave a long shaken sigh i dont know the burial customs of his clan but surely they would find no shame in a funeral pyre of skyborn flame surely not the bardling murmured this time when kevin hesitantly pulled at his arm the dark elf went willingly chapter xxii this was not kevin mused wearily the type of adventure of which the bards sang oh carlotta wasnt making any further move to stop them at least there was that for all the bardling knew she had been blown aside by the whirlwind like her soldiers or so exhausted by her magics she needed to rest but that hardly made matters easy they had only two horses left tired horses one of them burdened with both kevin and naitachal and as the animals forced their way into the dense underbrush of the forest lydia said suddenly this isnt working weve got to let the horses go no kevin protested yes they can barely keep their feet as it is and this is pretty dense forest a horse cant get through without leaving a trail any child could follow besides we can hide better on foot but naitachals too tired i can manage the dark elf muttered slipping off his mount reluctantly kevin followed lydia slapped the horses on their rumps and the animals trotted wearily away watching them go the bardling thought with a flash of wry humor its not fair heroes arent supposed to scuttle through the underbrush yes and by any rights at all naitachals sorceries should have torn the storm apart too instead the rain continued to pour unrelentingly down and the stubbornly stormy sky turned the forest into a nearly nightblack maze of roots and thorns all of which seemed determined to trip up the intruders or tear their flesh ill scout ahead tichki said shortly im not nightblind like you humans as she flew though she trailed behind her a steady stream of what kevin assumed could only be curses in her native tongue even though the thick curtain of leaves cut off the worst of the rain her wings were plainly still sodden enough to hamper her flying come on she shot back no laggards such a caring gentle friend lydia muttered she and kevin followed after as best they could naitachal dazed and exhausted somehow managed to keep pace with them but if we dont find shelter soon kevin realized hes going to collapseand w with him but just when the bardling had decided they must have died and been condemned to an eternity of dark and wet and endless thorny paths tichki came fluttering back she landed on lydias shoulder panting wings drooping wearily but kevin saw her sharp little teeth flash in a grin shelter she crowed just up ahead a big old shell of a tree hurry up youll see she was right the oak must have been truly ancient incredibly vast in girth and all but dead time and age had worn a deep hollow in the base a natural cave just big enough for two humans one elf and a fairy to fit inside it smelled strongly of animals and decaying wood but it was blessedly dry and carpeted with a thick layer of crumbled leaves kevin sure he was soaked to the very bone couldnt make up his mind whether to remove his cloak and freeze or keep the soggy thing wrapped about him and stay wet hopefully he thought the combined body warmth of four living beings would warm the treecave soon enough naitachal the dark elf had fallen to his knees with a faint groan lydia hastily dropped to his side all right i know youre hurt let me see that arm in here tichki cut in thought you humans couldnt see in the dark she added in sudden alarm youre not going to try lighting a fire in a tree dyou think im mad ino thats too easy a jest kevin bit his lip nervously just barely able to make out naitachals crumpled form in the darkness ill try the watchwood melody again he said in sudden inspiration you know the lightspell i think i can get it to last longer this time there wasnt much room to take the lute out of its case let alone play it but by squirming his way back into the treecave kevin managed to hit the proper notes and chords he began to sing hesitantly at first his singing voice feeling rusty from disuse then more strongly secure that the storm outside would drown out the sound and praying that his small magics wouldnt be noticeable to carlotta and bardic magic stirred within himthe treecave began to glow with a feint steady light and lydia nodded in satisfaction now she told naitachal you will let me see that arm the dark elf eyes closed made no move to stop her kevin winced at the sight of the long slash running halfway down naitachals upper arm but lydia didnt seem particularly worried arrow just grazed you that arms going to be sore for a time but hopefully thatll be about the worst of it she paused you arent hiding any other wounds are you no it was a weary whisper of sound my cloak cook most of the damage ah so it did look at those holes the woman held up a fold of black fabric and gave a soft whistle you were lucky my friend naitachal winced another was not he murmured faintly ah well iuhdont think eliathanis would begrudge us a chance to take care of the living before thebefore we before we mourn the dead lydia do what you think necessary to this slash then let me rest she blinked at his suddenly cold tone sure the woman hunted through the pouches hanging from her belt for a time oh damn my healing herbs are all back in the castle some oh so helpful ladys maid must have tried to neaten up my stuff when i wasnt watching lydia paused holding up a small flask i do still have this though water tichki piped up should think youd had enough of water by now its not water believe me ah the brandy howd the maid miss that i dont know but its a good thing she did naitachal you want to take a good swig of this then bite down on something this is going to hurt like hell but at least it should ward off woundsickness kevin winced in sympathy nearly losing his hold on the lightspell as she poured the brandy on the arrowgash naitachal never made a sound instead endurance finally exhausted he simply fainted there now lydia said after a moment thats bandaged as best can manage what with nothing really dry you can stop singing now kevin the light was already fading because the bardlings voice was quavering so much he could barely hold the tune he broke off abruptly and the treecave was plunged back into darkness kevin what is it boy whats wrong i ddont i eliathanis oh hell kid dont be embarrassed nothing wrong with grieving be you woman or man but kevin battled with himself till hed fought back the tears ii dont understand him who naitachal how can he suddenly turn so cold eliathanis was his friend why isnt he grieving ach kevin lydias voice was very gentle he is that coldness was to hide his real feelings look you ive seen a lot of people die too many she added softly thats part of being a warrior ive mourned a lot of them too and thats also part of being a warrior true grief isnt something you can command it comes out when and where it will all at once lydia gave a long tired sigh you know something i enjoy traveling and all that but times like this i really wish i had a place to come home to she stopped for a thoughtful moment then added with an embarrassed little laugh like that castle we just left if it wasnt already inhabited by that bitchwitch and her buddy it might make a good place to settle despite all the hassle the place itself had a nice homey feel to it or do you think thats too crazy not at all kevin straightened staring in her direction in the darkness there were times in that casde when i was really miserable i admit it but underneath it all even with those two running things and those spoiled brats of squires there really is something there that could make it a good place to live working by touch he fit the lute back into its case ah well lets not dream about catching the moon as master aidan would say lydia chuckled softly oh i dont know about that dreams arent such a bad thing to have and sometimeswho knows sometimes you do catch that moon kevin heard the dried leaves rustle as she stirred come on kid enough talk have a suspicion were going to be leading an active life in the next few days so lets try to get some sleep while we can if we huddle together with naitachal we should be warm enough hungry bruised and battered lydia added wryly but warm enough kevin the fierce hiss brought the bardling awake with a start naitachal the treecave wasnt as totally dark as it had been but even so the dark elfs eyes still glinted with their eerie red light what kevin sat bolt upright carlotta has she she hasnt found us not yet but i felt her sorcery brush us just now and she has set loose her hunters not human hunters tichki added perching beside kevin for a moment not all of them i sensed that too and i dont think we care to meet any of them the dark elf added wryly so come we must hurry at least it had stopped raining they were given that much of a boon but the day was a waking nightmare of being forever on the run slipping on mud and wet leaves struggling through underbrush so dense it seemed impassible with hardly a chance to snatch a sip from a stream hardly a chance to swallow a handful of berries lydia experienced hunter that she was led the way showing them how to throw off anything that might be following by scent by crossing and recrossing streams how to avoid leaving footprints by running along rock or fallen trees ha why didnt i think of this before tichki suddenly exclaimed during one of their brief pauses to rest i can help ill hide our trail altogether not by magic naitachal warned sharply gashed arm cradled against his chest carlotta will surely sense the use of any spells no no you dont understand you know the trick i have of influencing minds the way i did with the guards back in westerin well thats not magic strictly speaking not really its aa skill of the mind sort of an unmagic to make people unthink she shook her head impatiently i cant put it more dearly in human terms but i should be able to make the trackers unthink the trailand there wont be a trace of magic for carlotta to find carlotta lydia reminded her dourly is part fairy im not taking bets on anything she can or cant do go ahead tichki try your unthinking unmagic the rest of us are going to keep right on watching our steps tichki grinned and darted off eh all right kevin naitachal lydia snapped getting to her feet rest times over we have some more hiking to do by the time darkness began to fall kevin was only too glad to sink to the ground in the rocky little grove lydia had found beside him naitachal sat in weary silence shrouded in his cloak but the woman paced restlessly about checking the lay of the land in her usual wary fashion were not likely to find a better place the dark elfs voice rose eerily out of the shadow of his hood no she agreed hands on hips its a pretty good spot for camping easily defended too what with the rocks making a natural wall on one side and there is a stream nearby naitachal added possibly with edible water plants kevin hadnt thought anything could have gotten him to his feet but the thought of something to eat made him scramble up ill go no kid you wouldnt know whats safe to eat ill go she glanced around at the everdarkening forest you think you can manage some sort of smokeless little fire naitachal of course when lydia returned with double armfuls of vegetation it was to a rabbit cooking over the barely visible campfire the dark elf had concocted where did that come from the woman asked it popped its head up to look at us kevin said he added modestly i threw a rock at it i was lucky soo lydias teeth flashed in her indomitable grin tonight we feast a whir of wings marked tichkis return just in time im starved but it was a strangely somber meal now that he had a moment to relax even a little kevin found himself constantly expecting to see eliathanis he caught himself thinking we must remember to tell him aboutor i wonder what he would think aboutand had to force himself not to keep looking over his shoulder for the white elf at last after their scanty dinner was done and the fire had been banked to coals the bardling couldnt stand it any more hardly aware of the others he took out his lute and let his fingers move across the strings at the back of his mind kevin was vaguely aware that he wasnt trying for bardic music he wasnt even trying for any music worthy of a bard at all but somehow music took form beneath his fingers and here was eliathanis stopping in surprise the sun turning his hair to molten gold and here was eliathanis bending in worry over the fallen naitachal and here was eliathanis grinning at the dark elfin sudden friendship and here was eliathanis freely joyously giving his life so his friends might live all at once kevins vision was blurring and his hands were shaking so much he couldnt play any more face wet he stilled the strings to silence with a palm then took a deep shaken breath and dried his eyes drained and a little awed by what his mind and hands had evoked he glanced up aware of the others only now and slightly embarrassed at their regard lydia too was wiping her eyes and even tichki was sitting still wines wrapped about her like an iridescent cape naitachal had his back to them all huddled nearly double in his black cloak so silent that the bardling wondered if he had even heard the music but then kevin heard the dark elf murmur fiercely as though angry with himself there is no time for this there never is lydia retorted the shrouded figure straightened slightly at that and kevin caught a hash of anguished eyes but instead of the sharp reply the bardling was expecting naitachal asked simply does it always hurt like this always lydia paused frowning slightly what have you never lost a friend before naitachal glared have you forgotten who and what i am i have never had a friend before you have some now kevin reminded him softly but the dark elf plainly embarrassed by his own grief pulled his hood savagely forward hiding his face once more i intend to sleep naitachal said shortly advise you to do the same kevin and lydia exchanged wry glances the woman shrugged hes got a point she hesitated for a long awkward while then added quietly kevin for the music and all that i ah hell what im trying to say is thank you the huddle of black cloak stirred faintly so am i naitachal admitted softly then was silent once more chapter xxiii night passed into day and day into night and the fugitives continued to flee through the forest tichkis unmagic did seem to be throwing off carlottas aim when it came to any direct sorcery but her trackers remained grimly on the trail once kevin hiding flat in the underbrush not even daring to breathe caught a glimpse of them squat powerful sharpfanged beings monstrous humanogre hybrids that sniffed the ground like so many deadly hounds if he fell into their ugly hands the bardling was pretty sure he wouldnt have to worry about carlotta any longer that time the trackers missed their prey completely but no place was safe for long kevin thanked the powers for tichki who confused those trackers as best one fairy could and for lydia who somehow kept moving her friends from concealment to concealment without their getting caught skillfully doubling back and forth on their tracks like some hunted wild thing which she is kevin thought wearily which we all are i cant remember the last time i had a good meal or a full nights sleep ha and if i dont get a bath pretty soon those trackers are going to be able to just nose me out what was truly frustrating was knowing he bore the manuscript holding the spell to destroy carlottaand yet not being able to do anything about it when they came to a temporary hiding place a crusheddown thicket that deer had used for a bed kevin pulled the manuscript out in desperation and showed it to naitachal what do you make of that the dark elf had grown almost haggard during the chase skin drawn tightly over the high cheekbones and eyes glittering eerily from under the shadow of his hood let me see he barely moved the arm the arrow had grazed and kevin felt a little pang of worry shoot through him naitachal its nothing the dark elf insisted as he had every time one of the others had tried to examine the wound give me the manuscript he studied it for a long puzzled moment then raised his head frowning i cant make anything of the text kevin and i mean that quite literally theres magic here all right but its keyed strictly to you the glyphs wont hold still long enough for me to read them only if you can copy the spell out for me can i hope to do something with it the dark elfs eyes glittered with a sudden cold rage and once the spell is deciphered i shall be the one to deliver it his words were made all the more chilling by being delivered in a quiet totally controlled voice we owe eliathanis this much his death shall be avenged in full upon carlotta and the traitor count her ally uhyyes it shall kevin was almost positive that the weird unexpected words in elfish had to be the components of the spell he could copy those out all right but on what and with what wait when i was making the copy back in the library i tucked the parchment into my lute case for safekeeping ha yes it was still there in the pocket meant for music scores and with it a small flask of ink as well a twig should make a decent enough brush and so every time lydia deemed it safe to stop kevin worked feverishly to extract the spell from the manuscript making as many copies as he could hiding one each time the party had to move onthe trackers cant possibly discover all our shelters and hopefully someone will find the spell and be able to complete it if were caught oror failed but what a weird spell it seemed to be kevin curious showed naitachal one elfish glyph and wasnt really surprised when the dark elf shook his head it looks something like elfish yes but you must have made some mistake that odd notation just to the left of the glyph doesnt belong to any dialect of elfish i know thats just the way its written in the manuscript kevin protested seeah never mind i forgot im the only one who can see it just what he needed another worry this one that somehow he was copying the whole thing wrong making the spell useless but there wasnt anything to do but continue and at last at their next brief sanctuary kevin breathed a great sigh of relief its done ive got the whole spell copied out naitachal now you can naitachal the dark elf was sagging against a tree as though all at once coo weak to move its nothing a moments dizziness nothing hell lydia erupted its that arm of yours isnt k she made a move towards it but naitachal waved her away we dont have the time for this he stepped away from the tree now quite steady on his feet let me see the spell taking the scrap of parchment from the bardling he added once i have it memorized the dark elf stopped dead what in the name of all the powers is this thing this matches no spell ive ever seen all these weird notations kevin straightened so suddenly he nearly rapped his head on a low branch notations he echoed regular notations in front of every word what if suddenly wild with suspense the bardling cried let me see that again yes yes dear powers yes i never stopped to really think about what i was copying but do you know what these notations are theyre music notes this isnt elfish at all no no its bardic magic and this spell is meant to be sung naitachals eyes flashed with excitement f course it is i should have realizedbut its also untried you realize what that means dont you that its dangerous oh indeed you will have to get very close to carlotta to even try it and then if it backlashes as some spells do it could kill you if it doesnt work at all carlotta certainly will kill you after all that had happened so far kevin knew he no longer thought of himself as a hero not even as being very brave but bravery had very little to do with this carlotta had killed a friend and would surely kill many many more people if she made her bid for power ill deliver the spell the bardling said quietly no matter what it costs sure but how lydia asked were stuck here in the forest and even though we havent seen a trace of hose damned persistent trackers weve shaken them tichki interrupted you dunk im pretty sure theyre still after us and we cannot risk letting ourselves be captured naitachals voice was all at once so thick with strain that kevin stared at him in alarm are you yes yes the dark elf said impatiently im fine as fine as one can be without enough to eat or enough time to rest naitachal made what was obviously a mighty effort to rouse himself if we are taken there is a good chance none of us will live long enough to even see carlotta true lydia shrugged what will be as the saying goes will be it looks like the only thing we can do is just go on and hope we meet up with someone along the way who can help us time for scouting duty tichki said wryly and darted ahead as kevin and lydia followed on foot lydia whispered in the bardlings ear i dont like the looks of naitachal if he isnt ill ill trade my sword for a loom i know kevin murmured even his eyes look funny yeah feverglazed lydia weve got to do something got any suggestions he denies theres anything wrong and he wont even let me look at his arm the woman gave a wry little shrug its that damned sorcerers pride and as the day progressed it was surely only a sorcerers will that kept naitachal going but all at once a fallen branch twisted under the dark elfs foot as he struggled to catch his balance his wounded arm struck against a tree trunk with a choked cry the dark elf collapsed to one knee oh hell lydia tore at the makeshift bandage even as naitachal weakly tried to fend her off stop fighting me youre burning up with fever andoh hell she repeated helplessly staring naitachals dark skin hid any sign of inflammation but the swelling around the still rawlooking gash was obvious even to the untrained kevin woundfever lydia murmured why didnt you say something what could i say what could you do i could have done something i knew the brandy wasnt enough why didnt i no this is not your fault lydia naitachal sighed my people have somewhat more immunity to iron wounds than do the white elves possibly from living as close as we do to the inner earth dark but such things are still perilous to us you still should have said no naitachal struggled to his feet to stop is to die as simply as that come i will keep up i doubt it lydia muttered under her breath theres a limit even to a sorcerers will i will keep up the dark elf repeated flatly just then tichki came whirring back strangers a whole troop of people and wagons up ahead wagons lydia shook her head puzzled cant be soldiers or those cursed trackers tichki i know find out more about them im gone she was back within a short time forget any help from them theyre nothing but some traveling minstrels bah lydia turned away in disgust theyre useless but kevin moved by a sudden wild hope told tichki go on what else can you tell us about them the fairy shrugged in midair what can i say theyre a colorful lot and their leaders a sharpfaced fellow with bright green eyes kevin started it couldnt be could it ddid you happen to catch his name bersomething i think berak thats it the fairy stared at him you know him in a way stumbling over his words in sudden eagerness kevin stammered llisten everyone berak and his troupe isarefriends of master aidan we can hide with them for a while look lydia said shortly weve been lied to and tricked along every step of this little adventure of ours do you really think we can trust them we can i can be fooled even you can be fooled but my masters a full bard no ones going to fool him come on maybe we can actually beg a hot meal out of berakand he and the troupe might even have some valuable news to share lydia shrugged on your head be it kid for one brief startling moment kevin could have sworn no time at all had passed since hed first left bracklin there were the same gaudy red and blue wagons the same cluster of brightly dressed men women and children gathered around a communal campfire and the bardling was overwhelmed by such a sudden surge of homesickness he nearly staggered there was berak exuberant and arrogant as ever pacing restlessly back and forth as though he bore too much pentup energy to be still he stopped short staring at kevin ha so there you are you were expecting me oh eventually at least i was hoping youd show up youve been stirring up enough excitement in recent days for a dozen bardlings the sharp green eyes noted naitachalcompletely hidden in his by now tattered black cloakand came to rest on lydia berak swept down in a theatrical bow i had no idea you were traveling in the company of such a lovely lady ha lydia said but to kevins astonishment she reddened slightly anyhow ah but from the looks of the lot of you berak continued without missing a beat you could use a good meal come join us but naitachal never moved kevin he said faintly remember when i boasted i could keep up i cant in fact the dark elf added swaying slightly if i dont sit down right now i think i may do something foolish like faint kevin and lydia caught him just in time in the next moment they were surrounded by the minstrel troupe helping hands reaching out berak wormed his way through the crowd and slipped a supporting arm around the dark elf back off he shouted to the others give the man room to breathe you and you drag that bench over here someone go get seritha and you beraks voice faltered for an instant as naitachals hood slipped back revealing his unmistakably dark elf features but then the minstrel shrugged and shouted seritha seritha hurry he added to naitachal helping him to the bench shes our healer have you up and well in no time to kevins surprise seritha turned out to be the plump motherly woman hed first seen in buttercup yellow hardly the sort he thought to harbor any sort of power but she laid bare the arrow gash with quiet skill and as soon as she placed her hands on the wound kevin saw power well up about her encircle her in a pale blue cloud brightening to dazzling bluewhite where her hands touched naitachals arm the bardling thought he saw unhealthy flesh slough away under that touch and felt his tooempty stomach lurch in protest he hastily turned away but after a time sheer curiosity made him look once more seritha looking worn but satisfied was straighteningnaitachal eyes wild with relief was getting to his feetand not a mark marred the smooth skin of his arm at serithas wave a little boy brought them flagons of something that smelled sharply herbal and was presumably strengthrestoring both healer and dark elf drank thirstily then smiled at each other naitachal bowed i am forever in your debt lady she beamed im hardly a lady and i only did what any healer should do seritha made a shooing gesture with both hands off with you now go reassure your friends naitachal grinned i hear and obey as the dark elf approached kevin asked breathlessly howhow do you feel healed absolutely totally healed now thats truly amazing lydia said i never thought an ordinary human could wield that type of power no the dark elf murmured thoughtfully neither did i his glance locked with that of berak but then naitachal shrugged so be it he said so meaningfully kevin could have sworn hed meant to say ill keep your secret what secret what was going on between those two but then the wonderful aroma of roasting meat hit his nostrils and kevin forgot all about secrets for the moment dont gobble lydia warned him your stomachs shrunk youll make yourself ill oh but it was a struggle not to wolf down the meat and bread and cheese the wine and sweetmeats at last feeling alive again for the first time in he didnt know how many days kevin sat back with a contented sigh my friends he told the minstrels we cant possibly repay this they laughed no need no need but the bardling added as casually as he could we ah separated a good many days ago separated someone teased you ran off is what happened uh well yes kevin admitted reluctantly aware of lydias amused glance but now what have you been doing since then have any news berak shrugged old news by now count volmar is going to be hosting a major fair at his castle shortly and were to perform at it a boy piped up before the count himself berak grinned thats right riki before the count himself his grin faded slightly as he turned back to kevinyou know there are odd rumors these days rumors that count volmar is going to make some sort of major announcementyou know anything about that nno not really indeed well rumor or no the truth is that certainly every liegeman and ally the count has is streaming in for the grand event whatever it may be kevin met beraks inquisitive stare as innocently as he could forcing a grin the bardling said well its been a long day if you dont mind well spend the night here with your people berak was plainly disappointed not to have learned any deep secrets from his guests but he bowed from the waist our camp is of course your camp make yourselves at home as soon as they were alone in the shelter of a wagon tichki popped out of hiding you could have slipped me more food she complained to lydia and have everyone wonder why i was feeding my hair naitachal ignored them what of beraks news that sounded truly ominous to me me too kevin agreed this isnt just some little tourney the count decided to throw not if hes calling in all his allies to hear some grand declaration exactly the dark elf frowned it just might be that volmar is gambling on carlottas behalf staking all as the saying goes on one throw of the dice if thats true lydia mused then losing one hole bardlingsorry kevinand one spell isnt going to stop them they must have had this plan in motion for months sure the bardling added and im one very small fly in the ointmentone they think they can afford to remove at their leisure he fought down the surge of indignant pride he was small and insignificantso far this could be just the chance we need to deliver the spell if we can take these folk into our confidence naitachal said if we dare lydia muttered if we can kevin added quietly in good conscience expose them to our own danger ah well there is that the bardling glanced at the others i think the best thing is for you to split up and go into hiding first off thats ridiculous lydia said were not going to please let me finish theres no point in you going into danger becausewell even if this spell works even if carlotta is disabled count volmar wont be and anyone whos with me is going to be in big trouble for a change lydia said drily youll be in that trouble too naitachal reminded the bardling ive already lost one friend i dont want to lose another i dont want to be lost either but kevin shook his head to put it bluntly im going to be worried enough as it is i dont want to have to worry about anyone else particularly not those i care about or those whove helped us either the minstrels exactly id like to travel to the castle with them it does seem to be the obvious way back in but i really want to keep their involvement in all this to an absolute minimum kevin gave a shaky sigh theres not enough time for anything other than what i think knights call desperation moves there wont be any heroes coming out of this sounds like youve gained some sense at least said a sardonic voice maybe even enough to keep you from being killed kevin nearly sprained his neck twisting about in shock that voice it was only berak who stood there and yet dont you think the masquerade has gone far enough naitachal asked the minstrel berak grinned you knew what i was right away didnt you the dark elf grinned in return even as you recognized me lydia looked from one to the other what are you talking about just this berak murmured a quiet word and it wasnt so much that his face and form changed as it was that a masking glamour seemed to fall away kevin stared how could he ever have missed how high those cheekbones were how sharply slanted those eyes and that hair was surely far too silky to be human hair youre an elf kevin gasped in alarm youre all elves chapter xxiv berak chuckled were all elves he agreed all my troupe the minstrel gestured to where they laughing had also shed their glamour of humanity tichki wriggled out of hiding so thats it she exclaimed clever disguises so obvious right under the humans noses and not one of them ever noticed beraks eyes widened ever so slightly at the fairys sudden appearance but all he did was dip his head in polite acknowledgement and say smoothly humans do tend to see what they expect to see lydia snorted no wonder serithas power was so much more than anything a human could master exactly but kevin was still staring know you youre the group who surrounded me in the forest that night yes and scared the life out of me too we were trying to scare the life into you youngling berak corrected drily you were much too cocky then for your own survival i dont understand something naitachal cut in you are very obviously white elves all of you and yet you never hesitated to help an enemy a dark elf you mean berak raised a brow and are you our enemy no of course not but naitachal gave a small sigh of confusion i really dont understand what clan are you what clan can you possibly be that you dont share the usual prejudice against my kind no clan at all or one of our own imagining and what does that mean berak smiled simply that we are the bits and tatters of many clans the outcasts the ones who couldnt fit in with all the staid and somber old traditions we like to laugh to rove to sing and play our songs for others elf or human and share our joy with them it amuses us just as it amuses us to disguise ourselves as humans my master knew though didnt he kevin asked what and who you really are i mean of course the green eyes narrowed slightly and its past time you started thinking about that master weve been crying all this time to track you down he shook his head we woke and you were gone we reached count volmars castle and you were gone from there too we went back to bracklin only to learn you had never returned master aidan has been frantic with worry why he even considered going after you and the spell himself despite his toosudden age and ill health ill health master aidan it was the first kevin had heard of that and yet with a sudden surge of guilt he remembered all the times hed thought the old bard lazy or afraid remembered how hed seen his masters pallor and shrugged it off as the result of too much of an indoor life the signs of carefully concealed illness had been there all along hed simply failed in his impatience and arrogance to notice them wait now what else had berak said toosudden age the bardling asked hesitantly i dont think boy berak snapped aidan was a youngling when he rescued the king not all that much older than you only some thirty years have passed even for you shortlived humans thats not such a vast span butbut hes old kevin insisted hes been old ever since ive known him aiyi kevin who do you think created that spell to destroy carlotta bardic magic is a powerful perilous thing it created the spell yes but in the process aidan was forced to de up his age and health within the thing until he no longer had the strength to do anything about it then speaking the spell may restore him berak shrugged with true elven fatalism or it may not but either way you must make his sacrifice worth it i will kevin said softly and ill make it up to you master aidan but theres something i must do here and now take these please he gave berak all but one of the remaining copies hed made of the spell at least this way it wont be lost with me what is this thing berak peered at the parchment elfish yet not quite elfish it is we pray the spell that shall put an end to carlotta naitachal said berak if you will permit it we will ride with you and together you and i and kevin can set about deciphering the thing why the minstrel asked suspiciously why kevin the bardling sighed because the spells bardic magic but i cant read elfish and unless you and naitachal can tell me how to pronounce the glyphs properly ill never be able to sing them you berak glanced sharply from kevin to naitachal then began speaking very rapidly in the elven tongue naitachal held up a hand kevin and i have gone over all the dangers i agree its an incredibly risky thing for him to try but neither you nor i are qualified to handle bardic magic kevin is but hes not a bard the boy is just a bardling still im as close to a bard as were going to find in such a short timeand weve wasted enough of that time already will you help us berak soo the cub grows fangs yes youngling i will help you and pray for you as well he added wryly it wasnt an easy decipherment as the wagons rolled and rattled their way toward count volmars castle the two elves spent much of the next day bent over the parchment arguing it says teatal or no no that has to read sentaila not sentailach when they were satisfied with each glyph they made kevin recite it till they were sure he had the intonation correct then sing it to the corresponding note when do i get to put the whole thing together you dont naitachal said in alarm do you want to trigger the spell here and now uh no but if i cant rehearse the spell now how am i going to know ive got it right the dark elf grinned without humor therein he said drily lies the adventure but i think you do have the component glyphs properly memorized berak added in what was presumably meant to be a comforting tone naitachal there is one unwoven thread to all this that bothers me eh you say carlotta is disguising herself as the counts niece well then what happened to the real charina there was one after all the dark elf shuddered as though a sudden cold draft had hit himi think i know what happened he said at last ijust could not bear to naitachal turned sharply away i was afraid to cast this spell afraid that i might find myself instead tempted to drag eliathanis back fromi didnt dare do you understand i do kevin murmured but naitachal what are you saying thatthat the real charina is that carlotta that charina powers what if her spirits enslaved i thought of chat the dark elf slumped in resignation so be it i will do what i mustberak i will need a clear sheltered place this evening and as few distractions as possible the white elf nodded you shall have that the night there in the forest grove was very dark the only light coming from the single small campfire built between the vee formed by the two wagons the troupe was hidden in those wagons or out in the forest but when kevin and lydia would have gone with them naitachal called out wait you as well berak say nothing do nothing only sit where you are until i signal you to leave i will need your presences as an anchor an anchor to what to life kevin felt a cold chill steal through him what if naitachal was dragged over the border into death how could they possibly pull him back but the dark elf didnt seem particularly worried though his face picked out in stark relief by the dancing flames was grim and his stance tense without warning he began a chant so softly kevin almost couldnt hear him berak heard though the bardling could feel him shudder somehow soft though the words were they werent quite obeying natural law they werent fading instead like so many layers of woven doth each new phrase fell atop the one before it never fading slowly filling up the night slowly filling up the very air calling demanding summoning and suddenly they were no longer alone in the clearing kevin was only dimly aware of lydias gasp only dimly heard his own sharply drawn in breath lost in a mix of amazement and terror he stared rill his eyes ached at a pale glow all at once there above the fire slowly condensing into the figure of a girl charinas ghost she wasnt as extravagantly lovely as her counterfeit her hair was pale yellow not spun gold her face merely pretty rather than beautiful and yet she was so much the more charming for not being perfect that kevin felt his heart ache as though it would break felt his cheeks suddenly wet with the loss of what might have been who are you naitachal said in the human tongue his voice the essence of gentleness i was i am the ghostly blue eyes widened in fright dont remember why am i here where am i you must remember who are you iicant you mustwho are you i cant kevin ached to shout out leave her alone cant you see she really doesnt know but somehow he managed to keep from making a sound and naitachal continued relentlessly who are you charina the ghost screamed all at once i am charina the dark elfs head drooped and kevin could hear him gasp for breach after a moment naitachal continued his voice gentle once more where are you charina i dont know its so dark dark and cold so cold i dont want to know never mind the dark elf crooned go back back see the day as it was the day before the darkness do you see it her frightened face seemed to tighten yes where are you charina the castle my uncles castle i am up on the ramparts andoh look at the pretty thing what are you doing charina leaning forward to see theno no please dont no the sheer terror of that scream cut kevin to the heart oh naitachal dont let her be but the dark elf continued softly who is it charina what is he doing uncle uncle please i wont tell anyone you dont have to kill me who killed you charina no no theres been a mistake its all a mistake im alive and who killed you charina imy uncle killed me he pushed me from the ramparts when none could see he murdered me and threw my body down a refuse shaft she burst into an anguished keening rocking back and forth in midair without taking his glance from her naitachal fiercely waved the watchers away they scrambled up and behind the wagons without any argument oh that poor kid lydia whispered she didnt even get a chance to live before that bastard berak waved her to silence now comes the most difficult part his voice was so soft it barely disturbed the air now he must help her deal with her own death and at last find rest they waited in silence as the time crept slowly by and at last naitachal staggered out to meet them he said not a word but sank to the ground head in hands berak moved to his side murmuring in elfish and naitachal nodded the white elf nodded as well and returned to kevin and lydia its done he said softly that poor lost child is gone naitachal continued to sit where he was black cloak like a shroud about him and all at once kevin couldnt stand it seritha was already brewing one other herbal teas and the bardling took a flagon from her and hurried to the dark elfs side naitachal naitachal its me kevin the dark elf slowly raised his head his eyes empty hhere the bardling insisted drink for a moment he wasnt sure naitachal was going to obey but then a hand cold as the grave took the flagon from him the dark elf held it for a moment in both bands gratefully absorbing its heat then drank for a time he sat with closed eyes then naitachal turned to look at kevin again and this time life glinted in the sorcerous eyes thank you i was wise to name you an anchor and charina is gone though gone where i cant say and no the dark elf added with a hint of returning humor im not being metaphysical she was a gentle girl but she did after all come of warrior stock i dare say weve not seen the last of her just yet what but more naitachal wouldnt say the best way to be invisible berak said with his usual dramatic flair is to be obvious if we try to sneak into count volmars castle like thieves with something to hide carlotta is sure to notice naitachal nodded just as shed be sure to notice any manner of magicworking he glanced at kevin and lydia now those two should make convincing enough members of your troupe with a little judicious dying of hair seritha added eying lydias curly black locks and some nice minstrelly recostuming but as for you she added studying naitachal hmm i am not the dark elf said flatly dressing up as a dancing girlonce was quite enough thank you berak gave a shout of laughter a girl you heard me we made a pretty group the lot of us kevin here and lydia and eliathanis naitachal broke off in midsentence pain flashing in his eyes kevin winced remembering the white elfs embarrassment and the dark elfs teasing remembering that silly happy time that seemed so long ago beraks sharp clever gaze shot from the bardling to naitachal never mind he said gently we wont need anything quite so ah drastic heyo everyone prepare to ride the elven minstrel troupe paraded into count volmars casde with cymbals clashing and trumpets blaring and sec up camp along with all the other groups of minstrels acrobats and stagemagicians in the increasingly crowded outer bailey how do you think i look lydia grinning tossed her newly dyed brazen hair and naitachal shook his head wryly about as elven as count volmar but definitely not like that wanton warrior woman wanton she tapped him with her fan ill give you wanton you stagemagician you the dark elf looked down at himself and laughed stagemagician he said ruefully they had decided to play up naitachals dramatic coloring by dressing him in the gaudiest of red robes a goldthreaded scarf draped theatrically about his head and face kevin who was dressed in fairly gaudy yellow and purple himself wasnt really listening to their nervous banter instead he stared thoughtfully up at the various casde towers there he murmured suddenly beside the great hall the chapel berak asked what about it not the chapel the bell tower next to it what are youah youre thinking of acoustics exactly kevin studied the tower for a long moment it was plain and squaresided with no windows save for the great arches at the very top the bell cant be rung i remember someone saying it had cracked and they hadnt gotten around to getting it down and recast but thats still a prettylooking sound chamber its hanging in berak smiled faintly quite nicely designed anyone standing in it who decided to start singing would be heard all over the casde he would kevin agreed and if i have any say in things he will be that officious servant told me my troupe isnt to perform until some time tomorrow and of course the site of the performance of all the performances is going to be in the courtyard coincidentally right in front of that chapel with its oh so pretty bell tower berak and kevin exchanged conspiratorial grins but even as he tried to act the role of a minstrel without a care in the world calmly helping the others prepare for tomorrows show kevins hands shook his heart pounded so fiercely he was sure the casually watching guards were going to hear it and drag him away for questioning berak had sent messengers off to king amber and master aidan with word of what had happened but the bardling knew he couldnt count on them to get here in time to do anything itits all up to vs to me gods gods he couldnt make a move until after dark and here it was only afternoon how was he ever going to get through this day and even after the night came if it ever did what if he couldnt get into that bell tower what if count volmar had locked it or set a guard or kevin battled with his growing panic this was stupid after all the whole thing came down simply to this tomorrow he naitachal and lydia would be heroes or they would be dead chapter xxv there was some mercy kevin thought at least there was no moon this night it wasnt difficult thanks to naitachals elven nightvision for three people to steal across the crowded courtyard to the bell tower without waking anyoneand without any merely human guard being able to spot them the bardling paused at the base of the bell tower to look nervously up and up its height a starkly black mass against the starfilled sky the tower hadnt seemed quite so tall from the outer bailey dont be silly he scolded himself youwere higher than that when you were up on the castle tower sure he answered himself and look how that turned out naitachal who was quietly testing the cower door drew back with a sudden hiss curse the man and his suspicious mind it was a savage whisper i know bronze is expensive but does he really think someones going to try stealing a heavy bell whwhats the matter kevin asked hes bolted the cursed door lydia gave a frustrated sigh cant you cast some sort of spell im a necromancer the dark elf said flatly not a lockpick besides you know any use of magic would bring carlotta down on our heads wonderful lydia repeated now what do we do a snicker cut the sudden silence helpless creatures tichki what here help me this thing is cursed heavy the fairy had stolen a whole coil of rope tichki this is great lydia whispered she craned her head back to study the tower now how are we going to get it up there tichki sighed in mock exasperation do i have to do everything around here she snatched up one end of the rope and started flapping her way up struggling against its weight naitachal watching closely so he wouldnt entangle her or destroy her balance played the rope out coil by coil shes at the top he murmured ah she has it tichki came spiraling down thats thative tied the thing strongly enough to hold even your weights now its up to you lydias teeth flashed in the darkness all right lets go me first i chink then kevin then you naitachal in case the kid has trouble i wont the bardling started but naitachal cut in calmly agreed before kevin could say anything more lydia was swarming up the rope with he thought disgusting ease she made it naitachal whispered after a few moments your turn kevin just what i need another chance to ruin my hands this tine with rope bums ah well better my hands than our lives he took a firm grip on the rope braced his feet against the side of the tower and started to climb to his relief the rope was knotted giving him something to grasp but hed never done anything like this powers he hadnt even climbed trees when he was a child not once hed started studying music and had to be concerned about his hands he could feel the ache in his arms and thighs already and even the familiar weight of the lute on his back was threatening to pull him over backwards cone on dont be a baby if lydia can do it so can you hey he had made it kevin scrambled up over the rim of one of the arches and stood aside so naitachal who also swarmed up the rope with disgusting ease could join them its about time tichki jibed watch your footing theres only this narrow strip of stone and the stairway down she fluttered in midair the whole towers hollow kevin shrugged of course it is they never expected anyone to stay here for very long the bell would deafen anyone caught up here that is if it wasnt cracked so badly it couldnt be rung lydia said with a grin lucky us she glanced around naitachal you dont need a dear view of the courtyard do you no sense cast magic and shield kevin from it wherever i stand fine then you take the left side over here ill be on the right where i can get a dear shot at any wouldbe snipers and you of course kevin get the place of honor here in the center she grinned now all we have to do is wait tichki tittered nighty night everybody try not to fall off the ledge in your sleep thank you tichki naitachal muttered thank you very much youre welcome the fairy laughed and darted away before he could hit her it might not have been the single most miserable time hed spent there certainly had been worse during their adventurings but kevin blinking blearily in the chill light of early morning not at all rested and not quite daring to stretch lest he lose his balance decided he had to rate this cold hard precarious night just past right up there with the worst naitachal was already on his feet gaudy finery replaced some time in the night by his usual somber black and lydia stripped down to her preferred warrior garb bow and quiver within easy reach was limbering up her muscles as best she could in that narrow space i wish we had something to eat other than a flask of water and some bread and cheese something warm kevin thought wistfully ha he added looking gingerly down into the depths of the tower and i wish we had ah more refined sanitary facilities too ah well at least it was morning and the sun would soon be warming things up the morning he would win or dieno curse it he wasnt even going to think about that not yet good morning he said lydia snorted more or less she leaned daringly out to study the courtyard far below at least were going to get a splendid view of the whole event thats got to be the counts chair there on that dais under the canopynow if only carlotta will just cooperate by showing up with him she did kevin tensed as the false charina pretty in blue silk simpered out to take her place beside count volmar who was dad in rich robes of dark redviolet thats almost royal purple kevin thought indignantly they really are planning to make a move towards the throne well not if i have anything to say about it then he had to laugh at his own bravado not if im allowed to have anything to say about it the bardling corrected wryly lydia was right they really did have a splendid view of the whole eventand an endless event it was too with minstrels being replaced by acrobats being replaced by more minstrels being replaced bykevin fought back a yawn astonished that he could feel bored even while he ached with tension and had he really been cold before now it was hot in this tower baking as it was directly in the sun so hot the bardling envied lydia her scanty garb powers would beraks troupe never get to perform kevin took yet another small sip of water trying to keep his throat moist were they going to be stuck up here until they starved or died of thirst would they never get to even try the spell that had cost them so much already and there they are naitachals voice was right with tension be ready kevin ilam between the hopefully fine acoustics of this sound chamber and withagain hopefullyhis own bardic magic to provide the rest there should be no way for carlotta to escape the sound of his voice till the spell was cast oh please he prayed to all the powers let it be so in order to make the best use of the chambers acoustics kevin realized there was only one place he could stand squarely in front of the bell in plain view and bowshotof the crowd if lydia or naitachal failed to protect him no theyd been through so much together already he wouldnt doubt them now beraks troupe were performing with all their elven skill carrying the crowd as berak would put it taking them through rousing heroic ballads and songs so light and humorous that waves of laughter surged to kevins ears come on he begged them you dont have to put on quite so good a show do you or so long but berak was a true showman after all no matter how tense the situation he wasnt going to leave an audience unsatisfied by the time he finally sang the opening notes of the ballad he and kevin had agreed upon the ancient tragic song of ellian and tens that tale of doomed young love the bardling was almost too numb from tension to recognize it berak and his troupe sang with exquisite simplicity barely ornamenting each line tracing the words delicately with harp and flute their every word filled with quiet grief and tenderness and the noisy restless crowd bit by bit fell still the ballad came to its bittersweet endingthe lovers sank into each others arms their lives slowly peacefully ebbing away it was done the stunned audience paid beraks troupe that rarest greatest of tributes absolute silence theyll start cheering in a moment kevin knew its got to be now oh gods the bardling thought in a surge of panic he wasnt ready he couldnt remember the words his voice wasnt going to cooperate but then kevin realized he was doing it he was singing out his spell the sound chamber amplifying his voice so it rang out over the courtyard yet even in that moment he knew from the heart of his musicians being that what he was doing wasnt enough oh powers why hadnt he realized this before the spell needed more than bare recitation to work it needed heart it needed belief it needed a power he simply didnt possess the very soul of the music was missing and without it carlotta would still triumph no ah no all those poor people will die and all at once something seemed to tear loose within kevins heart all at once he couldnt be afraid not for himself wild with this sudden flame of hope of pity he sang for eliathanis he sang for charina he sang for all the good kind ordinary people whose lives carlotta would destroy and magic true strong bardic magic fully grown at last roused within him feeling nothing but the fire surging through him hearing nothing but the sound of the spellsong kevin was hardly aware of carlottas shriek of disbelieving rage or the counts shouts to his archers a few arrows cut the air about him but then lydia and naitachal were retaliating fending off attack suddenly the spellsong was done kevin sagged drained and gasping for breath only naitachals firm grip on his arm keeping him from falling as he stared as they all stared the silence that followed was the worse thing kevin had ever heardbecause nothing at all happened to carlotta it failed after all the spell failed all at once kevin was too weary to care he stood passively waiting to die either from sorcery or the spells own backlash dimly he heard carlottas scornful laugh but then that laugh went wrong too shrill too high in pitch kevin came back to himself with a jolt shouting look dear powers look despite all her frantically shriekedout spells carlotta was shrinking within moments though she still struggled to ding to charinas form she had shrunk to the size and shape of a fairy stunned silence fell through which count volmars voice cut like a whip guards pointing up at the bell tower he shouted those foul sorcerers have attacked my niece stop them have to admire his presence of mind naitachal muttered but berak and his troupe were ready as the guards rushed forward the white elves swung tent poles like quarterstaffs across unprotected shins the first rush of men went hurtling to the ground and the next wave fell over them come on lydia yelled lets get out of here while we can the three of them scrambled down the rope kevin not even stopping to worry about his hands and set off across the crowded courtyard at a dead run people squealing and scrabbling away from the foul sorcerers were going to make it were really going to oh hell lydia murmured well we gave it our best a long line of the counts men had broken through the crowd standing between the three and safety eyes cold pikes at the ready count volmar strode forward pushing his men aside face so florid with rage a comer of kevins mind wondered if he meant to kill his foes himself logic would have insisted there was no way out kevin still caught in the power of his own music wasnt ready to listen to logic instead he did the only thing he could do he sang he sang with all the force of his newly born magic of an innocent girl most foully slain of a sweet young life that was the price of a mans ambitionof charina murdered by her uncle by the count himself the long gleaming line of pikes swayed as the men murmured uneasily among themselves dont listen to him count volmar blustered hes aa sorcerer trying to trick you but then one of the guards cried out in shock look look the ghost of charina a pale glimmer in the daylight was slowly forming as if called by the song but this time there was nothing soft or weak about the specter behold the murderer her voice rang out fierce as a hawks cry echoing in the suddenly still air behold my uncle who slew me so he might steal a throne my curse upon you uncle i have come for youand i shall have my revenge she thrust out her hand as though casting a spear count volmar gasped clutching his chest eyes wild with sudden agony for one long moment he stood helplessly convulsed in pain trying without breath to cry out for aid but before any could move he crumpled to the cobblestones and lay still i am avenged the specter shrilled in savage joy and vanished in a dazzling flash of light by the time kevins sight had cleared one of the guards was kneeling by count volmars side hehes dead the man gasped count volmar is dead kevin and lydia stared at naitachal the dark elf shrugged wasnt my doing i told you charina came from warrior stock well now would you look at this lydia murmured the guards were all staggering back like men waking from a foul dream i was right kevin said carlotta really did have them all under her control her spell must have just about worn off he stiffened in sudden alarm yes but where is she if she got away ha dont worry about her tichki suddenly tittered in his ear butbut she escaped for what good thatll do her what tichki pinched his cheek kevin lad i may not be on the best of terms with my fairy kin but they will still heed my messages i sent out a spellcall to them to all of them every hill every dun every fairy cairn is closed to carlotta no one will shelter her none give her aid she is powerless bound in fairy shape foreverand forever shall be in exile uh thats all well and good one of the guards said hesitantly and were not exactly sorry to see the end of count volmar either the murdering traitor were loyal to king amber we are we know that kevin said reassuringly but well what do we do now i mean whos in charge andhe seemed to notice lydias warrior garb for the first time lady youre the closest thing weve got to a commander right now will you accept our surrender lydia straightened despite her gaudy dyed hair looking every inch the military figure i will indeed and hold your trust in safety till king amber does appoint a new overlord but then she whispered to kevin hows that sound properly high and noble he almost spoiled the whole thing by bursting into helpless laughter oh itit does indeed this is all well and good naitachal murmured but what happens now we get the crowd out of here for one thing lydia said and snapped out commands to the guards who only too glad to obey someone began to make order and someone has to take care of count volmars body kevin added that i shall do a precise voice said dkrikas the seneschal bowed as best an arachnia could i let myself refuse to see what was truly happening i stained my own honor by sheer blindness you have cleansed that honor and won my gratitude uh yes kevin said uncertainly but a blare of trumpets cut into his words a column of horsemen came riding into the courtyard beneath king ambers gold and crimson banner well what do you know lydia said drily looks like the cavalry has arrived the great hall was crowded with royal guards casde folkand of course beraks troupe all wideeyed with excitement at the high table kevin sat with the captain of the royal troop a strongfaced fierceeyed man who explained and so when my royal master received your message he knew no man could reach this casde by normal means the court wizards working all as one cast a spell to transport us men and horses here as swiftly as they could they transported someone else a familiar voice added kevin sprang to his feet so suddenly his chair overturned with a crash master aidan he raced to the bards side then staggered to a stop staring this was still plainly master aidanbut he was now a man of middle years his hair and beard only slightly streaked with gray it worked kevin breathed casting the spell really did restore your years it did kevin couldnt stand on ceremony a moment longer he caught the bard in a fierce hug master aidan chuckled lad lad youre cracking my ribs oh ssorry but berak told me you were ill how do you feel ah kevin master aidan touched kevins cheek tenderly amazingly well now when i sent you to retrieve the spell he added with a laugh i never expected you to be the one to cast it and you cast it so successfully my young bard whwhat did youwhat i called you bard kevin and bard you most assuredly are hes more than that the captain of the royal guards called out if you would bard kevin bard kevin struggling not to grin like an idiot kevin returned to his place at the high table the captain continued my royal master suspected that even with the spell of magical transport we might well arrive after things were ah settled one way or another and since you have proven yourself a loyal subject of the crown a most brave and worthy subject from all weve been told i have orders from the king himself may the gods favor him want to cut through all the courtly talk lydia asked kevins brave all right and worthy as they come get on with it man to kevins surprise the captain grinned anything to oblige a lovely lady he said so urbanely that lydia actually looked flustered of course bard kevin the captain continued youll have to go to the royal palace to get this all done properly but king amber in gratitude for service rendered hereby cedes to you he rank and all the lands and honors pertaining to the late traitor volmar kevin stared whwhat are you saying hes saying that youre a count now kid lydia told him looks like this castle really is going to be your home but what about you oh i guess ill just go on traveling but a hint of loneliness was in her voice the hell you will kevin exploded look you im going to need someone i can trust to oversee the casde guards what do you say lydia do you want to be my commanderinchief she broke into a slow happy grin sure kid someones got to keep an eye on you and i bard kevin dkrikas added will serve you as well the being paused uneasily if you will have me i cant see myself running a casde without you oh i shall have help humor glinted in dkrikas great eyes he means me tichki piped up exactly dkrikas gave a short chitter almost a chuckle i was fooled once by a count who feigned nobility and by youa natural noble who feigned commonness with this little one by my side i shall not dare slip into complacency again kevin laughed agreed but what about naitachal lydia wondered kevin glanced down the cable to where the dark elf and master aidan were deep in discussion the young bard could have sworn he heard naitachal murmur but i wont fetch your laundry im a bit too old to be an errand boy and surely master aidan was chuckling and agreeing naitachal kevin called and the dark elf looked up and for the first time since the young bard had known him true peaceful joy shone in his blue eyes kevin master aidan and i have come to an agreement i am going off with him to nice tranquil bracklin as his apprentice i shall take your advice my friend and study to become a bard his smile was a beautiful thing ive had quite enough of death naitachal said i want to try the magic of life for a change kevin smiled in return and may you enjoy it my friend thats that tichki said in satisfaction all the loose ends are nicely tied up all right everyone enough talk weve some heavy celebrating to do the end
