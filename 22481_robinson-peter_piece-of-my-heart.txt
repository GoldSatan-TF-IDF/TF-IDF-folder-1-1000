peter robinson piece of my heart book in the inspector banks series for sheila imagination abandoned by reason produces impossible monsters united with it she is the mother of the arts and the source of its marvels francisco goya the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom william blake the marriage of heaven and hell chapter one monday th september to an observer looking down from the peak of brimleigh beacon early that monday morning the scene below might have resembled the aftermath of a battle it had rained briefly during the night and the pale sun coaxed tendrils of mist from the damp earth they swirled over fields dotted with motionless shapes mingling here and there with the darker smoke of smoldering embers human scavengers picked their way through the carnage as if collecting discarded weapons occasionally bending to extract an object of value from a dead mans pocket others appeared to be shoveling soil or quicklime into large open graves the light wind carried a whiff of rotting flesh and over the whole scene a terrible stillness reigned but to dave sampson down on the field there had been no battle only a peaceful gathering and dave had the wormseye view it was just after am and he had been up half the night along with everyone else listening to pink floyd fleetwood mac and led zeppelin now the crowd had gone home and he was moving among the motionless shapes litter left behind by the vanished hordes helping to clean up after the very first brimleigh festival here he was bent over back aching like hell eyes burning with tiredness plodding across the muddy field picking up rubbish the eerie sounds of jimmy page playing his electric guitar with a violin bow still echoed in his mind as he shoved cellophane wrappers and halfeaten mars bars into his plastic bag ants and beetles crawled over the remains of sandwiches and halfempty tins of cold baked beans flies buzzed around the feces and wasps hovered about the necks of empty pop bottles more than once dave had to maneuver sharply to avoid being stung he couldnt believe some of the stuff people left behind food wrappers soggy newspapers and magazines used durex tampons cigarette ends knickers empty beer cans and roaches youd expect but what on earth had the person who left the underwood typewriter been thinking of or the wooden crutch had a cripple suddenly healed by the music run off and left it behind there were other things too things best avoided the makeshift toilets set over the open cesspit had been uninviting as well as few and far between and the queues had been long encouraging more than one desperate person to find a quiet spot elsewhere in the field dave glanced toward the craters and felt glad that he wasnt one of the volunteers assigned to fill them up with earth in an otherwise isolated spot at the southern edge of the field where the land rose gently toward the fringes of brimleigh woods dave noticed an abandoned sleeping bag the closer he got the more it looked to be occupied had someone passed out or simply gone to sleep more likely dave thought it was drugs all night the medical tent had been open to people suffering hallucinations from bad acid and there had been enough mandrax and opiated hash around to knock out an army dave prodded the bag with his foot it felt soft and heavy he prodded it again harder this time still nothing it definitely felt as if there was someone inside finally he bent and pulled the zip and when he saw what was there he wished he hadnt monday th september detective inspector stanley chadwick was at his desk in brotherton house before eight oclock monday morning as usual with every intention of finishing off the paperwork that had piled up during his two weeks annual leave at the end of august the caravan at primrose valley with janet and yvonne had made a nice haven for a while but yvonne was obviously restless as only a sixteenyearold on holiday with her parents can be and crime didnt stop while he was away from leeds nor apparently did the paperwork it had been a good weekend yorkshire beat derbyshire in the gillette cup final and if leeds united coming off a season as league champions hadnt managed to beat manchester united at home at least they had come out of it with a draw and billy bremner had scored the only blot on the landscape was that yvonne had stayed out most of the night on sunday and it wasnt the first time chadwick had lain awake until he heard her come in at about half past six and by then it was time for him to get up and get ready for work yvonne had gone straight to her room and closed her door so he had put off the inevitable confrontation until later and now it was gnawing at him he didnt know what was happening to his daughter what she was up to but whatever it was it frightened him it seemed that the younger generation had been getting stranger and stranger over the past few years more out of control and chadwick felt unable to find any point of connection with them anymore most of them were like members of another species to him now especially his own daughter chadwick tried to shake off his worries about yvonne and glanced over the crime sheets trouble with squatters in a leeds city center office building a big drugs bust in chapeltown an assault on a woman with a stone in a sock in bradford manningham lane he noticed and everyone knew what kind of women you found on manningham lane still poor cow nobody deserved to be hit with a stone in a sock just over the county border in the north riding the brimleigh festival had gone off peacefully enough with only a few arrests for drunkenness and drug dealing only to be expected at such an event and a bit of bother with some skinheads at one of the fences at about half past nine chadwick reached for the next file and he had just opened it when karen popped her head around his door and told him detective chief superintendent mccullen wanted to see him chadwick put the folder back on the pile if mccullen wanted to see him it had to be something pretty big whatever it was it was bound to be a lot more interesting than paperwork mccullen sat in his spacious office puffing on his pipe and enjoying the panoramic view brotherton house perched at the western edge of the city center adjacent to the university and leeds general infirmary buildings and it looked out west over the new inner ringroad toward park lane college all the old mills and factories in the area blackened by a century or more of soot had been demolished over the last two or three years and it seemed that a whole new city was rising from the ruins of its victorian past the international swimming pool leeds playhouse leeds polytechnic the yorkshire post building cranes crisscrossed on the horizon and the sound of pneumatic drills filled the air was it just chadwicks imagination or was there a building site no matter where you looked in the city these days he wasnt sure that the future was better than the past it was replacing any more than he was sure the emerging world order was better than the old one there seemed a monotonous sterility to many of the new buildings concreteandglass tower blocks for the most part along with terraces of redbrick council houses their victorian predecessors like benjamin gotts bean ing mills might have looked a bit more grimy and shabby but at least they had character or perhaps chadwick thought he was just becoming an old fogy about architecture the same way he was about young people and at fortyeight he was too young for that he made a mental note to try to be more tolerant of hippies and architects stan sit down said mccullen gesturing to the seat opposite his desk he was a hard compact man one of the old school and fast nearing retirement gray hair in a severe crew cut sharp square features an intimidating gleam in his narrowed eyes people said he had no sense of humor but chadwick thought it was just so dark and buried so deep that nobody could recognize it or wanted to find it mccullen had served as a commando during the war and chadwick had seen more than enough active duty himself he liked to think it created a bond between them something in common that they never spoke about they also shared a scottish background chadwicks mother was a scot and his father had worked in the clydebank shipyards chadwick had grown up in glasgow drifting down to yorkshire only after the war chadwick sat i wont beat about the bush mccullen began knocking his pipe on the heavy glass ashtray but theres been a body discovered at brimleigh glen the big field where they held the festival this weekend i dont have many details yet the report has just this minute come in all we know is that the victim is a young woman oh said chadwick aware of that cold sinking feeling deep in his belly i thought brimleigh was the north riding mccullen refilled his pipe strictly speaking it is he said finally releasing clouds of aromatic blue smoke just over the border but theyre country coppers they dont get many murders just a bit of sheepshagging now and then theyve certainly got no one capable of handling an investigation of this magnitude given how many people must have been attending that festival and theyre asking for our help i thought perhaps with your recent successes the locals still wont like it chadwick said perhaps its not as bad as having scotland yard tramping all over your provincial toes but its already cleared said mccullen turning his gaze back to the window theres a local detective sergeant name of keith enderby youll be working with him hes already at the scene mccullen glanced at his wristwatch better get out there stan dc bradleys waiting with the car the docll be there soon wanting to get the body back to the mortuary for the postmortem chadwick knew when he was being dismissed solve two murders so far this year and you get lumbered with a case like this bloody hippies paperwork suddenly didnt look so bad after all tolerance he told himself he stood up and headed for the door monday th september there was no easy access to the body in the field not without getting his shoes muddy chadwick cursed under his breath as he saw his lovingly polished black brogues and the bottoms of his suit trousers daubed with brown mud if hed been a rural copper hed have kept a pair of wellies in the boot of his car but you dont expect mud when youre used to working the streets of leeds if anything dc bradley complained even more brimleigh glen looked like a vast tip a natural amphitheater cupped between low hills to the east and north and brimleigh woods to the west and south it was a popular spot for picnics and brass band concerts in summer not this weekend though a stage had been erected at the western end of the field abutting the woods and the audience had sprawled as far back as the hillsides on the eastern and northern sides to a distance where chadwick guessed nobody would have been able to see very much at all except little dots the small knot of people surrounding the body stood at the southern edge of the field about a hundred yards back from the stage near the edge of the woods when chadwick and bradley arrived a man with long greasy hair bellbottom jeans and an afghan waistcoat turned and said with far more aggression than chadwick would have expected of someone who was supposed to embrace peace and love who the fuck are you chadwick feigned a surprised expression and looked around then he pointed his thumb at his own chest who me yes you a clearly embarrassed young man hurried over to them er i think thats probably the detective inspector from leeds am i right sir chadwick nodded how dyou do sir im detective sergeant enderby north yorkshire constabulary this is rick hayes the festival promoter you must have been up all night said chadwick id have thought youd be long tucked up in bed by now theres still a lot to see to hayes said gesturing behind him that scaffolding for a start its rented and it all has to be accounted for im sorry by the way he glanced in the direction of the sleeping bag this has all been very upsetting im sure said chadwick making his way forward there were four people besides himself and dc bradley at the scene only one of them a uniformed policeman and most of them were standing far too close to the body they were also very casually dressed even ds enderbys hair chadwick noticed was dangerously close to touching the collar of his jacket and his sideboards needed trimming his black winklepickers looked as if they had been dirty even before he crossed the field were you the first officer to arrive at the scene chadwick asked the young police constable trying to move people back and clear a little space around the sleeping bag yes sir pc jacobs i was on patrol when the call came in who called it in one of the others stepped forward i did steve naylor i was working on the scaffolding when dave here shouted me over theres a phone box on the road on the other side of the hill did you find the body chadwick asked dave sampson yes sampson looked pale as well he might chadwick thought his own war service and eighteen years on the force had hardened him to the sight of violent death but he hadnt forgotten his first time and he never forgot how devastating it could appear to someone who had never witnessed it before he looked around any chance someone might rustle up a pot of tea everyone stared at him dumbfounded then naylor the stage worker said weve got a primus and a billycan back there ill see what i can do good lad naylor headed for the stage chadwick turned back to sampson touch anything he asked only the zip i mean i didnt know i thought what did you think it felt like there was someone inside i thought they might be asleep or on drugs possibly yes after you opened the zip and saw what it was what did you do then i called over to the stage chadwick looked at the speckled mess on the grass about a yard away before or after you were sick sampson swallowed after did you touch the body at all no good now go over and give your statement to detective sergeant enderby well probably want to talk to you again so stick around sampson nodded chadwick crouched by the blue sleeping bag keeping his hands in his pockets so that he didnt touch anything even by accident only the upper half of the girls body was exposed but it was enough she was wearing a smocked white dress with a scooped neck and the area under the left breast was a mess knife work by the looks of it also her dress was bunched up around her waist as if she hadnt had time to smooth it down when she got into the bag or as if someone had shoved her in quickly after hed killed her the long dress could also have been raised for sexual purposes if she had been sharing the sleeping bag with her boyfriend chadwick realized but he would have to wait for the pathologist to find out any more about that she was a very pretty girl with long blond hair an oval face and full lips she looked so innocent not unlike yvonne he thought with a sudden shudder and yvonne had been out all last night too but she had come home not this girl she was perhaps a year or two older than yvonne and her eye shadow emphasized the color of her big blue eyes the mascara stood out in stark contrast to the paleness of her skin she wore several strings of cheap colored beads around her neck and she had a cornflower painted on her right cheek there was nothing more chadwick could do until the home office pathologist arrived which should be very soon mccullen had given him to understand standing he scanned the ground nearby but saw only rubbish kitkat wrappers a soggy international times an empty pouch of old holborn rolling tobacco an orange pack of rizla cigarette papers it would all have to be bagged and checked out of course he sniffed the air moist but warm enough for the time of year and glanced at his watch half past eleven it looked like being another fine day and a long one he turned his gaze back to the others anybody recognize her they all shook their heads chadwick thought he noticed a little hesitation in rick hayess reaction mr hayes no said hayes never seen her before chadwick thought he was lying about not recognizing the girl but it would keep he noticed a movement by the stage and looked to see naylor coming back with a tray and following shortly behind him a nattily dressed man who seemed to be about as happy to find himself walking across a muddy field as chadwick had been but this man was carrying a black bag the pathologist had arrived at last october detective chief inspector alan banks hit the play button and after the heartbeats the glorious sound of breathe from pink floyds dark side of the moon filled the room he still hadnt got the hang of the new equipment yet but he was finding his way around it slowly he had inherited a stateoftheart sound system along with a dvd player inch plasma tv g ipod and a porsche from his brother roy the estate had gone to bankss parents but they were set in their ways and had no use for a porsche or a largescreen tv the first wouldnt last five minutes parked outside their peterborough council house and the second wouldnt fit in their living room they had sold roys london house setting them both up nicely for the rest of their lives and passed on the things they couldnt use to banks as for roys ipod bankss father had taken one look at it and been about to drop it in the waste bin before banks rescued it now it had become as essential to him when he went out as his wallet and his mobile he had been able to download the software and buy new chargers and cables along with an adapter that allowed him to play it through his car radio and while he had kept a great deal of his brothers music library on it he had managed to clear a good fifteen hours worth of space by deleting the complete ring cycle and that was far more than enough to accommodate his meager collection at the moment banks headed into the kitchen to see how dinner was getting along all hed had to do was remove the packaging and put the foil tray in the oven but he didnt want to burn it it was friday evening and annie cabbot was coming over for dinner tonight just as a friend and the evening was to be a sort of unofficial housewarming though that was a term banks hesitated to use these days he had been back in the restored cottage for less than a month and tonight would be annies first visit it was a wild october night outside banks could hear the wind screaming and moaning and see the dark shadows of tree branches tossing and thrashing beyond the kitchen window he hoped annie would make the drive all right that there were no trees down there was a spare bed if she wanted to stay but he doubted that she would too much history for that to be comfortable for either of them although there had been moments over the summer when he had thought it wouldnt take much to brush all the objections aside best not think about that he told himself banks poured himself the last of the amarone his parents had inherited roys wine cellar and they had passed this on to him too as far as arthur banks was concerned white wine was for sissies and red wine tasted like vinegar his mother preferred sweet sherry their loss was bankss gain and while it lasted he got to enjoy the high life of firstgrowth bordeaux and sauternes white and red burgundy from major growers chianti classico barolo and amarone when it was gone of course he would be back to boxes of simply chilean and big aussie red but for the moment he was enjoying himself whenever he opened a bottle though he missed roy which was strange because they had never been close and banks felt he had only got to know his brother after his death he would just have to learn to live with it it was the same with the other things the tv stereo car music they all made him think of the brother he had never really known part of the way through us and them he heard the doorbell ring annie half past seven right on time he walked through and opened the front door flinching at the gust of wind that almost blew her into his arms she edged back giggling trying to hold down her hair as banks pushed the door shut but even in the short trip from her car to his front door it had become a tangled mess quite the night out there banks said i hope you didnt have any problems getting here annie smiled nothing i couldnt handle she handed banks a bottle of wine tescos chilean merlot he noticed and took out a hairbrush as she attacked her hair she wandered around the front room this is certainly different from what i expected she said it looks really cozy i see you did go for the dark wood after all the wood for the desk had been one of the things they had talked about and annie had advised the darker color as opposed to light pine what had been bankss main living room was now a small study complete with bookcases a reproduction georgian writing table for the laptop computer under the window and a couple of comfortable brown leather armchairs arranged around the fire perfect for reading a door by the side of the fireplace led into the new entertainment room which ran the length of the house annie walked up and down and admired it though she did tell banks she thought it was a bit of a blokes den the tv hung on the wall at the front and the speakers were spread about in strategic positions around the deep plum sofa and armchairs storage racks on the side walls held cds and dvds mostly roys apart from the few banks had bought over the past couple of months at the back french windows led to the new conservatory they wandered into the kitchen which had been completely remodeled banks had tried to make sure it was as close to the original as possible with the pine cupboards copperbottomed pans on wall hooks and the breakfast nook where bench and table matched the cupboards but that strange benign presence he had felt there before had gone for good or so it seemed now it was a fine kitchen but only a kitchen the builders had run the conservatory along the entire back of the house and there was also a door leading to it from the kitchen impressive annie said all this and a porsche parked outside too youll be pulling the birds like nobodys business some hope said banks i might even sell the porsche why it just feels so strange having all roys stuff i mean the tv and the movies and cds are okay i suppose not quite as personal but the car i dont know roy loved that car give it a chance you might get to love it too i like it well enough its just oh never mind mmm it smells good in here whats for dinner roast beef and yorkshire pudding annie gave him a look vegetarian lasagna he said marks and spencers best thatll do fine banks threw a simple salad together with an oilandvinegar dressing while annie sat on the bench and opened the wine pink floyd finished so he went and put some mozart wind quintets on the stereo hed had speakers wired into the kitchen and the sound was good when everything was ready they sat opposite one another and banks served the food annie was looking good he thought her flowing chestnut hair still fell about her shoulders in disarray but that only heightened her attraction for him as for the rest she was dressed in her usual casual style just a touch of makeup lightweight linen jacket a green tshirt and closefitting black jeans bead necklace and several thin silver bracelets which jingled when she moved her hand they had hardly got beyond the first mouthful when bankss telephone rang he muttered an apology to annie and went to answer it sir it was dc winsome jackman yes winsome banks said this had better be important ive been slaving over a hot oven all day sir never mind go on theres been a murder sir are you certain i wouldnt be disturbing you if i wasnt sir winsome said im at the scene right now moorview cottage in fordham just outside lyndgarth im standing about six feet away from him and the back of his heads caved in looks like someone bashed him with the poker kevs here too and he agrees sorry detective sergeant templeton the local bobby called it in banks knew fordham it was nothing but a hamlet really a cluster of cottages a pub and a church christ he said okay winsome ill get there as soon as i can in the meantime you can call in the socos and dr glendenning if hes available right you are sir should i ring di cabbot ill deal with that keep the scene clear well be there half an hour at the most banks hung up and went back into the kitchen sorry to spoil your dinner annie but weve got to go out suspicious death winsomes certain its murder your car or mine yours i think the porsche is a bit pretentious for a crime scene dont you think monday th september as the day progressed the scene around brimleigh glen became busy with the arrival of various medical and scientific experts and the incident van a temporary operational headquarters with telephone communications and more important teamaking facilities the immediate crime scene was taped off and a constable posted at the entrance to log the names of those who came and went all work on rubbish disposal stage dismantling and cesspit filling was suspended until further notice much to the chagrin of rick hayes who complained that every minute more spent at the field was costing him money chadwick hadnt forgotten hayess possible lie earlier about not recognizing the victim and he looked forward to the pleasure of a more indepth interview in fact hayes was high on his list of priorities for the moment though it was important to get the investigation organized get the mechanics in place and the right men appointed to the right jobs detective sergeant enderby seemed capable enough on first impression despite the length of his hair and chadwick already knew that simon bradley his driver was a bright young copper with a good future ahead of him he also demonstrated the same sort of military neatness and precision in his demeanor that chadwick appreciated as for the rest of the team they would come mostly from the north riding people he didnt know and he would have to learn their strengths and weaknesses on the hoof he preferred to enter into an investigation on more certain ground but it couldnt be helped officially this was north yorkshires case and he was simply helping out the doctor had pronounced the victim dead and turned the body over to the coroners officer in this case a local constable specially appointed to the task who arranged for its transportation to the mortuary in leeds during his brief examination at the scene dr oneill had been able to tell chadwick only that the wounds almost certainly had been caused by a thin bladed knife and that she had been dead less than ten hours and more than six before the time of his examination which meant she had been killed sometime between half past one and half past five in the morning her body had been moved after death he added and she had not been in the sleeping bag when she died though stab wounds even to the heart often dont bleed a great deal the doctor said he would have expected more blood on the inside of the sleeping bag had she been stabbed there how long she had lain elsewhere before she had been moved or where she had lain he couldnt say only that the postmortem lividity indicated that she had been on her back for some hours from an external examination it didnt look as if she had been raped she was still in fact wearing her white cotton knickers and they looked clean but only a complete postmortem would reveal details of any sexual activity prior to death there were no defensive wounds on her hands which most likely meant that she had been taken by surprise and that the first stab had pierced her heart and incapacitated her immediately there was light bruising on the front left side of her neck which dr oneill said could be an indication that someone the killer probably had restrained her from behind so chadwick thought the killer had made a clumsy attempt to make it look as if the girl had been killed in the bag on the field and clumsy attempts to mislead often yield clues before doing anything else chadwick commissioned enderby to get a team with a police dog together to comb brimleigh woods the photographer did his stuff and the specialists searched the scene then bagged everything for scientific analysis they got some partial footprints but there was no guarantee that any of these were the killers even so they patiently made plasterofparis casts there was no weapon in the immediate vicinity hardly surprising as the victim hadnt died there nor was there anything in the sleeping bag or near her body to indicate who she was lack of drag marks indicated that she might have been moved there before it rained the beads she wore were common enough although chadwick imagined it might be possible to track down a supplier some poor mother and father would no doubt be wringing their hands with worry about now as he had been wringing his about yvonne had she been at the festival he wondered it would be just like her the kind of music she listened to her rebellious spirit the clothes she wore he remembered the fuss she had made when he and janet wouldnt let her go to the isle of wight festival the weekend before the isle of wight for crying out loud it was three hundred miles away anything could happen what on earth had she been thinking about for the time being the best course of action was to check all missing persons reports for someone matching the victims description failing any luck there they would have to get a decent enough photograph of her to put in the papers and show on television along with a plea for information from anyone in the crowd who might have seen or heard anything however they did it they needed to know who she was as soon as possible only then could they attempt to fathom out who had done this to her and why the darkness deepened the closer banks and annie got to lyndgarth it looked as if the wind had taken down an electricity cable somewhere and caused a power cut the silhouettes of branches jerked in the beam of the cars headlights while all around was darkness not even the light of a distant farmhouse to guide them in lyndgarth houses pubs church and village green were all in the dark annie drove slowly as the road curved out of town over the narrow stone bridge and around the bend another half a mile or so to fordham even in the surrounding darkness it was easy to see where all the fuss was as they came over the second bridge shortly after half past eight the main road veered sharp left at the pub opposite the church toward eastvale but straight ahead on a rough track that continued up the hill past the youth hostel and over the wild moorland a police patrol car blocked the way along with winsomes unmarked vectra annie pulled up behind the cars and wind whipped at her clothes as she got out of the car the trouble was in the last cottage on the left opposite moorview cottage a narrow lane ran west between the side of the church and a row of cottages until it was swallowed up in the dark countryside not much of a place is it said banks depends on what you want said annie its quiet enough i suppose and there is a pub looking back across the main road banks fancied he could see the glow of candlelight through the windows and hear the muffled tones of conversation from inside a little thing like a power cut clearly wasnt going to deprive the locals of their handpumped ale the light of a torch dazzled them and banks heard winsomes voice sir di cabbot this way i took the liberty of asking the socos to bring some lighting with them but for the moment this is all weve got they followed the trail the torch lit up through a high wooden gate and a conservatory the local pc was waiting inside the door talking to newly promoted detective sergeant kevin templeton and the light from his torch improved visibility quite a bit even so they were limited to what they could see within the beams the rest of the place was shrouded in darkness treading carefully across the stone flags banks and annie followed the lights to the edge of the living room they werent wearing protective clothing so they had to keep their distance until the experts had finished there sprawled on the floor near the fireplace lay the body of a man he was lying on his face so banks couldnt tell how old he was but his clothing jeans and a dark green sweatshirt suggested he was youngish and winsome was right there was no doubt about this one he could see even from a few feet away that the back of his head was a bloody mess and a long trail of dark coagulating blood gleamed in the torchlight ending in a puddle that was soaking into the rug winsome moved her torch beam around and banks could see a poker lying on the floor not far from the victim and a pair of glasses with one lens broken do you notice any signs of a struggle banks asked no said annie the beam picked out a packet of dunhills and a cheap disposable lighter on the table beside the armchair toward which the victims head was pointing say he was going for his cigarettes banks said and someone took him by surprise yes but someone he had no reason to think would kill him banks pointed to the rack by the fireplace the poker would most likely have been there on the hearth with the other implements bloodspatter analysis should give us a better idea of how it happened annie said banks nodded and turned to winsome first thing we do is seal off this room completely he said its out of bounds to anyone who doesnt need to be in it right sir said winsome and organize a housetohouse as soon as possible ask for reinforcements if necessary sir do we know who he is we dont know anything yet winsome said pc travers here lives down the road and tells me he doesnt know him apparently its a holiday cottage then presumably theres an owner somewhere shes in here sir it was the pc who spoke and he pointed his torch into the dining room where a woman sat in the dark on a hardback chair staring into space i didnt know what else to do with her sir he went on i mean i couldnt let her go until shed spoken with you and she needed to sit down she was feeling a bit faint you did the right thing said banks anyway its mrs tanner shes the owner no im not said mrs tanner i just look after it for them they live in london okay said banks sitting down opposite her well get those details later pc travers shone his torch along the table between them so that neither was dazzled and each could at least see the other from what banks could tell she was a stout woman in her early fifties with short graying hair and a double chin are you all right mrs tanner he asked she put a hand to her breast im better now thank you it was just a shock in the dark and all its not that ive never seen a dead body before just family like you know but this she took a sip from the steaming mug in front of her it looked as if travers had had the good sense to make some tea which meant there must be a gas cooker are you up to answering a few questions banks asked her i dont know that i can tell you anything leave that to me to decide how did you come to find the body he was just lying there like he is now i didnt touch anything good but what i meant was why did you come here it was the power cut i live just down the road see the other side of the pub and i wanted to show him where the emergency candles were theres a big torch too what time was this just before eight oclock did you see or hear anything unusual no see anyone not a soul no cars no was the door open no it was shut so what did you do first i knocked and then well there was no answer see and it was all dark inside didnt you think he might be out his cars still here whod go out walking on a night like this what about the pub i looked in but he wasnt there and nobody had seen him so i came back here ive got the keys i thought maybe hed had an accident or something fallen down the stairs in the dark and all because id forgotten to show him where the candles and the torch were where are they banks asked in a box on the shelf under the stairs she shook her head slowly sorry as soon as i saw him just lying there it went out of my head completely why id come thats all right banks sent pc travers to find the candles he came back a few moments later there were matches in the kitchen by the cooker sir he said and proceeded to set candles in saucers and place them on the dining table thats better said banks he turned back to mrs tanner do you know who your guest was his name nick thats all when he came by when he arrived last saturday and introduced himself he just said his name was nick he didnt give you a check with his full name on it he paid cash is that normal some people prefer it that way how long was he staying he paid for two weeks two weeks in the yorkshire dales in late october seemed like an odd holiday choice to banks but there was no accounting for taste maybe this nick was a keen rambler how did he find the place the owners have a web site but dont ask me owt about that i only see to the cleaning and general maintenance i understand said banks any idea where nick came from no he didnt have any sort of foreign accent but he wasnt from around here down south id say is there anything else you can tell me about him i only ever saw him the once mrs tanner said he seemed like a nice enough lad how old would you say he was not old midthirties maybe im not very good at ages car headlights shone through the window and soon the small house was filled with socos peter darby the photographer and dr glendenning the home office pathologist arrived at about the same time glendenning complaining that banks thought he had nothing better to do than hang around dead bodies on a friday evening banks asked pc travers to take mrs tanner home and stay with her her husband was out at a darts match in eastvale she said but he would soon be back and she assured banks she would be fine on her own the socos quickly set up lights in the living room and while peter darby photographed the cottage with his pentax and digital camcorder banks watched dr glendenning examine the body turning it slightly to examine the eyes anything you can tell us doc banks asked after a few minutes dr glendenning got to his feet and sighed theatrically ive told you about that before banks dont call me doc its disrespectful sorry said banks he peered at the corpse anyway he spoiled my friday evening too so anything you can tell me would help well for a start hes dead you can write that down in your little notebook i suspected as much said banks and dont be so bloody sarcastic you realize i was supposed to be at the lord mayors banquet by now drinking country manor and munching volauvent sounds bad for your health banks said youre better off here glendenning favored him with a sly smile maybe youre right at that laddie he smoothed down his silvery hair anyway it was almost certainly the blow to the back of the head that killed him ill know better when i get him on the table of course but thatll have to do for now time of death not more than two or three hours rigor hasnt started yet banks looked at his watch five past nine mrs tanner had probably been there about an hour or so which narrowed it down even more between six and eight say she couldnt have missed the killer by long which made her a very lucky woman any chance he got drunk fell and hit his head banks knew it was unlikely but he had to ask you didnt go off wasting valuable police time and resources on a domestic accident almost certainly not said glendenning glancing over at the poker for a start if it had happened that way he would most likely be lying on his back and secondly judging by the shape of the wound and the blood and hair on that poker over there id say your murder weapons pretty obvious this time maybe youll find a nice clean set of fingerprints and be home by bedtime some hope said banks seeing yet another weekend slip away why couldnt murderers commit their crimes on mondays it wasnt only the prospect of working all weekend that made friday murders such a pain in the arse but that people tended to make themselves scarce offices closed workers visited relatives everything slowed down and the first fortyeight hours were crucial in any investigation anyway he said the poker was close to hand which probably means that whoever did it didnt come prepared to kill or wanted to make it look that way ill leave the speculation to you as far as im concerned he belongs to the coroner now you can remove the body whenever cartierbresson here has finished banks smiled he noticed peter darby stick his tongue out at glendenning behind the doctors back they always seemed to be getting in one anothers way at crime scenes which were the only places they ever met by now it was impossible to ignore the activity in the rest of the house which was swarming with socos thick cables snaked through the conservatory attached to bright lights which cast shadows of men in protective clothing on the walls the place resembled a film set feeling very much in the way banks edged out toward the conservatory the wind was still raging and at times it felt strong enough to blow away the whole frail structure it didnt help that they had to leave the door open to let the cables in detective sergeant stefan nowak the crime scene coordinator arrived next and after a brief hello to banks and annie he set to work it was his job to liaise between the scientists and the detectives if necessary translating the jargon into comprehensible english and he did it very well his degrees in physics and chemistry certainly helped there are people who will stand for hours watching others work banks had noticed you see them at building sites eyes against the knotholes in the high wooden fences as the mechanical diggers claw at the earth and men in hard hats yell orders over the din or standing in the street looking up as someone on scaffolding sandblasts the front of an old building banks wasnt one of them that kind of thing was a perverse form of voyeurism as far as he was concerned besides there was nothing much more he could do at the house now until the team had finished and his thoughts moved pleasantly to the candlelit pub not more than thirty yards away the people in there would have to be interviewed someone might have seen or heard something one of them might even have done it best talk to them now while they were still in there and their memories were fresh he told winsome and templeton to stay with stefan and the socos and to come and get him if anything important came up then he called out to annie and they headed for the gate chapter two monday th september when chadwick was satisfied that things were running smoothly he called rick hayes over and suggested they talk in the van it was set up so that one end was a selfcontained cubicle just about big enough for an interview though at six foot two chadwick felt more than a little claustrophobic still he could put up with it and a bit of discomfort never did any harm when someone had something to hide close up hayes looked older than chadwick would have expected perhaps it was the stress of the weekend but he had lines around his eyes and his jaw was tense chadwick put him in his late thirties but with the hairstyle and the clothes he could probably pass for ten years younger he had about three or four days stubble on his face his fingernails were bitten down to the quick and the first two fingers of his left hand were stained yellow with nicotine mr hayes chadwick began maybe you can help me i need some background here how many people attended the festival about twentyfive thousand quite a lot not really there were a hundred and fifty thousand at the isle of wight the weekend before mind you they had dylan and the who and we had competition crosby stills and nash and jefferson airplane were playing in hyde park on saturday and you had biggest draws pink floyd led zeppelin chadwick who had never heard of either dutifully made a note of the names after checking the spelling with hayes who else a couple of local groups jan dukes de grey the mad hatters the hatters especially have been getting really big these past few months their first lp is already in the charts what do you mean local chadwick asked making a note of the names leeds general area at any rate how many groups in all thirty i can give you a full list if you like much appreciated chadwick wasnt sure where that information would get him but every little bit helped something like that must require a lot of organization youre telling me not only do you have to book the groups well in advance and arrange for concessions parking camping and toilet facilities youve also got to supply generators transport and a fair bit of sound equipment then theres security who did you use my own people youve done this sort of thing before on a smaller scale its what i do im a promoter chadwick scribbled something on his pad shielding it from hayes in the curve of his hand not that it meant anything he just wanted hayes to think it did hayes lit a cigarette chadwick opened the window the festival lasted three days is that correct yes we started late friday afternoon and wrapped up today in the wee hours what time led zeppelin played last they came on shortly after one oclock this morning and they must have finished about three we were supposed to wind up earlier but there were the inevitable delays equipment malfunctions that sort of thing what happened at three people started drifting home in the middle of the night there was nothing to keep them here the ones who had pitched tents probably went back to the campground to grab a few hours sleep but the rest left the field was pretty much empty for the cleanup crew to start by dawn the rain helped what time did it start to rain must have been about half two in the morning just a brief shower like so it was mostly dry while this led zeppelin was playing mostly yes yvonne had arrived home at sixthirty chadwick thought which gave her more than enough time to get back from brimleigh if she had been there what had she been doing between three and sixthirty chadwick decided he had better leave that well alone until he had established whether she had been there or not given a time of death between onethirty and fivethirty the victim might have been killed while the band was playing or while everyone was heading home most likely the former he decided as there would have been less chance of witnesses and possibly before the rain as there was no obvious trail are there any other gates he asked in addition to where i came in no only to the north but there are plenty of exits i assume theres fencing all around the site yes it wasnt a free concert you know but no one would have had any real reason to go through the woods no there are no exits on that side it doesnt lead anywhere the parking camping and gates are all on the north side and thats where the nearest road is too i understand you had a bit of trouble with skinheads nothing my men couldnt handle a gang of them tried to break through the fence and we saw them off north or south east actually when was this saturday night did they come back not as far as i know if they did they were quiet about it did people actually sleep in the field over the weekend some did like i said we had a couple of fields for parking and camping just over the hill there a lot of people pitched tents and came back and forth others just brought sleeping bags look why does all this matter id have thought it was obvious what happened chadwick raised his eyebrows oh i must be missing something tell me well she must have got into an argument with her boyfriend or something and he killed her she was a bit away from the crowds there by the edge of the woods and if everyone was listening to led zeppelin they probably wouldnt notice if the world ended loud are they this led zeppelin you could say that you should have a listen maybe i will anyway its a good point youve raised im sure the music might have helped the killer but why assume it was her boyfriend do boyfriends usually stab their girlfriends i dont know its just i mean who else could have been a homicidal maniac perhaps youd know more about that than i do or a passing tramp now youre taking the piss i assure you mr hayes i am taking this very seriously indeed but in order to find out who might have done this boyfriend or whatever we need to know who she is he made a note then looked directly at hayes maybe you can help me there ive never seen her before in my life oh come off it laddie chadwick stared at him i dont know who she is ah but you did see her somewhere hayes looked down at his clasped hands maybe and where perhaps might you have seen her she may have been backstage at some point now were getting somewhere how does a person get to go backstage well usually you need a pass and who hands those out security but hayes wriggled in his chair well you know sometimes a goodlooking girl what can i say how many people were backstage dozens it was chaos back there we had a vip area roped off with a beer tent and lounges then there were the performers caravans dressing rooms toilets we also had a press enclosure in front of the stage some of the performers hung around to listen to other bands you know then maybe theyd jam backstage and you know who were the last groups to play on sunday we kicked off the evening session with the mad hatters just after dark then fleetwood mac pink floyd and led zeppelin were they all backstage at one time or another if they werent onstage yes with guests there were a lot of people how many i dont know maybe fifty or so more thats including roadies managers publicists disc jockeys record company people agents friends of the bands hangerson and what have you did you keep guest lists you must be joking lists of those who were given passes no anyone keep track of comings and goings someone checked passes at the entrance to the backstage area thats all and let in beautiful girls without passes only if they were with someone who did have a pass ah i see so our victim might not have been issued a pass for herself in addition to beer were there any other substances contributing to that general sense of wellbeing backstage i wouldnt know about that i was too busy most of the time i was running around like a bluearsed fly making sure everything was running smoothly keeping everyone happy were they for the most part you got the occasional pillock complaining his caravan was too small but on the whole it was okay chadwick jotted something down he could tell that hayes was craning his neck trying to read it so he rested his hand over the words when he had finished perhaps if we were to narrow down the time of death do you think youd be able to give us a better idea of who might have been backstage maybe i dunno like i said it was a bit of a zoo back there i can imagine did you see her with anyone in particular no it might have been her or it might not have i only got a fleeting glance there were a lot of people a lot of goodlooking birds his expression brightened maybe it wasnt even her lets remain optimistic shall we and assume that it was did the girl you saw have a flower painted on her right cheek i dont know like i said im not even sure it was her lots of girls had painted flowers perhaps your security team might be able to help us maybe if they remember was the press around on and off what do you mean its a matter of give and take isnt it i mean the publicitys always useful and you dont want to piss off the press but at the same time you dont want someone filming your every move or writing about you every time you go to the toilet do you we tried to strike a balance how did that work a big press conference before the event scheduled interviews with specific artists at specific times where in the press enclosure so the press werent allowed backstage you must be joking photographers only in the press enclosure can you give me their names i cant remember them all you can ask mick lawton he was press liaison officer for the event ill give you his number what about television they were here on saturday and sunday let me guess press enclosure for the most part they filmed crowd scenes and the bands performing within strict copyright guidelines with permission and everything ill need the names of television companies involved sure the usual suspects hayes named them it wasnt as if there were that many to choose from and yorkshire television and bbc north would have been chadwicks first guesses anyway chadwick stood up stooping so he didnt bang his head on the ceiling well have a chat with them later see if we can have a look at their footage and well be talking with your security people too thanks for your time hayes shuffled to his feet looking surprised thats it chadwick smiled for now it was like a scene out of dickens painted with rembrandts sense of light and shade there were two distinct groups in the lowbeamed lounge one playing cards the other in the midst of an animated conversation gnarled weatherbeaten faces with lined cheeks and potato noses lit by candles and the wood fire that crackled in the hearth the two people behind the bar were younger one was a local girl banks was sure he had seen before a pale willowy blonde of nineteen or twenty the other was a young man about ten years older with curly hair and a wispy goatee everyone stopped what they were doing and looked toward the door when banks and annie walked in then the cardplayers resumed their game and the other group muttered quietly nasty night out there said the young man behind the bar what can i get for you ill have a pint of black sheep said banks showing his warrant card and di cabbot here will have a slimline bitter lemon no ice annie raised an eyebrow at banks but accepted the drink when it came and took out her notebook thought it wouldnt be long before you lot came sniffing around all that activity going on out there said the young man his biceps bulged as he pulled bankss pint and youll be cameron clarke landlord everyone calls me cc banks paid for the drinks against ccs protests and took a sip of his beer well cameron he said this is a nice pint you keep i must say thanks banks turned to the girl and you are kelly she said shifting from foot to foot and twirling her hair kelly soames i just work here like cc kelly wore a white tshirt with the cross keys inn emblazoned across her chest there was enough candlelight behind the bar to see that the thin material came to a stop about three inches above her lowrise jeans and broad studded belt exposing a flat strip of pale white skin and a belly button from which hung a short silver chain as far as banks was concerned the baremidriff trend had turned every male over forty into a dirty old man he glanced around a middleaged couple he hadnt noticed when he came in sat on the bench below the bay window tourists by the look of them anoraks and an expensive camera bag on the seat beside them several of the people were smoking and banks suppressed a sudden urge for a cigarette he addressed the whole pub does anyone know whats happened up the road they all shook their heads and muttered no anyone leave here during the last couple of hours one or two cc answered ill need their names cc told him when did the electricity go off about two hours ago theres a line down on the eastvale road it could take an hour or two more or so they said it was half past nine now banks noted so the power cut had occurred at half past seven it would be easy enough to check the exact time with yorkshire electricity but that would do to be going on with if nick the victim had been killed between six and eight then had the killer seized the opportunity of the cover of extra darkness or had he acted sooner between six and half past seven it probably didnt matter except that the power cut had brought mrs tanner to check on her tenant and the body had been discovered perhaps quite a bit sooner than the killer had hoped anyone arrive after the electricity went off we arrived at about a quarter to eight said the man in the baywindow seat isnt that right darling the woman beside him nodded we were on our way to eastvale back to the hotel he went on and this is the first place we saw that was open i dont like driving after dark at the best of times i dont blame you banks said did you see anyone else on the road no i mean there might have been a car or two earlier but we didnt see anyone after the power went out where were you coming from swainshead did you see anyone when you parked here no i mean i dont think so the wind was so loud and the branches you might have seen someone i thought i saw the taillights of a car the mans wife said where heading up the hill straight on i dont know where the road goes but i cant be certain as my husband says it was a bit like a hurricane out there it could have been something else flashing in the dark a lantern or a torch or something you didnt see or hear anything else they both shook their heads a possible sighting of a car heading up the unfenced road over the moors then that was the sum of it they would make inquiries at the youth hostel of course but it was hardly likely their murderer was conveniently staying there still someone might have seen something banks turned back to cc well need statements from everyone in here names and addresses when they arrived that sort of thing ill send someone over for the moment though did anyone leave and come back between six and eight i did said one of the cardplayers what time would that be about seven oclock how long were you gone about fifteen minutes as long as it takes to drive to lyndgarth and back why did you drive to lyndgarth and back i live there he said i thought i might have forgotten to turn the gas ring off after i had my tea so i went back to check and had you what turned the gas ring off oh aye wasted journey then not if i hadnt turned it off that raised a titter from his cronies banks didnt want to get mired any deeper in yorkshire logic you still havent told us whats happened another of the cardplayers piped up why are you asking all these questions a candle guttered on the table and went out leaving his gnarled face in shadow this is just the beginning said banks thinking he might as well tell them they would find out soon enough it looks very much as if we have a murder on our hands a collective gasp rose from the drinkers followed by more muted muttering who was it if i might ask said cc i wish i knew said banks maybe you can help me there all i know is that his name was nick and he was staying at moorview cottage mrs tanners young lad then said cc she was in here looking for him not so long ago i know said banks she found him poor woman tell her theres a drink on the house waiting for her whatever she wants have you seen her husband tonight banks asked remembering that mrs tanner had told him her husband was at a darts match jack tanner no hes not welcome here whys that im sorry to say it but hes a troublemaker ask anyone soon as hes got three or four pints into him hes picking on someone i see said banks thats interesting to know now wait a minute protested cc im not saying hes capable of owt like that like what you know what you said murdering someone do you know anything about the young man annie asked cc was so distracted by her breaking her silence that he stopped spluttering he came in a couple of times he said did he talk to anyone only to ask for a drink like and food he had a bar snack here once didnt he kelly kelly was on the verge of tears banks noticed anything to add he asked her even in the candlelight banks could see that she blushed no she said why should i just asking look he was just a normal bloke cc said you know said hello smiled put his glass back on the bar when he left not like some did he smoke cc seemed puzzled by the question then he said yes yes he did did he stand at the bar and chat annie asked he wasnt the chatty sort said cc hed take his drink and go sit over there with the newspaper he gestured toward the hearth which newspaper banks asked cc frowned the independent he said i think he liked to do the crossword too hard for me that one i can barely manage the daily mirror why does it matter banks favored him with a tight smile maybe it doesnt he said but i like to know these things it tells me he was intelligent at any rate if you call doing crossword puzzles intelligent i suppose it does i think theyre a bit of a waste of time myself ah but you cant do them can you does either of you have any idea what he did for a living annie asked glancing from cc to kelly and back i told you said cc he wasnt chatty and im not especially the nosy type man wants to come in here and have a quiet drink hes more than welcome as far as im concerned so it never came up annie said no maybe he was a writer or a reviewer or something why do you say that well if he didnt have the newspaper he always had a book with him he glanced toward banks and dont ask me what book he was reading because i didnt spot the title any idea what he was doing here this time of year banks asked none look we often get people staying at moorview cottage dropping by for a pint or a meal and we dont know any more or less about them than we did about him you dont get to know people that quickly especially if theyre the quiet type point taken said banks he knew quite well how long it took the locals to accept newcomers in a place like fordham and no holidaying cottager could ever stay long enough that just about wraps it up for now he looked at annie anything else you can think of no said annie putting away her notebook banks drained his pint right then well be off and someone will be over to take your statements kelly soames was chewing on her plump pink lower lip banks noticed glancing back as he followed annie out of the pub monday th september the newshounds had sniffed out a crime at about the same time that the incident van arrived and the first on the scene was a yorkshire evening post reporter shortly followed by local radio and television the same people who had no doubt been reporting on the festival chadwick knew that his relationship with them was held in a delicate balance they were after a sensational story one that would make people buy their newspapers or tune in to their channel and chadwick needed them on his side they could be of invaluable help in identifying a victim for example or even in staging a reconstruction in this case there wasnt much he could tell them he didnt go into details about the wounds nor did he mention the flower painted on the victims cheek though he knew that that was the sort of sensationalist information they wanted the more he could keep out of the public domain the better when it came to court he did however get them to agree to let police look at the weekends footage it would probably be a waste of time but it had to be done when chadwick was done at the field it was afternoon and he realized he was hungry he had dc bradley drive him to the nearest village denleigh about a mile to the northeast it had turned into a fine day and only a thin gauze of cloud hung in the sky to filter a little of the suns heat the village had a sort of stunned appearance about it and chadwick noticed that it was unusually messy the streets littered with wastepaper and empty cigarette packets at first it seemed there was nobody about but then they saw a man walking by the village green and pulled up beside him he was a tweedy sort with a stiffbrush mustache and a pipe he looked to chadwick like a retired military officer reminded him of a colonel hed had in burma during the war anywhere to eat around here chadwick asked winding the window down fishandchip shop just round the corner the man said should be still open then he peered more closely at chadwick do i know you i dont think so chadwick said im a policeman huh we could have done with a few more of your lot around this weekend the man went on by the way forbes is the name archie forbes they shook hands through the window unfortunately we cant be everywhere mr forbes said chadwick was there any damage one of them broke the newsagents window when ted told them hed run out of cigarette papers some of them even slept in mrs wrigleys back garden scared her half to death i suppose youre here about that girl they found dead in a sleeping bag news travels fast it does around these parts communism you mark my words thats whats behind it communism probably said chadwick moving to wind up the window forbes kept talking i still have one or two contacts in the intelligence services if you catch my drift he said putting a crooked finger to the side of his nose and theres no doubt in my mind and in the minds of many other rightthinking people i might add that this is a lot more than just youthful high spirits behind it all youll find those french and german student anarchist groups and behind them youll find communism need i spell it out sir the russians he took a puff on his pipe theres no doubt in my mind that there are some very unscrupulous people directing events behind the scenes unscrupulous foreigners for the most part and their goal is the overthrow of democratic government everywhere drugs are only a part of their master plan these are frightening times we live in yes said chadwick well thanks very much mr forbes well be off for those fish and chips now he signaled for bradley to drive off as he wound up the window leaving forbes staring after them they had a laugh about forbes though chadwick believed there might be something in what hed said about foreign students fomenting dissent they soon found the fishandchip shop and sat in the car eating when chadwick had finished he screwed up the newspaper then excused himself got out of the car and put it in the rubbish bin next he went into the telephone booth beside the fishandchipshop and dialed home janet answered on the third ring hello darling she said is anything wrong no nothings wrong said chadwick i was wondering about yvonne how is she today back to normal it seems did she say anything about last night no we didnt talk she left for school at the usual time and gave me a quick peck on the cheek on her way out look lets just leave it at that for the time being darling cant we if shes sleeping with someone i want to know who it is and what good would that do you what would you do if you knew go over and beat him up arrest him be sensible stan shell tell us in her own time or when its too late what do you mean oh never mind said chadwick look i have to go dont bother keeping dinner warm tonight ill probably be late how late i dont know dont wait up what is it murder a nasty one youll hear all about it on the evening news be careful stan dont worry ill be fine chadwick hung up and went back to the car everything all right sir bradley asked window rolled down halfway through his postfishandchips cigarette the cars interior smelled of lard vinegar and warm newsprint yes said chadwick right now i think wed better head back to brimleigh glen and see whats been happening there dont you monday th september the search team had fastened tape to the four trees that surrounded the little grove deep in brimleigh woods about two hundred yards from where the body had been found the woods were dense enough that from there you couldnt see as far as the field and any noise would certainly have been drowned out by the music the police dog had found the spot easily enough by following the smell of the victims blood officers had also marked off the route the dog had taken and painted little crosses on the trees every inch of the path would have to be searched for the moment though chadwick enderby and bradley stood behind the tape gazing down at the bloodstained ground this where it happened chadwick asked so the experts tell me said enderby pointing to bloodstains on the leaves and undergrowth theres some blood here consistent with the wounds the victim received wouldnt the killer have been covered in blood bradley asked not necessarily said enderby peculiar things stab wounds certainly with a slashed neck artery or vein or a head wound theres quite a lot of spatter but with the heart oddly enough the edges of the wound close and most of the bleeding is internal it doesnt spurt the way many people think it does theres quite a bit of seepage of course thats what youre seeing here and in the sleeping bag and i doubt hed have got away with his hands completely clean after all it looks as if he stabbed her five or six time and twisted the blade he gestured to the edge of the copse if you look over there though by the stream you can see that little pile of leaves theyve got traces of blood on them too i reckon that he tried to wipe it off with the leaves first then he washed his hands in the running water get it all collected and sent to the lab said chadwick turning away he wasnt usually sentimental about victims but he couldnt get the image of the innocentlooking girl in the bloodstained white dress out of his mind and he couldnt help but think of his own daughter when did the doctor say hed get around to the postmortem he said hed try for later this afternoon sir said enderby good weve interviewed most of the people on security duty enderby added and nothing im afraid sir they all agree there was so much coming and going so much pandemonium that nobody knows who was where when ive a good suspicion most of them were partaking of the same substances as the musicians and guests too which doesnt help their memories much lots of people were wandering around in a daze hmm said chadwick i didnt think we could expect too much from them what about the girl no one admits definitely to seeing her but weve got a couple of cautious maybes push a bit harder will do sir chadwick sighed i suppose wed better arrange to talk to the groups who were backstage at the time get statements for what theyre worth sir said enderby what you might find that a bit difficult sir i mean theyll have all gone home now and these people well theyre not readily accessible theyre no different from you and me are they enderby not royalty or anything no sir more like film stars but well then ill deal with the two local groups but as far as the rest are concerned arrange to have them interviewed get someone to help you yes sir enderby replied tightly and turned away and enderby sir i dont know what the standards are in north yorkshire but while youre working for me id prefer it if you got your hair cut enderby reddened yes sir bit hard on him werent you sir said bradley when enderby had gone hes a scruff no sir i mean about questioning the groups hes right you know some of these pop stars are a bit high and mighty what would you have me do simon ignore the fifty or so people who might have seen the victim with her killer because theyre some sort of gods no sir come on lets head back home i should be in time for dr oneills postmortem if im lucky and i want you to go to yorkshire television and the bbc and have a look at the footage they shot of the festival what am i looking for sir right now anything the girl anyone she might have been with any odd or unusual behavior chadwick paused on second thought dont worry about that last bit its all bound to be odd and unusual given the people were dealing with bradley laughed yes sir just use your initiative laddie at least you wont have to watch the doctor open the poor girl up before they walked away chadwick turned back to the bloodstained ground what is it sir bradley asked something thats been bothering me all morning the sleeping bag sleeping bag aye who did it belong to her i suppose said bradley perhaps chadwick said but why would she carry it into the woods with her it just seems odd thats all chapter three it was after midnight when the lights came back on and the wind was still raging now lashing torrents of rain against the windows and lichenstained roofs of fordham the coroners van had taken the body away and dr glendenning had said he would try to get the postmortem done the following day even though it was a saturday the socos worked on in the new light just as they had done before collecting samples labeling and storing everything carefully so far they had discovered nothing of immediate importance one or two members of the local media had arrived and the police press officer david whitney was on the scene keeping them back and feeding them titbits of information banks used the newly restored electric light to have a good look around the rest of the cottage and it didnt take him very long to realize that any personal items nick might have had with him were gone except for his clothes toiletries and a few books there was no wallet for example no mobile nothing with his name on it the clothes didnt tell him much nothing fancy just casual gapstyle shirts a graypinstripe jacket cargos and levis for the most part all the toiletries told him was that nick suffered from or worried that he might suffer from heartburn and indigestion judging by the variety of antacids he had brought with him winsome reported that his car was a renault mégane and to open it you needed a card not a key there wasnt one in sight so she had phoned the police garage in eastvale who said they would send someone out as soon as possible there was nothing relating to the car on the police national computer winsome added so she would have to get the details from the driver and vehicle licensing agency in swansea as soon as she could raise someone which wouldnt be easy on a weekend if necessary they could check the national dna database which held samples of the dna not only of convicted criminals but of anyone who had been arrested even if they had been acquitted the public railed about its attacks on freedom but the database had come in useful more than once for identifying a body among other things they would find out who nick was soon enough but someone was making it difficult for them and banks wondered why would knowing the victims identity point the police quickly in the direction of the killer did he need time to make his escape it was clear that only one of the two bedrooms had been used the beds werent even made up in the other from what banks could see at a cursory glance it looked as if both sides of the double bed had been slept on but nick might have been a restless sleeper peter darby had already photographed the room and the socos would bag the sheets for testing there was no sign of condoms in any of the bedside drawers or anywhere else for that matter and nothing at all to show who or what the mysterious nick had been except for the paperback copy of ian mcewans atonement on the bedside table according to the waterstones bookmark nick had got to page sixtyeight banks picked up the book and flipped through it on the back endpaper someone had written in faint pencil six uneven rows of figures some of them circled he turned to the front and saw the price of the book also in pencil but in a different hand at the top right of the first inside page a secondhand book then which meant that any number of people might have owned it and written the figures in the back still it might mean something banks called up a soco to bag it and told him to be sure to make a photocopy of the page in question frustrated by this early lack of knowledge of the victim banks went back downstairs usually he had a persons books or cd collection to go on not to mention the opinions of others but this time all he knew was that nick did the independent crossword was reading atonement was polite but not particularly chatty favored casual clothing perhaps suffered from indigestion smoked dunhills and wore glasses it wasnt anywhere near enough to help start figuring out who might have wanted him dead and why patience he told himself early days yet but he didnt feel patient by half past twelve hed had enough time to go home just as he was about to get pc travers to fix up a lift for him annie edged over and said theres not a lot more we can achieve hanging around here is there nothing said banks the mechanics are all in motion and stefan will get in touch with us if anything important comes up but i doubt well get any further tonight why annie smiled at him well i dont know about you but im starving and as i remember marks and spencers vegetarian lasagna heats up a treat you know what they say about an army marching on its stomach and all that monday th september yvonne chadwick accepted the joint that steve passed to her and drew deeply she liked getting high not the hard stuff no pills or needles only dope sex was all right too she liked that well enough with steve but most of all she liked getting high and the two usually went together really well music too they were listening to hendrixs electric ladyland and it sounded out of this world take now she was supposed to be at school but she had taken the afternoon off it was only games and free periods anyway the new term hadnt really got under way yet there was a house just up the road from her school on springfield mount where a group of hippies lived steve todd jacqui american charlie and others who came and went she had become friendly with them after she met steve upstairs at the peel on boar lane one night in april when shed gone there with her friend lorraine from school she had just turned sixteen the month before but she could pass for eighteen easily enough with a bit of makeup and high heels steve was the handsome sensitive sort of boy and she had fancied him straightaway hed read her some of his poetry and while she didnt really understand it she could tell that it sounded important there were other houses she visited where people were into the same things too one on carberry place and another on bayswater terrace yvonne felt that she could turn up at any one of them at any time and feel as if she really belonged there everyone accepted her just as she was someone was always around to welcome her maybe with a joint and a pot of jasmine tea they all liked the same music too and agreed about society and the evils of the war and stuff but springfield mount was the closest and steve lived there the air smelled of sandalwood incense and there were posters on the walls jimi hendrix janis joplin a creepy salvador dalí print and even creepier goyas etching the sleep of reason brings forth monsters sometimes when she was smoking really good dope yvonne would lose herself in that one the sleeping artist surrounded by creatures of the night mostly they all just sat around and talked about the terrible shape the world was in and how they hoped to change it end the war in vietnam free the universities from the establishment and their professor lackeys put a stop to imperialism and capitalist oppression yvonne couldnt wait to go to university as far as she was concerned that was where life got really exciting not like boring old school where they still treated you like a kid and werent interested in what you thought about the world at university you were a student and you went to demos and things steve was a secondyear english student but the term wasnt due to start for a couple of weeks yet hed told her he would get her into all the great concerts at the university refectory next term and she could hardly wait the moody blues were coming and family and tyrannosaurus rex there were even rumors of the who coming to record a live concert they had already seen a lot of great local gigs together that summer thunderclap newman at the town hall pink floyd colosseum and eire apparent at selby abbey she regretted missing the isle of wight dylan had been there after all but her parents wouldnt let her go that far she had two years to wait to go to university and she had to get good a levels right now that didnt look like a strong possibility but shed worry about that later she had just started in the lower sixth so there was plenty of time yet to catch up after all she had managed to get seven very good o levels she had to admit as she grinned through the haze of smoke that things were looking pretty good sunday had been great they had gone to the brimleigh festival she steve todd charlie and jacqui and they had stayed up all night on the field sharing joints food and drink with their fellow revelers steve had dropped acid but yvonne hadnt wanted to because there were too many people around and she worried about getting paranoid but steve had seemed okay though shed got worried at one time when he disappeared for more than an hour when it was all over they went to springfield mount for a while to come down with a couple of joints and then she went home to get ready for school narrowly avoiding bumping into her father she hadnt dared tell her parents where she was going christ why did she have to have a father who was a pig for crying out loud it just wasnt fair if she told her new friends what her old man did for a living theyd drop her like a hot coal and if it wasnt for her parents she could have gone to brimleigh on saturday too steve and the others had been there both nights but if shed done that she realized they wouldnt let her out on sunday they were sitting on the living room floor propped up against the sofa just her and steve this time the others were all out some of the people who came and went she wasnt too sure about at all one of them magic jack was scary with his beard and wild eyes although she had never seen him behave in any other way than gently but the most frightening of all and thank god he didnt turn up very often was mcgarrity the mad poet there was something about mcgarrity that really worried yvonne older than the rest he had a thin lined parchment face and black eyes he always wore a black hat and a matching cape and he had a flickknife with a tortoiseshell handle he never really talked to anyone never joined in the discussions sometimes he would pace up and down tapping the blade against his palm muttering to himself reciting poetry t s eliot mostly the waste land yvonne only recognized it because steve had lent her a copy to read not so long ago and he had explained its meaning to her some people found mcgarrity okay but he gave yvonne the creeps she had asked steve once why they let him hang around but all steve had said was that mcgarrity was harmless really it was just that his mind had been damaged a bit by the electric shock treatment theyd given him at the mental home when he deserted from the army besides if they wanted a free and open society how could they justify excluding people there wasnt much to say after that though yvonne thought there were probably a few people they wouldnt like to have in the house her dad for example mcgarrity had been at brimleigh too but luckily hed wandered off and left them alone yvonne could feel steves hand on her thigh gently stroking and she turned to smile at him it was all right really it was all right her parents didnt know it but she was on the pill had been since shed turned sixteen it wasnt easy to get and there was no way she would have asked old cuthbertson the family doctor but her friend maggie had told her about a new familyplanning clinic on woodhouse lane where they were very concerned about teenage pregnancies and very obliging if you said you were over the age of consent steve kissed her and put his hand on her breast the dope they were smoking wasnt especially strong but it heightened her sense of touch as it did her hearing and she felt herself responding to his caresses getting wet he undid the buttons on her school blouse and then she felt his hand moving up over her bare thighs jimi hendrix was singing when steve and yvonne toppled onto the floor pulling at one anothers clothing monday th september chadwick leaned back against the cool tiles of the mortuary wall and watched dr oneill and his assistant at work under the bright light postmortems had never bothered him and this one was no exception even though the victim had reminded him earlier of yvonne now she was just an unfortunate dead girl on the porcelain slab her life was gone drained out of her and all that remained were flesh muscle blood bone and organs and possibly clues the painted cornflower looked even more incongruous in this harsh steelandporcelain environment blooming on her dead cheek chadwick found himself wondering not for the first time whether it had been painted by the girl herself by a friend or by her killer and if the latter what was its significance dr oneill had carefully removed the bloody dress after matching the holes in the material to the wounds and set it aside with the sleeping bag for further forensic testing so far they had discovered that the sleeping bag was a cheap popular brand sold mainly through woolworths the doctor bent over the pale naked body to examine the stab wounds there were five in all he noted and one had been so hard and gone so deep that it had bruised the surrounding skin if the hilt of the knife had caused the bruising as dr oneill believed it had they were dealing with a singleedged fourinch blade a very thin stilettotype blade too allowing that it was a bit bigger than the actual wounds owing to the elasticity of the skin one strong possibility he suggested was a flickknife they were illegal in britain but easy enough to pick up on the continent judging by the angles of the wounds dr oneill concluded that the victim had been stabbed by a strong lefthanded person standing behind her the complete lack of defense wounds on her hands indicated that she had been so taken by surprise that she had either died or gone into shock before she knew what was happening she may not have seen her killer then said chadwick unless it was someone she knew well enough to let that close i cant speculate on that you can see as well as i can though that there appear to be no other injuries to the surface of the body apart from that light bruising on the neck which tells me someone held her in a stranglehold with his right arm while he stabbed her with his left well be testing for drugs too of course its possible she was slipped something that immobilized her nembutal tuinal something like that but she was standing when she was stabbed the angles tell us that much so she must have been conscious chadwick looked down at the body dr oneill was right apart from the faint discoloration on her neck and the mess around her left breast she was in almost pristine condition no cuts no rope burns nothing was he taller than her chadwick asked yes judging by the shape and position of the bruises and the angle of the cuts id estimate by a good six inches she was five foot four which makes him at least five foot ten would you say the bruising indicates a struggle not necessarily as you can see its fairly mild he could simply have had his arm loosely around her neck then tightened it when he stabbed her it probably all happened so quickly he didnt need to restrain her we already know there are no defensive wounds to the hands which indicates she was taken by surprise if thats the case she would have slumped as she died and his arm could have caused the bruising then i thought bodies didnt bruise after death this would have been the moment before death or at the moment of death dr oneill turned his attention to the golden hair between the girls legs and chadwick felt himself tense so like yvonnes when he had seen her naked that time by accident at the caravan how embarrassed they had both felt again said dr oneill well have to do swabs and further tests but there doesnt appear to be any sign of sexual activity theres no bruising around the vaginal areas or the anus so youre saying she wasnt raped she didnt have sex im not committing myself to anything yet said dr oneill sharply not until ive done an internal examination and the samples have been analyzed all im saying is there are no obvious superficial signs of forced or rough sexual activity one thing we did find was a tampon it looks as if our victim was menstruating at the time of the murder which still doesnt rule out sexual activity altogether not at all but if she did have sex she had time to put another tampon in before she was killed chadwick thought for a moment if sex had been the reason for her death then surely there would have been more signs of violence unless they had been lovers to begin with had they made love first then dressed and while she was leaning back on him in the afterglow he killed her but why if sex had been consensual had she perhaps refused said she was having her period and had that somehow angered her attacker were they really dealing with a nutcase as often as not chadwick knew investigations including the medical kind threw up more questions than answers and it was only through answering them that you made progress chadwick watched as oneill and his assistant made the y incision and peeled back the skin muscle and soft tissues from the chest wall before pulling the chest flap up over her face and cutting through the rib cage with an electric saw the smell was overwhelming raw meat lamb mostly chadwick thought hmm its as i suspected said dr oneill the chest cavity is filled with blood as are all the other cavities massive internal bleeding would she have died quickly dr oneill probed around and remained silent a few minutes then he said from the state of her seconds at most look here he twisted the knife so sharply he actually cut off a piece of her heart chadwick looked as usual he wished he could see what dr oneill did but all he saw was a mass of glistening bloody organ tissue ill take your word for it he said dr oneills assistant carefully started removing the inner organs for sectioning further testing and examination barring any glaring anomalies chadwick knew it would be a few days before he received the results of all this there was no real reason to stick around and he had more than enough things to do he left just as dr oneill started up the saw to cut through the victims skull and remove her brain saturday morning dawned fresh and clear and helmthorpe had that rinsed and scoured look the streets limestone buildings and flagstone roofs still dark with rain but the sun out the sky blue and a cool wind to rattle the bare branches banks fiddled with the attachment that let him play the ipod through the car stereo and was rewarded by judy collins singing who knows where the time goes in a voice of such aching beauty and clarity that it made him want to laugh and cry at the same time sandy dennys lyrics had never seemed so doomladen they made him think about his brother roy almost as a rebuke it seemed the porsche coursed smoothly and powerfully through the lateautumn landscape after she had eaten the lasagna and drunk one small glass of wine annie had driven off to harkside and left banks to his own devices it was after two in the morning but he had poured himself a glass of amarone and listened to fischerdieskaus winterreise in the dark before heading for bed with a head full of gloomy thoughts even then he hadnt been able to sleep it was partly heartburn from eating so late he wished he had taken one of nicks antacids as he had none in the house and partly disturbing dreams during those brief moments when he did nod off several times he awoke abruptly with his heart pounding and a vague terrifying image skittering away down the slippery slopes of his subconscious he had lain there taking slow deep breaths until he had fallen asleep about an hour before the alarm went off the team gathered in the boardroom crime scene photos pinned to the corkboard but the whiteboard was conspicuously empty apart from the name nick an incident van had been dispatched to fordham earlier in the morning fitted out with phones and computers information collected there would be collated and passed on to headquarters banks was officially the senior investigating officer appointed by assistant chief constable ron mclaughlin and annie was his deputy other tasks would be assigned to various officers according to their skills since detective superintendent gristhorpe had retired two months ago they had been given a temporary replacement in catherine gervaise there were those who muttered that banks should have got the job but he knew it had never been on the cards he had got on well enough with acc mclaughlin red ron and with the chief constable himself on those rare occasions when they met but he was too much of a loose cannon if nothing else running off to london to look for his brother and getting involved in all that followed from that had put several nails in the coffin of his career besides he didnt want the responsibility or the paperwork gristhorpe had always left him alone to work cases the way he wanted which meant he ended up doing a lot of the legwork and streetwork himself because that was the way he liked it catherine gervaise was cool and distant not a mentor and friend the way gristhorpe had been and under her rule he found that he had to fight harder for his privileges she was an administrator through and through an ambitious woman who had risen quickly through the ranks via acceleratedpromotion schemes management and computer courses and some said by affirmative action this would be her first major investigation at western area headquarters so it would be interesting to see how she handled it at least she wasnt stupid banks thought and she should know how best to use her resources some were put off by her posh accent and cheltenham ladies college background but banks was inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt as long as she left him alone the one thing they had in common he discovered was that she also had season tickets to opera north and he had seen her at a performance of lucia di lammermoor with her husband he didnt think she had noticed him at least she hadnt let on in appearance she wore little makeup and was rather severe with short blond hair rather unexpected cupidsbow lips and a trim figure in dress she was conservative favoring navy suits and white blouses and in manner she was nononsense remaining aloof and either not getting the squad room humor or not wishing to show that she did the superintendent asked for a summary of what they had so far which wasnt much the bloodspatter analysis was consistent with the theory that nick had been bashed over the back of the head with a poker as he had been turning away from his killer perhaps walking toward his cigarettes after that he had been hit once or twice more they wouldnt know until dr glendenning performed the postmortem no doubt to make sure he was dead have we got any further identifying the victim superintendent gervaise asked next a little maam said winsome at least the local memory tag on his license plate number indicates the car was registered in london its not hired no we finally got a look inside with the help of the garage unfortunately there was nothing inside to indicate who he was either so someone really wanted to throw sand in our eyes well maam its a fairly new car and he might not have been the kind of person who lives out of it but it certainly looks that way whoever did it must have known he could only have slowed the investigation down though winsome looked at banks who nodded for her to go on which probably means that he wanted to give himself a bit of time to get far enough away and arrange an alibi interesting theory dc jackman said gervaise but thats all it is isnt it a theory yes maam for the moment and we need facts that was pretty much selfevident in any investigation banks thought of course you wanted facts but until you got them you played around with theories you used what you did have then you applied a bit of imagination and as often as not you came up with an approximation of the truth which was what he thought winsome was doing so ms gervaise wanted to establish herself as a justthefacts nofancytheories kind of superintendent well so be it the squad would soon learn to keep their theories to themselves but banks hoped her attitude wouldnt completely crush their creativity and wouldnt stop them from confiding their theories in him it was all very well to come in with an attitude but it was another thing if that attitude destroyed the delicate balance that had already been achieved over time they were drastically short of dcs having recently lost gavin rickerd their best office manager to the new neighborhood policing initiative where he was working with community support officers and specials to tackle the antisocial behavior that was becoming increasingly the norm all over the country especially on a saturday night in eastvale gavin hadnt been replaced yet and in his absence the job this time had gone to one of the uniformed constables hardly the ideal choice but the best they could do right now banks wanted winsome jackman and kev templeton doing what they did best tracking down information and following leads and when it came to that detective sergeant hatchley had always been a bit slow and lazy his physical presence used to help intimidate the odd suspect or two but these days the exrugby players muscle had gone mostly to fat and the police werent allowed to intimidate villains anymore villains rights had put paid to that or so it sometimes seemed especially since a burglar had fallen off the roof of a warehouse he had broken into last summer then sued the owner for damages and won im trying to get in touch with the dvla in swansea winsome said but its saturday theyre closed and i cant seem to track down my contact keep trying said superintendent gervaise is there anything else winsome consulted her notes ds templeton and i interviewed the people in the cross keys and took statements nothing new there and when the lights came on we made a quick check of their outer clothing for signs of blood there were none whats your take on this gervaise asked banks i dont have enough facts yet to form an opinion banks said the irony wasnt lost on superintendent gervaise who pursed her lips she looked as if she had just bitten into a particularly vinegary pickle banks noticed annie look away and smile to herself pen against her lips shaking her head slowly i understand you entered a licensed premises during the early stages of the investigation yesterday evening gervaise said thats right banks wondered who had been talking and why i suppose you know there are regulations governing drinking whilst on duty with all due respect banks said i didnt go there for a drink i went to question possible witnesses but you did have a drink while i was there yes i find it puts people at ease they see you as more like they are not as the enemy duly noted said gervaise dryly and did you find any cooperative witnesses nobody seemed to know very much about the victim banks said he was renting a cottage not a local on holiday at this time of year thats what i wondered about find out what he was doing there that might help us get to the bottom of this quite the one for dishing out obvious orders was superintendent gervaise banks thought hed had bosses like that before state the obvious the things your team would do anyway without even being asked and take the credit for the results of course he said were working on it one of the staff might know a bit more than shes letting on what makes you think that her manner body language all right question her bring her in if necessary banks could tell by superintendent gervaises clipped tone and the way her hand strayed to her short layered locks that she was getting bored with the meeting and anxious to get away no doubt to send out a memo on drinking while on duty or the ten most obvious courses to pursue during a murder inquiry if thats all for now ladies and gentlemen she went on stuffing her papers into her briefcase then i suggest we all get down to work to a chorus of muttered yes maams she left the room heels clicking against the hardwood floor only after shed gone did banks realize that he had forgotten to tell her about the figures in the book monday th september janet was watching the news at ten when chadwick got home that evening and reginald bosanquet was talking about itas exciting new uhf color transmissions from the crystal palace transmitter which was all very well chadwick thought if you happened to own a color tv he didnt not on a dis pay of a little over two thousand pounds per year janet walked toward him hard day she asked chadwick nodded kissed her and sat down in his favorite armchair drink a small whiskey would go down nicely yvonne not home yet he glanced at the clock twenty past ten not yet know where she is janet turned from pouring the whiskey out with friends was all she said she shouldnt go out so often on school nights she knows that janet handed him the drink shes sixteen we cant expect her to do everything the way wed like it things are different these days teenagers have a lot more freedom freedom as long as shes under this roof weve a right to expect some degree of honesty and respect from her havent we chadwick argued the next thing you know shell be dropping out and running off to live in a hippie commune freedom oh give it a rest stan shes going through a stage thats all janet softened her tone shell get over it werent you just a little bit rebellious when you were sixteen chadwick tried to remember he didnt think so it was when he was sixteen before teenagers had been invented when youth was simply an unfortunate period one had to pass through on the route from childhood to maturity another world george vi was crowned king that year neville chamberlain became prime minister and looked likely to get along well with hitler and the spanish civil war was at its bloodiest but chadwick had paid only scant attention to world affairs he was at grammar school then on a scholarship playing rugby with the first fifteen and all set for a university career that was interrupted by the war and somehow never got resurrected he had volunteered for the green howards in because his father had served with them in the first world war and spent the next five years killing first japanese then germans while trying to stay alive himself after it was all over and he was back on civvy street in his demob suit it took him six years to get over it six years of deadend jobs bouts of depression loneliness and hunger he nearly died of cold in the bitter winter of then it was as if the weight suddenly lifted and the lights came on he joined the west riding constabulary in the following year he met janet at a dance they were married only three months later and a year after that in march yvonne was born rebellious he didnt think so it seemed to be a young persons lot in life to go off to war back then just like the generation before him and in the army you obeyed orders hed got into minor mischief like all the other kids smoking before he was old enough the odd bit of shoplifting sneaking drinks from his fathers whiskey bottle replacing what hed drunk with water he also got into the occasional scrap but one thing he didnt dare do was disobey his parents if he had stayed out all night without permission his father would have beaten him black and blue chadwick grunted he didnt suppose janet really wanted an answer she was just trying to ease the way for yvonnes arrival home which he hoped would be soon the news finished at ten fortyfive and the latenight x film came on normally chadwick wouldnt bother watching such rubbish but this week it was saturday night and sunday morning which he and janet had seen at the lyric about eight years ago and he didnt mind watching it again at least it was the sort of life he could understand real life not longhaired kids listening to loud music and taking drugs it was about quarter past eleven when he heard the front door open and shut by that time his anger had edged over into concern but in a parent the two are often so intermingled as to be indistinguishable where have you been he asked yvonne when she walked into the living room in her pale blue bellbottomed jeans and red cheesecloth top with whiteandblue embroidery down the gathered front her eyes looked a little bleary but other than that she seemed all right thats a nice welcome she said are you going to answer me if you must know ive been to the grove wheres that down past the station by the canal and what goes on there nothing goes on its folk night on mondays people sing folk songs and read poetry you know youre not old enough to drink i wasnt drinking not alcohol anyway you smell of smoke its a pub dad people were smoking look if all youre going to do is go on at me like this im off to bed its a school day tomorrow or didnt you know enough of your cheek youre too young to be hanging around pubs in town god knows who if it was up to you i wouldnt have any friends at all would i and id never go anywhere you make me sick and with that yvonne stomped upstairs to her room chadwick made to follow her but janet grabbed his arm no stan not now lets not have another flaming row not tonight furious as he felt chadwick realized she was right besides he was exhausted not the best time to get into a long argument with his daughter but hed have it out with her tomorrow find out what she was up to where she had been all sunday night exactly what crowd she was hanging around with even if he had to follow her he could hear her banging about upstairs using the toilet and the bathroom slamming her bedroom door making a point of it it was impossible to get back into the film now impossible to go to sleep too no matter how tired he felt if hed had a dog he would have taken it for a walk instead he poured himself another small whiskey and while janet pretended to read her womans weekly he pretended to watch saturday night and sunday morning until all was silent upstairs and it was safe to go to bed chapter four annie took a chance that kelly soames would be turning up for work on saturday morning so she parked behind the incident van in fordham and adjusted her rearview mirror so that she could see the pub and the road behind her banks had told her he thought kelly didnt want to talk last night because there were people around and she might have a personal secret therefore it would be a good idea to get her alone take her somewhere he also thought a woman might have more chance of getting whatever it was out of her hence annie just before eleven oclock annie saw kelly get out of a car she recognized the driver he was one of the men who had been in the pub the previous evening one of the cardplayers as soon as he had driven off and turned the bend annie backed up and intercepted kelly a word with you please she said kelly made toward the pub door i cant ill be late for work annie opened her passenger door youll be a lot later if you dont come with me now kelly chewed her lip then muttered something under her breath and got in the old purple astra it was long past time for a new car annie realized but shed had neither the time nor the money lately banks had offered her his renault when he got the porsche but she had declined it wasnt her kind of car for a start and there was something rather shabby in her mind about taking bankss castoffs shed buy something new soon but for now the astra still got her where she wanted to go annie set off up the hill past the youth hostel where a couple of uniforms were still making inquiries on to the wild moorland beyond she pulled over into a layby next to a stile it was the start of a walk to an old lead mine annie knew as banks had taken her there to show her where someone had once found a body in the flue that morning there was no one around and the wind raged whistling around the car plucking at the purple heather and rough sere grass kelly took a packet of embassy regals out of her handbag but annie pushed her hand down and said no not in here i dont like the smell of smoke and im not opening the windows its too cold kelly put the cigarettes away and pouted last night when we were talking in the pub annie said you reacted in a rather extreme way about what happened well someone got killed i mean it might be normal for you but not round here it was a shock thats all it seemed like a personal shock what do you mean do i have to spell it out kelly im not thick then stop playing games what was your relationship with the deceased i didnt have a relationship he came in the pub thats all he had a nice smile said have one for yourself isnt that enough enough for what enough to be upset that hes dead look im sorry if this is hard for you annie went on but were only doing this because we care too kelly shot her a glance you never even saw him when he was alive you didnt even know he existed true it was one of the things about annies job that she more often than not found herself investigating the deaths of strangers but banks had taught her that during the course of such investigations they dont remain strangers you get to know the dead become their voice in a way because they can no longer speak for themselves she couldnt explain this to kelly though hed been in the cottage a week said annie and youre telling me you only saw him when he came into the pub and said hello so you seem more upset than i think you would be if that was all kelly folded her arms i dont know what youre talking about annie turned to face her i think you do kelly they sat silently cocooned in the car kelly stiff facing the front annie turned sideways in her seat looking at her profile a few spots of acne stood out on the girls right cheek and she had a little white scar at the outer edge of one eyebrow outside the wind continued to rage through the moorland grass and to rock the car a little with unexpected gusts and buffets the sky was a vast expanse of blue with small high fastmoving white clouds casting brief shadows on the moor it must have been three maybe four minutes an awful long time in that sort of situation anyway before kelly started to shiver a little and before long she was shaking like a leaf in annies arms tears streaming down her face you mustnt tell my father she kept saying through the tears you mustnt tell my father tuesday th september on tuesday evening yvonne was in her room after teatime reading mark knopflers column in the yorkshire evening post he wrote about the music scene as well as sometimes jamming with local bands at the peel and the guildford and she thought he might have something to say about brimleigh but this weeks column was about a series of forthcoming concerts at the harrogate theatre the nice the who yes fairport convention it sounded great if her father would let her go to harrogate she heard a knock at her door and was surprised to see her father standing there even more surprised to see that he didnt appear angry with her her mother must have put in a good word for her even so she braced herself for the worst accusations the cutting of pocket money and limitation of freedom but they didnt come instead they came to a compromise she would be allowed to go to the grove on mondays but had to be home by eleven oclock and must under no circumstances drink any alcohol then she had to stop in and do her homework every other school night she could also go out friday and saturday but not all night he tried to get her to tell him where shed been on sunday but all shed said was she spent the night listening to music with friends and had lost track of the time somehow she got the impression that he didnt believe her but instead of pushing it he asked have you got anything by led zeppelin led zeppelin yes why they had only released one lp so far and yvonne had bought it with the record token her aunt moira had given her for her sixteenth birthday back in march it said in melody maker that they had a new album coming out next month and robert plant had mentioned it at brimleigh when they had played songs from it like heartbreaker yvonne could hardly wait robert plant was so sexy would you say theyre loud yvonne laughed pretty loud yes mind if i give them a listen still confused yvonne said no not at all go ahead she picked it out of her pile and handed it to him the lp with the big zeppelin touching the edge of the eiffel tower and bursting into flames the dansette record player that her father had got for five thousand embassy coupons before he stopped smoking was downstairs in the living room it was a bone of contention as yvonne maintained that she was the only one who bought records and really cared about music apart from the occasional johnny mathis and jim reeves her mother put on and her fathers few bigband lps she thought it should be in her room but her father insisted that it was the family record player at least he had bought her for her birthday an extra speaker unit that you could plug in and create a real stereo effect and she had the little transistor radio she kept on her bedside table but she still had to wait until her parents were out before she could listen to her own records properly at the right volume she went down with him and turned it on he didnt even seem to know how to operate the thing so yvonne took over soon good times bad times was blasting out loudly enough to bring janet dashing in from the kitchen to see what was going on after listening to less than half of the song chadwick turned down the volume and asked are they all like that youd probably think so yvonne said but every song is different why nothing really just something i was wondering about he rejected the lp and switched off the record player thanks you can have it back now still puzzled yvonne put the lp back in its sleeve and went up to her room banks looked out of his office window it was market day and the wooden stalls spread out over the cobbled square canvas covers flapping in the wind selling everything from cheap shirts and flat caps to used books bootleg cds and dvds the monthly farmers market extended farther across the square selling locally grown vegetables wensleydale and swaledale cheese and organic beef and pork banks thought all beef and pork not to mention wine fruit and vegetables was organic but someone had told him it really meant organically raised without pesticides or chemicals why didnt they say that then he wondered locals and tourists alike mingled and sampled the wares when they had finished there banks knew many of them would be moving on to the big carboot sale at catterick where they would agonize over buying dodgy mobile phones for a couple of quid and dubious fiftypee inkjet refills it was half past twelve banks had spent the rest of the morning after the meeting going over the soco exhibits lists and talking with stefan and vic manson about fingerprints and possible dna samples from the bedding at moorview cottage what they would prove he didnt know but he needed everything he could get and these were probably the kind of facts over which detective superintendent gervaise salivated that wasnt fair he realized especially as he had decided to give her the benefit of the doubt but that remark about going to the pub had stung he had felt like a schoolboy on the headmasters carpet again martha argerich was playing a beethoven piano concerto on radio in the background it was a live recording and in the quiet bits banks could hear people in the audience coughing he thought again about seeing catherine gervaise and her husband at opera north they had much better seats than he had closer to the front theyd have been able to see the sweat and spittle at close hand rumor had it that superintendent gervaise was after a commanders job at scotland yard but until something came up they were stuck with her in eastvale banks sat down and picked up the book again it looked wellthumbed he had never read any ian mcewan but the name was on his list one day he liked the opening well enough the book gave no clue as to where it had been bought some secondhand bookshops banks knew had little stamps on the inside cover with their name and address on but not this one he would check the local shops to see if the victim had bought it in eastvale where there were two possible suppliers and a number of charity shops that sold used books nick hadnt written his name on the inside the way some people do all it said was there was a sticker on the back and banks realized it was from borders hed seen it before there looked to be enough coded information on there to locate the branch but he very much doubted that that would lead him to the actual customer who had bought it originally and who knew how many people had owned it since then once again he turned to the neat penciled figures in the back they meant nothing to him but then he had never been any good at codes if that was what it was supposed to be or anything to do with numbers really he couldnt even tackle sudokus it might be the most obvious sequence of prime negative ordinals or whatever in the world and he wouldnt know it from a betting slip he racked his brains to think of someone who was good at stuff like that not annie or kev templeton that was for sure winsome was good with computers so maybe she had a strong mathematical brain then it came to him of course how could he have forgotten so soon he grabbed his internal telephone directory but before he could find the number he wanted the phone rang it was winsome sir yes winsome weve got him i mean we know who he is the victim thats great sorry it took so long but my contact at the dvla was at a wedding this morning thats why i couldnt get in touch with her she had her mobile turned off who is he his name is nicholas barber and he lived in chiswick winsome gave banks an address bloody hell said banks thats the second londoner killed up here this year if they get wind of that down south the tourists will all think theres a conspiracy and stop coming a lot of people might think that wouldnt be such a bad idea sir said winsome maybe then some of the locals would be able to afford to live here dont you believe it estate agents would find some other way to gouge the buyers anyway now we know who he is we can see about checking his phone records i cant believe he didnt have a mobile even if he had he couldnt have used it in fordham no coverage yes but he might have gone to eastvale or somewhere to make calls but what network check with all the majors but sir i know its saturday just do the best you can winsome if you have to wait until monday morning so be it nick barbers not going anywhere and his killers already long gone will do sir banks thought for a moment nick barber there was something familiar about that name but he couldnt for the life him remember what it was then he reached for the directory again and carried on with what he had been doing annie let kelly soames collect herself and dry her eyes trying to minimize the embarrassment the young girl obviously felt at her outburst of emotion im sorry kelly said finally im not usually like this its just the shock you knew him well kelly blushed no not at all we only i mean it was just a shag thats all still said annie thinking that shagging was pretty intimate even if there was no love involved and that by speaking of it that way kelly was trying to diminish what had happened so she wouldnt feel it so painfully if someone was naked with you one minute caressing you entering you and giving you pleasure then lying on the floor with his head bashed in the next it didnt make you a softy if you shed a tear or two care to tell me about it you mustnt tell my dad hell go spare promise kelly im after information about the about nick unless you were involved in some way with his murder youve got nothing to worry about i wont have to go to court or anything i cant imagine why kelly thought for a moment there wasnt much to it really she said finally then she looked at annie its not something i do all the time you know im not a slag nobodys saying you are my dad would if he found out what about your mother she died when i was sixteen dads never remarried she they werent very happy together im sorry said annie but theres no reason for your father to find out as long as you promise annie hadnt promised and she wasnt going to the way things stood she could see no reason why kellys secret should come out and she would do her best to protect it but the situation could change how did it happen she asked like i said he was nice in the pub you know lots of people just treat you like dirt because youre a barmaid but not nick did you know his second name no sorry i just called him nick the wind moaned and rocked the car kelly hugged herself she wasnt wearing much more than she had been the previous evening cold annie asked ill turn the heater on she started the car and turned the heat on soon the windows misted over with condensation thats better go on you got chatting in the pub no thats just it my dads always there isnt he he was there last night thats why i anyway he watches me like a hawk at work hes like the rest thinks a barmaids no better than a whore you should have heard the arguments we had about me taking the job why did he let you take it then money he was sick of me living at home and not having a job thatll do it so you didnt meet nick in the pub well we did meet there i mean thats where we first saw each other but he was just like any other customer he was a fitlooking lad ill admit i fancied him and i think maybe he could see that but he wasnt a lad kelly he was much older than you kelly stiffened he was only thirtyeight thats not old and im twentyone besides i like older men theyre not always pawing you like kids my own age they understand they listen and they know about things all the kids my age talk about is football and beer but nick knew everything about music all the bands everything the stories he told me he was sophisticated annie made a mental note of that while wondering just how long it took this nick to start pawing kelly how did you meet him then she asked in town eastvale wednesdays my day off see and i was out shopping he was just coming out of that secondhand bookshop down by the side of the church and i almost bumped into him talk about blush anyway he recognized me and we got chatting went for a drink in the queens arms he was funny what happened he gave me a lift back id come on the bus and we arranged to meet later where at the cottage he invited me for a meal i told my dad i was going out with some girlfriends and what happened what do you think he made a meal a curry he wasnt a bad cook and we listened to some music and you know you went to bed together yes only that once kelly looked away kelly we did it again on friday all right i got two hours off in the afternoon to go to the dentist but i rearranged my appointment for next wednesday what time on friday between two and four that was the afternoon of the murder only two or three hours after kelly had left in all likelihood nick had been killed and those were the only occasions you spent with him wednesday night and friday afternoon we didnt spend the night together not that i wouldnt have mind you just the evening had to be home by eleven as you might have gathered my fathers a bit of a victorian when it comes to matters of freedom and discipline yes and you were off shagging some older bloke youd just laid eyes on for the first time annie thought maybe kellys father had a point anyway it was none of her business she was surprised at herself for being so judgmental what does he do for a living hes a farmer can you imagine anything more naff plenty of things huh well i cant do you know someone called jack tanner kelly seemed surprised at the question yes she said he lives just down the road from the pub what do you think of him i can say i do very much think of him that is he always seems a bit of a miserable sod to me and hes a total lech as well what do you mean hes always looking at my tits he doesnt think i know but its well obvious he does it with all us young girls have you ever seen him in the pub no cc barred him before i started working there he cant hold his drink hes always picking fights annie made a note to look into jack tanner further and went on what do you remember about the cottage it just looked like a cottage you know old furniture and stuff a creaky bed toilet with a wonky seat what about nicks personal things you must know you were in there everythings gone kelly kelly gave her a startled look somebody stole it is that why they killed him but there was hardly anything there unless he was hiding money under the mattress and i dont think he was you could have felt a pea under that thing what did he have just a few books a portable cd player with a couple of those small speakers you can set up not great sound but okay mostly he liked old stuff but he had some more modern bands doves franz ferdinand kaiser chiefs and he had a computer laptop yes a little one toshiba i think he said he used it used it mostly for watching dvds but he did do some work on it too what kind of work he was a writer what sort of writer i dont know he never told me about it and i never asked none of my business was it maybe he was writing his autobiography that would be a bit presumptuous at thirtyeight annie thought but people had written autobiographies at earlier ages than that but he definitely said he was a writer i asked him what he was doing up here at such a miserable time of year and he said he wanted a bit of peace and quiet to do some writing i could tell he was being a bit shy and secretive about it so i didnt push i wasnt after his life story anyway did he ever show you anything hed written no i mean all we did was have a curry a chat and a shag i didnt go searching through his stuff or anything what do you think i am all right kelly dont get your knickers in a twist kelly managed a brief smile bit late for that isnt it what did you use for contraception condoms what do you think we didnt find any in the house we used them all on friday like he wanted to you know do it again but we couldnt there werent any left and it was too late to go into eastvale i had to be at work and theres no way i was going to do it without im not totally stupid okay said annie once she had got kelly talking she had proved to be far less shy and reticent than she appeared in public so that explained the rumpled bed and lack of condoms but robbery hardly seemed like a motive obviously if nick had had something of great value there he wouldnt have told some local scrubber hed picked up in a pub but why cart anything of value up here in the first place unless he was blackmailing somebody or making a payoff did he have a mobile he did a fancy nokia fat lot of good it did him though they dont work around here you have to go to eastvale or helmthorpe its a real drag that was a problem in the dales annie knew theyd put up some new towers but coverage was still patchy in places because of the hills there wasnt a landline at the cottage most rental places dont include one for obvious reasons and both mrs tanner and winsome had used the telephone box across the road by the church how did he seem when you were with him she asked he was fine he didnt seem upset depressed or worried about anything no not at all what about drugs kelly paused we smoked a couple of joints thats all id never do anything harder than that did he have a lot of gear no just enough for himself at least thats all i saw look he wasnt a drug dealer if thats what youre getting at im not getting at anything said annie i just want to establish some idea of nicks state of mind was he any different on friday afternoon no not sos i noticed he wasnt nervous or edgy as if he was expecting someone no did you make any plans for the future well he didnt ask me to marry him if thats what youre thinking annie laughed i dont suppose he did but were you going to see one another again sure he was up here for another week and i said i could get away a few times if he got some more condoms he said i could come and see him in london too if i wanted he gets lots of free tickets and he said hed take me to concerts she pouted my dad would never let me go though he thinks londons some sort of den of iniquity did nick give you his address we didnt get that far we thought you know wed see one another again up here oh shit sorry she dabbed at her face again crying had made her skin blotchy other than that she was a beautiful young woman and annie could see why any man would be attracted to her she wasnt stupid either as she had pointed out and there was a forthrightness about her attitude to sex that many might envy but now she was just an upset and confused kid and her skin was breaking out when shed pulled herself together she laughed and said you must think im well daft crying over some bloke i just met no i dont said annie you felt close to him and now hes dead that must be terrible it must hurt kelly looked at her you understand dont you youre not like the rest not like that sourpuss you had with you last night annie smiled at the description of banks not one she would have used herself oh hes all right she said hes just been going through a rough time lately too no i mean it youre all right you are whats it like being a copper it has its moments annie said do you think theyd have me if i applied like im sure it would be worth a try annie said were always looking for bright motivated people thats me kelly said with a crooked smile bright and motivated im sure my dad would approve i wouldnt be too sure about that annie said thinking of what banks had told her about the way his parents reacted to his chosen profession but dont let it stop you kelly frowned then she said look ive got to get to work im already late ccll go spare okay said annie i think im just about done for now can you give me a minute before we go said kelly pulling down the mirror and taking a small pink container from her handbag ive got to put my face on of course annie watched with amusement while kelly applied eye shadow and mascara and various powders and potions to hide the acne and blotchiness then drove down the hill to drop the girl at the cross keys before heading back up to see what was happening at the youth hostel chapter five thth september over the next few days chadwicks investigation proceeded with a frustrating lack of progress the two essential questions who was the victim and who was with her at the time of her death remained unanswered surely chadwick thought someone somewhere must be missing her unless she was a runaway things had been quiet on the home front since he and yvonne had come to their compromise he was convinced now that she had been at the brimleigh festival on sunday night she really wasnt a very good liar but there seemed little point in pursuing the issue now it was over the important thing was to try to head off anything along the same lines in the future and janet was right he wouldnt achieve that by ranting at her on wednesday though chadwick had paid a quick visit to the grove just to see the kind of place where his daughter was spending her time it was a small scruffy oldfashioned pub by the canal with one dingy room set aside for the young crowd he checked with his friend geoff broome on the drugs squad and found it didnt have a particularly bad reputation which was good news god only knew what yvonne saw in the dump dr oneill whose full postmortem report had yielded nothing to dispute the cause of death had estimated the victims age at between seventeen and twentyone so it was conceivable that she had left home and was living by herself at the time of her murder in which case what about her friends boyfriends colleagues at work either they didnt know what had happened or they hadnt missed her yet did she even have a job hippies didnt like work chadwick knew that perhaps she was a student or on holiday one interesting point that dr oneill had included in his report was that there was a parturition scar on the pelvic bone which meant that she had given birth to a baby dc bradley had viewed all the television footage of the festival and spoken with newspaper reporters who had attended the event he had learned precisely nothing the victim was nowhere to be seen on the film which more often than not panned over a sea of young idealistic faces and cut back and forth from the gymnastic displays of the bands onstage to closeshot interviews with individual musicians and revelers perhaps it might all be of some use in the future when they had a suspect or needed to pick someone out of the crowd but for the moment it was useless bradley had also contacted the festivals press officer mick lawton and made a start phoning the photographers most were cooperative had no objection to the police looking at their photographs and would be happy to send prints after all they had been taken for public consumption in the first place what a difference it was from asking reporters to name sources the experts were still combing the area where the victim had been killed and the spot she had been moved to collecting all the trace evidence for later analysis if nothing else it might provide useful forensic evidence in a trial the lab had already reported back on the painted cornflower on the victims cheek informing chadwick that it was simple greasepaint available in any number of outlets the flower was still one small detail the police had not yet made public when it came to questioning the stars themselves enderbys original doubts proved to be remarkably prophetic it got done mostly but in a perfunctory and unsatisfactory way as far as chadwick was concerned usually by the local forces who had only minimal briefing in the case there was more than one provincial di just dying to have a crack at his local rock star bring in the dogs and the drugs search team despite the fiasco of the rolling stones bust a couple of years ago but asking a few questions about a poxy festival up north hardly excited anyones interest these longhaired idiots might be stoned and anarchic the thinking mostly went but theyre hardly likely to be bloody murderers are they chadwick preferred to keep an open mind on the subject he thought of the murders in los angeles a story he had been following in the newspapers and on television just like everyone else according to the reports someone had broken into a house in benedict canyon cut the telephone wires and murdered five people including the actress sharon tate who had been eight and a half months pregnant at the time she was stabbed to death later that night another house had been broken into and a wealthy couple had been killed in a similar way there was much speculation about drug orgies as the male victims had been wearing hippietype clothing and drugs were found in one of their cars there was also talk about a ritualistic aspect to the murders the word pig had been written in blood on the front door of sharon tates house and death to pigs had been written on the living room wall of the other house also in blood and healther skelter inside the fridge door which the authorities took to be a misspelling of helter skelter a beatles song from the white album what little inside knowledge chadwick had been able to pick up on the grapevine indicated that the police were looking for members of some obscure hippie cult it had not occurred to chadwick that the crimes had anything in common with the brimleigh festival murder los angeles was a long way from yorkshire still if people who listened to beatles songs and called the police pigs could do something like that in los angeles then why not in england chadwick would have interviewed the musicians himself but they lived as far afield as london buckinghamshire sussex ireland and glasgow some of them in small flats and bedsits but a surprising number of them owned country estates with swimming pools or large detached houses in nice areas he would have spent half his life on the motorway and the rest on country roads he had hoped that one of the interviewers might at least have sniffed out a halftruth or a fullblown lie then he would have conducted a followup interview himself however far he had to travel but everything came back routine no further action a lot of the bands whose names he had seen in connection with brimleigh were playing at another festival in rugby that weekend pink floyd the nice roy harper the edgar broughton band and the third ear band he sent enderby down to rugby to see if he could come up with anything enderby seemed in his element at the prospect of meeting such heroes two of the bands at brimleigh had been local chadwick had already spoken briefly with jan dukes de grey in leeds during the week derek and mick seemed pleasant enough young lads beneath the long hair and unusual clothes and both of them had left the festival well before the time of the murder the mad hatters were in london at the moment but were expected back up north early in the following week to stay at swainsview lodge lord jessops residence near eastvale where they were to rehearse for a forthcoming tour and album he would talk to them then it was half past two in the afternoon by the time dc gavin rickerd managed to make it over to western area headquarters in eastvale banks was due to sit in on the nicholas barber postmortem at three but he wanted to get this out of the way first he had rung annie at fordham and they had given each other a quick update agreeing to meet in the queens arms at six oclock come in gavin said banks how are things going in neighborhood policing teething troubles busy you know how things are with a new job sir but its fine really i like it rickerd adjusted his glasses he was still wearing oldfashioned national health specs held together at the bridge with sticking plaster it had to be a fashion statement of some sort banks thought as even a poor dc could certainly afford new ones the words fashion statement and gavin rickerd hardly seemed a match made in heaven so maybe it was an antifashion statement he wore a bottlegreen corduroy jacket with leather elbow patches and brown corduroy trousers a bit worse for wear his tie was awkwardly fastened and his shirt collar bent up on the left side from the top pocket of his jacket poked an array of pens and pencils his face had the pasty look of someone who didnt get outside very much banks remembered the way kev templeton used to take the piss out of him mercilessly he had a cruel streak did templeton miss the thrust and parry of policing on the edge banks asked not really sir im quite happy where i am ah right banks had never really known how to talk to richard rumor had it that he was a bona fide trainspotter that he actually stood out at the end of cold station platforms in darlington leeds or york come rain or shine scanning the horizon for the royal scotsman the mallard or whatever they called it these days nobody had actually seen him but the rumor persisted he also had a bachelors degree in mathematics and was reputed to be a whiz at puzzles and computer games banks thought he was probably wasted in eastvale and should have been recruited by mi years ago but at the moment their loss was his gain one thing banks did know for certain was that gavin rickerd was a fanatical cricket fan so he chatted briefly about englands recent ashes victory then he said got a little job for you gavin but sir you know im neighborhood policing now not cid or major crimes yes said banks but whats in a name its not just the name sir its a serious job im sure it is thats not in dispute the superintendent wont like it sir rickerd was starting to look decidedly nervous glancing over his shoulder at the door been warned off have you rickerd adjusted his glasses again okay banks said i understand i wouldnt want to get you into trouble you can go its just that ive got this puzzle i thought you might be interested in at least i think it could be a puzzle whatever it is though we need to know puzzle said rickerd licking his lips what sort of puzzle well i was thinking maybe you could have a look at it in your spare time you know that way the super cant complain can she i dont know sir like a little peek well maybe i could just have a quick look good lad banks handed him a photocopy of the page from nick barbers copy of atonement he had got from the socos rickerd squinted at it turned it this way and that and put it down on the desk interesting he said i was thinking that you like mathematical puzzles and things know a bit about them maybe you could take it away with you and play around with it i can take it away of course its only a photocopy all right then said rickerd evidently charged with a new sense of importance he folded the piece of paper carefully into a square and slipped it into the inside pocket of his corduroy jacket youll get back to me said banks soon as ive got something i cant promise mind you it might just be some random gibberish i understand said banks do your best rickerd left the office pausing to glance both ways down the corridor before he dashed off toward the neighborhood policing offices banks glanced at his watch and pulled a face time to go to the postmortem saturday th september chadwick was hoping to get away early as he and geoff broome had tickets for leeds uniteds away game with sheffield wednesday at about ten oclock though a woman who said she lived on the raynville estate rang to say she thought she recognized the victim she didnt want to commit herself saying the sketch in the paper wasnt a very good likeness but she thought she knew who it was out of respect for the victim the newspapers hadnt published a photograph of the dead girl only an artists impression but chadwick had a photo in his briefcase this wasnt the kind of interview he could delegate to an underling like the inexperienced simon bradley let alone the scruffy keith enderby so before he left he rang geoff broome with his apologies there would be no problem getting rid of the ticket somewhere in brotherton house geoff told him after that chadwick went down to his aging vauxhall victor and drove out to armley rain streaking his windscreen the raynville estate was not among the best of the newer leeds council estates and it looked even worse in the rain built only a few years ago it had quickly gone to seed and those who could afford to avoided it chadwick and janet had lived nearby on the astons until they had managed to save up and buy their semi just off church road in the shadow of st bartholomews armley when chadwick was promoted to detective inspector four years ago the caller who had given her name as carol wilkinson lived in a secondstory maisonette on raynville walk the stairs smelled of urine and the walls were covered with filthy graffiti a phenomenon that was starting to spring up in places like this it was just another sign of the degeneracy of modern youth as far as chadwick was concerned no respect for property when he knocked on the faded green door a young woman holding a baby in one arm opened it for him the chain still on are you the policeman detective inspector chadwick he showed his warrant card she glanced at it then looked chadwick up and down before unfastening the chain come in youll have to excuse the mess and he did she deposited the baby in a wooden playpen in a living room untidy with toys discarded clothing and magazines it he couldnt tell whether it was a girl or a boy stood and gawped at him for a moment then started rattling the bars and crying the cream carpet was stained with only god knew what and the room smelled of unwashed nappies and warm milk a television set stood in one corner and a radio was playing somewhere kenny everett chadwick only knew who it was because yvonne liked to listen to him and he recognized the inane patter and the clumsy attempts at humor when it came to radio chadwick preferred quiz programs and news he took the chair the woman offered giving it a quick onceover to make sure it was clean and plucking at the crease in his trousers before he sat the maisonette had a small balcony but there were no chairs outside chadwick imagined the woman had to be careful because of her baby more than once a young child had crawled onto a balcony and fallen off despite the guardrail trying to distance himself from the noise the smell and the mess chadwick focused on the woman as she sat down opposite him and lit a cigarette she was pale and careworn wearing a baggy fawn cardigan and shapeless checked slacks dirty blond hair hung down to her shoulders she might have been fifteen or thirty you said on the phone that you think you know the woman whose picture was in the paper i think so she said i just wasnt sure thats why i took so long to ring you i had to think about it are you sure now well no not really i mean her hair was different and everything its just what something about her thats all chadwick opened his briefcase and took out the photograph of the dead girl head and shoulders he warned carol what to expect and she seemed to brace herself drawing an exceptionally deep lungful of smoke when she looked at the photo she put her hand to her chest slowly she let the smoke out ive never seen a dead person before she said do you recognize her she passed the photo back and nodded funnily enough this looks more like her than the drawing even though she is dead do you know who she is yes i think its linda linda lofthouse how did you know her we went to school together she jerked her head in a generally northern direction sandford girls she was in the same class as me at least the victim was local then which made the investigation a lot easier still it made perfect sense while many young people would have made the pilgrimage from all parts of the country to the brimleigh festival chadwick guessed that the majority of those attending would have been from a bit closer to home leeds bradford york harrogate and the surrounding areas as the event was practically on their doorstep when was this i left school two years ago last july when i was sixteen linda left the same year we were almost the same age eighteen and one kid already chadwick wondered if she had a husband she wasnt wearing a wedding ring which didnt mean much in itself but there didnt seem to be any evidence of male presence as far as he could see anyway the age was about right for the victim were you friends carol paused i thought so she said but after wed left school we didnt see much of one another why not linda got pregnant after christmas in her final year just before she turned sixteen she looked at her own child and gave a harsh laugh at least i waited until id left school and got married the father hes at work toms not a bad bloke really so she was married in a way chadwick felt relieved i meant the father of lindas child oh him she was going out with donald hughes at the time i just assumed you know like did they marry live together not that i know of linda well she was getting a bit weird that last year at school if you must know in what way the way she dressed like she didnt care anymore and she was more in her own world wherever that was she kept getting into trouble for not paying attention in class but it wasnt as if she was stupid or anything she even did okay in her o levels despite being pregnant she was just in her own world yes the teachers didnt know what to do with her if they said anything shed give them a right clever answer she had some nerve and that last year she sort of stopped hanging around with us you know there were a few of us me linda julie and anita used to go down the locarno on a saturday night have a good dance and see if there were any decent lads around she blushed sometimes wed go to le phonograph later if we could get in most of us could pass for eighteen but sometimes they got a bit picky on the door you know what its like so linda became a bit of a loner yes and this was before she got pregnant quiet liked to read not schoolbooks poetry and stuff and she loved bob dylan didnt the rest of you hes all right i suppose but you cant dance to him can you and i cant understand a word hes singing about if you can call it singing chadwick didnt know whether he had ever heard bob dylan though he did know the name so he was thankful the question was rhetorical dancing had never been a skill he possessed in any great measure though he had met janet at a dance and that had seemed to go well enough did she have any enemies anyone who really disliked her no nothing like that you couldnt hate linda youd know what i mean if youd met her did she ever get into any fights or serious disagreements with anyone no never do you know if she was taking drugs she never said so and i never saw her do anything like that not that id have known i suppose where did she live on the sandford estate with her mum and dad though i heard her dad died a short while ago in the spring sudden like heart attack can you give me her mothers address carol told him do you know if she had the child about two years ago that would be september around that time yes but i never saw her after school broke up that july i got married and tom and me set up house here and all then little andy came along have you ever bumped into her since then no i heard that shed moved away down south after the baby was born london maybe she had chadwick thought that would explain why she hadnt been immediately missed as carol had said the likeness in the newspaper wasnt a particularly good one and a lot of people dont pay attention to the papers anyway have you any idea what happened to the baby or the father ive seen don around hes been going out with pamela davis for about a year now i think they might be engaged he works in a garage on kirkstall road near the viaduct i remember linda talking about having the baby adopted i dont think she planned on keeping it the mother would probably know not that it mattered whoever had killed linda lofthouse it wasnt a twoyearold is there anything else you can tell me about linda he asked not really said carol i mean i dont know what you want to hear we were best friends but we sort of drifted apart as you do i dont know what she got up to the last two years im sorry to hear that she was killed though thats terrible why would somebody do a thing like that thats what were trying to find out said chadwick trying to sound as reassuring as he could he didnt think it came over very well he stood up thanks for your time and for the information youll let me know when you find out ill let you know said chadwick standing up please stay here with the baby ill let myself out whats up with you then asked cyril the landlord of the queens arms as banks ordered a bitter lemon and ice late that afternoon doctors orders more like bosss orders banks grumbled weve got a new super shes dead keen and seems to have eyes in the back of her bloody head shell get nowt out of me said cyril my lips are sealed banks laughed cheers mate maybe another time bad for business this new boss of yours give us time said banks with a wink well get her trained he took his glass over to a dimpled coppertopped table over by the window and contemplated its unappetizing contents gloomily the ashtray was half full of crushed filters and ash banks pushed it as far away as he could now that he no longer smoked hed come to loathe the smell of cigarettes hed never noticed it before as a smoker but when he got home from the pub his clothes stank and he had to put them straight in the laundry basket which would be fine if he got around to doing his laundry more often annie turned up at six oclock as arranged shed been at fordham earlier banks knew and had talked to kelly soames she got herself a britvic orange and joined him christ she said when she saw bankss drink theyll be thinking were all on the wagon too true good day not bad i suppose you banks swirled the liquid in his glass ice clinked against the sides ive had better he said just come from the postmortem ah no picnic never is even after all these years you never get quite used to it i know said annie anyway banks went on we werent far wrong in our original suspicions nick barber was in generally good health apart from being bashed on the back of the head with a poker it fits the wound and dr glendenning says he was hit four times once when he was standing up which accounts for most of the blood spatter and three times when he was on the floor annie raised an eyebrow overkill not necessarily the doc said it neednt have been a frenzied attack just that whoever did it wanted to make sure his victim was dead in all likelihood hed have got a bit of blood on him too and bloods hard to get rid of it might give us something we can use in court if we ever catch the bastard anyway there were no prints on the poker so our killer obviously wiped it clean what do you make of it all i dont know said banks sipping bitter lemon and pulling a face it certainly doesnt look professional and it wasnt frenzied enough to look like a lovers quarrel not that we can rule that out i doubt if the motive was robbery either annie told banks more detail than she had given him over the phone about her conversation with kelly soames and what little she had discovered about barber from her and the timing is interesting banks added what do you mean was he killed before or after the power cut all the doc can tell us is that it probably happened between six and eight one bloke left the pub at seven and came back around quarter past the others bear this out but nobody saw him in lyndgarth banks consulted his notes name of calvin soames soames said annie thats the barmaids name kelly soames he must be her father i recognized him when he dropped her off thats right said banks she said hes always in the pub when shes working i know she was terrified of him finding out about her and nick ill have a talk with him tomorrow go carefully alan he didnt know about her and nick barber apparently hes a very strict father thats not such a terrible thing is it anyway ill do my best but if he really did know i understand said annie and dont forget jack tanner said banks we dont know what motive he might have had but he had a connection with the victim through his wife wed better check his alibi thoroughly its being done said annie ought to be easy enough to check with his darts cronies and ive got kev following up on all the blokes who left the pub between the relevant times good now the tourist couple the browns say they arrived at about a quarter to eight and thought they saw a car heading up the hill right annie consulted the notes she had taken in the incident van someone from the youth hostel a new zealander called vanessa napier told pc travers that she saw a car going by at about half past seven or a quarter to eight on friday evening shortly after the lights went off she was looking out of her window at the storm did she get any details no it was dark and she doesnt know a honda from a fiat doesnt help us much does it its all weve got they questioned everyone in the hostel and vanessas the only one who saw anything shes not another one been shagging our nick too has she annie laughed i shouldnt think so hmm banks said there seem to have been more comings and goings between half past seven and eight than there were earlier yorkshire electricity confirms the power went out at seven twentyeight pm the problem is banks went on that if the killer came from some distance away and timed his arrival for half seven or a quarter to eight he cant have known there would be a power cut so its not a factor maybe it gave him an opportunity annie said theyre arguing the lights go out nick turns to reach for his cigarette lighter and the killer seizes the moment and lashes out possibly said banks though the darkness would have made it a bit harder for him to search the cottage and be certain he took away everything he needed to also your eyes need time to adjust look at the timing mrs tanner showed up at eight that didnt give him much time to search in the dark and check barbers car he might have had a torch in his own vehicle hed still have had to go and get it there wouldve been no reason for him to be carrying one if he arrived before the power cut does the electricity failure really matter then i think we can assume that the killer would have done what he came to do anyway and if the lights went out that just gave him a better opportunity what about the browns their timing is interesting yes said banks but do they strike you as the types to kill someone and then drop by the local pub for a pint it was dark there was no electricity maybe the local was as good a place to hide as any what about blood winsome checked after the lights came back on annie said she didnt see any signs but theyd hardly have hung around till the lights came back on if they were hiding bloodstains we could hardly stripsearch everyone true said banks look weve still got a long way to go you mentioned that nick barber was a writer thats what kelly said he told her whod want to kill a writer there were plenty i wanted to kill when i was at school doing english said annie but they were all dead already banks laughed but seriously well it depends what kind of writer he was doesnt it annie argued i mean if he was an investigative journalist onto something big then someone might have had a reason to get rid of him but what was he doing up here there are plenty of cupboards full of skeletons in north yorkshire countered annie yes but where to begin thats the problem google suggested annie thats a start and shouldnt we be going to london monday morning said banks then well be able to talk to his employer if we can find out who it is you know how useless sundays are for finding anything out ive asked the locals to keep an eye on the place until then to make sure no one tries to get in what about next of kin winsome sorted that too they live just outside sheffield theyve already been informed i thought you and winsome could go and talk to them tomorrow fine said annie i was only going to wash my hair anyway oh theres one more thing about that book yes it looks as if he might have bought it just over the road here kelly said she met him coming out of the secondhand bookshop banks consulted his watch damn itll be closed now is it important could be it didnt look as if the figures were written in the same hand as the price but you never know we can ring the owner at home i suppose good idea said banks from the way youre still sitting there i assume youre expecting me to do it if you would look im sick of this bloody bitter lemon as far as im concerned were off duty working on our own time and if lady gervaise wants to make something of it then good luck to her im having a pint you annie smiled spoken like a true rebel ill have the same and while youre getting them in she took her mobile phone from her briefcase and waved it in the air banks had to wait until a party of six tourists who couldnt make up their minds what they wanted to drink had been served and when he got back with two foaming pints of black sheep annie had finished well he certainly didnt do it she said fair bristled at the idea of anyone writing anything but the price in books even the blank pages at the back sacrilege he said anyway he remembers the book it only came in the day before nick barber bought it last wednesday and he checks them all thoroughly there was nothing written in the back then interesting said banks very interesting indeed well just have to wait and see what young gavin makes of it wont we saturday th september yvonne sat upstairs at the front of a number bus heading for the city center chewing on her fingernails and wondering what to do some clever sod had taken a marker to the no spitting sign and altered it to read no shitting yvonne lit a cigarette and pondered her dilemma if she was right it could be serious it had happened the previous evening when her father came home late from work as usual hed been taking something out of his briefcase when a photograph had slipped to the floor hed put it back quickly and obviously thought she hadnt seen it but she had it was a picture of the dead girl the one who had been stabbed on sunday at the brimleigh festival and with a shock yvonne had realized she recognized her linda she didnt know linda well had only met her once and hadnt really talked with her much but the local hippie community was small enough that if you hung around the right places for long enough youd come across pretty much everyone in the scene eventually whether at the grove the adelphi the peel or one of the student pubs on woodhouse lane in hyde park or headingley even as far away as the farmers inn where they had blues bands like savoy brown chicken shack free and jethro tull on a sunday night you could also be damn sure that theyd all beg borrow or steal to get to an event with a lineup like the brimleigh festival so when you thought about it linda being there wasnt quite so much a coincidence as it appeared on the surface the thing was you didnt expect to get killed there it was supposed to be a peaceful event a gathering of the tribes and a celebration of unity the bus lumbered down tong road past the lyric which was advertising a double bill of last years carry on up the khyber and carry on camping what crap yvonne thought it was a gray day and light rain pattered against the windows rows of grim backtoback terraces sloped up the hill toward hall lane all dark slate roofs and dirty red brick a couple of kids got on at the junction with wellington road behind the crown by the flats and took the other front seat theyd filmed part of billy liar there a few years ago yvonne remembered while it was a wasteland of demolished houses before the flats were built yvonne had been about eight and her father had brought her down to watch she had ended up in one of the crowd scenes waving a little flag as tom courtenay drove through in his tank but when she had watched the film she couldnt see herself anywhere the kids lit cigarettes kept looking over at her and making cheeky remarks yvonne ignored them she had met linda at bayswater terrace one evening during the summer holidays she had got the impression that it was just a flying visit that linda used to live there for a while but had moved to london linda was really fantastic she remembered she actually knew some of the bands and hung around with lots of rock stars at clubs and other in places she wasnt a groupie she made that clear she just liked the music and the guys who played it yvonne remembered someone saying that one of the members of the mad hatters was lindas cousin but she couldnt remember which one linda even played a bit of guitar herself she had sat down that evening with an acoustic and played as tears go by and both sides now not a bad voice either yvonne had thought a little in awe of her and that sort of luminous haze her long blond hair and the long white dress she wore created around her pale features the guys were all in love with her you could tell but she wasnt interested in any of them linda didnt belong to anyone she was her own person she also had a great throaty laugh which surprised yvonne coming from one who looked so demure like marianne faithfull mcgarrity had been there that night yvonne remembered and even he had seemed subdued keeping his knife in his pocket for once and refraining from muttering t s eliot all evening the guy they said was organizing the brimleigh festival rick hayes had also been present which was how they managed to score some free tickets he knew linda from down in london and seemed to know dennis too whose house it was yvonne hadnt liked hayes he had tried to get her to go upstairs with him and got a bit stroppy when she wouldnt that was the only time yvonne and linda had met and they hadnt talked much but linda had made an impression yvonne was waiting for her olevel results and linda had said something about exams not proving anything and the real truth of what you were was inside you that made sense to yvonne now linda was dead stabbed yvonne felt tears prick her eyes she could hardly believe it one of her own she hadnt seen her during the festival but that wasnt surprising the bus carried on past the gasworks over the canal and river and past the huge building site where they were putting up the new yorkshire post building at the corner of wellington street then past the dark high victorian buildings to city square where yvonne got off there were a couple of new boutiques she wanted to visit and that little record shop down the ginnel off albion street might still have a copy of the blind faith lp her parents hadnt let her go to the free concert in londons hyde park last june but at least she could enjoy the music on record later she was going over to carberry place to meet up with steve and have a few tokes a bunch of them were going to the peel that night to see jan dukes de grey derek and mick were quite the local celebrities and they were like real people theyd talk to you and sign their first lp cover sorcerers not hide away backstage like rock stars yvonnes problem persisted though whether or not to tell her father about linda if she did the police would be at bayswater terrace like a shot maybe dennis and martin and julie and the others would get busted and it would be her fault if they found out theyd never speak to her again she was sure that none of them could have had anything to do with what happened to linda so why bring grief on them rick hayes was a creep and mcgarrity was weird but neither of them would kill one of their own how could knowing about linda being at bayswater terrace in july possibly help the police investigation her father would find out who linda was eventually he was good at finding things out but it wouldnt be from her and nobody would be able to blame her for what happened that was what she decided in the end turning the corner into the wet cobbled ginnel she would keep it to herself there was no way she was going to the pigs even if the chief pig was her father chapter six there were some advantages to being a dci banks thought on sunday morning as he lingered over a second cup of coffee in the conservatory and read his way through the sunday papers outside the wind had dropped over the past couple of hours the sun was shining and the weather had turned a little milder though there was an unmistakable edge of autumn in the air the smell of the musty leaves and a whiff of acrid smoke from a distant peat fire he was still senior investigating officer of course and in a short while he would go to interview calvin soames at some point he would also drop by at the station and the incident van to make his presence felt and get uptodate with developments if there were any in an investigation like this he could never be far away from the action for any length of time but the team had enough to occupy itself for the moment and the socos had plenty of trace evidence to sift through he was always only a phone call away so barring a major breakthrough there was no reason for him to appear at the office at the crack of dawn every day he would only get lumbered with paperwork first thing tomorrow morning he and annie would be on the train to london and perhaps there they would find out more about nick barber all annie had been able to find out on google was that he had written for mojo magazine and had penned a couple of quickie rock star biographies it was interesting and banks thought he recognized the name now he saw it in context but it still wasnt much to go on just as banks thought it was time to tidy up and set off for soamess farm he heard a knock at the door it couldnt be annie he thought because she had gone to see nick barbers parents near sheffield puzzled he ambled through to the front room and answered it he was stunned to see his son brian standing there oh great dad youre in so it would appear said banks you didnt ring batterys dead and the car chargers fucked sorry it is okay isnt it of course banks said smiling putting his hand on brians shoulder and stepping back come on in its always good to see you banks heard rather than saw a movement behind brian then a young woman came into view this is emilia said brian emilia my dad hi mr banks said emilia holding out a soft hand with long tapered fingers and a bangled wrist its really nice to meet you can we bring the stuff in from the car brian asked still puzzled by it all banks just said okay and stood there while brian and emilia pulled a couple of holdalls from the boot of a red honda that looked as if it had seen better days then walked back to the cottage were going to stay for a few days if thats okay with you brian said as banks gestured them into the cottage only ive got some time off before rehearsals for the next tour and emilias never been to the dales before i thought id show her around well do a bit of walking you know country stuff brian and emilia put their bags down then brian took his mobile phone from his pocket and searched for the lead in the side pouch of his holdall okay if i charge up the phone he asked of course said banks pointing to the nearest plug socket can i get you something he looked at his watch i have to go out soon but we could have some coffee first great coffees fine said brian emilia nodded in agreement she looked terribly familiar banks thought come through to the conservatory then said banks conservatory lahdidah said brian enough of your lip banks joked theres something very relaxing about conservatories theyre like a sort of escape from the real world but brian was already poking his nose into the entertainment room jesus christ he said look at this stuff is this what you told me you got from uncle roy yes said banks your grandparents didnt want it so fantastic said brian i mean its sad about uncle roy and all but look at that plasma screen all those movies that porsche out there is yours too isnt it it was roys yes said banks feeling a bit guilty about it all now he left brian and emilia nosing around the growing cd collection and headed for the kitchen where he put the coffeemaker on then he picked up the scattered newspapers in the conservatory and set them aside on a spare chair brian and emilia came through via the doors from the entertainment room i wouldnt have had you down for a streets fan dad he said just shows how little you know me said banks yeah but hiphop research said banks have to get to know the criminal mind dont i besides its not really hiphop is it and the kid tells a great story sit down both of you ill fetch the coffee milk sugar they both said yes banks brought the coffee and sat on his usual white wicker chair opposite brian and emilia he knew it was unlikely brian was in his twenties after all but his son seemed to have grown another couple of inches since he had last seen him he was about six foot two and skinny wearing a green tshirt with the bands logo the blue lamps and cream cargos he had also had his hair cut really short and gelled banks thought it made him look older which in turn made banks feel older emilia looked like a model only a couple of inches shorter than brian slender as a reed wearing tight blue lowrise jeans and a skimpy bellytop with the requisite wide gap between the two and a green jewel gracing her navel she moved with languorous grace and economy her streaky brownblond hair hung over her shoulders and halfway down her back framing and almost obscuring an oval face with an exquisite complexion full lips small nose and high cheekbones her violet eyes were unnaturally bright but banks suspected contact lenses rather than drugs hed seen her somewhere before he knew it it really is good to see you again he said to brian and nice to meet you emilia im sorry you caught me unawares dont tell me theres no food in the house brian said or worse no booze theres wine and a few cans of beer but thats about it oh theres also some leftover vegetarian lasagna youve gone veggie no annie was over the other evening aha said brian you two an item again banks felt himself redden dont be cheeky and no were not cant a couple of colleagues have a quiet dinner together brian held his hands up grinning okay okay why dont we eat out later pub lunch if i can make it if not dinner on me okay said brian that all right with you emmy of course said emilia i can hardly wait to try some of this famous yorkshire pudding youve never had yorkshire pudding before said banks emilia blushed ive led a sheltered life well i think that can be arranged said banks he glanced at his watch right now id better be off ill phone cool said brian can you tell us which room we can have and well take our stuff up while youre out saturday th september the sandford estate was older than the raynville and it hadnt improved with age mrs lofthouse lived right at the heart of things in a semidetached house with a postagestamp garden and a privet hedge across the street a rusty hillman minx without tires was parked on a neighbors overgrown lawn and three windows were boarded up in the house next door it was that kind of estate mrs lofthouse though had done as much as she could to brighten the place up with a vase of chrysanthemums on the windowsill and a colorful painting of a cornish fishing village over the mantelpiece she was a small slight woman in her early forties her dyedbrown hair recently permed chadwick could still read the grief in the lines around her eyes and mouth she had just lost her husband and now he was here to burden her with the death of her daughter its a nice house you have said chadwick sitting on the flowerpatterned armchair with lace antimacassars thank you said mrs lofthouse its a rough estate but i do my best and there are some good people here anyway now jims gone i dont need all this room ive put my name down for a bungalow out sherbourne inelmet way that should be a bit quieter its about linda isnt it you know mrs lofthouse bit her lip i saw the sketch in the paper ever since then i just ive been denying it convincing myself its not her its a mistake but it is her isnt it her accent was noticeably yorkshire but not as broad as carol wilkinsons we think so chadwick slipped the photograph from his briefcase im afraid this wont be very pleasant he said but it is important he showed her the photograph is this linda after a sharp intake of breath mrs lofthouse said yes youll have to make a formal identification down at the mortuary i will im afraid so well make it as easy for you as we can though please dont worry when can i you know the funeral soon said chadwick as soon as the coroner releases the body for burial ill let you know im very sorry mrs lofthouse but i do have to ask you some questions the sooner the better of course ill be all right and its margaret please look shall i make some tea would that be okay i could do with a cuppa right now said chadwick with a smile wont be a moment margaret lofthouse disappeared into the kitchen no doubt to give private expression to her grief as she boiled the kettle and filled the teapot in the timehonored comforting ritual a clock ticked on the mantel beside a framed photograph twentyfive to one broome and his pal would be well on their way to sheffield by now if they werent there already chadwick got up to examine the photograph it showed a younger margaret lofthouse and the man beside her with his arm around her waist was no doubt her husband also in the picture which looked as if it had been taken outside in the country was a young girl with short blond hair staring into the camera margaret lofthouse came back with a tray and caught him looking that was taken at garstang farm near hawes in wensleydale she said we used to go for summer holidays up there a few years ago when linda was little my uncle owned the place hes dead now and strangers have bought it but i have some wonderful memories linda was such a beautiful child chadwick watched the tears well up in her eyes she dabbed at them with a tissue sorry she said i just get all choked up when i remember how things were when we were a happy family i understand said chadwick what happened margaret lofthouse didnt seem surprised at the question what always seems to happen these days she said with a sniffle she grew up into a teenager they expect the world at the age of sixteen these days dont they well what she got was a baby what did she do with the child put him up for adoption its a boy what else could she do she couldnt look after him and jim and i were too old to start caring for another child im sure hes gone to a good home im sure agreed chadwick but its not the baby im here to talk about its linda yes of course milk and sugar please she poured tea from a royal doulton teapot into fragilelooking cups with goldpainted rims and handles this was my grandmothers tea set she said its the only real thing of value i own theres nobody left to pass it on to now linda was an only child when did she leave home shortly after the baby was born the winter of where did she go london at least thats what she told me where in london i dont know she never said you didnt have her address no did she know people down there she must have done mustnt she but i never met or heard of any of them did she never come back and visit you yes several times we were quite friendly but in a distant sort of way she never talked about her life down there just assured me she was all right and not to worry and i must say she always looked all right i mean she was clean and sober and nicely dressed if you can call them sort of clothes nice and she looked well fed hippiestyle clothing yes long flowing dresses bellbottomed jeans with flowers embroidered on them that sort of thing but as i said they was always clean and they always looked good quality do you know how she earned a living i have no idea what did you talk about she told me about london the parks the buildings the art galleries ive never been there you see she was interested in art and music and poetry she said all she wanted was peace in the world and for people to just be happy she reached for the tissues again so you got along okay fine i suppose on the surface she knew i disapproved of her life even though i didnt know much about it she talked about buddhism and hindus and sufis and goodness knows what but she never once mentioned our true lord jesus christ and i brought her up to be a good christian she gave a little shake of her head i dont know maybe i could have tried harder to understand she just seemed so far away from me and anything ive ever believed in what did you talk to her about just local gossip what her old school friends were up to that sort of thing she never stopped long did you know any of her friends i knew all the kids she played with around the estate and her friends from school but i dont know who she spent her time with after she left home she never mentioned any names well she might have done but i dont remember any did she ever tell you if anything or anyone was bothering her no she always seemed happy as if she hadnt really a care in the world you dont know of any enemies she might have had no i cant imagine her having any when did you last see her in the summer july it would be not long after jim was she at the funeral oh yes she came home for that in may she loved her father she was a great support i dont want to give you the impression that wed fallen out or anything mr chadwick i still loved linda and i know that she still loved me it was just that we couldnt really talk anymore not about anything important shed got secretive in the end i gave up trying but this was a couple of months after jims death just a flying visit to see how i was getting along what did she talk about on that visit we watched that man walk on the moon neil armstrong linda was all excited about it said it marked the beginning of a new age but i dont know we stayed up watching till after three in the morning anything else im sorry nothing else really stood out except the moon landing some pop star she liked had died and shed been to see the rolling stones play a free concert for him in hyde park london that is and i remember her talking about the war vietnam about how immoral it was she always talked about the war i tried to tell her that sometimes wars just have to be fought but shed have none of it to her all war was evil you should have heard it when linda and her dad went at it he was in the navy in the last war just toward the end like but you say linda loved her father oh yes dont get me wrong i didnt say they saw eye to eye about everything i mean he tried to discipline her got on at her for staying out till all hours but she was a handful they fought like cat and dog sometimes but they still loved one another it all sounded so familiar to chadwick that the thought depressed him surely all children werent like this didnt cause their parents such grief was he taking the wrong approach with yvonne was there another way he felt like such a failure as a parent but short of locking her in her room what could he do when yvonne went on about the evils of war he always felt himself tense up inside he could never even enter into a rational argument about it for fear he would lose his temper lash out and say something he would regret what did she know about war evil yes necessary well how else were you going to stop someone like hitler he didnt know much about vietnam but he assumed the americans were there for a good reason and the sight of all these unruly longhaired youngsters burning the flag and chanting antiwar slogans made his blood boil what about the boyfriend donald hughes what about him is he the father i assume so i mean thats what linda said and i think i know her well enough to know she wasnt you know some sort of trollop what did you think of him hes all right i suppose not much gumption mind you the hugheses arent exactly one of the best families on the estate but theyre not one of the worst either and you cant blame poor eileen hughes shes had six kids to bring up mostly on her own she tries hard do you know if donald kept in touch after linda left i doubt it he made himself scarce after he found out our linda was pregnant then just after the baby was born he became all concerned for a while said they should get married and keep it that it wouldnt be right to give his child up for adoption thats how he put it his child what did linda say she gave him his marching orders then not long after that she was gone herself do you know if he ever bothered her at all i dont think so she never said never even mentioned him or the baby again did he ever come here after that asking about her just once about three weeks after shed left wanted to know her address what did you tell him that i didnt know of course he didnt believe me and he made a bit of a fuss on the doorstep what did you do i sent him packing told him id set jim on him if he came back again and shut the door in his face he left us alone after that surely you dont think donald could have we dont know what to think yet mrs lofthouse we have to look at all possibilities hes a bit of a hothead anyone will tell you that but i very much doubt that hes a murderer she dabbed at her eyes again im sorry she said i still cant seem to take it in i understand said chadwick is there anyone youd like me to get to stay with you relative neighbor mrs bennett next door shes always been a good friend shes a widow like me she understands what it feels like chadwick stood up to leave ill let her know you want her to come over look before i go do you have a recent photograph of linda i could borrow i might have she said just a minute she went over to the sideboard and started rummaging through one of the drawers this was taken last year when she came home for her birthday her father was a bit of an amateur photographer she handed chadwick the color photograph it was the girl in the sleeping bag only she was alive a halfsmile on her lips a faraway look in her big blue eyes wavy blond hair tumbling over her shoulders thank you he said ill let you have it back and youll keep in touch wont you about the arrangements of course ill also send someone to drive you to the hospital and back to make the formal identification thank you she said and stood with him at the door holding a damp tissue to her eyes how can something like this happen to me mr chadwick she said ive been a devout christian woman all my life ive never hurt a soul and ive always served the lord to the best of my ability how can he do this to me a husband and a daughter both in the same year all chadwick could do was shake his head i dont know he said i wish i knew the answer just outside sheffield turned out to be a quaint village on the edge of the peak district national park and the house was a detached limestone cottage with a fairsized and welltended garden central door symmetrical up and down mullioned windows garage and outbuildings in the dales annie guessed it would be valued at about half a million pounds these days but she had no idea what prices were like in the peak district probably not much different there were many similarities between the two areas with their limestone hills and valleys and both drew hordes of tourists ramblers and climbers almost yearround winsome parked by the gate and they made their way down the garden path a few birds twittered in the nearby trees completing the rural idyll the woman who opened the door to them had clearly been crying annie felt grateful she hadnt been the one to break the news she hated that the last time she had told someone about the death of a friend the woman had actually fainted annie cabbot and winsome jackman from north yorkshire major crimes she said yes come in said the woman weve been expecting you if the sight of a sixfoot black woman surprised her at all she didnt show it like many others she no doubt watched crime programs on tv and had got used to the idea of a multiracial police force even in such a white enclave as the peaks she led them through a dim hallway where coats hung on pegs and boots and shoes were neatly aligned on a low slatted rack then into an airy living room with french windows that led to the back garden a neatly manicured lawn with stone birdbath white plastic table and chairs and herbaceous borders plane trees framed a magnificent view over the fields to the limestone peaks beyond the sky was mostly light gray with a hint of sun hiding behind clouds somewhere in the north weve just got back from church the woman said we go every week and it seemed especially important today of course said annie whose religious background had been agnostic and whose own spiritual dabbling in yoga and meditation had never led her to any sort of organized religion were very sorry about your son mrs barber please she said call me louise my husband ross is making some tea i hope that will be all right thatll be perfect said annie youd better sit down the chintzcovered armchairs all had spotless lace antimacassars and annie sat carefully not quite daring to let the back of her head touch the material in a few moments a tall rangy man with unruly white hair wearing a gray vneck pullover and baggy cords brought in a tray and placed it on the low glass table between the chairs and the fireplace he looked a bit like a sort of mad scientist character who could do complex equations in his head but had trouble fastening his shoelaces annie admired the framed print of seurats sunday afternoon on the island of la grande jatte over the mantelpiece once tea had been served and everyone was settled winsome took out her notebook and annie began i know this is a difficult time for you but anything you can tell us about your son would be helpful right now do you have any suspects mr barber asked im afraid not its early days yet were just trying to piece together what happened i cant imagine why anyone would want to harm our nicholas he was harmless he wouldnt have hurt a fly its often the innocent who suffer said annie but nicholas he let the sentence trail off did he have any enemies ross and louise barber looked at one another no louise said i mean he never mentioned anyone and like ross says he was a gentle person he loved his music and his books and his films and his writing of course he wasnt married was he they had not been able to find a record of a wife but annie thought it best to make sure if a jealous wife had caught wind of what barber was up to with kelly soames she might easily have lost it no he was engaged once ten years ago said ross barber nice girl local but they drifted apart when he moved to london more tea annie and winsome said yes please barber topped up their cups we understand that your son was a music journalist annie went on yes said louise it was what he always wanted even when he was at school he was editor of the magazine and he wrote most of the articles himself we found out from the internet that hes done some articles for mojo and written a couple of biographies can you tell us anything else about his work did he write for anyone in particular for example no he was a freelancer ross barber answered he did some writing for the newspapers reviews and such and feature pieces for that magazine sometimes as you said im afraid that sort of music isnt exactly to my taste he smiled indulgently but he loved it and apparently he made a decent living annie liked pop music but she hadnt heard of mojo though she knew she must have seen it in w h smiths when she was picking up now star or heat the trashy celebrity gossip magazines she liked to read in the bath her one secret vice you didnt approve of your sons interest in rock music she asked its not that were against it or anything you understand said ross barber weve just always been a bit more inclined toward classical louise sings with the local operatic society but were happy that nicholas seemed to pick up a love of music at a very early age along with the writing he loves classical music too of course but writing about rock was how he made his living he was lucky then said annie being able to combine his two loves yes louise agreed wiping away a tear with a lacy handkerchief do you have any copies of his articles you must be proud of him a scrapbook perhaps im afraid not said louise it never really entered our heads did it darling her husband agreed it wouldnt mean anything to us you see what he was writing about the names the records we would never have heard of any of them annie wanted to tell them that wasnt the point but it would clearly do no good how long has he been doing this for a living she asked about eight years now ross answered and before that he got a ba in english at nottingham then he did an ma in film studies i think at leicester after that he did a bit of teaching and wrote reviews then he got a feature accepted and after that he never studied journalism no i suppose you might say he got in through the back door whats your profession if you dont mind my asking i was a university professor said ross barber classics and ancient history rather dull im afraid im retired now mind you annie was trying frantically to puzzle out why anyone would want to kill a music journalist but she couldnt come up with anything except drugs kelly soames had said that she and nick smoked a joint but that meant nothing annie had smoked a few joints in her time even while she was a copper even banks had smoked joints she wondered about winsome and kev templeton kevs drug of choice was probably e washed down with liberal amounts of red bull but she didnt know about winsome she seemed a cleanliving girl with her passion for the outdoors and for potholing but surely there had to be something anyway it didnt help very much knowing that nick barber smoked marijuana occasionally she imagined it was par for the course in the rock business whichever end of it you were in can you tell us anything about nicks life she asked we have so little to go on i cant see how any of it would help you said louise but well do our best did you see him often you know what its like when they leave home louise said they phone and visit when they can our nick was no better or worse than anyone else in that regard i shouldnt think so he was in touch regularly he phoned us once a week and tried to drop by whenever he could when was the last time you saw him her eyes filled with tears again just the week before last friday he was on his way up to yorkshire and he stopped over for the night we always keep his old room ready for him just in case was there anything different about him different what do you mean did he seem fearful in any way no not at all was he depressed about anything the barbers looked at one another then louise replied no maybe a little preoccupied but certainly not depressed he seemed quite cheerful as a matter of fact nick was never the most demonstrative of children but he was generally eventempered he was no different this time from any other time he called by he wasnt anxious about anything not as far as we could tell if anything he was a bit more excited than usual excited about what he didnt say i think it might have been a story he was working on what was it about he never told us details like that not that we werent interested in his work but i think he realized it would mean nothing to us besides it was probably a scoop hed learned to become secretive in his business even from you the walls have ears hed developed an instinct i dont think it really mattered to whom he was talking so he didnt mention any names no im sorry did he tell you why he was going to yorkshire he said hed found what sounded like a quiet place to write and i think there was someone he wanted to see who lives up there who mrs barber spread her hands im sorry but i got the impression it was to do with what he was working on annie cursed under her breath if only nick had named names if hed thought his parents had the least interest in his passion then he probably would have despite his journalistic instinct to protect his scoop is that what he was excited about i think so can you add anything mr barber ross barber shook his head no as louise said the names of these groups and singers mean nothing to us i think hed learned there was no point in mentioning them im afraid i glaze over in discussions like that no doubt members of his own generation would be very impressed but they went right over our heads i can understand that said annie what do you know about nicks life in london he had a nice flat said louise didnt he ross just off the great west road we stayed there not so long ago on our way to heathrow he slept on the sofa and let us have his bedroom spotless it was he didnt live or share with anyone no it was all his own did you meet a girlfriend or a close friend anyone no he took us out for dinner somewhere in the west end the next day we flew to new york ross and i have old friends there and they invited us for our fortieth wedding anniversary thats nice said annie so you dont really know much at all about nicks life in london i think he worked all the hours god sent he didnt have time for girlfriends and relationships and that sort of thing im sure he would have settled down eventually in annies admittedly limited experience if someone had reached the age of thirtyeight without settling down you were a fool if you held your breath and waited for him to do so but she also knew that many more people were holding off committing to relationships for much longer these days herself included i know this is a rather delicate question annie asked and i dont want it to upset you but did nick ever have anything to do with drugs well said ross we assumed he experimented of course like so many young people today but we never saw him under the influence of anything more than a couple of pints of bitter or perhaps a small whiskey were fairly liberal about things like that i mean you cant teach in a university for as long as i did and not have some knowledge of marijuana but if he did use drugs at all they didnt interfere with his job or his health and we certainly never noticed any signs did we no louise agreed it was a fair answer if not entirely what annie had expected she sensed that ross barber was being as honest as he could be the barbers clearly loved their son and were distraught over his death but there seemed to have been some sort of communication gap between them they were proud of his achievements but not interested in the actual achievements themselves nick might well have interviewed coldplay or oasis but annie could just imagine ross barber saying thats very nice son as he pored over his ancient tomes she couldnt think of anything else to ask and glanced over at winsome who shrugged perhaps banks would have done better perhaps she wasnt asking the right questions but she couldnt think of any more they would have a quick look in nicks room just in case he had left anything of interest then maybe catch a pub lunch somewhere on the way back after that annie would check in at the incident van and give banks a ring hed want to know what she had found out no matter how little it was saturday th september the young man in the greasy overalls was standing with a spanner in his hand surrounded by pieces of a dismantled motorbike when chadwick arrived at the garage later that afternoon according to the car radio leeds were one nil up vincent black lightning the young man said lovely machine how can i help you chadwick showed his warrant card are you donald hughes hughes immediately looked cagey put down the spanner and wiped his hands on his greasy overalls maybe he said depends why you want to know chadwicks immediate inclination was to tell the kid to stop messing about and come up with some answers but he realized that hughes might not know yet about lindas murder and that his reaction to the news could reveal a lot perhaps a softer approach would be best then at least to start with maybe youd better sit down laddie he said why there were two foldup chairs in the garage instead of answering chadwick sat on one a little dazed hughes followed suit the dim garage smelled of oil petrol and warm metal it was still raining outside and he could hear the steady dripping of water from the gutters what is it hughes asked has something happened to mum not as far as i know said chadwick read the papers much nah nothing but bad news hear about the festival up at brimleigh glen last weekend hard not to were you there nah not my cup of tea look why are you asking all these questions a young girl was killed there he said stabbed when hughes said nothing he continued weve good reason to believe that she was linda lofthouse linda but she bloody hell hughes turned pale she what she went off to live in london she was at brimleigh for the festival i should have known look he said im really sorry to hear about what happened it was a long time ago though me and linda another lifetime it seems two years isnt very long people have held grudges longer what do you mean revenge is a dish thats best eaten cold i dont know what youre on about lets suppose we start at the beginning said chadwick you and linda we went out together for a couple of years when we were fifteen and sixteen thats all and she had your baby hughes looked down at his oily hands in his lap yeah well i tried to make it right asked her to marry me and all thats not the way i hear it look all right at first i was scared wouldnt you be i was only sixteen i didnt have no job nothing we left school linda stayed at home with her mum and dad that summer and had the baby and i i dont know i suppose i brooded about it anyway i decided in the end we should make a go of it i had a job here at the garage by then and i thought you know that we might have had a chance after all but she didnt want to know did she by then shed got her head full of this hippie rubbish bob dylan and his stupid songs and all the rest of it when did this start before we split up just little things always correcting me when i said something wrong like she was a bloody grammar expert talking about poets and singers id never heard of reincarnation and karma and i dont know what else always arguing it was like she wasnt interested in a normal life what about her new friends longhaired pillocks and poxy birds i hadnt time for any of them did she chuck you you could say that and when you came back cap in hand she wanted nothing more to do with you i suppose so then she buggered off to london soon as shed had the kid put him up for adoption my son did you follow her down there id had enough by then let her go with her poncy new friends and take all the drugs she wanted did she take drugs when she was with you no not that i knew of i wouldnt have stood for it but thats what they do isnt it so they stole her from you did they the hippies he looked away i suppose you could say that made you angry enough to do her harm hughes stood so violently that his chair tipped over what are you getting at are you trying to say i killed her calm down laddie i have to ask these questions its a murder investigation yeah well im not your murderer got a bit of a quick temper though havent you hughes said nothing he picked up the chair and sat again folding his arms across his chest did you ever meet any of lindas new friends hughes rubbed the back of his hand across his upper lip and nose she took me to this house once he said i think she wanted me to be like her and she thought maybe shed convince me by introducing me to her new friends when was this just after she left school that summer nineteen sixtyseven when she was pregnant yes go on we werent getting along well at all like i said before she was weird into all sorts of weird stuff i didnt understand like tarot cards and astrology and all that crap this one time she was going to see some friends and i didnt want her to go i wanted her to come to the pictures with me to see you only live twice but she said she didnt want to see some stupid james bond film and if i wanted to be with her i could come along if i didnt well she made it clear i didnt have much choice so i thought what the hell lets see whats going on here do you remember where she took you i dunno it was off roundhay road near that big pub at the junction with spenser place the gaiety thats the one chadwick knew it there werent many coppers in leeds plainclothes or uniformed who didnt do you remember the name of the street no but it was just over roundhay road one of the bayswaters chadwick knew the area a densely packed triangle of streets full of small terraced houses between roundhay road bayswater road and harehills road it didnt have a particularly bad reputation but quite a few of the houses had been rented to students and where there were students there were probably drugs thats the place do you know which one i cant say for sure but i think it was the terrace or maybe the crescent remember where the house was about halfway which side of the street dont remember was there anything odd about the place from the outside no it looked just like all the others what color was the door i dont remember okay thanks said chadwick maybe he could find it it was frustrating to be so close but still so far even so it was probably a cold lead the students who had been there two years ago might have graduated and left town by now if they were students what happened nothing really there were these people about five of them hippies like in funny clothes freaks were they students maybe some of them were i dont know they didnt say the place smelled like a tarts window box that bad some sort of perfume smell anyway i think it was something they were smoking one or two of them were definitely on something you could tell by their eyes and the rubbish they were spouting like what i dont remember but it was all cosmic this and cosmic that and there was this awful droning music in the background like someone rubbing a hacksaw on a metal railing do you remember any names i think one of them was called dennis it seemed to be his place and a girl called julie she was blowing bubbles and giggling like a little kid linda had been there before i could tell she knew her way around and didnt have to ask anyone you know like where the kettle or the toilet was or anything what happened i wanted to go i mean i knew they were taking the mickey because i didnt talk the same language or like the same music even linda in the end i said we should leave but she wouldnt so what did you do i left i couldnt stick any more of it i went to see you only live twice by myself there couldnt have been that many hippies in leeds during the summer of it might have been the summer of love in san francisco but leeds was still a northern provincial backwater in many ways always a little behind the times and it was only over the past two years or so that the numbers had grown everywhere the leeds drugs squad hadnt even been formed until anyway if there was a dennis still living on bayswater terrace it shouldnt be too hard to find him how often did you see her again a couple of times then after the baby was born you know when i tried to make things up between us then she went down south and her bloody mother wouldnt even give me an address and finally i got over her ive been going out with someone else for a while now might get engaged at christmas congratulations said chadwick standing up im really sorry about linda hughes said but it was nothing to do with me honest i was here working all last weekend ask the boss hell tell you chadwick said he would then left when he turned on the car radio he found that leeds had beaten sheffield wednesday allan clarke and eddie grey scoring still he hadnt missed the game for nothing he now knew who the victim was and had a lead on some of the people shed knocked around with in leeds if only he could find them chapter seven the soames farm was about half a mile up a narrow walled lane off the main lyndgarth to eastvale road and it boasted the usual collection of ramshackle outbuildings built from local limestone a muddy yard and a barking dog straining at its chain it also presented the unmistakable bouquet of barnyard smells calvin soames answered the door and with a rather grudging good afternoon let banks in the inside was dim with dark low beams and gloomy hallways the smell of roast beef still lurked somewhere in the depths our kellys in the kitchen he said pointing with his thumb thats all right said banks its you i came to talk to really me i told you everything i know the other night im sure you did said banks but sometimes after a bit of time things come back little things youd forgotten may i sit down aye go on then banks sat in a deep armchair with a sagging seat the whole place once he could see it a bit better was in some disrepair and lacked what they used to call a womans touch is there a mrs soames he asked the wife died five years ago complications of surgery soames spat out these last words making it quite clear that he blamed the doctors the health system or both for his wifes untimely death im sorry said banks soames grunted he was a short squat man almost as broad as he was tall but muscular and fit banks judged wearing a tight waistcoat over his shirt and a pair of baggy brown trousers he probably wasnt more than about fortyfive but farming had aged him and it showed in the deep lines and rough texture of his ruddy face look banks went on i just want to go over what you told us in the pub on friday it were the truth nobody doubts that you said you left the cross keys at about seven oclock because you thought you might have left the gas ring on thats right have you done that before he has said a voice from the doorway twice he nearly burned the place down banks turned kelly soames stood there arms folded one bluejeaned hip cocked against the doorjamb in a graceful curve flat stomach exposed she certainly was a lovely girl banks thought again she was fit and she knew it as the streets would say hed been spoiled for lovely girls this morning what with brians emilia turning up too should he have said something brian and emilia obviously just assumed they were going to sleep together under his roof but he wasnt sure how he felt about that his own son what if he heard them but what else could he have done made an issue of it his parents of course would never have stood for such a thing but attitudes changed when he was young he had left home and got a flat in london so he could sleep with girls stay out late and drink too much these days parents allowed their kids to do all that at home so they never left had no reason to they could have all the sex they wanted come home drunk and still get fed and get their washing done but brian was only visiting surely it would be best just to let him and emilia do what they usually did banks could imagine the kind of atmosphere it would create if he came on all disciplinarian and said not under my roof you dont but the whole thing the assumption the reality still made him feel uneasy despite her cocky stance kelly soames seemed nervous banks thought after what annie had told him about her exploits he wasnt surprised she must be worried that he was going to spill the beans to her father kelly said mr soames make a cup of tea for mr banks here he might be a copper but we still owe him our hospitality no thats all right thank you said banks ive already had far too much coffee this morning please yourself ill have a cuppa myself though lass kelly slouched off to make the tea and banks could imagine her straining her ears to hear what they were talking about calvin soames took out a pipe and began puffing at some vilesmelling tobacco outside the dog barked from time to time when a group of ramblers passed on the footpath that skirted the farm property what did you think of nick barber banks asked was that his name poor sod yes i cant say as i thought much really i didnt know him but he was a regular in your local soames laughed dropping by the cross keys for a pint every day or so for a week doesnt make anyone a regular around these parts tha should know that even so said banks it was long enough at least to be on greeting terms wasnt it i suppose so but i cant say as i have much to do with visitors myself why not do you need it spelling out bloody londoners come up here buying properties pushing prices up and what do they do they sit in the poncy flats in kensington and just pull in the cash thats what they do it brings tourism to the dales mr soames said banks they spend money aye well maybe its all right for the shopkeepers soames went on but it doesnt do us farmers a lot of good does it people tramping over our land morning noon and night ruining good grazing pasture as far as banks had heard absolutely nothing ever benefited the farmers he knew they had a hard life but he also felt that people might respect them more if they didnt whine so much if it wasnt eu regulations or footpath access it was something else of course footandmouth disease had taken a terrible toll on the dales farms only a few years ago but the effects hadnt been limited to farmers many of whom had been compensated handsomely the pinch had also been felt by local businesses particularly bedandbreakfast establishments cafés and tearooms pubs walkinggear shops and marketstall holders and they hadnt been compensated banks also knew that the outbreak had driven more than one ruined local businessman to suicide it wasnt that he had no sympathy for the farmers it was that they often seemed to assume they were the only ones with any rights or any serious grievances and they had more than enough sympathy for themselves to make any from other sources seem quite superfluous but banks knew he had to tread carefully this was marshy ground i understand theres a problem he said but it wont be solved by killing off tourists do you think thats what happened i dont know what happened said banks kelly came back with the tea and after she had handed it to her father she lingered by the door again biting her fingernail nobody around here would have murdered that lad you can take it from me said soames how do you know because most know youre right cc benefits from the holidaymakers and so do most of the others oh people talk a tough game thats dalesmen for you weve got our pride if nowt else but nobodyd go so far as to kill a bloke whos minding his own business and not doing anyone any harm is that your impression of nick barber i didnt see much of him like i said but from what i did see he seemed like a harmless lad not mouthy or full of himself like some of them and we didnt even murder them when you came home on friday to check on the gas ring did you notice anything out of the ordinary no said soames there were one or two cars on the road this was before the power cut remember but not a lot it was a nasty evening even by then and most folks given the choice were stopping indoors did you see anyone near the cottage where nick barber was staying no but i live the other way so i wouldnt have what about you kelly banks asked i was in the pub all the time working said kelly i never left the place you can ask cc but what did you think about nick barber this was clearly dangerous ground and kelly seemed to become even more nervous she wouldnt look him in the eye but banks wasnt worried about her she didnt know how far he was going to go but without giving kellys secret away he wanted to keep his eyes on calvin to see if there was any hint that he had known what was going on between his nubile daughter and nick barber dont know really said kelly he seemed a pleasant enough lad like dad says he never really said much she examined her fingernails so neither of you knew why he was here holiday i suppose said calvin though why anyone would want to come up here at this time of year is beyond me would it surprise you to hear that he was a writer of some sort cant say as i ever really thought about it said calvin i think he was mostly just looking for a secluded place to work said banks but there might also be another reason why he was up here rather than say in cornwall or norfolk for example banks noticed kelly tense up i dont know if he was writing fiction or history but its possible that either way he might have been doing some research and there might have been someone he wanted to see someone hed been looking for with some connection to the area maybe to the past any ideas who that might be calvin shook his head and kelly followed suit banks studied them he thought himself a reasonable judge and he was satisfied from the reactions and body language he had seen that calvin soames did not know about his daughter shagging nick barber which gave him no real motive for the murder no more than anyone else anyway whether kelly had a motive he didnt know true she had been working at the time of the murder but she admitted to seeing barber in the afternoon and if the doctor was at all wrong about the time of death he could have been dead when she left him but why theyd only known one another a few days according to annie and theyd both had a bit of fun without any expectation of a future it would be good to keep an open mind as ever banks thought but for now his thoughts moved toward london and what they might find out from nicks flat monday th september one thing that disappointed chadwick as he riffled through the stack of brimleigh festival photographs on monday morning was that they had all except for a few obviously posed ones been taken in daylight he should have expected that flash doesnt carry a great distance and it would have been useless for shots of the crowd at night or of the bands performing one photographer did seem to have got backstage though at least several of his photographs were taken there candids linda lofthouse showed up in three of them the flowing white dress with the delicate embroidery was easy to spot in one she was standing chatting casually with a mixed group of longhaired people in another she was with two men he didnt recognize and in the third she was sitting alone staring into the distance it was an exquisite photograph head and shoulders in profile perhaps taken with a telephoto lens she looked beautiful and fragile and there was no flower painted on her cheek someone to see you downstairs sir said karen popping her head around his door and breaking the spell who chadwick asked young couple they just asked to see the man in charge of the brimleigh festival murder did they indeed better have them sent up chadwick glanced out of his window as he waited sipping his tepid coffee he was high up at the back and looked out over british insulated callenders cables ltd up westgate toward the majestic dome of the town hall blackened like the other buildings by a century of industry a steady flow of traffic headed west toward the inner ring road finally there was a knock at his door and karen showed in the young couple they looked a bit sheepish the way most people would in the inner sanctum of police headquarters chadwick introduced himself and asked them to sit down both were in their early twenties the young man with neatly cut short hair and a dark suit and the girl in a white blouse and a black miniskirt blond hair pulled back and tied behind her neck with a red ribbon dressed for work they introduced themselves as ian tilbrook and june betts you said it was about the brimleigh festival murder chadwick began ian tilbrooks eyes looked anywhere but at chadwick and june fidgeted with her handbag on her lap but it was she who spoke first yes she said giving tilbrook a sideways glance i know we should have come forward sooner she said but we were there at the festival yes so were thousands of others did you see something no its not that june went on she glanced at tilbrook again who was staring out of the window took a deep breath and went on someone stole our sleeping bag i see said chadwick suddenly interested well the newspapers said to report anything odd and it was odd wasnt it why didnt you come forward earlier june looked at tilbrook again he didnt want to get involved she said hes up for promotion at the copper works and he thinks itll spoil his chances if they find out hes been going to pop festivals theyll think hes a drugtaking hippie and a murder suspect thats not fair said tilbrook i said it was probably nothing it was just a sleeping bag but you kept going on about it he looked at his watch and now im going to be late for work never mind about that laddie said chadwick just tell me about it tilbrook sulked but june took up the story again well the papers said she was found in a blue woolworths sleeping bag and ours was blue and from woolworths i just thought you know can you identify it im not sure i dont think so theyre all the same arent they i suppose you both er it was big enough for the two of you you spent some time in it over the weekend june blushed yes therell be evidence we can match youll still have to look at it june cringed i dont think i could is there i mean did she theres not a lot of blood no and you wont have to see it all right i suppose but first give me a few details lets start with the time we werent really paying attention to time said tilbrook but it was late sunday night how do you know led zeppelin were on said june they were the last band to play and we went to see if we could get anywhere closer to the stage we left our stuff thinking if we did find somewhere one of us could go back and get it while the other remained but we couldnt find anywhere it was so crowded near the front when we got back it was gone just the sleeping bag yes what else did you have just a rucksack with some extra clothes a bottle of pop and sandwiches and that remained untouched yes where were you sitting right at the edge of the woods about halfway down the field it was close chadwick thought with a surge of excitement very close so the killer had walked two hundred yards through the dense woods to the edge of the field and found a sleeping bag had that been what he was looking for he would certainly have known that plenty of people there had one it would have been dark by then the crowd would for the most part be entranced by the music all their attention focused on the stage and it would have been easy enough for a dark figure to pick up a sleeping bag even if the owners had been sitting nearby and slip back into the woods putting it back on the field with a body in it would have been more difficult of course and chadwick was willing to bet that someone had seen something a figure dragging a bag of some sort or carrying it over his shoulder why had no one come forward clearly they hadnt found what they saw suspicious or they simply wanted to avoid any sort of contact with the police drugs might have played a part too perhaps whoever saw it was too far gone to comprehend what he or she was seeing on the other hand the killer might have waited until led zeppelin had finished playing and people started wandering home then it would have been easy to plant the sleeping bag however it happened the best thing the killer had in his favor was that not one of the twentyfive thousand people present would expect to see someone dragging a body in a sleeping bag over the grass there were risks of course there always are someone might also have seen him steal the bag for example and raised a hue and cry but it was so dark that they wouldnt have been able to describe him and those hippies in chadwicks experience had a very cavalier attitude toward private property also someone might have found the body while he was away even then all he would have lost was the opportunity to try to disguise the crime to make it look as if the girl had been killed in the sleeping bag on the field it was clear they werent dealing with a criminal genius here but he had had luck on his side even if he hadnt disguised the crime scene and someone had found the body in the woods there was still no evidence to link it to him and the police would be exactly where they were now or at least where they had been before june betts and ian tilbrook had come forward it hadnt taken long to debunk the misleading evidence about where the victim was killed and now just as chadwick had hoped the attempt to mislead had yielded a clue they now had a much better idea of the time of the murder if nothing else but they still didnt know what had happened to the knife can you be a bit more specific about the time he asked how long had the group been playing its hard to say said june looking at tilbrook they hadnt been on long they were playing i cant quit you baby when we set off to see if we could find somewhere nearer the stage said tilbrook and they were still playing it when we got back i think it was their second number of the set and the first was pretty short chadwick had no idea how long these songs lasted but he realized he could probably get a set list from rick hayes to whom he wanted to speak again anyway for now this would have to do say between five past one and half past then we didnt have watches said june but if you say they started at one then yes it would have been about twenty minutes into the show something like that that would put the time at about onetwenty which meant that linda must have been killed between about one when the band started and then he showed them her photograph did you see this girl at any time no they said then chadwick showed them the pictures of linda with others recognize anyone isnt that june said it could be i suppose said ian who chadwick asked theyre from the mad hatters ian explained terry watson and robin merchant chadwick looked at the photograph again he would be talking to the mad hatters that afternoon okay he said standing up now if youd like to come to the evidence room with me you can have a look at that sleeping bag reluctantly they followed him down i know you have a train to catch said detective superintendent catherine gervaise early on monday morning but i wanted to have a quick word with you before you left banks sat across the desk from her in what used to be gristhorpes office it was a lot more sparsely decorated now and the bookcases held only books on law criminology and management technique gone were the leatherbound volumes of dickens hardy and austen with which gristhorpe had surrounded himself and the books about flyfishing and drystonewall building one shelf displayed a few of the superintendents archery awards alongside a framed photograph of her aiming a bow the only true decorative effect was a poster for an old covent garden production of tosca on the wall as you probably know superintendent gervaise went on this is my first murder investigation at this level and im sure the boys and girls in the squad room have been having a good laugh at my expense not at she waved him down it doesnt matter thats not what this is about she shuffled some papers on her desk i know a lot about you dci banks i make a point of knowing as much as i can about the officers under my command a very wise move said banks wondering if he was in for even more of the obvious she gave him a sharp glance including your penchant for cheap sarcasm she said but thats not why were here either she leaned back in her executive chair and smiled her cupidsbow lips turning up at the edges as if she was ready to fire an arrow id like if i may to be completely frank with you dci banks on the understanding that nothing thats said in here this morning goes beyond you me and these four walls is that clear yes said banks now wondering what the hell was coming next im aware that you recently lost your brother under appalling circumstances and you have my sincere commiserations i am also aware that you lost your home and almost your life not too long ago all in all its been quite an eventful year for you hasnt it it has but i hope none of that has affected my job oh but i think we can be quite sure that it has dont you she was wearing oval glasses with silver frames which she adjusted as she looked at the papers on her desk withholding information in a major investigation assault on a suspect with an iron bar need i go on but you dont need much encouragement to go a little bit over the top do you dci banks you never did your record is a patchwork quilt of questionable decisions and downright insubordination res ipsa loquitur as the lawyers are fond of saying so you can quote latin banks thought to himself big deal look he said ive cut a few corners i admit it you have to in this job if youre to keep ahead of the villains but ive never perjured myself ive never faked the evidence and ive never used force to get a confession i admit i lost it in london last summer but like you said a personal tragedy youre the new broom i understand that you want to make a clean sweep fair enough if im a transfer waiting to happen then lets get on with it what on earth makes you think that maybe something you said she regarded him through narrowed eyes you got on very well with my predecessor detective superintendent gristhorpe didnt you he was a good copper whats that supposed to mean what i said mr gristhorpe was an experienced officer and he gave you free rein he knew how to get the job done right superintendent gervaise leaned forward and clasped her hands on the desk well let me tell you something that may surprise you i dont want you to change i want you to get the job done too what said banks i thought that might surprise you let me tell you something im a woman in a mans world do you think i dont know that do you think i dont know how many people resent me because of it how many are waiting in the wings just to see me fail but im also ambitious i see no reason why i shouldnt make chief constable in a few years not here necessarily but somewhere maybe theyll give me the position because im a woman i dont care ive got nothing against positive discrimination weve had it coming for centuries its well overdue my predecessor wasnt ambitious he didnt care he was close to retirement but im not and i still see a career ahead of me a long career and a great one and my role in all this is you know as well as i do that were judged by results and one thing ive noticed as ive studied your checkered career is that you do get results maybe not in the traditional ways maybe not always in the legally prescribed ways but you get them and it may also interest you to know that there are relatively few black marks against you that means you get away with it most of the time she sat back and smiled again when the doctor asks you how much you drink what do you tell him pardon come on this isnt about drinking what do you tell him you know a couple of drinks a day something like that and do you know what your doctor does tell me he immediately doubles that figure she leaned forward again my point is that we all lie about things like that and this she tapped the folders in front of her simply tells me that the number of times you got caught out in something not exactly kosher is the tip of the iceberg and thats good it is yes i want someone who gets away with it i dont want black marks against you because theyll reflect on me but i do want results and as i said you get results it looks good on me and when i leave this godforsaken wasteland of sheepshaggers and saturdaynight pub brawlers i want to take a shining record with me and that might be sooner than we think if the home office has its way i assume youve been reading the newspapers yes maam said banks many of the smaller county forces such as north yorkshire had recently been deemed by the home office as not up to the task of policing the modern world consequently there was talk of them being merged with larger neighboring forces which meant that the north yorkshire constabulary might be swallowed up by west yorkshire nobody was saying what would happen to the present personnel if such a shakeup actually went ahead you can give me that shining record superintendent gervaise went on and in return i can give you enough rope drink on duty follow leads on your own disappear for days without reporting in i dont care but all the while youre doing those things theyd damn well better be for the sake of solving the case and youd damn well better solve it quick and id damn well better get all the reflected glory no slacking am i still making myself clear you are maam said banks struck with admiration and awe for the spectacle of naked ambition unfolding before him and working in his favor and if you do anything over the top make damn sure you dont get caught or youll be out on your arse she said then she straightened the collar of her white silk blouse and leaned back in her chair now she said dont you have a train to catch banks got up and walked to the door dci banks yes that opera north production of lucia di lammermoor dont you think it was just a little lackluster and wasnt lucia just a little too shrill monday th september after a meeting with bradley enderby and detective chief superintendent mccullen later on monday morning chadwick invited geoff broome for a lunchtime sandwich and pint at the pub across from park lane college most of the students hung out in the slightly more posh lounge but the public bar was chadwicks domain and that of a few oldage pensioners who sat quietly playing dominoes over their halves of mild with a couple of pints of websters pennine bitter beside them and a plate of roast beef sandwiches each chadwick brought broome uptodate on the linda lofthouse murder i dont know why youre telling me all this stan said broome finishing his sandwich and taking out a packet of ten kensitas tapping one on the table and lighting it it doesnt sound like a drugrelated killing to me chadwick watched broome inhale and exhale and felt the familiar urge he thought hed vanquished six years ago when the doctor found a shadow on his lung that turned out to be tuberculosis and cost him six months in a sanitarium smoke bothering you broome asked no its all right chadwick sipped some beer im not saying its a drugrelated murder but drugs might play a part in it thats all i was just wondering whether you might be able to help me find out who the girls contacts in leeds were you know that scene far better than i do of course if i can said broome as usual his hair looked disheveled and his suit looked as if it had been slept in all of which might have masked the fact that he was one of the best detectives in the county perhaps not good enough to detect that his wife had been having it off with a vacuumcleaner salesman behind his back but good enough to reduce significantly the amount of illegal drugs entering into the city he also ran one of the most efficient networks of undercover officers and his many paid informants within the drugs community knew they could depend on absolute anonymity chadwick told him what donald hughes had said about visiting the house in one of the bayswaters i cant say anything springs immediately to mind said broome but weve had call to visit that neighborhood once in a while let me do a bit of fishing bloke called dennis said chadwick and its maybe terrace or crescent thats all i know broome jotted the name and streets down you really think its not just some random nutcase he asked i dont know chadwick answered if you look at the crime what we know of it thats certainly a possibility until we know more about the girls background and movements and whether she was drugged or not for example we cant really say much more she was stabbed five times so hard that the knife hilt bruised her chest and the blade cut off a piece of her heart but there were no signs of any sort of struggle in the surrounding grass and the bruising around her neck is minimal maybe it was a lovers quarrel lovers kill each other all the time stan you know that yes but theyre usually a bit more obvious about it like i said this has more deliberate elements the killer stood behind her for a start so shes leaning back on him she felt safe what about her boyfriend didnt have one so far as we know she had an exboyfriend donald hughes but his alibi checks out he was working most of the night on a rush job at the garage where he works and he wouldnt have had time to go anywhere near brimleigh someone else close to her then i suppose theres a chance she knew her killer chadwick admitted that it was someone she felt familiar with felt comfortable with why he did it is another matter entirely but to find out any more we need to track down her friends well i cant promise anything but ill see what i can do said broome good lord is that the time must dash i have to see a man about a shipment of dexedrine all go isnt it you can say that again whats next on your agenda why so gloomy ive got an appointment with their royal majesties the mad hatters this afternoon chadwick said lucky you maybe theyll give you a free lp they know what they can do with it think of yvonne though stan youd be golden in her eyes you met the mad hatters and got a signed lp get away with you ill come back to you about the house broome said then left broomes cigarette butt still smoldered in the ashtray chadwick put it out that made his fingers smell of smoke so he went to the toilet and washed them before sitting down to finish his drink he could hear a group of students in the lounge laughing over stevie wonders my cherie amour on the jukebox a song chadwick actually quite liked when he heard it on the radio maybe it wouldnt be such a bad idea to get a signed lp for yvonne he thought then immediately dismissed the idea a lot of good that would do for his authority begging a bunch of drugaddled layabouts for their autographs chadwick tried to picture the twentyfive thousand kids at the brimleigh festival all sitting in the dark listening to a loud band on a distant litup stage he knew he could narrow his range of suspects if he tried hard enough especially now that he had a more accurate idea of the time of the murder for a start rick hayes was still holding something back he was certain of it the candid photographs proved that linda lofthouse had been in the backstage area and that she had talked with two members of the mad hatters among others hayes must have known this but he didnt say anything why was he protecting someone on the other hand chadwick remembered that hayes himself was lefthanded like the killer so if he knew more than he was telling still he admonished himself no point in too much theorizing ahead of the facts imagination had never been his forte and he had seen enough to know that the details of the murder did not necessarily give any clues as to the killers state of mind or to his relationship with the victim people were capable of strange and wondrous behavior and some of it was murderous he finished his pint and went back to the station he would get dc bradley to give the boffins a gentle nudge while he went out to swainsview lodge with young enderby chapter eight banks hadnt been to london since roys death or since the terrible tube and bus suicide bombings that summer and he was surprised getting off the gner intercity at kings cross that lunchtime at how just being there brought a lump to his throat it was partly roy of course and partly some deeprooted sense of outrage at what the place had suffered kings cross station was the usual throng of travelers standing gazing up at the boards like people looking for alien spacecraft there was nowhere to sit that was the problem the station authorities didnt want to encourage people to hang around the station they had enough problems with terrorists teenage prostitution and drugs as it was so they let the poor buggers stand while they waited for their trains a uniformed constable met banks and annie at the side exit as arranged and whisked them in a patrol car through the streets of central london to cromwell road and along the great west road past the roadside graffitiscored concreteandglass towers of hammersmith to nick barbers chiswick flat not far from fullers brewery it was a modern brick lowrise building three stories in all and barber had lived at the top in one of the corner units the police locksmith was waiting for them when the paperwork had been completed and handed over the lock yielded so quickly to the smiths ministrations that banks wondered whether he had once used his skills to less legitimate ends banks and annie found themselves standing in a room with purple walls on which hung a number of prints of famous psychedelic poster art jimi hendrix and john mayall at winterland february buffalo springfield at the fillmore auditorium december the mad hatters at the roundhouse chalk farm october mixed with these were a number of framed sixties album covers cheap thrills disraeli gears blind faith forever changes and sir peter blakes infamous sergeant peppers lonely hearts club band custom shelving held a formidable collection of cds and lps and the stereo equipment was top of the line bang amp olufsen as were the bose headphones resting by the leather armchair there were far too many cds to browse through but on a cursory glance banks noticed a prevalence of latesixties to earlyseventies rock stopping around bowie and roxy music and including some bands he hadnt thought of in years like atomic rooster quintessence dr strangely strange and amazing blondel there was also a smattering of jazz mostly miles trane and mingus along with a fair collection of j s bach vivaldi and mozart one shelf was devoted to magazines and newspapers in which nick barber had published reviews or features and quickie rock bios some recent correspondence mostly bills and junk mail sat on a small worktable under the window there was no desktop computer banks noticed which probably meant barber did all his work on the fly on his laptop which had been taken the bedroom was tidy and functional with a neatly made double bed and a wardrobe full of clothes much the same as the ones hed had with him in yorkshire casual and not too expensive there was nothing to indicate any interests other than music apart from the bookshelves which reflected fairly catholic tastes in modern fiction from amis to wodehouse with a few popular sciencefiction horror and crime novels mixed in philip k dick ramsey campbell derek raymond james herbert ursula k le guin james elroy and george pelecanos the rest were books about rock and roll greil marcus lester bangs peter guralnick a filing cabinet in a corner of the bedroom held copies of contracts lists and reviews of concerts attended expense sheets and drafts of articles all of which would have to be taken away and examined in detail for the moment though banks found what he needed to know in a brief note in the current file referring to the matter we discussed and urging barber to go ahead and get started it also reminded him that they didnt pay expenses up front the notepaper was headed with the mojo logo and an address at mappin house on winsley street in the west end it was dated st october just a couple of weeks before nick barber left for yorkshire there were several messages on nicks answering machine two from an anxious girlfriend who left him her work number said she hadnt seen him for a while and wanted to get together for a drink another from a mate about tickets to a kasabian concert and one offering the deal of the century on doubleglazing as far as banks could see nick barber had kept his life clean and tidy and taken most of it with him on the road now it had disappeared wed better split up he said to annie ill try the mojo offices and you see if you can get any luck with the girl who left her work number see if theres anything else you can find around the flat that might tell us anything about him too and arrange to have the files and stuff taken up to eastvale ill take the tube and leave you the driver okay said annie where shall we meet up banks named an italian restaurant in soho one he was sure they hadnt been to together before so it held no memories for them theyd have to take a taxi or the tube back to their hotel which was some distance away just off cromwell road not too far from the magnificent natural history museum it was clean they had been assured and unlikely to break the tight police budget as annie busied herself listening to barbers phone messages again banks left the flat and headed for the underground melanie wright dabbed at her cheeks and apologized to annie for the second time they were sitting in a starbucks near the embankment not far from where melanie worked as an estate agent she said she could take a break when annie called but when she found out about nick barbers murder she got upset and her boss told her she could take the rest of the afternoon off if nick had a type then annie was at a loss to know what it was kelly soames was gamine pale and rather naive whereas melanie was shapely tanned and sophisticated perhaps the only similarities were that both were a few years younger than him and both were blondes nick never let anyone get really close to him melanie said over a frappuccino but that was okay i mean im only twentyfour im not ready to get married yet or even to live with someone for that matter ive got a nice flat in chelsea i share with a girlfriend and we get on really well and give each other lots of space but you did go out with nick yes wed been seeing one another for a year or so now on and off i mean we werent exclusive or anything we werent even what youd call a couple really but we had fun nick was fun to be with most of the time what do you mean most of the time oh he could be a bit of a bore when he got on his hobbyhorse thats all i mean i wasnt even born when the bloody sixties happened it wasnt my fault cant stand the music either so you didnt share his enthusiasm nobody could it was more than an enthusiasm with him i mean i know this sounds weird because he was really cool and i got to meet all sorts of bands and stuff i mean we even had a drink with jimmy page once at some awards do can you believe it jimmy page even i know who he is but even though it all sounds really cool and everything being a rock writer and meeting famous people when you get right down to it its a bit like having any kind of allconsuming hobby isnt it i mean it could have been trainspotting or computers or something are you saying nick was a bit of a nerd in some ways of course there was more to him than that or i wouldnt have hung around nerds arent my type it wasnt just for the bands then she shot annie a sharp disapproving glance no im not like that either we really had fun me and nick i cant believe hes gone ill miss him so much she dabbed at her eyes im sorry melanie said annie i dont mean to be insensitive or anything but in this job you tend to get a bit cynical when was the last time you saw nick it must have been about two weeks ago a bit over what did you do she gave annie a look what do you think we did before that we had dinner at his place yeah he was a fair chef liked watching all those cooking programs on tv cant stand them myself you ask me what i can make and i say reservations annie had heard it before but she laughed anyway was there anything different about him melanie thought for a moment frowning then she said it was just a feeling i got really i mean id been around him before when he was pitching for a feature it always mattered to him i mean he loved it but this time he was sort of anxious i dont think hed got the green light yet why do you think he was anxious that he wouldnt get the assignment maybe it was partly that but i think it was more that it was personal personal yeah dont ask me why i mean nick was fanatical about all his projects and secretive about the details but i got the sense that this one was a little more personal for him did he tell you what or who he was working on no but he never did i dont know if he thought id tell someone else whod get to it first but like i said he was always secretive until hed finished used to disappear for weeks on end never told me where he was going not that he had any obligation to mind you i mean its not like we were joined at the hip or anything did he say anything at all about it just once that last night she gave a little laugh it was a funny sort of thing to say he said it was a very juicy story and it had everything including murder murder he actually said that melanie started crying again yes she said but i didnt think he meant his own monday th september the mad hatters enderby explained as he negotiated the winding country roads with seeming ease consisted of five members terry watson on rhythm guitar and vocals vic greaves on keyboards and backup vocals reg cooper on lead guitar robin merchant on bass and vocals and adrian pritchard on drums they had formed about three years ago after they met at leeds university and so were considered a local band though only two of them greaves and cooper actually came from yorkshire for the first year or so they played only gigs around the west riding then a london promoter happened to catch one of their shows at a bradford pub and decided theyd fill a niche in the london scene with their unique blend of psychedelic pastoral hold on a minute said a frustrated chadwick what on earth is psychedelic pastoral when its at home enderby smiled indulgently think of alice in wonderland or winnie the pooh set to rock music chadwick winced id rather not go on thats about all sir they caught on got bigger and bigger and now theyve got a bestselling lp out and theyre hobnobbing with rocks élite theyre tipped for even bigger things roger waters from pink floyd was telling me just yesterday in rugby that he thought theyd go far chadwick was already getting tired of enderbys namedropping since the weekend and he wondered if it had been a mistake to send him down to interview the brimleigh festival groups who were appearing in rugby he hadnt even found out anything of interest in two days and reported that there had only been about three hundred people there and he still hadnt got a haircut what the hell does lord jessop have to do with this he asked changing the subject this place does belong to him doesnt it yes hes young rich a bit of a longhair himself he likes the music and he likes to be associated with that world bit of a swinger you might say actually hes away a lot of the time and he lets them use his house and grounds for rest and rehearsals simple as that yes sir chadwick gazed out at the landscape the valley bottom to his left where the river swain meandered between wooded banks and the rising slope of the daleside opposite a haphazard pattern of drystone walls and green fields until about halfway up where the grass turned brown and the rise ended in gray limestone outcrops along the top marking the start of the gorseandheather moorland it was a fine day with only a few high white clouds in the sky even so chadwick felt out of his element it wasnt as if he had never visited the dales before he and janet had had many rides out there when yvonne was younger and he got his first car a reliant threewheeler that rocked dangerously in even the slightest crosswind he wasnt untouched by the beauty of nature but he was still a city boy at heart after a short while the open country did nothing for him except make him miss the damp pavements the noise and bustle and crowds even more if he had his way they would spend their holidays exploring new cities but janet liked the caravan yvonne wouldnt be coming with them for very much longer he thought so he might just be able to persuade janet to take a trip to paris or amsterdam if they could afford it and broaden her horizons janet had never been abroad and chadwick himself had only been on the continent during wartime it would be interesting to revisit some of his old haunts not the beaches battlefields or cemeteries he had no interest in them but the bars cafés and homes where people had opened their doors and hearts and shown their gratitude after liberation here we are sir chadwick snapped out of his reverie as enderby pulled off the narrow track onto the grass is this it he asked it doesnt look like much of a place what he could see of the house beyond its high stone wall and wooden gate was an unremarkable building of limestone with a flagstone roof and three chimneys it was long and low with very few windows all in all a gloomylooking place this is just the back said enderby as they approached the gate it opened into a flagged yard and the path led to a heavy red door with a large brass knocker in the shape of a lions head tradesmans entrance enderby knocked on the door and they waited the silence was oppressive chadwick thought no birds singing even the sound of a rock band rehearsing would have been preferable well on second thought the door opened and a young man of about thirty in a paisley shirt and flared black denim jeans greeted them his chestnut hair wasnt as long as chadwick would have expected but it did hang over his collar you must be the police he said im chris adams the bands manager i dont see how we can help you but please come in enderby and chadwick followed him into a broad paneled hallway with doors leading off to the left and right the dark wood gleamed and chadwick caught a whiff of lemonscented polish at the far end a set of french windows framed a stunning view of the opposite daleside an asymmetrical jumble of fields and drystone walls and below them at the bottom of the slope was the river the doors chadwick noticed as he got closer led out to a terrace with stone balustrades a table complete with umbrella and six chairs stood in front of the doors impressive said chadwick its nice when the weathers good said adams which i cant say is all that often in this part of the world local i grew up in leeds went to school with vic the keyboards player its down here he led them down a flight of stone steps and chadwick realized then that they had entered the house on its highest level and there was a whole other floor beneath at least half of it he noticed as they walked in through the door was taken up by one large room at the moment full of guitars drums keyboard instruments microphones consoles amplifiers speakers and thick snaking electrical cords the rehearsal studio mercifully silent except for the allpervading hum of electricity more french windows these ones open led out to a patio area in the shadow of the terrace above just beyond that across a short stretch of overgrown lawn was a granite and marble swimming pool why anyone would want an outdoor swimming pool in their backyard in yorkshire was beyond chadwick but the rich had their own tastes and the wherewithal to indulge them perhaps it was heated sunlight reflecting from the surface told him the pool was full of water four young men sat around in the large room smoking cigarettes and chatting and laughing with three girls and one lay on a sofa reading on a table by one wall stood a variety of bottles cocacola gin vodka whiskey brandy beer and wine some of the others seemed to have drinks already and adams offered refreshments but chadwick declined he didnt like to feel beholden in any way toward people who might very well be or might soon become suspects everyone was wearing casual clothes mostly jeans and tshirts some tiedyed in the most outrageous patterns and colors very long hair was the norm for both men and women except for adams who seemed a shade more conservative than the rest chadwick was wearing a dark suit and muted tie now that he was here chadwick didnt know exactly where to start adams introduced the band members who all said hello politely and the girls who giggled and retreated to one of the other rooms fortunately one of the group members stepped forward and said how can we help you mr chadwick we heard about what happened at brimleigh its terrible it was robin merchant bass and vocals and clearly the spokesman he was tall and thin and wore jeans and a jacket made of some satiny blue material with zodiac signs embroidered on it i dont know that you can said chadwick sitting down on a folding chair its just that we have information the girl was in the backstage area at some point on sunday evening and were trying to find out if anyone saw her there or talked to her there were a lot of people around said merchant i know that and i also know that things might have been shall we say a wee bit chaotic back there one of the others adrian pritchard the drummer chadwick thought laughed you can say that again it was anarchy man they all laughed even so chadwick said one of you might have seen or heard something important you might not know it what it is but its possible does the tree fall in the woods if no one is there to hear it chimed in the one on the sofa vic greaves keyboard player come again said chadwick greaves stared off into space its a matter of philosophy isnt it how can i know something if i dont know it how can i know that something happens if i dont experience it what vic means said merchant jumping to the rescue is that we were all pretty much focused on what we were doing which was pardon what were you doing well you know said merchant just relaxing in the caravan practicing a few chord changes or maybe having a drink or something talking to guys in the other bands depends what time it was chadwick doubted it most likely he thought they were taking drugs and having sex with groupies but none of them was going to admit that what time did you perform merchant looked to the others for confirmation we went on about eight just after right and we played an hour set so we were off again just after nine after the roadies moved the equipment around and set up the light show pink floyd came on after us about ten then fleetwood mac then led zep and after your set what did you do merchant shrugged we just hung around you know we were pretty wired the adrenaline from performing and everything i mean it went really well a great gig and a big one for us so we needed a couple of drinks to come down i dont know we just listened to the other bands that sort of thing i spent a bit of time in the caravan reading reading what you wouldnt have heard of it try me aleister crowley magick in theory and practice never heard of it said chadwick with a smile merchant gave him a sharp penetrating glance as i said i didnt think you would have done did you stay until the end yeah jesse said we could stay here for the night so we didnt have too far to go jesse sorry lord jessop everyone calls him jesse i see is he here now no hes in france spends quite a bit of his time there down in antibes we saw him last month when we did a tour there in france yeah the albums selling really well there congratulations thanks was lord jessop at brimleigh sure he went down to antibes maybe last tuesday or wednesday all of a sudden a loud violent buzzing noise cut like a chain saw through chadwicks head sorry a sheepish reg cooper lead guitarist apologized feedback he put his guitar down carefully the noise ebbed slowly away boring you am i laddie said chadwick no cooper muttered not at all i said i was sorry accident chadwick held coopers gaze for a moment then turned his attention back to robin merchant lets get back to the eighth of september he said we think the girl was killed between about one oclock and twenty past one in the morning while led zeppelin were playing a song called i cant quit you baby such language came only with difficulty from chadwicks mouth and he noticed some of the others smirk as he spoke the words i understand that theyre very loud he went on ignoring them so its unlikely anybody heard anything if there was anything to hear but were any of you in brimleigh woods at that time the woods said merchant no we didnt go there at all we were backstage up front in the press enclosure or in the caravan all of you all the time chadwick scanned the others faces they all nodded if you go down to the woods today vic greaves intoned in the background why would we go to the woods man said adrian pritchard all the action was backstage what action you know man the birds the shut up adrian said merchant he turned back to chadwick and folded his arms look i know what preconceptions you coppers have of us but were clean you can search the place if you like go on im sure you are said chadwick you knew we were coming but im not interested in drugs not at the moment anyway im more interested in what you were doing when this girl died and in whether any of you saw her or talked to her well i told you said merchant we never went near the woods and how do we know if we saw her or not when none of us knows her name or what she looked like you didnt see the papers we never bother with them full of establishment lies anyway chadwick said reaching for his briefcase i was getting to that as it happens i now have a fairly recent photograph it should interest you he took out the photograph of linda with the members of the mad hatters and passed it to merchant who gasped and stared openmouthed is that vic he passed it to vic greaves who still lay sprawled on a sofa smoking and looking to chadwick quite out of it greaves stirred and took the photo fuck he said fucking hell and the photo slipped out his hands chadwick went over and picked it up standing over greaves who is it he asked you know her sort of said greaves look i dont feel too good rob my head its like snakes and things coming back you know man like i need he turned away merchant stepped forward vics not too well he said the doctor says hes suffering from fatigue and his emotional state is pretty fragile right now this must be a hell of a shock for him why asked chadwick sitting down again he gestured toward the photo that girl its linda linda lofthouse shes vics cousin cousin mrs lofthouse had never mentioned that but why should she he hadnt asked her about the mad hatters and she had probably been in shock still this was a new development worth following chadwick looked at vic greaves with more interest by far the scruffiest of the bunch he looked as if he hadnt shaved in four or five days and his skin was deathly pale as if he never saw the sun his face dotted with angry red spots his dark hair stuck out in tufts as if he had slept on it and not washed or combed it for a week his clothes looked rumpled sleptin too there was a wellthumbed paperback on the sofa beside him called meetings with remarkable men were they particularly close chadwick asked robin merchant no not really i dont think i mean you know just cousins she grew up in leeds and vics family lived in rochdale but we understand she lived in london chadwick said isnt that where you all live now its a big place chadwick took a deep breath mr merchant he said i appreciate that you lads are busy not to mention famous and no doubt wealthy but a young girl has been brutally murdered at a festival in which you were taking part she was seen backstage talking to two of you and now it appears that one of you is also her cousin is there any particular reason mr greaves over there is suffering from fatigue that his emotional state is distressed thats exactly the kind of thing that killing someone might do to you a stunned silence followed chadwicks controlled tirade greaves tossed on the sofa and his book fell to the floor he put his head in his hands and groaned talk to him rob talk to him he said you tell him i cant handle this look said merchant why dont we take a walk outside inspector ill answer all your questions as best i can but cant you see its upsetting vic upsetting vic greaves was not chadwicks main concern but he thought he might be able to get a bit more information out of robin merchant who seemed the most levelheaded of the lot if he did as requested he gestured to enderby to stay with the others and accompanied merchant out to the flagged patio down the slope toward the swimming pool ever use it chadwick asked sometimes merchant answered with a smile for midnight orgies on the two days in august when its warm enough jesse tries to keep it cleaned up but its difficult lord jessop isnt a relation too is he jesse good lord no hes a patron of the arts a friend they stood by the side of the pool looking out across the dale chadwick could see a red tractor making its way across one of the opposite fields toward a tiny farmhouse the hillside was dotted with sheep he glanced down at the swimming pool a few early autumn leaves floated on the waters scummy surface along with a dead sparrow all right mr merchant said chadwick am i to take it youre the leader of the group spokesman we dont believe in leaders very well spokesman that means you can speak for the others to some extent yes its not that they cant speak for themselves but vic as you can see is not exactly a social charmer though hes a great creative force adrian and reg are okay but theyre not especially articulate and terry is way too hip to talk to the fuzz you sound educated ive got a degree if thats what you mean english literature im impressed youre not meant to be its just a piece of paper merchant kicked a couple of loose pebbles with his foot they plopped into the swimming pool can we get this over with i dont mean to be rude or anything but we do have a tour to rehearse for contrary to what a lot of people think rock bands arent just a random collection of layabouts with minimal musical ability and loud amplifiers we take our music seriously and we work hard at it im sure you do i think if i ask you direct simple questions and you answer them straightforwardly well soon be done here how about that fine ask away merchant lit a cigarette was it mr greaves who got the backstage pass for linda lofthouse it was me said merchant why you vics not i mean as you can see he doesnt deal well with rules people in authority stuff like that it intimidates him it was his cousin but he asked me to do it for him so you did yes she would have picked this up where at the entrance to the backstage area from security i assume yes that meant either theyd missed out on questioning the guard who had given linda the pass or he had forgotten or lied about it well chadwick thought people lie often enough to the police they dont want to get involved and theres always that little bit of guilt everybody carries around with them could she come and go as she pleased yes what were you talking about when you were photographed with her just asking if she was having a good time that sort of thing it was very casual we only chatted for a couple of minutes i didnt even know that someone had taken a photo of us was she having a good time so she said was anything bothering her not as far as i could tell what was her state of mind fine just you know normal was she worried about anything frightened by anything no did you talk to her again after the photo was taken later in the evening no see her only around you know from a distance did she have a flower painted on her cheek later merchant paused for a moment then said as a matter of fact she did at least i think it was her there was some bird doing body art in the enclosure well chadwick thought there went one theory still it would be useful to track down the bird if possible and establish for certain whether she had painted the flower on lindas cheek how well did you know linda not well at all id met her in london a couple of times once when we were doing the album she got in touch with vic through his parents and asked if she could sit in on the studio sessions with a friend shes interested in music as a matter of fact we let her play a little acoustic guitar on one track and her and her friend did some harmonies they werent bad at all what friend just another bird i didnt really talk to her did linda ever go out with anyone in the group no come off it mr merchant linda lofthouse was an exceptionally attractive girl or hadnt you noticed theres no shortage of attractive girls in our business anyway she didnt strike me as the sort to take up with a rock musician what do you mean i mean that she seemed like a decent wellbroughtup girl just a little brighter than most and with broader interests than her friends she had a baby so you have to sleep with someone to get pregnant she did it when she was fifteen so how can you tell me that on the strength of two meetings she wasnt that sort of girl call it gut instinct i dont know maybe im wrong she just seemed a nice girl thats all didnt give off that kind of vibe you get to recognize it especially in this business take those three you saw when you came in so linda wasnt going out with anyone in the group no what about the other groups at the festival she might have talked to people but i didnt see her hanging around with anyone in particular for very long what about rick hayes the promoter yeah i saw her with him she said she knew him in london was he her boyfriend i doubt it i mean ricks a good guy dont get me wrong but hes a bit of a loser in that department and they werent acting that way toward one another chadwick made a mental note losers in love often found interesting and violent ways to express their dissatisfaction do you know if she had a boyfriend did she ever mention anyone not that i recall look have you ever thought that it was something else what do you mean they might have thought that it was something other than murder they figure of speech whoever did it youve lost me so i see i dont know im just speculating not everyone sees the world the same way as you do im coming to realize that well you know i mean murder is just a word i can assure you its more than that to me sorry sorry i didnt mean to be offensive but thats you im just trying to show you that other people think differently chadwick was beginning to think he had wandered into a wednesday play desperate to get back to more tenable ground he asked do you know where she lived merchant seemed to come back from a long way off and gather his thoughts before answering in a tired voice she had a room on powis terrace notting hill gate thats what she said that time she came down to the studio anyway you dont know the number no i wouldnt even know the street except when she said notting hill i asked her about it because its a great neighborhood everyone knows notting hill portobello road powis square and all that chadwick remembered portobello road from some leave he had spent in london during the war expensive bloody hell no not for london at any rate its all cheap bedsits you said you met her a couple of times in london when was the other time a gig at the roundhouse last year october i think it was one of the ones rick hayes promoted again she asked vic to get her and a friend backstage passes and he delegated it to me the same friend who sat in on the recording session with her yeah sorry but like i said i didnt talk to her i cant remember her name chadwick stared out across the dale again the tractor had disappeared cloud shadows raced across the fields and limestone outcrops as the breeze picked up not much of a memory have you laddie he said look im sorry if im not sounding helpful said merchant but its the truth linda was never part of the entourage and she wasnt a groupie she got in touch with vic exactly three times over the past two years just to ask for little favors we didnt mind it was no problem she was family after all but thats all there was to it none of us went out with her and none of us really knew her and thats it yes back to last sunday where were you all between one and twenty past one that night merchant flicked his cigarette end into the swimming pool i dont really remember were you with the others listening to led zeppelin some of the time yeah but theyre not really my thing i might have been in the caravan reading or in the beer tent thats not much of an alibi is it i wasnt aware id need one what about the others they were around your manager mr adams was he there chris yeah he was somewhere around but you didnt see him i dont really remember seeing him at any particular time no but i did see him now and then in passing so any one of you could have gone out to the woods with linda lofthouse and stabbed her but nobody had any reason to merchant said we didnt hang out with her didnt really know her i just got the passes for her thats all passes yeah two you didnt say this before you didnt ask who was the other pass for her friend the girl she was with the same one you saw her with at the roundhouse and the recording session the one whose name you cant remember thats the one why didnt you say so earlier merchant shrugged if you got her a pass you must know her name i didnt look at it did you see her later at the festival once or twice were they together the first time i saw them yes later on they werent what do you know about this girl nothing she was a friend of lindas and that they sang together in clubs i think they shared a pad or were neighbors or something what does she look like about the same age as linda long dark hair olive complexion nice figure what time did you last see her i dont know when pink floyd were on it must have been close to midnight and were the two of them together i didnt see linda then no what was this other girl doing just standing around with a group of people drinking and chatting who just people nobody in particular so who was she chadwick wondered and why hadnt she reported her friend missing not for the first time he began to wonder about the mental faculties of the world he was dealing with didnt these people care if someone stole their sleeping bag or worse if someone close to them simply disappeared he didnt expect them to see the world as he did with danger at every turn but surely it was simple common sense to worry unless something had happened to her friend too he wouldnt find that out by hanging around swainsdale lodge he decided and the thought of trying to talk to any of the others again brought on a headache chadwick thanked robin merchant for his time said he would have to talk to vic greaves at some point when he was feeling better then they went back inside enderby looking pleased with himself held out a copy of the mad hatters lp and asked merchant if he would sign it he did the others were slouching in their chairs smoking and sipping drinks reg cooper picking a quiet tune on his guitar vic greaves apparently asleep on his sofa tranquilized to the gills the sound system was buzzing in the background chris adams showed them out apologizing for greaves and promising that if there was anything else they needed they should just get in touch with him gave them his phone number and left them at the door where did you get that chadwick said in the car pointing to the lp he gave it to me the manager i got them all to sign it better hand it over said chadwick you wouldnt want anyone to think youd been accepting bribes would you but sir chadwick held his hand out come on laddie give reluctantly enderby handed over the signed lp chadwick slipped it into his briefcase suppressing a little smile as enderby practically stripped the gears getting back to the road chapter nine the mojo office was a square openplan area on the same floor as q and kerrang magazines accommodating about twenty or so people there were two fairly large windows at one end and two long desks equipped with mac computers in various colors and stacked with cds reference books and file folders cluttered but appealingly so filing cabinets fitted under the desks posters covered the walls mostly blowups of old mojo covers the people banks could see working there ran the whole gamut short hair long hair gray hair shaved heads dress was mostly casual but there were even some ties in evidence nobody paid banks any attention as john butler the editor he had come to see led him to a section of desk close to the window an empty prêt a manger bag sat among the papers on his desk and a whiff of bacon hung in the air reminding banks that it was midafternoon and he was starving he could feel his stomach growling as he sat down john butler looked to be in his late thirties and was one of the more casually dressed people in the office wearing jeans and an old hawkwind tshirt his shaved head gleamed under the strip lighting there was music playing some sixtyish piece with jangling guitars and harmonies banks didnt recognize it but he liked it he could also hear the thumping bass of dance mix coming from round the corner he thought it must be hard to concentrate on writing with all that noise going on its about nick barber said banks i understand he was working on an assignment for you yes thats right poor nick butlers brow crinkled one of the best nobody and i mean nobody knew more about latesixties and earlyseventies music than nick especially the mad hatters hes a great loss to the entire music community its my job to find out who killed him said banks i understand any help i can give of course though i dont see how what was nick barbers assignment he was doing a big feature on the mad hatters said butler more specifically on vic greaves the keyboards player next year is the fortieth anniversary of when the band was formed and theyre reforming for a big concert tour banks had heard of the mad hatters not many people hadnt they had rebuilt themselves from the ashes of the sixties in a way that few other bands had except perhaps fleetwood mac after peter green and pink floyd after syd barrett left but not without tremendous cost as banks recalled where are they now he asked all over the place most of them live in la vic greaves disappeared years ago didnt he banks said thats right nick had found him how did he manage that he protected his sources pretty well but id say most likely through a rental agency or an estate agent he had his contacts vic greaves doesnt go to extraordinary lengths to stay anonymous hes just a recluse and he doesnt advertise his presence i mean hes been found before the problem is that no one can ever get much out of him so they give up except maybe some of the weirdos who see him as a sort of cult figure which is why he guards his privacy to the extent that he does or chris adams does anyway however nick did it you can guarantee it wouldnt be through adams the manager why not adams is very protective of greaves has been ever since the breakdown theyre old friends apparently go back to school days where did nick find greaves in north yorkshire the hatters always had a strong connection with yorkshire through lord jessop and swainsview lodge besides vic and reg cooper the lead guitarist were both local lads met the others at the university of leeds north yorkshire how long has he been living there dunno said butler nick didnt say so the object of nick barbers pilgrimage had been right under his nose all the time and he had never guessed well why would he if you wanted to live as a hermit in the dales it could be done now banks had a glimmer of a memory something that he might have guessed brought nick barber to swainsdale help me here he said i didnt grow up in the area and i wasnt there at the time but as far as i can remember there was some other connection with the group wasnt there robin merchant the bass player he drowned didnt he indeed he did drowned in a swimming pool about a year after brian jones did exactly the same thing june tragic business and that swimming pool was at swainsview lodge said banks now i remember he was surprised at himself for not getting the connection earlier but when it came down to it although he knew that brian jones had also died in a swimming pool he didnt know where that pool was either to him a swimming pool was a swimming pool but nick barber would know things like that just the way sports fans knew their teams scores statistics and greatest players going back years swainsview lodge has been empty for a few years now banks said ever since lord jessop died of aids in there were no heirs and nobody wanted the old pile of stone banks remembered it cost too much to keep up for a start and it needed a lot of work a couple of hotel chains had shown a brief interest but the footandmouth business had soon scared them off and there was at one time talk of the lodge being converted into a convention center but nothing had come of it tell me more about nick barber he said not much to tell really said butler how did he get into the business according to his parents he had no training in journalism this might sound a bit odd to you but journalistic training is rarely encouraged in this line of work too many bad habits naturally we require writing ability but we judge that for ourselves what counts most is love of the music that would suit banks right down to the ground he thought if only he could write and nick barber had that in spades and he had indepth knowledge on all sorts of genres too including jazz and some classical like i said a remarkable mind and a tragic loss how long had he been writing for you about seven or eight years on and off and his interest in the mad hatters the last five years or so he seemed to live quite frugally from what ive seen nobody said music journalism pays well but there are a lot of fringe benefits drugs i didnt mean that backstage passes to concerts rubbing shoulders with the rock aristocracy a bit of cachet with the girls that sort of thing i think id rather have an extra hundred quid a week said banks well i suppose thats one reason why this business isnt for you fair enough why didnt he have a job on staff didnt want one wed have taken him on like a shot as would the competition but nick wanted to keep his independence he liked being a freelancer to be quite frank some people just dont function at their best in an office environment and i think nick was one of them he liked the freedom to roam but he always delivered on deadline banks understood what butler was talking about wasnt that pretty much what detective superintendent gervaise had said about him that very morning stay out of the office but bring me results how did he get the assignment he pitched for it funnily enough wed just had our monthly meeting and decided we wanted to do something on the hatters anniversaries reunion tours and things like that are usually a good excuse for a reappraisal or a new revelation so he rang you yes just when we were about to ring him hed written about them before only brief pieces and reviews but insightful look i can give you a few back copies if youd like so you can see the kind of thing he did id appreciate that said banks who knew that he had probably read some of barbers pieces in the past but he didnt keep his back issues of mojo the pile just got too high what was the next step we had a couple of meetings to sharpen things up and came up with a tight brief a focus for the piece which was to be vic greaves yes hes always been the key figure the mystery man troubled genius and all that and the timing of his leaving couldnt have been worse for the band robin merchant had just drowned and they were falling apart if it hadnt been for chris adams they might have done nick was hoping to get an exclusive interview that would have been a real scoop if he could have got greaves to talk he also wanted to do something on their early gigs before merchant died and greaves left contrast their style with the later works how long would it take barber to write a feature like that anything from two to five months theres a lot of background research for a start a lot of history to sift through a lot of people to talk to and its not always easy you also have to sort out the truth from the apocrypha and that can be really difficult you know what they say about the sixties and memory what they dont say is that if people cant remember it they make it up but nick was nothing if not thorough he was a fine writer he checked all his facts and his sources twice theres not a mad hatters gig hed leave unexamined not a university newspaper review he wouldnt dig up not an obscure bside he wouldnt listen to a hundred times how far had he got hardly begun hed spent a week or two driving around making phone calls checking out old venues that sort of thing i mean a lot of the places the original hatters played dont even exist anymore and he might have done a bit of general background you know browsed over a few old reviews in the newspaper archives at the british library but he planned to get started on the main story up in yorkshire hed only been there a week when well you know what happened had he sent in any reports no id spoken to him on the phone a couple of times thats all apparently he had to go into a public telephone box over the road to ring when he was in yorkshire he didnt have any mobile signal up there i know said banks how did he sound he was excited but he was also very cagey a story like this i mean if nick could really get vic greaves to open up about the past well if someone else got wind of it you can imagine what that would mean ours can be a bit of a cutthroat business we really need to know where vic greaves lives said banks i understand that and if i knew his address id tell you nick mentioned a village called lyndgarth in north yorkshire ive never heard of it but apparently its near eastvale if thats any help thats all i know banks knew that he ought to be able to find vic greaves in lyndgarth easily enough i know it he said its very close to where nick was staying walking distance in fact do you happen to know if he had already spoken to greaves once and it didnt go well according to nick greaves freaked out refused to talk as usual sent him packing to be honest i very much doubt youll get any sense out of him whats wrong with him nobody knows he went strange thats all has been for years when did nick talk to him he didnt say sometime last week what day did he phone you friday friday morning what was he going to do talk to greaves again work out a different approach nick was good hed simply tested the waters hed have found something to catch greavess interest some common ground and hed have taken it from there have you any idea banks asked why this story should have cost nick barber his life none at all said butler spreading his hands i still cant really believe that it did i mean maybe what happened was nothing to do with the hatters have you considered that maybe it was an irate husband bit of a swordsman was our nick any husband in particular who might have wanted him dead recently not that i know of he never seemed to stick with anyone for long especially if they started to get clingy he liked his independence and the music always got in the way most of our guys live alone in flats when you get right down to it theyd rather be ferreting out old vinyl on berwick street than go out with a girl theyre loners obsessed so nick barber would love em and leave em something like that maybe it was an irate girlfriend then butler laughed uneasily banks thought of kelly soames again but he didnt think she had killed nick barber and not only because of the discrepancy in timing there was still her father though calvin soames he had disappeared from the pub for fifteen minutes and nobody had seen him return to his farm in lyndgarth to check the gas ring admittedly it was a bad night and the farm was off the beaten track but it was still worth further consideration the question was had soames been hiding the fact that he knew about barber and kelly banks couldnt tell and if he had done it why take all barbers stuff when it came right down to it though banks had a gut feeling that it was the mad hatters story that got barber killed he had no idea why unless you were a soul or a rap artist music was generally a murderfree profession and it was a bit of a stretch to imagine aging hippies going around bashing people over the head with pokers but there it was nick barber had headed to yorkshire in search of a reclusive exrock star had found him and within days he had turned up dead all his notes mobile phone and laptop computer missing banks thanked butler for his time and said he might be back with more questions butler accompanied him back to the lift stopping to pick out some back issues for him on the way banks walked out onto busy oxford street a little more enlightened than when he had entered mappin house he noticed that he was standing right outside hmv so he went inside monday th september the mood in the grove was subdued that monday evening somebody had turned out all the electric lights and put candles on every table yvonne sat at the back of the small room near the door with steve julie and a bunch of others mcgarrity was there though thankfully not sitting with them at one point he took the stage and recited a t s eliot poem that was typical of him yvonne thought he dismissed everybody elses poetry but didnt even have the creativity to make up his own there was a bit of talk about a concert in toronto that saturday where john lennon and yoko had turned up to play with some legendary rock n roll stars and some desultory conversation about the los angeles murders but mostly people seemed to have turned in on themselves they had known the previous monday that something had happened at brimleigh of course but now it was all over the place and the victims name had been in that mornings paper and on the evening news many people had known her at least by name or by sight yvonne was still stunned by the signed mad hatters lp her father had given her before she went out that evening she couldnt imagine him even being in the same room as such a fantastic band let alone asking them to sign a copy of their lp but he was full of surprises these days maybe there was hope for him yet mcgarritys eliot travesty aside most of the evening was given over to local folksingers a plump shorthaired girl in jeans and a tshirt sang she walks through the fair and farewell farewell a curlyhaired troubadour with a gap between his front teeth sang the trees they do grow high and needle of death followed by a clutch of early bob dylan songs there was a somber tone to it all and yvonne knew although it was never said that this was a farewell concert for linda other people in the place had known her far better than yvonne had in fact she had sung there on more than one occasion when she visited her friends in leeds everybody had looked forward to her visits yvonne wished she could be like that the kind of person who had such a radiant spiritual quality that people were drawn to her but she also couldnt forget that someone had been drawn to kill her she remembered the photograph that had slipped out of her fathers briefcase linda with an expressionless face and eyes the pathetic little cornflower on her cheek linda not at home dead linda just a shell her spirit soared off into the light she felt herself well up with tears as she thought her thoughts and listened to the sad songs of long ago ballads of murder and betrayal of supernatural lovers metamorphoses disasters at sea and wasted youth she wasnt supposed to drink but she could easily pass for eighteen in the grove and steve brought her drinks like babycham pony and cherry b after a while she started to feel lightheaded and sick she made her way to the toilet and forced her finger down her throat that helped when she had finished she rinsed her mouth out washed her face and lit a cigarette she didnt look too bad on her way out she had to squeeze past mcgarrity in the narrow corridor and the look of cruel amusement on his face at her obvious discomfort frightened her he paused pressed up against her breasts ran one dirty nailbitten finger down her cheek and whispered her name it made her shiver when she got back to steve and the others it was intermission she hadnt brought up the subject of linda with steve yet partly because she was afraid that he might have slept with her and that would make yvonne jealous it shouldnt jealousy was a negative emotion steve always said to be cast aside but she couldnt help it linda was so perfect and beside her yvonne felt like a naive awkward schoolgirl finally she made herself do it did you know linda well she asked him as casually as possible steve rolled a cigarette from his old holborn tin before answering not really he said shed gone before i came on the scene i only saw her a couple of times when she came up from london and stayed at denniss bayswater terrace is that where she lived yeah before she went to london with dennis no not with him just at his pad man steve gave her a puzzled look what does it matter anyway shes dead now we have to let go yvonne felt flustered it doesnt it i mean i only met her once myself and i liked her thats all everybody loved linda not everybody obviously what do you mean well somebody murdered her that doesnt mean he didnt love her i dont understand steve stroked her arm its a complicated world von and people do things for many reasons often reasons we dont understand reasons they dont even understand themselves all im saying is that whoever did it didnt necessarily do it from hatred or jealousy or envy or one of those other negative emotions it might have been from love or an act of kindness sometimes you have to destroy the thing you love the most its not for us to question yvonne hated it when he talked down to her like that as if she were indeed a silly schoolgirl who just didnt get it but she didnt get it to her linda had been murdered no amount of talk about killing for love or kindness made any sense perhaps it was because she was a policemans daughter she thought in which case she had better stop sounding like one or they would be onto her in a flash youre right she said its not for us to question and the second half of the evening started she could see mcgarrity through the crowds a dark shadow hunched in the candlelight just to the right of the stage area and she thought he was staring at her then a young man with long blond hair climbed on the tiny stage and began to sing polly on the shore in a booth in a noisy and smoky italian restaurant on frith street banks and annie shared fizzy water and a bottle of the house red as banks tucked into his veal marsala and annie her pasta primavera outside darkness had fallen and the streets and pubs and restaurants of soho were filling up as people finished work or arrived in the west end for an evening out red and purple lights reflected in the sheen of rain on the pavements and road youve got a lot of explaining to do annie said fixing her hair behind her ears so it didnt get in her mouth while she ate about what said banks this mad hatters business i hardly understood a word of what you were talking about before dinner its not my fault if your cultural education is severely lacking said banks put it down to my callow youth and explain in words of one syllable youve never heard of the mad hatters of course i have ive even seen them on jonathan ross thats not the point i just dont happen to know their entire bloody history thats all they got big in the late sixties around the same time as led zeppelin a bit after pink floyd and the who their music was different it had elements of folkrock the byrds and fairport convention but they gave a sort of psychedelic twist to it at first anyway think eight miles high meets sir patrick spens annie made a face i would if i knew what either of those sounded like i give up said banks anyway a lot of their sound and style was down to the keyboards player vic greaves the bloke we were talking about who now lives in lyndgarth and the lead guitarist reg cooper another yorkshire lad vic greaves was the keyboards player yeah he was a bit of a keith emerson got amazing sounds out of his organ annie raised her eyebrows the mind boggles they had light shows did long guitar solos wore funny floppy hats and purple velvet trousers gold caftans and they did all that other sixties psychedelic stuff anyway in june not long after their second album hit the charts the bass player robin merchant drowned in lord jessops swimming pool at swainsview lodge our swainsview lodge the one and only was there an investigation i should imagine so said banks thats something well have to dig up when we get back to eastvale there should be files in the basement somewhere wonderful said annie last time i went down there i was sneezing for a week dont worry well send kev annie smiled she could imagine templetons reaction to that especially since he had become puffed up to an almost unbearable level since his promotion maybe your folksinger friend will know something she asked penny cartwright said banks remembering his last unsatisfactory encounter with penny on the banks of the river swain one summer evening it was all long before her time besides shes gone away again america this time what happened to the mad hatters they got another bass player and what about vic greaves hed been a problem for a long time he was unpredictable sometimes he didnt show up for gigs hed walk offstage he got violent with other band members with his girlfriends they say there were times he just sat there staring into space too stoned to play naturally there were stories about the huge quantities of lsd he consumed not to mention other drugs he wrote a lot of their early songs and some of the lyrics are very well druginduced trippy i suppose youd say the rest of the band were a bit more practical and ambitious and they didnt know what to do about him but in the end they didnt have to worry he disappeared for a month in late september i think and when they found him again he was living rough in the countryside like a tramp he wanted nothing more to do with the music business been a hermit ever since did nobody do anything for him like what help him get psychiatric help for a start different times annie there was a lot of distrust of conventional psychiatry at the time you had weirdos like r d laing running around talking about the politics of insanity and quoting william blake blake was a visionary said annie a poet and an artist he didnt take drugs i know that im just trying to explain the prevalent attitudes as i understand them look when everyone is weird just how weird do you have to be to get noticed id say staring into space when youre supposed to be playing keyboards is a pretty good place to start not to mention beating up your girlfriend i agree theres no excuse for violence but people still turn a blind eye even the victims themselves sometimes and there was a lot of tolerance within the community for drug consumption bad trips and suchlike as for the rest odd behavior especially onstage might just have been regarded as nonconformist or avantgarde theatrics they say that syd barrett from pink floyd once put a whole jar of brylcreem on his head before a performance and during the show it melted and dripped down his face people thought it was some sort of artistic statement not a symptom of insanity dont forget there were so many weird influences at play dadaism surrealism nihilism if john cage could write four minutes and thirtythree seconds of silence whos to say greaves wasnt doing something similar by not playing you ought to know this given your bohemian background did nobody at your dads place ever paint a blank canvas i was just a kid said annie but i do remember we had more than our fair share of freaks around my dad always used to protect me from them though youd be surprised in some ways how conservative my upbringing was they went out of their way to instill normal values in me it was as if they didnt want me to be too different like them they probably didnt want you to be singled out and picked on at school ha then it didnt help the other kids still thought i was a freak how did the mad hatters survive all this their manager chris adams pulled it all together he brought a replacement in fiddled with the bands sound and image a bit and wham they were off how did he change them instead of another keyboards player he brought in a female vocalist their sound became a bit more commercial more pop without losing its sixties edge entirely they just got rid of that juvenile psychedelia thats probably the way you remember them the nice harmonies anyway the rest is history they conquered america became a big stadium band youth anthems and all that by the time they released their fourth album in they were megastars not all their new fans were aware of their early roots but then not everyone knows that fleetwood mac was a decent blues band before stevie nicks and rhiannon and all that crap hey watch what youre calling crap i happen to like rhiannon banks smiled sorry he said i should have known snob anyway thats the mad hatters story and you say the girlfriend melanie wright melanie wright said that nick thought hed got his teeth into a juicy story and that she felt it was somehow personal to him yes and he mentioned murder dont forget that i havent said banks whose murder did he mean at a guess from what youve just told me id say robin merchants wouldnt you tuesday th september i want to apologize to you about that mad hatters lp chadwick said to ds enderby over a late breakfast in the canteen on tuesday morning geoff broome had come up with an address on bayswater terrace enderby had driven down from brimleigh and they were fortifying themselves with bacon and eggs before the visit its all right sir said enderby i got pink floyd to sign my copy of more last weekend as a matter of fact the mad hatters and even floyd arent really my cup of tea im actually more of a blues man myself blues howlin wolf muddy waters chicken shack john mayall right said chadwick still no wiser anyway i am sorry it was wrong of me you were probably right though about not being seen accepting gifts well id feel a bit better about saying that if i hadnt gone and given it to my daughter you did what sir chadwick looked away i gave it to my daughter a few bridges to build you know enderby burst out laughing im sorry sir he said what did she say she seemed a bit shocked but she was very grateful i hope she enjoys it she will she likes them and again you know dont worry about it sir probably the best use for it im only glad i didnt get them to sign it to me look enderby about these young people you seem to take them in your stride but they stick in my craw id noticed that sir its just a matter of perspective but i dont understand them at all theyre just kids mostly having a good time some of them are political and that can become violent if they mix with the wrong types and now that unscrupulous dealers have moved in on the drugs trade that can be dangerous too a lot of them are confused by the world and theyre looking for answers maybe we think theyre looking in all the wrong places but theyre looking whats so wrong with wanting peace in the world nothing but most of them come from decent homes have parents who love them why on earth do they want to run off and live in filthy squats and squalid bedsits you really dont get it do you sir thats why im asking you dammit freedom you know yourself how parents often disapprove of what their kids do and prevent them from doing it these kids dont mind a bit of dirt and mess as long as they can come and go as they please but what about the drugs the sex thats what they want i mean they couldnt smoke pot and have sex if they lived with their parents could they chadwick shook his head its more than that though enderby went on especially in the north a lot of kids girls like linda lofthouse for example they see a pretty bleak future waiting for them marriage babies dirty nappies washing cooking a life of drudgery slavery even it can look a lot like a prison if youve got a bit of imagination and intelligence as it seems she had and for the blokes its not that much different same boring job at the factory day in day out down at the same old pub with your same old cronies night after night footie on saturdays telly most nights if they catch a glimpse of something else if theyve got a bit about them you can see how it might appeal an escape perhaps something new something different but marriage and family are the cornerstones of our civilization i know that sir im just trying to answer your question put myself in their shoes marriage and family are our traditional values a lot of kids today argue against them say thats why the worlds in the trouble its in war famine greed and girls these days think there ought to be more for them in life they want to work for example and get paid as much as men for doing the same job theyll be after our jobs before long i wouldnt be too surprised sir freedom eh said chadwick is that what its all about i think so sir a lot of it at any rate freedom to think what you want and do what you want the rest is just trappings icing on the cake but what about responsibility what about consequences theyre young sir indestructible and immortal they dont worry too much about those sorts of things i thought freedom was what i was fighting for in the war it was sir and we won and this is the result enderby shrugged all right said chadwick i take your point well just have to live with it then wont we another fried slice dont mind if i do sir chapter ten tuesday th september it was raining when chadwick and enderby paid their visit to bayswater terrace and the rows of slateroofed redbrick houses looked suitably gloomy di broome had found the number of the house they wanted easily enough it wasnt known as a drug house especially though broome had no doubt that drugs were consumed there but the police had been looking for a dealer who had slipped through their net a few months ago and they had visited all his possible known haunts including this house rented by a dennis nokes since early according to their information the occupancy turnover was pretty high and included students hippies and general layabouts nokes described himself as a student and a musician but as far as anyone knew he was on the dole after the previous days exhausting session with the mad hatters chadwick wasnt looking forward to the interview he also hadnt been certain when was the best time to call to find somebody home in the end he decided it didnt matter so they went around lunchtime either these people didnt work or they were students and the university term hadnt started yet so the odds were that someone would be there at almost any time of the day or night chadwick could hear the sound of a solo acoustic guitar coming from inside the house which was encouraging it stopped when enderby knocked on the door and they could hear someone shuffling down the hall it turned out to be a young girl surely no older than yvonne wearing only a long grubby white tshirt with a target on the front which hardly covered her bare thighs the top did nothing much to hide her breasts either as she clearly wasnt wearing a bra police enderby said they showed their warrant cards and introduced themselves she didnt looked scared or nervous merely puzzled police yeah right okay come in then and she stood aside when they were all inside the hall she reached her arms in the air pulling the tshirt up even higher and yawned as he averted his gaze chadwick could see that enderby made no effort to do likewise that he was gazing with open admiration at her exposed thighs and pubic hair you woke me up the girl said i was having a nice dream who is it julie came a voice from upstairs followed by a young man peering down from the landing a guitar in his hand police said julie okay right just a minute there was a short pause while the young man disappeared back into his room then visited the toilet chadwick thought he could hear the sound of a few quids worth of marijuana flushing down the bowl if hed been drugs squad the young lad wouldnt have stood a chance when he came down he was without his guitar what can i do for you he asked are you dennis nokes yes wed like to talk to you is there somewhere we can go nokes gestured toward the rear kitchen julies crashing in the front room go back to bed julie its okay ill take care of it chadwick could just about make out a sleeping bag or a pile of blankets on the floor before the door closed the kitchen was cleaner than chadwick would have expected but janet would definitely have turned her nose up and gone at it with the ajax and domestos the chairs were covered with some sort of red plastic material that had cracked and lined like parchment over time and the table with a redandwhitechecked oilcloth and on it lay a magazine called oz with a photograph of a white man embracing a naked black man on the cover beside that stood an open jar of orange marmalade rim encrusted with dried syrup a halfwrapped slab of lurpak butter and some bread crumbs nearby were a bottle of camp coffee salt and pepper shakers a packet of cocoa krispies and a halfempty bottle of milk not to mention the overflowing ashtray to which dennis nokes by the looks of it was soon to add they sat down and enderby took out his notebook and pen its only tobacco nokes said as he rolled a cigarette he had a tangle of curly dark hair and finely chiseled almost pixieish features and he wore an opennecked blue shirt with jeans and sandals a necklace of tiny differentcolored beads hung around his neck and a silver bracelet engraved with various occult symbols encircled his left wrist it had better be chadwick said pity you had to flush everything you had down the toilet when thats not what i came about it only lasted a moment but chadwick noticed the look of annoyance that flashed across nokess features before the practiced shrug ive got nothing to hide from the fuzz while were talking said chadwick lets agree on a few ground rules its not fuzz or pigs its di chadwick and ds enderby okay whatever you want nokes agreed lighting the cigarette right im glad weve got that out of the way now lets get to the real subject of our visit linda lofthouse linda yes i assume youve heard the news bummer man said nokes i was trying to write a song for her when you guys arrived its okay i mean im not blaming you for interrupting me or anything it wasnt going very well sorry to hear that said chadwick i dont suppose you thought for a moment to come forward with information why man i havent seen linda in a while when was the last time summer july i think same time rick was up rick rick hayes man he put on the festival was he with linda lofthouse in july not with her just here at the same time did they know one another well theyd met i think lindas cousins vic greaves you know the keyboard player in the mad hatters and rick promoted some of their gigs in london were they going out together no way man nokes laughed linda and rick you must be joking she was way out of his league i thought he made plenty of money from the concerts its not about money man is that all you people ever think of so what was it about it was a spiritual thing linda was an old soul spiritually she was lifetimes ahead of rick i see said chadwick but they were here at the same time yes that time linda crashed here but rick was staying in some hotel in town didnt stop him trying to pick up some bird to take back with him but he ended up going alone why was he here i used to know him a few years ago when i lived in london were sort of old mates i suppose anyway hed come up to check out something at brimleigh glen for the festival so he dropped by to see me chadwick filed all that information away for his next talk with rick hayes who was proving to be even more of a liar than he had at first appeared to be you say linda hasnt been here since july thats right have you seen her since then no were you at brimleigh of course rick scored us some free tickets did you see her there no where were you between one and onetwenty on sunday night how do you expect me to remember that led zeppelin had just started if that refreshes your memory yeah right i sat through the whole set in the same place we were in the middle quite near the front we got there early on friday and staked out a good space who was with you nokes nodded toward the front room julie there and the others from the house there were five of us in all ill need names sure there was me julie martin rob and cathy full names please sir ds enderby interrupted nokes gave him a pitying look and told him are any of the others at home now chadwick asked only julie well send someone over later to take statements now about linda did she stay here around the time of the festival no she knows shes welcome here anytime she wants man she doesnt have to ask just turn up but i dont know where she was staying maybe in a tent or out on the field or something maybe she was with someone maybe they had a car i dont know man all i know is this is freaking me out stay calm mr nokes try a few deep breaths i hear it works wonders nokes glared at him youre taking the piss not at all this is very upsetting what that linda was murdered or that youre being questioned nokes ran the end of his index finger over some grains of salt on the tablecloth all of it man its just so heavy youre laying a real trip on us and youre way off course were into making love not killing his whiny voice was starting to grate on chadwick tell me about linda what about her when did you first meet couple of years ago not long after i moved here may june around then and you came up from london yeah i was living down there until early id seen the sort of stuff that was happening and thought i could make some of it happen up here those were really exciting times great music poetry readings light shows happenings revolution was in the air man back to linda how did you meet in town in a record shop we were both looking through the folk section and we just got talking she was so alone i mean she was changing but she didnt know it trying to find herself didnt know how to go about it like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly know what i mean so you helped her to find herself i invited her around here from time to time i gave her a few books leary gurdjieff alan watts played music for her we talked a lot did you sleep with her no way she was six months pregnant drugs of course not how long did she stay here not very long after shed had the baby she came here for a while maybe a month or two the winter of then she went to london early in after that shed crash here when she was up visiting what did she do what do you mean work earn a living did she have a job oh that shit well she didnt when i first met her of course she was still living with her parents then the baby anyway she made really beautiful jewelry but i dont think she got much money for it gave most of it away clothes too she could fix anything and make a shirt from any old scraps of material she was into fashion too did some of her own designs so how did she make money she worked in a shop biba its pretty well known they just moved to kensington high street do a lot of s nostalgia stuff you know the sort of thing all floppy hats ostrich feathers and long satin dresses in plum and pink do you happen to know her address in london nokes gave him an address in notting hill did she live alone or share alone but she had a good friend living in the same house across the hall came up here with linda once or twice american girl her names tania hutchison what does she look like like a dream i mean shes like a negative image of linda man but just as beautiful in her own way shes got long dark hair really long you know and she has a dark complexion like shes half mexican or something and white teeth but all americans have white teeth dont they it sounded like the girl robin merchant had described so what if anything did this tania hutchison have to do with linda lofthouses murder there was nothing more to be got from dennis nokes so chadwick gave enderby the signal to wrap up the interview he would send someone to talk to the others later he didnt really think that nokes and his pals had had anything to do with linda lofthouses murder but now he at least knew where she had been living and this tania woman might be able to tell him something about lindas recent life and death before heading to interview vic greaves the following day banks first called at swainsview lodge out of curiosity to soak up the atmosphere he got the keys from the estate agent who told him they had kept the place locked up tight since there had been reports from local farmers of someone breaking in she thought it was probably just kids but the last thing they needed she said was squatters or travelers taking occupation of the place entering the cold and drafty hallway banks felt as if he were entering one of those creepy mansions from the old roger corman films of poe stories the fall of the house of usher or something the long wainscoted hallway had paneled doors opening off each side and there were obvious spaces on the walls where paintings had once hung banks tried some of the doors and found they opened to empty rooms in varied states of disrepair bits of ceiling had crumbled and a veneer of plaster dust lay over everything banks kicked clouds of it up as he walked and it made him cough made his mouth dry at the end of the hall a motheaten dusty old curtain covered french windows banks fiddled for the key and opened them they led out to a broad empty balcony banks walked out and leaned against the cool stone of the balustrade to admire the view below him lay the empty graniteandmarble swimming pool its dark bottom clogged with weeds lichen and rubbish lower down the hillside the trees on the banks of the river swain were red and brown and yellow some of the leaves blew off and swirled in the wind as banks watched sheep grazed in the fields of the opposite daleside dots of white on green among the irregular patterns of drystone walls the clouds were so low they grazed the limestone outcrops along the top and shrouded the upper moorland in mist wrapping his arms around himself against the autumn chill banks went back inside the building and headed downstairs to the lower level where he found himself in a cavernous room that he guessed must have been used as the recording studio so this was where the mad hatters had recorded their breakthrough second album during the winter of and several others over the years there was no equipment left of course but there were still a few strips of wire lying around along with a broken drumstick and what looked like a guitar string banks strained but could hear no echoes of events or music long past he unlocked the doors and walked out to the edge of the swimming pool there was broken glass on the courtyard and bottles and cans at the bottom of the pool where it sloped down to the deep end banks saw what the estate agent meant and guessed that local kids must have climbed the wall and had a party he wondered if they knew the houses history maybe they were celebrating robin merchant the way the kids flocked to jim morrisons tomb in the pèrelachaise cemetery in paris banks doubted it he thought he heard a sound behind him in the abandoned recording studio and turned in time to see a mouse skitter through the dust he tried to imagine the scene on that summer night thirtyfive years ago there would have been music and probably lights strung up outside around the pool incense drugs of course and alcohol too by the early seventies booze was coming back in fashion among the younger generation there would also have been girls half undressed or more perhaps laughing dancing making love and when everyone was sated robin merchant had well what had happened banks didnt know yet kev templeton was still in the basement of western area headquarters going through the archives a gust of wind rattled the open door and banks went back inside there was nothing for him here except ghosts lord jessop was dead of aids poor sod and robin merchant had drowned in the swimming pool the rest of the mad hatters were still very much alive though and vic greaves was around somewhere if he would talk if he could talk banks didnt know exactly what the official diagnosis was only that everyone claimed hed taken too much acid and gone over the top well in a short while with a little skill and a little luck he would find out wednesday th september it was a long time since chadwick had walked along the portobello road wartime in fact one of the times he had been back on leave between assignments he was sure the street had been narrower then and there had been sandbags blackout curtains empty shop windows rubble from bomb damage the smell of ash fractured gas lines and sewage pipes now the biggest mess was caused by construction on the westway an overhead motorway that was almost completed and most of the smells were exotic spices that took him back to his days in india and burma chadwick had taken the afternoon train down to kings cross a journey of about five hours now it was early evening the market had closed for the day the stallholders had packed up their wares and gone to one of the many local pubs outside the duke of wellington a fireeater entertained a small crowd the atmosphere was lively the people young and colorful in brightly printed fabrics flared jeans with flowers embroidered on them or gold lamé caftans some of the girls were wearing oldfashioned widebrimmed hats and long dresses trailing around their ankles there were quite a few west indians wandering the street too some also in bright clothes with beards and fuzzy hairdos chadwick was sure he could smell marijuana in the air he was also sure he looked quite out of place in his navy blue suit although there were one or two business types mingling with the crowds according to his map there were quicker ways of getting to powis terrace than from the notting hill underground station but out of interest he had wanted to wander up and down portobello road he had heard so much about it from the notting hill race riots of over ten years ago to the notorious slum landlord peter rachman connected to both the kray twins and the profumo affair of the area had history now the street was full of chic boutiques hairdressers and antique shops with brightpainted facades there was even a local fleapit called the electric cinema showing a double bill of easy rider and girl on a motorcycle one shop alices antiques sold edwardian policemens capes and for a moment chadwick was tempted to buy one but he knew he wouldnt wear it it would just hang at the back of his wardrobe until the moths got at it chadwick turned down colville terrace and finally found the street he was looking for at the end of the block someone had drawn graffiti depicting che guevara and underneath the bearded face and beret were the words long live the revolution in red paint imitating dripping blood the terraced houses once majestic fourstory georgianstyle stucco were now dirty white with stained and graffiticovered facades the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom and crime is the highest form of sensuality rubbish littered the street each house had a low black metal railing and gate which led down murky stone steps to the basement flat the broad stairs leading up to the front door were flanked by two columns supporting a portico most of the doors looked badly in need of a paint job chadwick had heard that the houses were all divided into a warren of bedsits there were several names listed beside the intercom at the house he wanted chadwick had timed his visit for early evening thinking that might be the best time to find tania hutchison at home the problem was that he didnt want her to be warned of his visit if she had had anything to do with lindas murder then there was a chance she would scarper the minute she heard his voice he needed another way in tanias flat he noted was number eight he wondered how securityconscious the other tenants were if drugs were involved probably very though if someone was under the influence he decided to start with the ground floor and after getting no answer went on up the list finally he was rewarded by a bad connection with an incomprehensible young man in flat five who actually buzzed the door open the smell of cats piss and onions was almost overwhelming the floor was covered with drab cracked lino and the stair carpet was threadbare if it had had a pattern once it was indiscernible from the dull gray background now the walls were also bare apart from a few telephone numbers scribbled around the shared pay phone out of habit chadwick made a note of them now he just had to find number eight it wasnt on the ground floor nor the first but on the second floor facing the front that landing had another shared pay phone and again chadwick copied down the numbers it smelled a little better up here mostly due to the burning incense coming from one of the rooms but the bulb was bare and cast a thankfully weak light on the shabby decor chadwick could hear soft music coming from inside number eight guitars and flutes and some sort of oriental percussion a good sign he tapped on the door a few moments later it opened on the chain he wasnt in yet but he was close are you tania hutchison he asked im tania she said who wants to know chadwick thought he detected an american accent only a thin strip of her face showed but he could see what dennis nokes had meant about her good looks im detective inspector chadwick he said holding up his warrant card its about linda lofthouse linda of course do you mind if i come in she looked at him for a moment he could see only one eye and he sensed she was calculating what was her best option in the end the door shut and when it opened again it opened all the way all right she said chadwick followed her into an lshaped room the smaller part of which was taken up with a tiny kitchen the rest was sparsely furnished perhaps because there was so little space there was no carpet on the floor only old wood a mattress covered in red cheesecloth and scattered with cushions sat against one wall and in front of that stood a low glass table holding a vase of flowers a copy of the evening standard an ashtray and a book called the glass bead game by hermann hesse chadwick had never heard of hermann hesse but he had the feeling he would be safer sticking to dick francis alistair maclean and desmond bagley an acoustic guitar leaned against one wall tania stretched out on the mattress leaning against the wall and chadwick grabbed one of the hardbacked kitchen chairs the room seemed clean and bright with a colorful abstract painting on the wall and a little light coming in through the sash window but there was no disguising the essential decrepitude of the house and neighborhood the woman was as dennis nokes and robin merchant had described her petite attractive with white teeth and glossy dark hair down to her waist she was wearing flared jeans and a thin cotton blouse that left little to the imagination she reached for a packet of pall mall filtertipped and lit one i just found out yesterday she said blowing out smoke about linda how the newspaper ive been away how long nine days it made sense chadwick had only discovered linda lofthouses identity from carol wilkinson on saturday so it hadnt really hit the papers and other news media until monday and now it was wednesday ten days since the brimleigh festival had ended and the body was discovered looking at tania he could see that she had been crying the tears had dried and crusted on her flawless olive skin and her big green eyes were glassy where were you chadwick asked in france with my boyfriend hes studying in paris the sorbonne i just got back yesterday i assume we could check that go ahead she gave him a name and a telephone number in paris it wasnt much use to chadwick the guy was her boyfriend after all and he would probably swear black was white for her but he had to go through the motions you were at brimleigh though sure thats what i want to talk about tania blew out some smoke and reached for the ashtray on the table cradling it on her lap between her crossed legs what happened there chadwick went on what do you mean what happened there lots of things happened there it was a festival a celebration of what youth music life love peace things you wouldnt understand oh i dont know said chadwick i was young once he was getting used to being criticized by these people for being old and square and as it didnt bother him in the least it seemed easier just to brush it aside with a glib comment like water off a ducks back what he still didnt understand though despite enderbys explanation was why intelligent young people from good homes wanted to come to places like this and live in squalor probably hardly eating a healthy meal from one day to the next were all the sex and drugs you wanted worth such a miserable existence tania managed a little smile it was different then you can say that again swing jitterbug glenn miller tommy dorsey henry hall harry roy nat gonella al bowlly real music and the war of course we choose not to fight in wars it must be nice to believe that you have a choice said chadwick feeling the anger rise the way it did when he heard such pat comments he was keen to steer back to the topic at hand theyd sidetrack you these people put you on the defensive and before you knew it youd be arguing about war and revolution look id just like to know the story of you and linda how you came to be at brimleigh why you didnt leave together what happened is that so difficult not at all we drove up on sunday morning ive got an old mini just the two of you thats about all you can fit in a mini if you want to be comfortable and you were only there for the one day yes the mad hatters said they could get backstage passes for us but only for the day they were there that was sunday to be honest we didnt really feel like sitting around in a muddy field in yorkshire for three days that was about the first sensible thing chadwick had heard a young person say in a long time when did you arrive early afternoon were the mad hatters there already they were around what did you do well it was great really we got to park where the bands parked and we could just come and go as we pleased what was going on back there music mostly believe it or not when the bands were playing you could get around the front in the press enclosure if there was room that was where you got the best view in the entire place the rest of the time its sort of like a garden party round the back you know a beer tent food tables and chairs someone plucking on a guitar conversation jamming dancing like a big club and a restaurant rolled into one it got a bit chaotic at times especially between bands when the roadies were running back and forth but mostly it was great fun i understand there were caravans for some of the stars people need privacy and you know if you wanted somewhere to go and well i dont have to spell it out do i did you go to a caravan with anyone her eyes widened and her skin flushed thats hardly a question a gentleman would ask of a lady and i cant see as it has any bearing on what happened to linda so nobody needed to go into the woods for privacy no it was like we had our own little community and there was no one there to lay down the law to tell us what to do a perfect anarchist state chadwick thought that was something of a contradiction in terms but he didnt bother pointing it out he didnt want to get sidetracked again who did you spend your time with he asked lots of people i suppose i was with chris adams a fair bit hes the hatters manager a nice guy smart and sensitive she smiled and not too stoned to have a decent conversation with interesting chadwick thought that adams hadnt mentioned this but why would he it would only connect him with events from which he wanted to distance himself and his group were you with him during led zeppelins performance tania frowned no i was out front in the press enclosure i suppose he might have been there but it was really crowded and dark i dont remember seeing him youre american i understand chadwick said canadian actually but a lot of people make that mistake and dont worry im here legally work permit and all my parents were born here scotland strathclyde my father was a professor at the university there a professors daughter no less and no doubt they had moved to canada because he was better paid over there even less reason then for tania to be spending her days in a tiny shabby bedsit in notting hill so what about linda he asked did she disappear into any caravans not that i saw look linda got a bit claustrophobic developed a headache and when led zeppelin came on she told me she was going for a walk in the woods i told her id probably be heading back home as soon as they finished because i wanted to catch a bit of sleep before taking the ferry over to see my boyfriend jeff she told me not to worry about her she had friends she could stay with i knew that id been up with her before and met them it was a place in leeds where she used to live before she moved to london bayswater terrace that sounds right so she told you she would stay there not in so many words only that she wasnt planning on heading back to london with me that night any reason i guess there were just people she wanted to see i mean it was where she came from home i guess did you see any of these people from the house with her at the festival no like i said we had backstage passes we were in with the bands we didnt know anybody there apart from vic robin chris and the rest didnt even know them very well look as you can imagine it got a bit wild at times like all parties do linda slipped away i didnt see her again did she have a flower painted on her face when she left you tania looked puzzled flower i dont think so i dont know it was dark i dont remember would you have noticed maybe i dont know lots of girls had flowers painted on their faces is it important it could be chadwick remembered robin merchant saying that linda did have the flower on her face when he last saw her how was she going to get to leeds it was the middle of the night hitch a ride there were plenty of people heading that way most of the crowd came from leeds or bradford stands to reason was this your original plan for her to stay in leeds hitch a ride plan we didnt have a plan it was all pretty spontaneous i mean she knew i was going to paris on monday and i had to drive back sunday night but she also knew she could come back down to london with me in the mini if she wanted and what did you do after zeppelin finished i went round the back again hung around awhile and waited for her there was still a party going on backstage but people were leaving fast i didnt see her so i assumed shed headed off to bayswater terrace i got in my car and drove back down here it was about four in the morning by the time i left and i got home about nine i slept till two then drove to dover and took the ferry to calais you must have been tired not really dont you have a job im between jobs im a temp i happened to be good at typing at school i can choose my own hours now but what about education you said your father was a professor surely he would want you to go to university she gave him a curious almost pitying look what my father wants doesnt come into it she said its my life i might go to university one day but itll be when i want to not when someone else decides for me tania shook her hair back and lit another cigarette chadwick thought he saw a mouse scurry across the kitchen floor he gave a little shudder it wasnt that mice scared him but the idea of living with them held no appeal id like to know more about linda he said i understand she was a shopgirl tania laughed shopgirl how very quaint and english i suppose you could say that she worked at biba but she wanted to be a designer she was good too wouldnt they be worried about her not coming back she took the week off so there was a plan there were possibilities thats all there were some people in st ives she wanted to see maybe she was going to stay in leeds a few days see her friends and her mother and then go down there i dont know she also had a friend living on anglesey she wanted to visit what can i say linda was a spontaneous sort of person she just did things thats why i wasnt worried about her besides you dont think i mean we were with people who are into love and peace and all that and you just dont expect tears ran down her cheek im sorry she said this is all too much chadwick gave her a few minutes to compose herself and wipe away the tears then he said when linda left the enclosure for the woods did you see anyone follow her tania thought for a moment sucked at her cigarette and flicked some ash no she said did you see anyone else go out around that time not that i remember most of us were excited about led zeppelin getting ready to go round the front and get our minds blown could she have arranged to meet someone could the headache have been an excuse tania gave him a blank look why would she if shed been going to meet someone shed have said so it wasnt lindas way to be sly and sneaky christ chadwick thought it was a lot easier when you were dealing with ordinary folk most of whom lied and cheated as easily as they breathed rather than this lot with their fancy ideals and highhanded attitudes did you notice anyone paying her undue attention he asked lindas a beautiful girl of course there were people talking to her maybe trying to make an impression pick her up but nobody succeeded tania paused linda wasnt seeing anyone this past while she answered look ive seen what the newspapers say about us the news of the world the people trash like that they paint us as being some sort of drugaddled and sexcrazed subculture nothing but orgies and excess well some people might be like that but linda was a very spiritual person she was into buddhism the cabala yoga astrology tarot all sorts of spiritual stuff and sometimes she just you know sex wasnt always a part of it for her and drugs out of the picture too im not saying shed never smoked a joint or dropped a tab of acid but not for a while she was moving on evolving i understand the two of you performed musical duets together tania looked at him as if she didnt understand then she managed a brief smile performed musical duets we sang together sometimes if thats what you mean just in folk clubs and such can i have a look at lindas flat tania bit her lip i dont know i shouldnt i mean you can come with me keep an eye on me itll have to be done eventually officially finally tania said okay ive got a key come on she led him across the hall lindas room was the same shape as tanias but like a mirror image it was more luxuriously furnished with a couple of patterned rugs on the floor and a stylized painting of a man sitting crosslegged under a tree surrounded by strange symbols on the wall chadwick recognized the signs of the zodiac from the newspaper horoscopes janet read there was also a small bookcase full of volumes on mysticism and the spiritual life and packs of variously scented joss sticks an acoustic guitar similar to the one in tanias room leaned against the wall linda also had a small record player and beside it stood a stack of lps similar to those yvonne had there was nothing really personal in the room at least not that chadwick could find one drawer held a couple of letters from her mother and some old photographs taken with her father there were no diaries or notebooks whatever she had been carrying with her at brimleigh had disappeared and very little else apart from her birth certificate and post office book showing that she had s d in her account which seemed rather a lot to chadwick she had also set up a sewing machine at a makeshift table and there were a few bolts of printed fabric lying around in her small wardrobe hung many long dresses and skirts of bright print fabrics and other materials he searched under the drawers and tried the cupboards and wardrobe for false bottoms but found nowhere that might have provided a good hiding place for drugs if tania knew this was what he was doing she didnt say anything she just leaned against the doorjamb with her arms folded as far as food was concerned the pickings were slim linda had no oven only a gas burner beside the little sink and the contents of her cupboard consisted of brown rice chickpeas muesli tahini mung beans and various herbs and spices there was no refrigerator either and no sign of meat vegetables or dairy products except for a bottle of sterilized milk on the table frugal living indeed frustrated chadwick stood by the door and gave one last look around still nothing what will happen to it now tania asked i suppose itll be relet eventually he said for the moment ill get the local police to come in and seal it off until weve done a thorough search what do you know about rick hayes tania locked lindas door and led chadwick back to her room where they resumed their previous positions rick hayes the promoter thats the one nothing much i chatted with him a couple of times hes a bit of a creep if you must know he tried to pick me up suggested we go to his caravan and i told him to get lost how did he react he laughed and said he liked a girl who spoke her mind look hayes is one of those men who asks every girl he meets to sleep with him he thinks the odds are pretty good if nine out of ten tell him what they think of him or slap his face theres always the tenth who might say yes he knew linda is that right theyd met before yes once we went backstage at a mad hatters concert at the roundhouse and rick was there hes harmless enough really to be honest hes far too taken with himself to really give much thought to anyone else but if someone he wanted turned him down do you think he could get violent tania gave him a sharp look i i dont know she said ive never really thought about it hes got a bit of a temper i saw him laying into one of the security guards but that was just i dont know some sort of a power trip i thought youre not suggesting he might have killed linda because she wouldnt let him fuck her if the word was meant to shock chadwick it did he wasnt used to such language coming from the mouths of such lovely young women he was damned if he was going to give her the satisfaction of a reaction though did you see him leave the enclosure during the time you were there no mostly he was coordinating with the performers and roadies making sure the equipment got set up right and everything went smoothly there were a few problems with the pa system and so on that he also had to deal with and he acted as mc introducing the bands he was really pretty busy all the time i dont think hed have had a chance to slip away even if hed wanted to so he was always in sight pretty much not always but most of the time youd see him out the corner of your eye here and there running around there was always somebody wanting him for something where was he while linda was in the woods i dont know like i told you i went round to the front to get a good view was he there no he introduced the band then he left the stage did you see him after that come to think of it no but i dont believe it i dont believe he could have had anything to do with what happened probably not said chadwick standing to leave it just pays to cover all the angles thats all he lingered at the door before i leave tell me how linda was behaving these past few weeks what do you mean did anything out of the ordinary happen no was she upset depressed or worried about anything no she was her usual self she was saving up to go to india she was really excited about that chadwick who had spent time in india before seeing action in burma during the war didnt understand what there was to get excited about as far as he was concerned the place was filthy hot and unsanitary still it explained the reason for the s d in her post office account is that all as far as i know had she fought or argued with anyone recently not that i know i doubt it anyway whys that linda didnt like scenes or arguments she was a peaceful person easygoing did anyone threaten her in any way good lord no was anybody bothering her no the only thing that was at all upsetting her was vic greaves they werent close or anything but they were family and on the two or three occasions we saw the mad hatters he seemed to be getting worse she thought he ought to be getting treatment but whenever she mentioned it to chris he just said shrinks were government brainwashers and mental hospitals were prisons for the true visionaries i suppose he had a point did either you or linda try to do anything about greaves what do you mean persuade him to get treatment linda did once but he refused pointblank did you try to change chris adamss mind it wasnt his decision tania said look nobody was going to be party to getting vic greaves certified simple as that i see said chadwick the decision didnt surprise him after the time he had spent with the mad hatters he would be talking to them again soon anyway he opened the door and went into the hall many thanks miss hutchison no problem i must say you seem to be one of the most sensible people ive talked to since all this began tania gave him an enigmatic smile dont count on it she said appearances can be deceptive thursday th september perhaps it was the spices he had smelled in portobello road that sparked it they say smell is closest to memory or maybe it was even going to see the battle of britain after his visit to tania hutchison that brought it all back but chadwick awoke in his hotel bed at am in a cold sweat he couldnt say that it was a dream because it had actually happened but he had buried it so deeply in his subconscious that when it rose up as it did from time to time it did so in a jumble of images so vivid they were almost surreal buried under two bodies mouth and nose full of sand on gold beach the air all smoke and fire bullets cracking and thudding into the sand nearby blood seeping through his uniform the man on top of him whimpering as he died crying for his mother charging the bunkers with taffy in burma taffy wounded his guts poking out stumbling forward into the gunfire diving into the bunker of japanese soldiers knowing he was going to die and pulling the pin on his hand grenade bits of people raining down on chadwick an eyeball pieces of brain blood and tissue and so it went on a series of fragmented nightmare images from the burmese jungle and the normandy beaches he not only saw and heard but smelled it all again in his dream the gunfire smoke heat tasted the sand in his mouth he feared that there would be no more sleep tonight so he sat up took the glass of water he had left on his bedside table and drank it down then went to refill it still hours to go until dawn and these were the worst hours the hours when his fears got the better of him the only solution was to get up and do something to take his mind off it all he wasnt going to go walking around kings cross at this hour in the morning so he turned on the bedside light took alistair macleans force ten from navarone out of his overnight bag and settled back on the pillows to read by the time the pale glow of sunrise started spreading over the city from the east his book had fallen on his chest and he was snoring quietly in a dreamless sleep chapter eleven in a village like lyndgarth banks knew the best way to find out about any resident was to ask at the local pub or at the post office in the case of vic greaves it was jean murray in the post officecumnewsagents who directed him toward the last cottage on the left on darlington road telling him that mr jones had been there for a few years now was definitely a bit strange not quite right in the head but that he seemed harmless enough and he always paid his newspaper bill on time he was a bit of a recluse she added and he didnt like visitors she had no idea what he did with his time but there had been no complaints about him her daughter susan added that he had few visitors but she had seen a couple of cars come and go she couldnt describe them banks left his car parked on the cobbles by the village green it was another miserable day with wind and rain from the east for a change and the flagstone roofs of the houses looked as dark green as moss pools bare tree branches waved beyond the tv aerials and beyond them lay the washedout backdrop of a dishwatergray sky at the top right of the village green between the old burgundy hotel and the dark squat methodist chapel a narrow lane led down toward a wooded beck on each side was a terrace of small oneuponedown limestone cottages once used to house farm laborers banks stood for a moment in front of the end one on the left and listened he could hear no signs of life see no lights the downstairs curtains were closed but the upstairs ones were open as were the windows finally he knocked on the door nothing happened so he knocked again harder this time when it seemed that no one was going to answer the door opened and a figure stood there looking anxious it was hard to say whether it was vic greaves or not as banks only had the old group photographs to go by when greaves had been a promising twentysomething rock star now he must be in his late fifties banks thought but he looked much older roundshouldered with a sagging stomach the size of a football he wore a black tshirt with a silver harley davidson on the front baggy jeans and no shoes or socks his eyes were bruised and hollow his dry skin pale and lined he was either bald or shaved his head regularly and that accentuated the boniness of his cheeks and the hollowness of his eyes he looked ill to banks and lightyears from the pretty young boy all the girls adored who had set the career of the mad hatters in motion im looking for vic greaves banks said hes not here today the man said his expression unchanging are you sure banks asked this seemed to puzzle the man and cause him some distress he might have been he might have been if he hadnt been trying to go home but his cars broken down the wheels wont work pardon suddenly the man smiled revealing a mouthful of stained and crooked teeth with the odd gap here and there and said hes nothing to do with me then he turned and walked back inside the house leaving the door wide open puzzled banks followed him the door led straight into the front room the same as it did in bankss own cottage because the curtains were closed the downstairs was in semidarkness but even in the poor light banks could see that the room was cluttered with piles of books newspapers and magazines there was a slight odor of sour milk about the place and of cheese that had been left out of the fridge too long but a better smell mingled with it olive oil garlic and herbs banks followed the man through to the back which was the kitchen where a bit more light filtered in through the grimy windows and past halfopen floral curtains inside the place was spotlessly clean and neat all the pots and pans gleaming on their wall hooks dishes and cups sparkling in their glassfronted cupboards whatever greavess problem was and banks believed he was greaves it didnt stop him from taking care of his home better than most bachelors banks had known the man stood with his back to banks stirring a pot on the gas range are you vic greaves banks asked no answer look said banks im a police officer dci banks alan my name is alan i need to talk to you are you vic greaves the man half turned alan he said peering curiously at banks i dont know who you are i dont know any alans i dont know you do i i just told you im a police officer no you dont know me they werent really meant to grow so high you know the man said turning back to his pot sometimes the rain does good things what the hillsides drink it banks tried to position himself so that he could see the mans face when the man half turned again and saw him he looked surprised what are you doing here he asked as if he had genuinely forgotten bankss presence i told you im a policeman i want to ask you some questions about nick barber he did come and talk to you didnt he do you remember the man shook his head and his face turned sad for a moment vics gone down to the woods today he said vic greaves is in the woods banks asked who are you no he said he had to get some stuff you know he needed it for the stew you went to the woods earlier he sometimes walks there on nice days its peaceful he likes to listen to the birds and look at the leaves and the mushrooms do you live here alone he sighed im just passing through tell me about nick barber he stopped stirring and faced banks his expression still blank unreadable someone came here thats right his name was nick barber when did he come do you remember the man said nothing just stared at banks in a disturbing way banks was beginning to feel thoroughly unnerved by the entire experience was greaves off his face on drugs or something was he likely to turn violent at any moment if so there was a handy rack of kitchen knives within his reach look he said nick barber is dead somebody killed him can you remember anything about what he said vics gone down to the woods today the man said again yes but this man nick barber what did he ask you about was it about robin merchants death was it about swainsview lodge the man put his hands over his ears and hung his head vic cant hear this he said vic wont hear this think surely you can remember do you remember swainsview lodge but greaves was just counting now one two three four five banks tried to talk but the counting got louder in the end he gave up turned away and left he would have to come back there had to be a way of getting some answers from vic greaves on his way out of the village banks passed a sleek silver merc but thought nothing of it all the way back to the station he thought about the strange experience he had just had and even pink floyds i remember a day on the stereo could not dispel his gloom kev what have you dug up annie cabbot asked when a dusty and clearly disgruntled ds templeton trudged over to her desk and flopped down on the visitors chair early that afternoon templeton sighed we ought to do something about that basement he said its a bloody health hazard he brushed some dust off his sixty quid topman distressed jeans and plonked a collection of files on the desk its all here maam he said what there is of it anyway kev ive told you before not to call me maam i know that detective superintendent gervaise insists on it but thats her prerogative a simple guv will suffice if you must right guv give me a quick rundown top and bottom of it is said templeton that there was no full investigation as such the coroner returned a verdict of accidental death and that was the end of it no reservations not so far as i can tell guv who was in the house at the time its all in that file there templeton tapped a thick buff folder for what its worth statements and everything basically there were the band members their manager lord jessop and various assorted girlfriends groupies and hangerson theyre all named on the list and they were all questioned annie scanned the list quickly and put it aside nothing or no one she hadnt expected though most of the names meant nothing to her it happened after a private party to celebrate the success of their second album which was called get this he whose face gives no light shall never become a star thats blake annie said william blake my dad used to quote him all the time sounds like a right load of bollocks to me templeton said anyway the album was recorded at swainsview lodge over the winter of lord jessop had let them convert an old banquet room he didnt use first into a rehearsal space and then into a private recording studio quite a lot of bands used it over the next few years so what happened on the night of the party everybody swore merchant was fine when things wound up around two or three oclock but the next morning the gardener found him floating on his back naked in the pool the postmortem found a drug called mandrax in his system whats that search me some kind of tranquilizer was there enough to kill him not according to the pathologist but hed been drinking too and that enhances the effects and the dangers probably been smoking dope and dropping acid as well but they didnt have toxicology tests for them back then so what was the cause of death officially he slipped on the side of the swimming pool fell in the shallow end smashed his head on the bottom and drowned the mandrax might have slowed down his reactions there was water in his lungs what about the blow to the head any way it could have been bluntobject trauma showed impact with a large flat area rather than a blunt object like the bottom of a swimming pool exactly guv what did the party guests say what youd expect everyone swore they were asleep at the time and nobody heard anything to be honest they probably wouldnt have even noticed if they were all full of drugs and he just fell in the pool not much to hear he was already unconscious from hitting his head any speculation as to why he was naked no said templeton but it was par for the course back then wasnt it hippies and all that stuff free love orgies and whatnot any excuse to get their kit off who carried out the investigation detective chief inspector cecil grant was sio hes dead now but a ds keith enderby did most of the legwork and digging around summer said annie hell be retired by now most likely but he might still be around somewhere ill check with human resources kev did you ever get the impression reading through the stuff that anyone put the kibosh on the investigation because a famous rock band and a peer of the realm were involved templeton scratched his brow well now you come to mention it it did cross my mind but if you look at the facts there was no evidence to say that it happened any other way ds enderby seems to have done a decent enough job under the circumstances on the other hand they all closed ranks and presented a united front i dont believe for a minute that everyone went to sleep at two or three in the morning and heard nothing more ill bet you there were people up and about on the prowl though perhaps they were in no state to distinguish reality from fantasy someone could easily have been lying to protect someone else or two or more of them could have been in it together conspiracy theory the other thing of course is that there was no motive no strife within the band not that anyone was able to put their finger on at the time again though they werent likely to tell the investigating officers about it if there was were they no but there might have been rumors in the music press these people lived a great deal of their lives in the public eye well if there was anything it was a wellkept secret said templeton ive checked some of the stuff online and at that time they were a successful group definitely going places maybe if someone dug around a bit now asked the right questions i dont know it might be different why dont you see if you can track down this enderby and ill have a chat with dci banks yes guv said templeton standing up want me to leave the files might as well said annie ill have a look at them thursday th september rick hayess soho office was located above a trattoria in frith street not too far from ronnie scotts and any number of sleazy sex shops and strip clubs refreshed by an espresso from the bar italia across the street chadwick climbed the shabby staircase and knocked at the glass pane on the door labeled hayes concert promotions a voice called out for him to come in and he entered to see hayes sitting behind a littered desk hand over the mouthpiece of his telephone inspector what a surprise hayes said sit down can you just hang on a moment ive been trying to get hold of this bloke forever chadwick waited but instead of sitting he wandered around the office a practice that he found usually made people nervous framed signed photos of hayes with various famous rock stars hung on the walls unfamiliar names for the most part jimi hendrix pete townsend eric clapton filing cabinets stuffed with folders he was opening drawers in a cabinet near the window when his snooping obviously made hayes worried enough to end his phone call prematurely what are you doing hayes asked just having a look around those are private files yes chadwick sat down well im a great believer in not wasting time sitting around doing nothing so i thought id just use a bit of initiative have you got a search warrant not yet why do i need one to look at those files you do oh i shouldnt think theres anything there of interest to me the reason im here is that youve been lying to me since the moment we met and i want to know why i also want to know what you have to do with the murder of linda lofthouse linda lofthouse dont play games with me laddie chadwick snarled his glaswegian accent getting stronger the more angry he became youll only lose thats the victims name how was i to know its been in the papers dont read them i know theyre all full of establishment lies i dont care whether you read the papers or not you saw the body at brimleigh you were there at the scene even before i arrived so you were in a perfect position to mislead us all to tamper with evidence she was right there lying dead at your feet and you told me you hadnt seen her before i told you later that i might have seen her backstage there were a lot of people around and i was very busy so you said later well there were two important things i didnt know then things you could have told me but didnt youve lost me what are you talking about chadwick counted them off on his fingers first that the victims name was linda lofthouse and second that you knew her a lot better than you let on hayes picked up a rubber band from his desk and started wrapping it around his nicotinestained fingers he hadnt shaved in a couple of days and his lank hair needed a wash he was wearing jeans and a red collarless shirt made of some flimsy material ive told you everything i know he said bollocks youve told me bugger all ive had to piece it all together from conversations with other people you could have saved me a lot of trouble its not my job to save the fuzz trouble enough of that phony hippie nonsense it doesnt suit you youre a businessman a filthy capitalist lackey just like the rest no matter how you dress and how infrequently you wash you knew linda lofthouse through dennis nokes the house on bayswater terrace leeds and through her cousin vic greaves of the mad hatters you also knew lindas friend tania hutchison the girl she was with at brimleigh but you didnt bother to tell us that either did you hayess jaw dropped who told you all this that doesnt matter is it true what if it is then youve been withholding important information in a murder investigation and that laddie is a crime i didnt think we were living in a police state yet believe me if we were youd know the difference when did you first meet linda lofthouse hayes glowered at chadwick still playing with the rubber band at denniss place he said when i dont know man a while back weeks months years look dennis is an old mate whenever im in the area i drop by and see him and one time you did this you met linda thats right she was staying at denniss with dennis no way linda was untouchable so it looked as if nokes was telling the truth about that at least this would have been the winter of early right if you say so how often have you seen her since just a couple of times you know no i dont enlighten me ive done some concerts with the hatters and she was at one of them i met her up at denniss again too but i didnt like know her or anything i mean we werent close we were just around the same scene sometimes like lots of other people were so why did you lie about knowing her if it was all so innocent i dont know man i didnt want to get involved you guys would probably take one look at me and think i did it besides every minute i was standing around in that field i was losing money you dont know what this business is like how hard it is just to break even sometimes so you lied because you thought that if you told the truth id keep you from your work and youd lose money thats right surely you can understand that oh i can understand it well enough said chadwick youre speaking my language now concern over money is a lot more common than you think then what were you doing after you introduced led zeppelin on sunday night listening to their set whenever i had a moment they were incredible blew me away where were you listening around i still had things to do we were looking to pack up and get out of there as soon as possible after the show so i couldnt waste time as it turned out but where did you go to listen to them the press enclosure was roped off in front of the stage apparently that was the best place to watch from did you go there no like i said i didnt have time to just stand there and watch i had other things to do it was pandemonium around there man we had people falling off the stage stoned and people trying to sneak in the front and back managers wanted paying there were cars blocking other cars limos turning up for people pieces of equipment to be accounted for i tell you man i didnt have time to kill anyone even if i wanted to which i didnt i mean what possible motive could i have for killing linda she was a great bird i liked her he lit a cigarette i notice youre lefthanded chadwick said yeah so the killer was lefthanded lots of people are do you own a flickknife no way man theyre illegal well im glad to see you know the law look are we finished because ive got a lot of phone calls to make were finished when i say we are hayes bristled but said nothing i hope you realize the extent of the trouble youre in chadwick went on look i did what anybody would do youve got to be crazy these days to give the fuzz an inch especially if youre a bit different in your case it didnt work did it ive found out anyway all we need now is one person just one person who saw you leaving the backstage area for the woods while led zeppelin were playing are you so sure that no one saw you after all weve discovered all your other little lies why not this one i did not leave the enclosure and i didnt see linda leave either were reinterviewing all the security personnel and everyone else we can think of who was there are you certain thats the story you want to stick to i did not leave the enclosure i did not go into those woods what did you do with the knife i cant believe this i never had a knife chadwick spread his hands on the table the gesture of a reasonable man laying out his cards look mr hayes im not persecuting you because youre different in fact i dont believe youre that much different from most of the petty villains i come into contact with you just wear a different uniform thats all why dont you make it easy on us all and tell me how it happened i want my solicitor what about tania hutchison did you try it on with her too im not saying another word but it was linda you really wanted wasnt it linda who seemed so unattainable untouchable isnt that the word you used she was so beautiful thought you werent good enough for her did she even your money and your famous contacts didnt impress her did they so how did it happen she wandered off into the woods you did your mc duties and when everyone was enthralled and deafened by led zeppelin you followed linda into the woods she rejected you again and this time was once too many she was having her period did she tell you that did you think it was just an excuse well you were wrong it was true maybe you were high maybe youd been taking drugs you could probably plead that you werent responsible for your actions but she turned her back on you for the last time you grabbed her from behind and stabbed her then when you realized what youd done you knew you had to throw us off the scent it was a clumsy attempt but the best you could come up with under pressure you walked to the edge of the field were lucky enough to steal a sleeping bag without being seen and the body was still undiscovered when you got back to it you shoved her in the sleeping bag very carelessly i might add and that was my first indication she hadnt been killed in it and you carried her to the field while everyones attention was riveted on the stage in the dark you set the sleeping bag down at the very edge of the crowd so we wouldnt link her with the backstage lot and hurried back to your duties i dont suppose it took long was there a lot of blood to wash off your hands i dont think so you rubbed them on the leaves then you rinsed them off in the beck did you get any on your clothes well we can always check where did you hide the knife as chadwick talked hayes turned pale its one thing accusing me of all this he said finally but it will be quite another proving it all we need is one witness who saw you leave the enclosure at the relevant time and the nonexistent knife that was clever of him chadwick thought the knife would help a lot especially if it had hayess fingerprints and linda lofthouses blood on it but cases had proceeded on less and been won on less hayes might get a haircut and wear a suit for the jury but people could still see through him chadwick leaned forward and picked up hayess telephone im going to call a contact at west end central he said and in no time well have search warrants for your office your house and anywhere else youve spent more than ten minutes over the past two weeks if there are any traces of lindas blood believe me well find them go ahead said hayes with less confidence than he was aiming for and as soon as youve done that ill have my solicitor down here and sue you for wrongful arrest i havent arrested you said chadwick dialing not yet yes i know what mandrax is or was said banks to annie over an offduty pint in the queens arms early that evening it was dark outside and the pub was noisy with the afterwork crowd along with those who never worked and had been there all day mostly loud kids with foul mouths telling fart jokes over the pool table in the back a big mistake that table was banks had told cyril the landlord but he had replied that he had to move with the times or the younger crowd would all go to the duck and drake or the red lion good riddance banks thought still it wasnt his livelihood the mix of accents said a lot about the changing dales banks could discern london newcastle and belfast mixed in with the locals the yob factor was getting stronger in eastvale too everyone had noticed and it had become a matter of concern written up in the newspaper argued over by members of the council and local mps that was why neighbourhood policing had been set up and gavin rickerd transferred to keep tabs on known troublemakers and share that intelligence with other communities even the police stations location right on the edge of the market square didnt seem to make any difference to the drunken louts who ran wild after closing time every saturday night leaving a trail of detritus and destruction in their wake on the ancient cobbles not to mention the occasional bleeding human being towncenter shopkeepers and pub landlords scrubbing away the vomit and sweeping up broken glass on a sunday morning was a common sight for the eastvale churchgoers mandrax was a powerful sedative banks said a sleeping tablet known affectionately as mandies been off the market since the seventies if they were sleeping pills annie asked why didnt they just put people to sleep banks took a swig of black sheep the only pint he was allowing himself before the drive home to gratly thats what they were supposed to do the thing was if you mixed them with booze and rode out the first waves of tiredness they gave you a nice mellow buzz they were also especially good for sex i expect that was why robin merchant was naked were they what good for sex i dont know i only took two once and i didnt have a girlfriend at the time i fell asleep annie patted his arm poor alan so was merchant on his way toward an assignation or was he just taking a post coital stroll what did the files say banks asked they were remarkably silent on the subject no one admitted to sleeping with him of course if hed been in the water all night it would have been difficult for the pathologist to tell whether hed had sex or not who was his girlfriend at the time no one in particular said annie no information on robin merchants sexual habits or preferences made it to the official case notes this enderby character might remember something if and when templeton tracks him down maybe he was gay annie suggested him and lord jessop in the sack together i could see why they might want to suppress that theres no evidence to suggest that lord jessop was gay said banks apparently he liked the ladies for a while at any rate what happened he became a heroin addict though he functioned well enough for years many addicts do if they can get a regular and reliable supply but heroin doesnt do a lot for your sex drive in the end he got aids from an infected needle youd think he could afford clean needles wouldnt you him being a lord and all he was broke by then banks said apparently he was rather a tragic figure toward the end he died alone all his friends had deserted him including his rockstar pals hed spent his inheritance sold off most of his land nobody wanted to buy swainsview lodge and he had no heirs hed sold everything else he had is that where he died swainsview ironically enough yes said banks that place has a sad history they both paused to take in the implications of that then annie said so they caused disorientation and tiredness these mandies yes i mean if robin merchant had been taking mandies and drinking he could easily have lost his footing i suppose when he hit his head on the bottom of the shallow end hed already be feeling the effects of the drug and might have drowned its like jimi hendrix in a way you know choking on his own vomit because he had so much vesperax in his system that he couldnt wake up and stop it happening usually the bodys pretty good at selfpreservation gag reflexes and such but certain drugs can inhibit or depress those functions across the room a white ball cracked into a triangle of reds breaking the frame and launching a new game someone started arguing loudly and drunkenly about the rules so what happened to mandrax annie asked i dont know the exact details but they took it off the market in the late seventies people soon replaced it with mogadon which they called moggies same sort of thing but a tranquilizer not a sedative and probably not as harmful annie sipped some beer but someone could have pushed him couldnt they of course they could even if we could find a motive though we might have a devil of a job proving it after all this time and strictly speaking its not our job it is if its linked to nick barbers murder true enough anyway i cant see vic greaves being much help that really upset you didnt it talking to him i suppose it did said banks toying with his beer mat i mean its not as if he was one of my idols or anything but just to see him in that state to see that emptiness in his eyes up close banks gave an involuntary shudder was it drugs was he really an acid casualty thats what everyone said at the time you know there was even a kind of heroic stature about it he was put on a pedestal for being mad people thought there was something cool about it he attracted a cult following a lot of weirdos they still hound him banks shook his head what a time the way they used to glorify tramps and call madmen visionaries you think there was something else to it i dont know how much lsd he took probably bucketfuls of the stuff ive heard hes done a few stints in various psychiatric establishments over the years along with group therapy and any other kinds of therapy that happened to be fashionable at the time but as far as i know theres still no official diagnosis none of them seemed to know exactly what his problem was let alone cure him acid casualty psychotic schizophrenic paranoid schizophrenic take your pick none of it really matters in the long run hes vic greaves and his heads fucked it must be hell inside there brian and emilia were in the entertainment room watching la dolce vita on the plasma screen when banks got home they were on the sofa brian sitting up with his feet on the pouf his arm around emilia who leaned against him head on his chest face hidden by a cascade of hair she was wearing what looked like one of brians shirts it wasnt tucked in at the waist because she wasnt wearing anything to tuck it into they certainly looked as if they had made themselves at home during the couple of days theyd been around and banks realized sadly that he had been so busy he had hardly seen them a tantalizing smell drifted from the kitchen oh hi dad said brian putting the dvd on pause got your note we were out walking around relton way not a very nice day for it im afraid said banks flopping onto one of the armchairs we got soaked said emilia it happens said banks hope it didnt put you off oh no mr banks its beautiful up here i mean even when its gray and rainy its got a sort of romantic primitive beauty hasnt it like wuthering heights i suppose it has said banks he gestured toward the screen and call me alan please didnt know you were fellini fans its one of your uncle roys ive been trying to watch them all bergman truffaut chabrol kurasawa im getting quite used to the subtitles now but i still have a bit of trouble following whats going on half the time brian laughed i heard someone talking about la dolce vita a while ago how great it was and there it was right in front of me emmy heres an actress i thought id seen you somewhere before banks said youve done tv right emilia blushed a little ive had small parts in spooks hustle and bad girls and ive done quite a bit of theater too no movies yet she stood up please excuse me a moment of course whats that smell banks asked brian when she had left the room emilias making us dinner i thought wed get a takeaway tonight thisll be better dad believe me you took us out on sunday emilia wants to repay you shes a gourmet cook leg of lamb with garlic and rosemary potatoes dauphinois he put his fingers to his lips and made a kissing sound fantastic well said banks ive never been one to turn down a gourmet meal but she doesnt have to feel obliged she likes doing it then id better open a nice bottle of wine banks walked to the kitchen and opened a bottle of peter lehmann australian shiraz which he thought would go well with the lamb when emilia came in she was wearing jeans with the shirt tucked in at the waist and her long hair tied back in a simple ponytail she smiled at him cheeks glowing and bent to open the oven the smell was even stronger wonderful said banks it wont be long now said emilia the lamb and potatoes are almost done im just going to make a salad pear and blue cheese thats okay isnt it brian said you like blue cheese its fine said banks sounds delicious in fact thank you emilia flashed him a shy smile and he guessed she was a little embarrassed because hed caught her with her trousers down so to speak banks poured a glass of shiraz offered one to emilia who said shed wait until later then went back to sit with brian who had now turned off the dvd and was playing the first mad hatters cd which banks had bought at the hmv on oxford street along with their second and third albums what do you think of it he asked brian it must have been quite something in its time brian said i like the guitar and keyboards mix theyve got that sounds quite original really spacey its good especially for a debut better than i remember i mean i havent listened to them in years me neither said banks i met vic greaves today at least i think i did vic greaves jesus dad hes a legend what was he like strange he spoke in non sequiturs referred to himself in the third person a lot banks shrugged i dont know everyone says he took too much lsd brian seemed deep in thought for a few moments then he said acid casualties makes it sound like war doesnt it but things like that happened its not as if he was the only one i know that said banks finding himself starting to wonder about brian he was living the rockstar life too as vic greaves had what did he get up to how much did he know about drugs dinners ready emilia called out banks and brian got up and went into the kitchen where emilia had lit candles and presented the salad beautifully they talked about brians music and emilias acting ambitions as they ate a pleasant relief for banks after his distressing encounter with vic greaves this time banks actually got as far as dessert raspberry brûlée before the phone rang cursing he excused himself sir yes winsome here sorry to bother you guv but its jean murray you know from the post office in lyndgarth she rang about five minutes ago about vic greaves said she was out walking her dog and heard all sorts of shenanigans up at the house lights going on and off people shouting and running around and breaking things i thought i should tell you you did right said banks did you send a car not yet good dont is there more than one person involved sounds like it to me thanks winsome said banks ill be there as soon as i can he thanked emilia for a wonderful dinner made his apologies and left saying he wasnt sure how late he would be back he didnt think brian minded too much the way he was looking at emilia and holding her hand in the candlelight chapter twelve friday th september detective chief superintendent mccullen called a meeting for friday afternoon in the incident room at brotherton house the town hall dome looked dark and forbidding against the irongray sky and only a few shoppers were walking up the headrow toward lewiss and schofields struggling with their umbrellas chadwick was feeling a little better after a decent and nightmarefree sleep in his own bed helped along considerably by the news that leeds united beat sk lyn oslo in the first round of the european cup photos were pinned to the boards at the front of the room the victim the scene and those present sat in chairs at the various scattered desks occasionally a telephone rang and a telex machine clattered in the distance present were mccullen chadwick enderby bradley dr oneill and charlie green a civilian liaison from the forensic laboratory in wetherby along with a number of uniformed and plainclothes constables who had been involved in the lofthouse case mccullen hosted the proceedings calling first on dr oneill to summarize the pathology findings which he did most succinctly next came the lab liaison man charlie green ive been in meetings with our various departments this morning he said so i think i can give you a reasonable précis of what weve discovered so far which isnt very much blood analysis determines that the victims blood is group a a characteristic she shares with about fortythree percent of the population as far as toxicology has been able to gather so far there is no evidence to suggest the presence of illegal substances i must inform you at this point though that we have no test for lsd a fairly common drug among well the type of people were dealing with it disappears from the system very quickly as you all know the areas around where the body was found and where the victim was stabbed have both been searched exhaustively by our search teams and by specially trained police dogs they turned up a small amount of blood at the scene some on the ground and more on some nearby leaves the blood matches the victims group and we submit that the killer used the leaves to wipe her blood from his hands and perhaps from the murder weapon a narrow singleedged blade the kind you often find on a flickknife there are no footprints in the woods and the footprints found near the sleeping bag were so muddled as to be useless upon examination the sleeping bag yielded traces of the victims blood along with hair and er bodily fluids that contain the respective blood types of ian tilbrook and june betts neither group a by the way who claimed the sleeping bag was stolen from them while they sought out a better viewing position on the field in all this then said mccullen there are no traces of the killer no blood no hair we still have unidentified hairs some taken from the tree trunk near which the girl was killed said green as you know hair comparison is weak to say the least and it often doesnt stand up in court but you do have hairs and they might belong to the killer yes we also have some fibers again some from the tree and some from the victims dress but theyre common blue denim which im sure just about everyone was wearing and black cotton which is also common theres a chance we might be able to make a match if we had the clothes but im afraid these fibers arent going to lead us to anything you cant get at lewiss or marks amp spencers is there anything else just one more thing really mccullen raised his eyebrows do tell we found stains on the back of the girls dress green said hardly able to stop the smile spreading across his large mouth they turned out to be semen a secretor type a blood same as the victim hardly conclusive of course but certainly interesting mccullen turned back to dr oneill doctor he said do we have any evidence of recent sexual activity on the part of the girl as i said to di chadwick at the postmortem the victim was menstruating at the time she was killed now that doesnt rule out sexual activity of course but vaginal and anal swabs reveal absolutely no signs of it and the tissue shows no signs of tearing or bruising was she on the pill mccullen asked we did find evidence of oral contraception yes so perhaps chadwick said our killer got his pleasure by ejaculating on the victim not in her or perhaps he couldnt help himself and it happened as he was stabbing her was there a great deal of semen mr green no said green minute traces as much as might have seeped through a persons underpants and jeans say so what do we know about our killer in total mr green he asked that hes between five foot ten and six feet tall left handed wore blue denim jeans and a black cotton shirt or tshirt hes a secretor and his blood type is a thank you mccullen turned to enderby i understand youve got something for us sergeant its not much sir said enderby but di chadwick asked me to track down the girl who was doing the body painting backstage at brimleigh it seems theres some question about the flower painted on the victims face whether it was preor postmortem and robin merchant one of the members of the mad hatters told di chadwick that he saw her with a painted flower on her face late that evening her friend tania hutchison cant remember hayes was also uncertain if she did have one we were wondering if the killer did it for some reason sir did he im afraid we still dont know for certain the body painter was a bit well not so much stupid as sort of lost in her own world she couldnt remember who she painted and who she didnt i showed her the victims photograph and she thought she recognized her then i showed her the design and she said it could have been one of hers but she didnt usually paint cornflowers wonderful said mccullen do any of these people have the brains they were born with i wonder i know sir said enderby with a grin its very frustrating should i continue my inquiries mccullen looked at chadwick stan youre in charge im not sure if its relevant at all chadwick said i simply thought that the drawing of such a flower by the killer indicated a certain type of mentality a nutcase you mean said mccullen to put it bluntly yes said chadwick and while im not saying our killer didnt do it im beginning to think that if he did its simply another clumsy attempt at sleight of hand like moving the body explain chadwick took greens place at the front by the boards yesterday in london with the permission of the local police at west end central i questioned rick hayes the festival promoter hes lied to me on a couple of occasions and when i confronted him with this he admitted to knowing the victim previous to the festival he denies any sexual involvement and i must add that a couple of other people i have spoken with regard this as highly unlikely too but he did know her hes also the kind of man who asks just about every girl he meets to hop into bed with him so im thinking theres a chance that if he was attracted to linda and she rejected him well i think you can see where im going what about his alibi mccullen asked shaky to say the least he was definitely onstage at one oclock to introduce the last group after that who knows he claims he was in the backstage enclosure paying people i gather a lot of this sort of thing operates on a cashinhand basis probably to avoid income tax and seeing to various problems that came up we can reinterview everyone who was there but i dont think thatll get us anywhere the point is that things were so chaotic back there when led zeppelin were playing that hayes could easily have followed linda out of the compound stayed away for long enough to kill her and get back without really being missed dont forget it was dark as well as noisy and most people were at the front of the stage watching the band the drugs they take also make them rather narcissistic and inwardlooking not a very observant lot by and large have we enough to hold him im not sure said chadwick with west end centrals help we searched his soho office and his flat in kensington and turned up nothing is he lefthanded yes the right height five foot eleven so its all circumstantial weve had worse cases but theres nothing to directly link him to the murder without the weapon except that he knew the victim he fancied her he had a bit of a temper hes lefthanded and his alibis weak hes not a nutcase so if he did paint the flower on her cheek he did so to make us think it was the work of a nutcase i see your point said mccullen he still sounds like the best bet weve got so far he could have ditched the knife anywhere talk to the kid who found the body again ask him at what point hayes turned up and what sort of state he was in and organize another search of the woods yes sir said chadwick what do we do about him in the meantime weve got enough to hold him havent we lets bring him back up here and treat him to a bit of yorkshire hospitality arrange it with west end central im sure there must be someone down there looking for a chance to come up and watch tomorrows game which game would that be sir mccullen looked at him as if were mad and said which game there is only one game as far as i know chadwick knew he meant the yorkshire challenge cup at headingley knew mccullen was a rugby man so he was teasing the others knew it too and they were grinning behind cupped hands sorry sir said chadwick i thought you meant leeds and chelsea mccullen grunted football he said with scorn nothing but a bunch of sissies now enough of your cheek and get on with it yes sir said chadwick the end cottage was quiet when banks walked up to the door at around nine oclock he had called on jean and susan murray who shared the flat above the post office just to let them know that he was there and they werent to worry jean murrays account of events in person was no more coherent than what winsome had repeated on the phone noise lights things breaking a domestic tiff banks would have guessed except that he was certain vic greaves had been alone when he left and he wasnt in any kind of shape to argue coherently with anyone banks had also considered calling in annie but there was no point in dragging her in all the way from harkside for what might turn out to be nothing he had parked his car by the green again next to a silver merc because it wouldnt fit up the lane he looked at the merc again and remembered it was the same one he had seen when he left lyndgarth in the late afternoon wind thrashed the bare branches in the streetlights casting eerie shadows over the cottage and the road the air smelled of rain that hadnt started falling yet the front curtains were closed but banks could see a faint light shining inside he walked down the path and knocked on the door this time it was answered quickly the man who stood there framed by the light had a red complexion and his thinning gray hair was pulled back in a ponytail which gave the effect of his having a bulbous belligerent face as if banks were seeing it through a fisheye lens he was wearing a leather jacket and jeans what the fuck do you want he said are you the bastard who came round earlier upsetting vic cant you sick bastards just leave him alone cant you see hes ill he did look rather ill to me said banks reaching inside his pocket for his warrant card he handed it over and the man examined it before passing it back im sorry he said running his hand over the top of his head excuse me come in im just used to being so protective vics in a hell of a state banks followed him in youre right though he said it was me who was here earlier and he did get upset im sorry if im to blame you werent to know who are you by the way the man stuck out his hand names chris chris adams banks shook adams had a firm grasp although his palm was slightly sweaty the mad hatters manager for my sins you understand the situation then sit down sit down banks sat on a cracked vinyl armchair of some indeterminate yellowbrown color adams sat at an angle to him all around them were stacks of papers and magazines the room was dimly lit by two table lamps with pinkandgreen shades there didnt seem to be any heat and it was chilly in the cottage banks kept his coat on i wouldnt say i understand the situation he said i know vic greaves is living here and thats just about all i know hes resting at the moment dont worry hell be okay said adams you take care of him i try to drop by as often as i can when im not away in london or la i live just outside newcastle near alnwick so its not too long a journey i thought you were all living in america thats just the band most of them anyway i wouldnt live there if you paid me a fortune in gold bullion right now theres plenty to do at this end organizing the forthcoming tour but you dont want to know about my problems what exactly can vic do for you now that he was here banks wasnt entirely sure he hadnt had time to plan an interview hadnt even expected to see chris adams this evening he had come in response to jean murrays call perhaps that was the best place to start im sorry i upset mr greaves earlier he began but i had a phone call a short while ago from someone in the village complaining about shouting and things breaking adams nodded that would have been vic when i got here it must have been shortly after you left i found him rolled up in a ball on the floor counting he does that when he feels threatened i suppose its sort of like sheep turning their backs on danger and hoping it will go away i thought maybe he was on drugs or something adams shook his head vic hasnt touched drugs at least nonprescription drugs in over thirty years or more and the noise the breakages i got him to sleep for a while then when he woke after dark he got disoriented and frightened he remembered your visit and he got hysterical had one of his tantrums and smashed a couple of plates it happens from time to time nothing serious i managed to calm him down eventually and hes sleeping again now small village word gets around indeed said banks ive heard stories of course but i had no idea he was so fragile adams rubbed at his lined forehead as if scratching an itch he can function well enough on his own he said as youve no doubt seen but he finds interaction difficult especially with strangers and people he doesnt trust he tends to get angry or to just shut down it can be very distressing not just for him but for whoever is trying to talk to him as you no doubt found out too has he been getting any professional help doctors oh yes hes seen many doctors over the years none of them have been able to do much except prescribe more and more drugs and vic doesnt like to take them he says they make him feel dead inside how does he get in touch with you pardon if he needs you or wants to see you has he got a phone no having a telephone would only upset him adams shrugged people would find out his number crazy fans thats what i thought you were at first he gets enough letters as it is like i said i just drop by whenever i can and he knows he can always get in touch with me i mean he knows how to use a phone hes not an idiot and sometimes hell phone from the box by the green can he get around he doesnt drive if thats what you mean he does have a bicycle a bicycle wasnt much good for many of these steep country roads banks thought unless you were especially fit and greaves didnt look that healthy but fordham he reminded himself was only about a mile away and you didnt need a car or even a bicycle to cover that sort of distance look whats going on adams asked i dont even know what youre doing here why do you want to know about vic im investigating a murder said banks eyes on adams to judge his reaction there wasnt one which was odd in itself ever heard of a man called nicholas barber nick barber sure if its the same man hes a freelance music journalist been writing about the hatters on and off for the past five years or so nice bloke thats the one is he dead then he was murdered in a cottage a little over a mile from here when was this just last week and you think i happen to know that barber was working on a feature about the mad hatters for mojo magazine he found greaves up here and came to talk to him but greaves freaked out and sent him packing he was planning on coming back but before he could he was killed and all his work notes were stolen of course hed get nothing out of vic he doesnt like talking about the old days theyre painful for him to remember if indeed he can remember much about them makes him angry does it gives him a tantrum adams leaned forward face thrust out aggressively now wait a minute you surely cant be thinking then he leaned back youve got it all wrong vics a gentle soul hes got his problems sure but he wouldnt harm a fly hes no more capable of your confidence in him is admirable but he certainly strikes me as being capable of irrational or violent behavior but why would he hurt nick barber youve just said it yourself hes not good at interaction especially with strangers or people he doesnt trust people he perceives as a threat maybe barber was after information that was painful for vic to remember something hed buried long ago adams relaxed and sat back in his chair the vinyl squeaked thats a bit fanciful if you dont mind my saying so why would vic perceive nick barber as a threat he was just another fucking music journalist for crying out loud thats what im trying to find out said banks well good luck to you but i honestly cant see you getting anywhere i think youre barking up the wrong tree on this one and besides id guess there were plenty of heavy people more interested in nick barber than vic what do you mean adams gave a twisted smile put his finger to one nostril and sniffed through the other one had quite a habit so i heard they can be very unforgiving some of those coke dealers banks made a note to check into that area of barbers life but he wasnt going to be deflected so easily did he talk to you who nick barber he was doing a feature on the hatters reunion after all it would only have been natural no he didnt i suppose he just hadnt got round to it banks said early days were you present when robin merchant drowned in the swimming pool at swainsview lodge adams looked surprised at the change of direction he took a packet of benson amp hedges from his jacket pocket and lit one not offering the packet to banks banks was grateful he might have accepted one adams inhaled noisily and the smoke curled in the dim chilly light of the pinkandgreenshaded table lamps i wasnt present at the drowning but i was in the lodge yeah asleep like everybody else like everybody else said they were and like the police and the coroner believed weve had a lot of success lately with cold cases its not a cold case its an over and done with case dead and buried history im not too sure about that said banks did you drop by to see vic last week at all i was in london most of last week for meetings with promoters i called in to see him on my way back up north what day would that be id have to check my calendar why is it important would you check please adams paused a moment obviously not used to being given orders then pulled a pda from his inside pocket isnt it wonderful modern technology he said tapping it with the stylus indeed said banks its one of the reasons weve had such a high success rate with cold cases new technology computers dna magic banks wasnt too sure about it himself though he was still trying to master a laptop computer and an ipod he hadnt got around to pdas yet adams shot him an angry glance are we talking about last week he asked yes then i would have seen him on wednesday on my way back from london id been down there since the previous weekend wednesday was there anything odd or different about his behavior anything he said no not that i noticed he was quite docile he was reading a book when i arrived he reads a lot mostly nonfiction adams gestured to the magazines books and papers as you can see he doesnt like to throw anything away he didnt tell about anything unusual or frightening happening about nick barber or anyone else coming to see him no according to john butler at mojo nick barber had tracked down vic greaves to this cottage and paid him a visit but butler hadnt known the actual day this had happened vic had freaked out refused to talk become angry and upset and barber had said he was going to try again the phone call to butler had been made on friday morning probably from the telephone box by the church if vic greaves hadnt told adams about his meeting with barber then it must have happened as late in the week as thursday perhaps and barber might have tried again on friday the day of his murder kelly soames said he had been in bed with her between two and four but that still left him virtually all day unless of course either kelly soames or chris adams was lying in which case all bets were off and of the two banks felt that while kelly soames would lie to protect herself from her father adams might have any number of less forgivable reasons for doing it where were you on friday banks asked home all weekend any witnesses sorry im afraid my wife was away visiting her mother can you give me the names and addresses of some of the people you met with in london and the hotel you were staying at banks asked am i hearing you right are you asking me for an alibi now process of elimination said banks the more people we can rule out straightaway the easier our job is bollocks said adams you dont believe me why dont you just come right out and admit it look said banks im not in the business of believing the first thing im told not by anybody id be a bloody useless detective if i were its a job nothing personal i want to get the facts straight before i come to any conclusions yeah yeah said adams tapping his way through the palmpilot and giving banks some names and numbers and i was staying at the montcalm theyll remember me i always stay there when im in town ive got a suite okay appreciate it said banks they heard a bang from upstairs adams cursed and headed out while he was gone banks took as good a look as he could around the room some of the newspapers were ten years old or more the same with the magazines which meant greaves must have brought them with him when he moved in the books were mostly biography or history one thing he did find of interest on the table half hidden under the lamp was a business card that had nick barbers chiswick address printed on it and his fordham address scribbled on the other side had barber left this for vic greaves when he paid his visit it should be possible to check it against a sample of his handwriting adams came back nothing he said his book slipped off the bed to the floor hes still out are you staying here overnight banks asked no vicll sleep right through till morning now and by then hell have forgotten whatever upset him today one of the marvels of his condition every day is a new adventure besides it wont take me too long to drive home and i have a lovely young wife waiting for me there banks wished he had someone living with him but even if he had he realized it wouldnt be possible with brian and emilia around how ironic he thought they could do whatever they wanted but he didnt feel he could spend the night with a woman in his own house while they were there chance would be a fine thing banks felt nervous about going home fearing what he might disturb hed phone them on his way when he got within mobile range just to warn them give them time to get dressed or whatever he showed adams the card i found this pushed under the lamp over there he said only the edge was showing did you put it there never seen it before said adams its nick barbers card so what that doesnt prove anything it proves he was here at least once but you already know that it also has his fordham address written on it so anyone who saw it here would know where he was staying when he was killed nice meeting you mr adams have a safe drive home im sure well be talking again soon saturday th september while chadwick was cheering on leeds united to a victory over chelsea at elland road that saturday afternoon yvonne walked over to springfield mount to meet steve and the others judy was going to make a macrobiotic meal then theyd smoke a joint or two and take the bus into town there was a bunch of stuff happening at the adelphi that night poets a blues band a jazz trio she was surprised and more than a little put out when mcgarrity opened the door but she asked for steve and he stood aside to let her in the place was unusually quiet no music or conversation yvonne went into the front room sat on the sofa and lit a cigarette glancing at the goya print which always seemed to mesmerize her a moment later mcgarrity strolled through the door with a joint in his hand and said hes not here will i do what mcgarrity put a record on and sat in the armchair opposite her he had that sort of fixed crooked smile on his face cynical and mocking that always made her feel nervous and ill at ease in his presence his pale skin was pockmarked as if hed scratched it when he had chicken pox as a child the way her mother said would happen to her and his dark hair was greasy and matted flopping over his forehead and almost covering one dark brown eye steve hes out theyre all out where are they town street shopping when will they be back i dont know maybe i should come back later no dont go so soon here he handed her the joint yvonne hesitated then put her cigarette in the ashtray accepted it and took a couple of drags a joint was a joint after all it tasted good quality stuff she recognized the music now the grateful dead china cat sunflower nice she still felt uncomfortable with the way he was looking at her though and she remembered the other night at the grove when hed touched her and whispered her name at least he didnt have his knife in his hand today he seemed normal enough still she felt edgy she shifted on the sofa and said thank you i should go now why are you being so rude youll share a joint with me but why dont you want to stay and talk to me he handed her the joint again and she took another couple of drags hoping it would set her at ease calm her down what was it about him that disturbed her so the smile the sense that behind it lay only darkness what do you want to talk about she said handing the joint back to him and picking up her cigarette again thats better i dont know lets talk about that girl who got killed last week yvonne remembered mcgarritys knife and that he had been wandering the crowds at brimleigh during the festival a terrible thought leaped into her mind surely he couldnt have she began to feel real fear now a physical sensation like insects crawling all over her skin she looked at the sleep of reason and thought she could see the bats flying around the sleeping mans head biting at his neck with vampire teeth the cat at his feet licked its lips yvonne felt an electric tingling in her arms and in the backs of her legs eelektrissattee god that hash was strong and the song had changed it wasnt china cat sunflower anymore but whats become of the baby a creepy sound montage of disembodied voices and electronic effects linda she heard herself saying in a strange distant voice that could have been someone elses what about her you met her i know you did wasnt she pretty sad isnt it but its an absurd and arbitrary world he said that sort of thing could happen to anyone anywhere anytime the pretty and the plain alike as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport not with a bang but a whimper one day youll understand have you read about those people in los angeles the rich people who got butchered one of them was pregnant you know they cut her baby out of her womb the newspapers are saying they were killed by people like us because they were rich piggies wouldnt you like to do something like that little von kill the piggies no i dont want to hurt anyone yvonne blurted out i believe in love his scythe cuts down the innocent and the guilty alike and the dead shall rise incorruptible yvonne put her hands over her ears her head was spinning stop it why because youre making me nervous why do i make you nervous i dont know but you do is it exciting what he leaned forward she could see the decay on his front teeth bared in that arrogant superior smile being nervous does it make you excited no it makes me nervous and you excited mcgarrity laughed youre not as stupid as you look are you little von even when youre stoned and here was me thinking the only reason steve wanted you was for your cunt but it is a pretty little cunt isnt it yvonne felt herself flushing to the roots of her being with anger and embarrassment mcgarrity was looking at her curiously as if she were some unusual specimen of plant life the owls in the goya print seemed to be whispering in the sleepers ear just as the songs eerie voices were whispering in her head you dont need to show me it he said ive already seen it what do you mean ive watched you with steve yvonnes jaw dropped she stubbed out her cigarette so hard the sparks burned her fingers and tried to stand up it wasnt easy somehow or other she couldnt believe how she found herself sitting down again and mcgarrity was beside her grasping her arm hard his face was so close to hers she could smell smoke and stale cheese on his breath he let go of her arm and started rolling a cigarette she thought she should make a run for it but she felt too heavy to move the joint she thought opiated hash it always did that to her gave her a heavy drifting dreamy feeling but this time the dream was turning into a nightmare he reached forward and touched her cheek with his finger just as he had done at the grove it felt like a slug yvonne he whispered what harm can it do we believe in free love dont we after all its not as if youre the only one you know her chest tightened what do you mean steve do you think youre the only pretty girl who comes around here to take her clothes off for him yvonne desperately wanted to get away from mcgarritys cloying and overbearing presence but even more desperately she wanted to know if he was telling the truth i dont believe you she said yvonne fridays and saturdays youre just his weekend hippie tuesdays and wednesdays its the lovely denise let me see now whos monday thursday and sunday is it the same one all three days or is it three different ones he was looking at her with that mocking smile on his face again stop it she said i wont believe you i want to go home she tried to rise again and proved a little more successful this time she was still dizzy though and soon fell back mcgarrity stood up and started pacing up and down muttering to himself she didnt know if it was t s eliot or the book of revelations she could see the bulge at the front of his jeans and she knew he was getting more excited every second she didnt trust him knew he had that knife somewhere unless christ he had probably had his way with linda and killed her and got rid of the knife that was why he didnt have it yvonnes mind was spinning why didnt steve and the others come home what were they doing had he killed them all was that it were they all lying upstairs in their rooms in pools of blood with flies buzzing around the ideas flashed and cracked electrically in her brain bouncing around her mind like the thunderstorm in the painting yvonne sensed that now was the time while he was distracted she went through it quickly in her head first visualizing herself do it she would have to be fast and that would be the hardest part she was still disoriented because of the hash he had drugged her with she would have only one chance get to the door get outside fast how did it open yale lock in or out in so twist to the left pull and run there would be people out there in the street in the park it was still light outside she could make it twist to the left pull and run when mcgarrity was at the far end of the room by the window his back turned to her yvonne summoned up all her energy and made a dash for the door she didnt know if he was after her or not she bounced off the walls down the hallway reached the door twisted the yale and pulled it opened daylight flooded her like warm honey she stumbled a bit on the top step but ran down the garden path and out of the gate as fast as she could she didnt look round didnt even listen for his footsteps following her she didnt know where she was running all she knew was that she had to run run run for her life chapter thirteen detective superintendent gervaise had called another progress meeting in the incident room as the boardroom had now become known for early wednesday morning the team lounged around the polished table sipping coffee from styrofoam cups and chatting about last nights television or boros prospects for the weekends football the corkboards had acquired more crime scene photographs and the names and details of various people connected with the victim were scrawled across the whiteboard annie cabbot sat next to winsome and dc galway on loan from harrogate cid and tried to digest what banks had told her over an early breakfast in the golden grill the presence in the area of two people connected with the mad hatters the band on whom nick barber had been writing a major feature seemed too much of a coincidence for her too she knew far less about the group and its history than banks did but even she could see there were a few skeletons in those closets worth shaking up a bit detective superintendent gervaise clicked in on her shiny black heels smoothed her navy pinstripe skirt and sat down at the head of the table gracing everyone with a warm smile a chorus of good morning maam rose up from the assembled officers she turned first to stefan nowak and asked if there was anything more from forensics not really said stefan naturally there are numerous fibers and hairs remaining to be analyzed the place was supposed to be thoroughly cleaned after each set of guests but nobodys that thorough weve got a list of the last ten renters from the owner so well check against their samples first it was a busy summer some of them live as far afield as germany and norway it could take a long time prints the poker was wiped clean and there are nothing but blurs around the door and conservatory entrance naturally weve found almost as many fingerprints as we have other trace evidence and itll all have to be sifted compared to existing records as i said it will take time what about dna well we did find traces of semen on the bedsheets but the dna matches that of the victim were trying to separate out any traces of female secretion but no luck so far apparently he used condoms and flushed them down the toilet he glanced toward annie for confirmation she nodded we know who this companion was dont we di cabbot yes said annie unless there was someone else which id say he hardly had time for kelly soames admits to sleeping with the victim on two occasions wednesday evening which was her night off and friday afternoon between the hours of two and four when she rearranged a dental appointment so she could visit his cottage resourceful girl superintendent gervaise reflected and dr glendenning estimates time of death between six and eight on friday he says he cant be any more precise than that replied stefan not earlier no maam all right said superintendent gervaise lets move on anything from the housetohouse nothing positive maam said winsome it was a miserable night even before the blackout and most people shut their curtains tight and stayed in except the killer yes maam in addition to the couple in the cross keys and the new zealander in the youth hostel who thought she saw a lightcolored car heading up the hill away from moorview cottage between seventhirty and sevenfortyfive we have one sighting of a darkcolored fourbyfour going up the same lane at about sixtwenty before the power cut and a white van at about eight oclock while the electricity was off according to our witnesses though neither of these stopped by the cottage not very promising is it said gervaise well one of them could have stopped further up the lane and walked back there are plenty of passing places i suppose so superintendent gervaise conceded but it was clear her heart wasnt in it oh winsome added someone says he saw a figure running across a field just after dark before the lights went out any description no maam he was closing his curtains and he thought he saw this dark figure he assumed it was someone jogging and ignored it fat thin tall short child man woman sorry maam just a dark figure which direction was the figure running banks asked winsome turned to face him the shortcut from fordham to lyndgarth sir across the fields and by the river its a popular jogging route yes but probably not after dark not in that sort of weather youd be surprised dci banks said superintendent gervaise some people take their exercise very seriously indeed do you know how many calories there are in a pint of beer everyone laughed banks wasnt convinced vic greaves didnt drive so adams had said but it wasnt very far from his cottage to fordham and that would have been the best route to take it cut the journey almost in half he made a note to get winsome to talk to this witness again or to do it himself what about this jack tanner character gervaise asked he sounded like a possible his alibi holds water said templeton weve talked to six members of his darts team and every one of them swears he was in the kings head playing darts from about six oclock until ten and i dont suppose he was drinking britvic orange either said gervaise maybe we ought to get traffic to keep an eye on mr tanner everyone laughed so do we have any promising lines of inquiry yet gervaise asked chris adams suggested that nick barber had a cocaine problem banks said im not convinced but ive put in a request for the met drugs squad to look into it but theres something else he told her about vic greavess breakdown and the drowning death of robin merchant at swainsview lodge thirtyfive years ago and the feature nick barber had been writing for mojo its a bit farfetched isnt said gervaise when he had finished ive always been a bit suspicious of events from so far in the past reaching forward into the present sounds like the stuff of television im more inclined toward the most obvious solution someone closer to hand a jilted lover cheated business partner whatever in this case perhaps some disgruntled drug dealer besides i take it this merchant business was settled at the time after a fashion said banks what are you suggesting ds templeton dug up the paperwork and it looks to have been a rather cursory investigation banks said after all a major rock star and a peer of the realm were involved meaning christ banks thought do i have to spell it out for you maam i should imagine nobody wanted a scandal that might in any way touch the establishment and make it to the house he said thered been enough of that sort of thing over the previous few years with profumo kim philby and the rest as it was the tabloids no doubt had a field day sex and drug orgies at lord jessops country manor a deeper investigation might have unearthed things nobody wanted brought to the surface oh for heavens sake banks this is paranoid conspiracy rubbish said superintendent gervaise honestly id have thought better of you well banks went on unfazed the victims personal belongings are all missing including his laptop and mobile and he was definitely silenced for good we do know that he had a laptop and mobile the girl kelly soames says she saw them when she visited him maam said annie gervaise frowned as if she had a bad taste in her mouth and tapped her pen on the blank pad in front of her people have been killed or beaten up for a mobile phone or less im still not convinced about this girl di cabbot she could be lying talk to her again see if her storys consistent surely you dont really believe that she might have killed him annie asked all im saying is that its possible but she was working in the pub at the time there are plenty of witnesses to vouch for her except when she was supposed to be going to the dentists on friday afternoon but was in actuality in bed with a man shed only just met a man who was found dead not long after the girl can obviously lie with the best of them all im saying is its suspicious di cabbot and the mo fits crime of passion maybe he slighted her asked her to do something she found repugnant perhaps she found out he had another girlfriend maybe she left the pub for a few moments later on in the dark it wouldnt have taken long that would involve some premeditation not a crime of passion maam said annie and the odds are that she would have also got some blood on her perhaps this sense of being wronged built up in her until she snapped when the lights went out and seized her opportunity before they got organized with candles i dont know all im saying is that its possible and that it makes a good deal more sense than any conspiracy rooted deep in the past either way push her a bit harder di cabbot do i make myself clear and ds nowak yes maam have a word with the pathologist dr glendenning see if you can push him a bit on time of death find out if theres any possibility that the victim could have been killed around four rather than between six and eight yes maam stefan gave annie a quick glance they both knew dr glendenning could not be pushed on anything and lets have the girls father in superintendent gervaise went on he disappeared for long enough around the time of the murder if he found out that this barber character was having casual sex with his daughter he might have taken the law into his own hands maam said annie what di cabbot its just that i sort of promised i mean i indicated to the girl to kelly that is that we had no need to tell her father about what happened apparently hes a bit of a disciplinarian and it could go badly for her all the more reason to have a close look at him it might already have gone badly for nicholas barber have you thought of that no maam you dont understand its her im worried about kelly hell hit the roof superintendent gervaise regarded annie coldly i understand perfectly well what youre saying di cabbot it serves her right for jumping into the bed with every man she sees then doesnt it with all due respect theres no evidence to suggest that she does anything of the kind she just happened to like nick barber superintendent gervaise glared at annie im not going to argue sexual mores especially with you di cabbot ask around find out the girl must have had other partners find them and find out if anyones ever paid her for it but maam annie protested thats an insult kelly soames isnt a prostitute and this case isnt about her sex life it is if i say it is i talked to calvin soames banks cut in superintendent gervaise looked over at him and in my opinion he didnt know what was going on between the victim and his daughter in your opinion yes said banks he couldnt have been hiding it he could i suppose banks admitted but if were assuming that he did it out of anger or righteous indignation i think he would have been far more likely to be wearing his heart on his sleeve he would have been angry when i was questioning his daughter about barber but he wasnt did you suggest they had slept together no said banks i merely asked her about her dealings with barber as a customer in the cross keys while her father was watching us i was watching him and i believe that if hed known there was more to it than that it would have shown in his expression his behavior or in something he said in my opinion hes not the sort of man accustomed to being sly and it didnt no very well id be more convinced however if i could witness his reaction to being told what his daughter had been up to but maam thats enough di cabbot i want you to pursue this line of inquiry until im satisfied there either is or isnt something to it itll be too late for kelly soames then annie muttered under her breath ds templeton said banks templeton sat up sir did you manage to locate detective sergeant enderby templeton shifted uneasily in his chair er yes sir i did he looked at superintendent gervaise while he was speaking what is this she asked well maam templeton said dci banks asked me to track down the detective who investigated the robin merchant drowning this is the drug addict who fell into the swimming pool thirtyfive years ago yes maam though im not certain that he was actually an addict not technically speaking superintendent gervaise sighed theatrically ran her hand over her layered blond hair then looked at banks very well dci banks i see youre hellbent and determined on following this up so ill give you the benefit of the doubt ill bear with you for the moment and assume there might be something in it but di cabbot sticks with the soameses okay fine said banks he turned to templeton well then kev where is he templeton glanced at superintendent gervaise again before answering er hes in whitby sir thats nice and handy then isnt it banks said i quite fancy a day at the seaside the sun was out again when banks began his descent from the north york moors down into whitby it was a sight that always stirred him even in the most gloomy weather but today the sky was milky blue and the sun shone on the ruined abbey high on the hill and sparkled like diamonds on the north sea beyond the dark pincers of the harbor walls retired detective inspector keith enderby lived in west cliff where the houses straggled off the a toward sandsend at least his fifties pebbledash semi had a sea view even if it was only a few square feet between the houses opposite other than that it was an unremarkable house on an unremarkable estate banks thought as he pulled up behind the gray mondeo parked at the front mondeo man a journalistically contrived representative of a certain kind of middleclass briton was that what enderby had become on the phone enderby had indicated that he was keen enough to talk about the robin merchant case and in person he welcomed banks into his home with a smile and handshake introduced his wife rita a small quiet woman with a halo of pinkishgray hair rita offered tea or coffee and banks went for tea it came with the requisite plate of chocolate digestives arrowroots and kit kats from which banks was urged to help himself he did after a few pleasantries at a nod from her husband rita made herself scarce muttering something about errands in town and drove off in the gray mondeo mondeo woman then banks thought enderby said something about what a wonderful woman she was banks agreed it seemed the polite thing to do nice place to retire to banks said how long have you been here going on for ten years now enderby said i put in my twentyfive years and a few more besides finished up as a di in south yorkshire police doncaster but rita always dreamed of living by the seaside and we used to come here for our holidays and you well the costa del sol would have suited me just fine but we couldnt afford it besides rita wont leave the country foreigners begin at calais and all that she doesnt even have a passport can you believe it you probably wouldnt have liked it there banks said too many villains whitbys all right said enderby and not short of a villain or two either i could do without all those bloody goths mind you banks knew that whitbys close association with bram stokers dracula made the place a point of pilgrimage for goths but as far as he knew they were harmless enough kids caused no trouble and if they wanted to wear black all the time and drink a little of one anothers blood now and then it was fine with him the sun flashed on the square of sea through the houses opposite i appreciate your agreeing to talk to me banks said no problem i just dont know that i can add much you dont already know it was all in the case files if youre anything like me banks said you often have a feeling call it a gut instinct or whatever that you dont think belongs in the files or a personal impression something interesting but that seems irrelevant to the actual case itself it was a long time ago enderby said i probably wouldnt remember anything like that now youd be surprised said banks it was a highprofile case i should imagine interesting times back then too rubbing shoulders with rock stars and aristos and all that oh it was interesting all right pink floyd the who i met them all more tea banks held out his cup while enderby poured his gold wedding band was embedded deeply in his pudgy finger surrounded by a tuft of hair youd have been how old then banks asked in just turned thirty that may that would be about right banks guessed enderby looked to be in his midsixties now with the comfortable paunch of a man who enjoys his inactivity and a head bereft of even a hint of a hair he made up for the lack with a gray scrubbingbrush mustache a delicate pink pattern of broken blood vessels mapped his cheeks and nose but banks put it down to blood pressure rather than drink enderby didnt talk or act like a boozer and his breath didnt smell of trebor extrastrong mints so what was it like working on that case banks asked what do you remember most about the robin merchant investigation enderby screwed up his eyes and gazed out of the window it must have been about ten oclock by the time we got to the scene he said it was a beautiful morning i do remember that clear warm birds singing and there he was floating in the pool what was your first impression enderby thought for a moment then he gave a brief barking laugh and put his cup down on the saucer do you know what it was he said youll never believe this he was on his back naked you know and i remember thinking hed got such a little prick for a famous rock star you know all the stuff we heard back then about groupies and orgies the news of the world and all that we assumed they were all hung like horses it just seemed so incongruous him floating there all shriveled like a shrimp or a seahorse or something it was the water of course no matter how warm the day was the water was still cold thatll do it every time were the others up and around when you arrived you must be joking the uniforms were just rousing them if it hadnt been for merchants drowning and our arrival theyd probably have slept until well into the afternoon they looked in pretty bad shape too some of them hungover and worse so who phoned it in the gardener when he arrived for work was he a suspect nah not really many hangerson and groupies around its hard to say according to their statements everyone was a close friend of the band i mean no one actually admitted to being a groupie or a hangeron most of the guys in the band were just with their regular girlfriends what about robin merchant was he with anyone that night there was a girl asleep in his bed said enderby girlfriend groupie according to what ive read banks said the thinking at the time was that merchant had taken some mandrax and was wandering around the pool naked when he fell in at the shallow end hit his head on the bottom and drowned is that right yes said enderby that was what it looked like and thats what the pathologist confirmed there was also a broken glass on the edge of the pool with merchants fingerprints on it hed been drinking vodka did you consider other possible scenarios such as that it wasnt accidental you mean somebody pushed him it would be a natural assumption you know what suspicious minds we coppers have true enough enderby agreed i must admit it crossed my mind but i soon ruled it out why nobody had any motive not according to what they told you we dug a bit deeper than that give us some credit we might not have had the resources youve got today but we did our best there was no friction within the band as far as i know theres always friction in bands put a group of people together with egos that big and there has to be stands to reason banks laughed then he thought of brian and wondered if the blue lamps were due for a split before too long brian hadnt said anything but banks sensed something different about him a certain lack of excitement and commitment perhaps and his turning up out of the blue like that was unusual he seemed weary and what about emilia was she the yoko ono figure still if brian wanted to talk he would get around to it in his own time there was no use in pushing him hed always been that way anything in particular he asked enderby lets see they were all worried about vic greavess drug intake for a start his performances were getting more and more erratic and his behavior was unreliable apparently hed missed a concert engagement not that long back and the rest of them were still a bit pissed off at him for leaving them in the lurch did greaves have an alibi enderby scratched the side of his nose as a matter of fact he did he said two actually two enderby grinned greaves and merchant were the only two band members who didnt have regular girlfriends that night greaves happened to be in bed with two groupies lucky devil said banks id never have thought he had it in him he remembered the bald bloated figure with the hollow eyes he had seen in lyndgarth according to them he didnt said enderby apparently he was too far gone to get it up bloody waste if you ask me they were lovelylooking girls he smiled at the memory not wearing very much either when i interviewed them thats one of the little things you dont forget in a hurry not so little either if you catch my drift could greaves not have sneaked away for a while during the night they must have both slept or passed out at some time look when you get right down to it any one of them could have done it at least anyone who could still walk in a straight line we didnt really set great store by the alibis as such for a start hardly any of them could remember much about the previous evening or even what time they finally went to bed they might have been wandering about all night for all i know and not even noticed merchant in the swimming pool so what made you rule out murder so quickly i told you no real motive no evidence that hed been pushed but merchant could have got into an argument with someone gone a bit over the top oh he could have yes but no one says he did so what are we supposed to do jump to conclusions and pick someone anyone what about an intruder couldnt be ruled out either it was easy enough to get into the grounds but again there was no evidence of an intruder and nothing was stolen besides merchants injuries were consistent with falling into a swimming pool and drowning which was what happened look if you ask me at worst it could have been a bit of stoned and drunken larking around that went wrong im not saying thats what happened because theres no proof but if they were all stoned or pissed which they were and they started running around the pool playing tag or what have you and someone tagged merchant just a bit too hard and he ended up in the pool dead well what would you do first off said banks id try to get him out of there there was no way i could be sure he was dead then id probably try artificial respiration or the kiss of life or whatever it was back then while someone called an ambulance aye said enderby and if youd had as much drugs in your system as they had youd probably have just stood there for half an hour twiddling your thumbs before doing anything and then the first thing youd have done is get rid of your stash did the drugs squad search the premises there was no mention in the file between you and me we searched the place oh we found a bit of marijuana a few tabs of lsd some mandies but nothing hard what happened we decided in the light of everything else like a body to deal with that we wouldnt bring charges we just disposed of the stuff i mean what were we to do arrest them all for possession disposed of banks doubted that consumed or sold more likely but there was no point in opening that can of worms did you get any sense that theyd cooked up a story between them no as i said half of them couldnt even remember the party it was all pretty fragmented and inconclusive lord jessop was present right right probably about the most coherent of the lot that was before he got into the hard stuff and the most influential i can see where youre going with this of course nobody wanted a scandal it was bad enough as it was maybe thats why we didnt bring drugs charges thered been enough of that over the past two or three years with the stones bust and it was all beginning to seem pretty ridiculous especially after the times ran that editorial about breaking a butterfly on a wheel within hours we had them all banging at the door and jumping over the walls the news of the world people daily mirror you name them so even if someone else had been involved in a bit of horseplay the thinking went then it had still been an accident and there was no point in inviting scandal as we couldnt prove that anyone else had been involved and no one was admitting to it that was the end of it teas done fancy another pot no thank you said banks if theres nothing more you can tell me id better be off sorry to disappoint you it wasnt disappointing look you never did really tell me what it was all about remember were in the same job or used to be banks was so used to not giving out any more information than he needed to that he sometimes forgot to say entirely why he was asking about something we found a writer by the name of nick barber dead you might have read about it sounds vaguely familiar said enderby i try to keep up what you wont have read about is that he was working on a story about the mad hatters on vic greaves and the bands early days in particular interesting said enderby but i still dont see why youre asking about robin merchants death it was just something barber said to a girlfriend banks said he mentioned something about a juicy story with a murder now youve got me interested said enderby a murder you say thats right i suppose it was probably just journalistic license trying to impress his girlfriend not necessarily said enderby what do you mean well im pretty sure that robin merchants death was accidental but that wasnt the first time i was out at swainsview lodge in connection with a suspicious death really said banks do tell enderby stood up look the suns well over the yardarm how about we head down to my local and ill tell you over a pint im driving said banks thats all right said enderby you can buy me one and watch me drink it what took you out there banks asked a murder said enderby eyes glittering a real one that time saturday th september she wont come out of her room janet chadwick said as she sat with her husband eating tea on saturday evening football results on the telly chadwick was filling in his pools coupon but it was soon clear that the jackpot was going to elude him this week just as it had every other week chadwick ate some toadinhole after giving it a liberal dip in the gravy whats wrong with her now she wont say she came dashing in late this afternoon and went straight up to her room i called to her knocked on her door but she wouldnt answer did you go in no she has to be allowed some privacy stan shes sixteen i know i know but this is unusual missing her tea like this and its saturday doesnt she usually go out saturday night yes ill have a word with her after tea be careful with her stan you know how on edge she seems these days chadwick touched his wifes wrist ill be careful im not really the terrible childgobbling monster you think i am janet laughed i dont think youre a monster shes just at a difficult age a father doesnt always understand as much as a mother does ill tread gently dont worry they finished their tea in silence and while janet went to wash the dishes chadwick went upstairs to try to talk to yvonne he tapped softly at her door but got no answer he tapped again a little louder but all he heard was a muffled go away there wasnt even any music playing yvonne must have had her transistor radio turned off another unusual sign chadwick reckoned he had two choices leave yvonne to her own devices or simply walk in janet would favor the former laissezfaire approach no doubt but chadwick was in a mood to take the bull by the horns hed had enough of yvonnes sneaking around stopping out all night her secrets and lies and primadonna behavior now was the time to see what was at the bottom of it taking a deep breath he opened the door and walked in the outrage he expected didnt come the curtains were closed the lights off giving the room a dim twilit appearance it even disguised the untidy mess of clothes and magazines on the floor and bed at first chadwick couldnt see yvonne then he realized she was on her bed under the eiderdown when his eyes adjusted he could also see that she was shaking concerned he perched on the edge of the bed and said softly yvonne yvonne sweetheart whats wrong what is it she didnt react at first and he sat patiently waiting remembering when she was a little girl and came to him when she had nightmares its all right he said you can tell me i wont be angry with you i promise her hand snaked out from under the eiderdown and sought his he held it still she said nothing then she slowly slid the cover off her face and he could see even in the weak light that she had been crying she was still shaking too what is it love he asked whats happened it was horrible she said he was horrible chadwick felt his neck muscles tense what has somebody done something to you hes ruined everything what do you mean youd better tell me from the start yvonne i want to understand honestly i do yvonne stared at him as if trying to come to a decision he knew he came across as strict and straight and unbending but he really did want to know what was upsetting her and not with a view to punishment this time whatever she thought and however difficult it was he really did love his daughter one by one the terrible possibilities crowded in on him had she found out she was pregnant was that it like linda lofthouse when she was yvonnes age or had someone assaulted her what is it he asked did somebody hurt you yvonne shook her head not like you think then she launched herself into his arms and he could feel her tears on his neck and hear her talking into his shoulder i was so scared daddy the things he was saying i really thought he was going to do something terrible to me i know he had a knife somewhere if i hadnt run away she collapsed into sobs chadwick digested what she had said trying to keep his fatherly anger at bay and gently disentangled himself yvonne lay back on her pillows and rubbed her eyes with the backs of her hands she looked like a little girl chadwick handed her the box of tissues from the dresser top start at the beginning he said slowly i was at brimleigh festival dad i want you to know that before i start im sorry for lying i knew that but dadhow call it a fathers instinct or coppers instinct he thought go on ive been hanging around with some people you wouldnt like them thats why why i didnt tell you but theyre people like me dad were into the same music and ideas and beliefs about society and stuff theyre different theyre not boring not like the kids at school they read poetry and write and play music students some of them so theyre older than you what does age matter never mind go on yvonne looked a little uncertain now and chadwick realized he would have to keep his editorial comments to a bare minimum if he hoped to get the truth from his daughter everything was fine really it was and then she started trembling again got herself under control and went on theres this man called mcgarrity hes older than the others and he acts really weird he always scared me in what way hes got this horrible twisted sort of smile that makes you feel like some sort of insect and he keeps quoting things t s eliot the bible other stuff sometimes he just paces up and down with his knife what knife hes got this knife and he keeps just you know tapping it against his palm as he walks what kind of knife is it a flickknife with a tortoiseshell handle which palm does he tap it against yvonne frowned and chadwick realized again he would have to be careful it could wait sorry he said it doesnt matter go on they say steve says hes a bit weird because he had electroshock therapy they say he used to be a great blues harmonica player but since the electric shocks he cant play anymore but i dont know he just seems weird to me is this the man who bothered you yes i went over there this afternoon to see steve hes my boyfriend but he wasnt in and only mcgarrity was there i wanted to go but he insisted i stay did he force you well i wouldnt say he forced me but i was uncomfortable i was just hoping steve and the others would get back soon thats all was he on drugs yvonne looked away and nodded okay go on he said some terrible things about what about the girl who was killed about those dead people in los angeles about me what did he say about you yvonne looked down he was rude i dont want to repeat it all right stay calm did he touch you he grabbed my arm and he touched my face he was just so frightening i was terrified he was going to do something chadwick felt his teeth grinding what happened i waited until he had his back turned to me and i ran away good girl did he come after you i dont think so i didnt look okay youre doing fine yvonne youre safe now but dad what if he what if he what was he at brimleigh yes with you no he was wandering around the field did you see him go in the woods no but it was dark most of the time i wouldnt have seen where did it happen this afternoon just down the road springfield mount look dad theyre all right really the others steve its just him theres something wrong with him im sure of it did he know linda lofthouse linda i dont yes yes he did chadwicks ears pricked up at the familiarity with which yvonne mentioned lindas name how do you know its all right yvonne you can tell me the truth im not going to be angry with you promise cross my heart and hope to die yvonne smiled it was an old ritual it was at another house on bayswater terrace she said theres three places people like gather to listen to music and stuff springfield mount and carberry place are the other two anyway sometime during the summer i was with steve and linda was there mcgarrity too i mean they didnt know one another they werent close or anything but he had met her chadwick paused a moment to take it all in bayswater terrace dennis julie and the rest so yvonne was part of that crowd his own daughter he held himself in check remembering hed promised not to be angry besides the poor girl had been through a trauma and it had taken a lot for her to open up the last thing she needed now was a lecture from her father but it was hard to keep his rage inside he felt so wound up so tight that his chest ached you met linda too he asked yes tears filled yvonnes eyes once we didnt talk much really she just said she liked my dress and my hair and we talked about what a drag school can be she was so nice dad how could anyone do that to her i dont know sweetheart chadwick said stroking his daughters silky blond hair i dont know do you think it was him mcgarrity i dont know that either but im going to have to have a talk with him dont be too hard on steve or the others dad please theyre all right really they are its only him only mcgarrity whos weird i understand said chadwick how do you feel now about getting up and having something to eat im not hungry well at least come downstairs and see your mother shes worried sick about you okay said yvonne but give me a few minutes to get changed and wash my face right you are sweetheart chadwick kissed the top of her head left the room and headed for the telephone jaw set hard later tonight someone was going to be very sorry he had ever been born chapter fourteen annie cabbot tried to control her temper as she waited to knock and enter detective superintendent gervaises office after banks had left for whitby it was difficult she had sensed that gervaise hadnt liked her from the start and sussed her as another ambitious woman who got where she was the hard way who was damned if she was going to give any other woman anything less than her worst so much for female solidarity annie took several deep calming breaths the way she did when she was meditating or practicing yoga it didnt work she knocked anyway and entered even before the slightly puzzled voice called out enter id like a word maam said annie di cabbot please sit down annie sat she remembered how she had always felt slightly awed and nervous when detective superintendent gristhorpe had called her into this same office but this time she felt nothing of the kind what can i help you with you were seriously out of order back there annie said at the morning briefing i was gervaise feigned surprise at least annie believed it was feigned you have no right to make public comments about my private life superintendent gervaise held her hand up now lets wait a moment before we go any further just exactly what was it i said that has upset you so much you know damn well what it was maam we dont seem to be getting off on the right foot here do we you said you had no desire to argue sexual mores especially with me these meetings arent a forum for argument di cabbot theyre called to bring everyone uptodate and set the scene for more actions and lines of inquiry you know that yet you deliberately insulted me in front of my colleagues superintendent gervaise regarded her as she might a particularly troublesome schoolgirl well seeing as were on the subject she said you do have something of a checkered history with us dont you annie said nothing let me remind you youd not been in north yorkshire five minutes before you were jumping into bed with dci banks and let me also remind you that fraternizing between fellow officers is seriously frowned upon and liaisons between a ds as you were then and a dci are particularly fraught with dangers as im sure you found out he was your superior officer what were you thinking of annie felt her heart beating hard in her chest my private life is my affair youre not a stupid woman superintendent gervaise went on i know that we all make mistakes and theyre rarely fatal she paused but your last one was wasnt it your last mistake almost cost dci banks his life we werent involved in anything then annie said aware as she spoke of how weak her response sounded i know that gervaise shook her head di cabbot im not entirely certain how youve managed to last here so long let alone how you were promoted to di so quickly in the first place things must have been very easygoing around here back then or perhaps dci banks had a certain amount of influence with the acc annie felt her heart about to explode at the insult but a dreadful calm flooded her disconcerting at first like a sort of cooling numbness in her blood a fallingaway of feeling then it warmed a little transformed into a calm altered state it didnt matter whatever superintendent gervaise thought said or did it didnt matter annie cared about her career but there were some things she just wouldnt take not for anything not from anyone and that knowledge made her feel free she almost smiled gervaise must have sensed some change in the air because there was a new edge to her voice when she noticed she wasnt getting the desired response from annie anyway in case you havent noticed it things have changed around here now i wont countenance romantic relationships among my officers theyre distracting and sow the seeds for all kinds of mistakes and future difficulties as you have discovered and in the future i would strongly suggest that you think again about continuing your relationship with dci banks did gervaise really believe that annie and banks had got back together why had someone told her a few moments ago annie would have leaped out of her seat and throttled gervaise at such words but now she took it all in calmly the superintendent had also known about banks having a pint in the cross keys on the night of the murder who had told her about that was there a spy in their midst annie didnt react di cabbot sorry said annie i was miles away thats very irresponsible of you you come barging in here telling me im not doing my job properly and the minute you realize youre in the wrong you start daydreaming it wasnt that annie said are we finished here not until i say we are maam this other business kelly soames its not other business said annie its all connected what do you mean i defended kelly soamess sexual mores so you attacked mine its connected i thought wed left that behind look you want me to subject the poor girl to the ordeal of her father finding out shed had a sexual relationship with nick barber and i said id given her some assurances that wouldnt happen those assurances werent yours to give im aware of that even so you can hardly attack me for wanting to stand by my word admirable as that may seem its not workable here this job isnt about saving your conscience and keeping your promises i want that girl confronted with what happened in the presence of her father and if you wont do it ill find someone who will what is it with you are you a sadist or something gervaises lips narrowed in a nasty smile im a professional detective just doing her job she said which is something you should take a little more seriously sympathy for victims is all very well in its place but remember that nicholas barber is the victim here not kelly soames not yet said annie insubordination will get you nowhere no but it feels good annie stood up to leave theres obviously no further point talking to you so if youre thinking of taking action against me do it i dont care either shit or get off the pot gervaises face fell what did you say annie walked toward the door you heard me she said right said superintendent gervaise i want you on statement reading as of now and send in ds templeton yes maam said annie and shut the door softly behind her as she left templeton now that made sense sunday st september chadwick went in with the springfield mount team because that was the house where yvonne had been accosted by mcgarrity two other teams also with search warrants carried out simultaneous raids on bayswater terrace and carberry place they waited until well after midnight by which time yvonne was fast asleep in bed as any prior announcement of their presence was likely to result in drugs being flushed down the toilet they were authorized to enter by force the streets were deserted most of the houses in darkness apart from the lonely light of an insomniac here and there or a student burning the midnight oil a sheen of rain reflected the amber streetlights on the pavements and tarmac directly across from springfield mount was a small triangular park locked up for the night wedged between two merging main roads at the end of the street across the road loomed the local grammar school all in darkness now with its bell tower and high windows the unmarked police car pulled up at the end of the street behind a patrol car there were five officers altogether chadwick bradley and three uniforms one of whom would guard the back geoff broome was leading the carberry team and his colleague martin young the raid on bayswater terrace they didnt expect any resistance or problems except perhaps from mcgarrity if he had his knife chadwick could hear music coming from the front room and candlelight flickered behind the curtains good someone was at home surprise was of the essence now when everyone was in position chadwick gave a nod to the uniform with the battering ram and one smash was enough to break the lock and send the door banging back on its hinges as arranged the two uniformed constables dashed upstairs to secure the upper level and chadwick and bradley entered the front room the officer on guard at the back would take care of the kitchen in the living room chadwick found three people lying on the floor in advanced stages of intoxication marijuana judging by the smell that even two smoldering joss sticks couldnt mask candles flickered and dreadful wailing electric guitar music came from the record player a kangaroo with a pain in its testicles by the sound of it chadwick thought it didnt look as if their arrival had interrupted any deep conversations or any conversations at all for that matter as they all seemed beyond speech and one of them could only manage a quick what the fuck before chadwick announced who he was and told them the police were there to search the premises for drugs and for a knife that may have been used in the committing of a homicide bradley switched on the electric light and turned the music off things didnt look so bad chadwick realized with surprise not what he had expected just three scruffy longhaired kids lounging around stoned listening to what passed for music there was no orgy nobody was crawling around naked and drooling on the floor or committing outrageous sex acts then he saw the lp cover leaning against the wall it showed a girl with long wavy red hair and full red lips she was naked from the belly button up and she couldnt have been more than eleven or twelve in her hands she cradled a chrome model airplane what kind of perverts was he dealing with chadwick wondered and one of them had been seeing his daughter this was where yvonne would have been tonight had mcgarrity not scared her off this was what she would have been doing she had been here before done this and that set his teeth on edge bradley took their names steve morrison todd crowley and jacqueline mcneil they all seemed docile and sheepish enough chadwick took steve aside to a corner of the room and gripped the front of his shirt in his fist whatever comes of this he hissed i want you to stop seeing my daughter understand steve turned pale who who am i supposed to be seeing her names yvonne yvonne chadwick shit i didnt know she just stay away from her okay steve nodded and chadwick let him go right he said turning to the others wheres mcgarrity dunno said todd crowley he was here earlier maybe hes upstairs what were you doing nothing just listening to music chadwick gestured toward the lp cover where did you get that filth what the naked child you realize we could probably prosecute you under the obscene publications act dont you thats art man crowley protested you can buy it at any record shop obscenitys in the eye of the beholder there were greasy fishandchip wrappers and newspapers on the floor beside empty bottles of beer bradley went over to the ashtray and extracted the remains of a number of handrolled cigarettes he identified by their smell as being a mix of tobacco and hash that in itself was enough to charge them with possession what the hell did yvonne see in this dump chadwick wondered why did she come here was her life at home so bad was she so desperate to get away from him and janet but there was no point trying to work it out as enderby had said it was probably down to freedom chadwick heard a brief scuffle and a bang upstairs followed by a series of loud thumps each one getting closer when he went to the foot of the stairs he saw the two uniformed constables one without his hat holding the arms of a man who was struggling to get up he didnt want to come with us sir one of the officers said it looked as if they had held his arms and dragged him down the stairs backward which shouldnt have done much damage to anything except his dignity and maybe his tailbone chadwick watched as the unruly blackclad figure with the lank dark hair and pockmarked face got to his feet and dusted himself off the superior smirk already back in place if indeed it had ever been gone well well well he said mr mcgarrity i assume ive been wanting a word with you enderbys local two streets down was like his house comfortable and unremarkable it was a relatively new building late sixties from its low squat shape and the large picture windows facing the sea the advantages from bankss point of view were that it was practically empty at that time in the afternoon and they sold caskconditioned tetleys one pint wouldnt do him any harm he decided as he bought the drinks at the bar and carried them over enderby looked at him thought your resolve might weaken it often does banks admitted nice view enderby took a sip of beer mmm the window looked out over the glittering north sea dotted here and there with fishing boats and trawlers whitby was still a thriving fishing town banks reminded himself even if the whaling industry it had grown from was long extinct captain cook had got his seafaring start in whitby and his statue stood on top of west cliff close to the jawbone of a whale when did this real murder happen banks asked september the year before in by christ banks youre taking me on a hell of a trip along memory lane today i havent thought about that business in years banks knew all about trips down memory lane having not so long ago looked into the disappearance of an old schoolfriend whose body was found buried in a field outside peterborough sometimes as he got older it seemed as if the past was always overwhelming the present who was the victim a woman young girl really called linda lofthouse lovely girl funny i can still picture her there halfcovered by the sleeping bag that white dress with the flowers embroidered on the front she had a flower painted on her face too a cornflower she looked so peaceful she was dead of course someone had grabbed her from behind and stabbed her so viciously he cut off a piece of her heart he gave a little shudder someones just walked over my grave how was swainsview lodge involved in all this im getting to that the murder took place at a rock festival in brimleigh glen the body was found on the field by one of the volunteers cleaning up after it was all over the evidence showed that she was killed in brimleigh woods nearby and then moved it was only made to look as if she was killed on the field i know brimleigh glen said banks he had taken his wife sandra and the children brian and tracy on picnics there shortly after they had moved to eastvale but i know nothing about any festival probably before your time here said enderby first weekend of september not so long after woodstock and the isle of wight it wasnt one of the really big ones it was overshadowed by the others and it was also the only one they ever held there who played the biggest names at the time were led zeppelin pink floyd and fleetwood mac the others maybe you remember family the incredible string band roy harper blodwyn pig colosseum the liverpool scene edgar broughton and the rest the usual latesixties festival lineup banks knew all those names even had a number of their cds or used to have he would have to work harder at building up his collection again instead of just buying new stuff or recent reissues he needed to make a note whenever he missed something he used to have how were the mad hatters involved he asked they were one of the two local bands to play there along with jan dukes de grey the hatters were just getting big at the time in late and it was a pivotal gig for them youve followed their career since then said banks enderby raised his glass of course i was more into blues back then still am really but i got all their records i mean i met them got a signed album it was a big thrill even if i didnt get to keep it he smiled at a distant memory why didnt you get to keep it di chadwick took it for his daughter good lord chiller chadwick i havent thought of him in years what a cold hard bastard he was to work for tough scot exarmy hard as nails the old school you know stickler for detail always perfectly turned out you could see your reflection in his brogues that sort of thing im afraid i was a bit of a rebel back then let my hair grow down to my collar he didnt like it one bit good detective though i learned a lot from chiller chadwick and he did apologize about the lp ill give him that what happened to him no idea retired i suppose maybe dead now he was quite a few years older than me fought in the war and he was with west yorkshire see leeds they didnt reckon wed got anyone bright enough up here to solve a murder and they might have been right at that anyway i heard there was some sort of trouble with his daughter and it affected his health what sort of trouble i dont know she went away to stay with relatives i never met her i think perhaps she was a bit of a wild child though and he wouldnt stand for that wouldnt chiller you know what some of the kids were like back then smoking marijuana dropping acid sleeping around anyway whatever it was he kept it under his hat you should talk to his driver if hes still around whos that young lad called bradley simon bradley he was a dc then chillers driver but now who knows probably a chief constable why do you say that bit of an arselicker they always get ahead dont they what was chadwicks first name stanley banks thought that templeton or winsome ought to be able to track simon bradley down easily enough and if leeds was involved he might be able to enlist the help of di ken blackstone to find out about chadwick he offered enderby another drink which enderby accepted bankss pint glass fortunately was still half full i take it this murder was solved banks asked when he returned with the drink oh yes we got him all right so back to how the mad hatters and swainsview lodge were involved oh yes forgot about that didnt i well vic greaves was the victims cousin see and hed arranged for her and her friend to get backstage passes for the festival while she was backstage during led zeppelins performance on the last night this cousin linda lofthouse decided to take a walk in the woods by herself thats where she was killed any sexual motive she wasnt raped if thats what you mean they did find some semen on the back of her dress though so what he did obviously gave him some sort of thrill secretor mind you it was a common enough blood group a if i remember correctly same as the victims we didnt have dna and all that fancy forensic technology back then so we had to rely on good oldfashioned police work did you recover the murder weapon eventually complete with traces of group a blood and the killers fingerprints very handy i suppose he could have argued that it was his own blood it was his knife after all he could have but he didnt our forensics blokes were good they also found traces of white fiber and a strand of dyed cotton wedged between the blade and the handle these were eventually linked to the victims dress there was no doubt about it the dye on its own was enough seems pretty much cut and dried then it was i told you anyway a week or so later the mad hatters were up at swainsview rehearsing for a tour so that was the first time i went there and met them tell me a little bit more about the personalities involved well vic greaves was mad as a hatter no doubt about it when we tried to talk to him at swainsview lodge he was practically incoherent you know hed keep going like if you go down to the woods today remember the teddy bears picnic banks did remember he had even heard another version of it recently when vic greaves said to him vics gone down to the woods today coincidence he would have to find out greaves hadnt been particularly coherent during the rest of their chat in lyndgarth the other day either was he on drugs at the time banks asked he was on something thats for certain most of the people around him said he took lsd like it was smarties maybe he did what about the rest of them the others werent too bad adrian pritchard the drummer was a bit of a wild man you know wrecking hotel rooms on tour getting into fights and that sort of thing but he settled down reg cooper of course well he was the quiet one he became one of the best most respected guitarists in the business great songwriter too along with terry watson the rhythm guitarist and lead singer he pushed the band in a more pop direction robin merchant always seemed the brightest of the bunch to me though he was educated well read articulate but a bit weird in his tastes you know he was into all that occult stuff magic tarot astrology aleister crowley carlos castaneda but lots of them were back then what about chris adams seemed a nice enough bloke both occasions i met him a bit straighter than the rest maybe but still one of the beautiful people if you catch my drift did they all take drugs they all smoked a lot of dope and did acid robin merchant obviously got into mandies in a big way and later both reg cooper and terry watson had their problems with heroin and coke but theyre clean now as far as i know have been for years im not sure about chris i dont think he was as much into it as the rest of them probably had to keep his wits about him for all the organizing managers have to do i suppose so said banks are you still in touch good lord no they wouldnt know me from adam the bumbling awestruck young detective who came around asking bothersome questions they didnt even remember me from the first time when i went there over robin merchants death but i tried to keep up with their careers you know you do when youve actually met someone as famous as that dont you i got to meet pink floyd you know and the nice roy harper too now he was stoned they live in los angeles these days most of the mad hatters except tania i think tania hutchison the singer they brought in after merchant died and vic greaves drifted off yes beautiful girl absolutely stunning banks remembered lusting after tania hutchison when hed watched her on the old grey whistle test in the early seventies every young male did i seem to remember reading that she lives in oxfordshire or somewhere like that banks said yes the proverbial country manor well she can afford it you actually met her i thought she came on the scene much later after all that mess with merchant and greaves sort of see she was the managers girlfriend at the time chris adams she was with him when we went to investigate robin merchants drowning they were in bed together at the time i interviewed her the next morning she wasnt looking her best of course a bit the worse for wear but she still put the rest to shame so tania and chris adams provided one another with alibis yes and you had no reason to disbelieve them like i said before i had no real reason to disbelieve any of them how long had she known adams and the group i cant say for certain but shed been around for a while before merchant died enderby said i know she was at the brimleigh festival with linda lofthouse they were friends i reckon that was where adams met her she and linda lived in london notting hill practically flatmates and they played and sang together in local clubs folk sort of stuff interesting said banks ill have to have a look into this linda lofthouse business well it was a murder but theres no mystery about it oh i dont know said banks and theres still the little matter of who killed nick barber and why sunday st september chadwick could tell right from the start that mcgarrity was not like the others who had been quickly bound over to appear before the magistrate first thing monday morning and released on police bail no mcgarrity was another kettle of fish entirely for a start like rick hayes he was older than the rest probably in his early to midthirties chadwick estimated he also had the unmistakable shiftiness of a habitual criminal and a pallor that experience had taught chadwick came only from spending time in prison there was something sly about him behind the smirk and a deadness in his eyes that gave off danger signals just the kind of nutter who likely killed linda lofthouse chadwick reckoned now all he needed was a confession and evidence they were sitting in a stark windowless room redolent of other mens sweat and fear the ceiling filmed brownishyellow from years of cigarette smoke on the scarred wooden desk between them sat a battered and smudged green tin ashtray bearing the tetleys name and logo dc bradley sat in a corner to the left of and behind mcgarrity taking notes chadwick intended to conduct this preliminary interview himself but if he met stubborn opposition he would bring in someone else later to help him chip away at the suspects resistance it had worked before and it would work again he was certain even with as slipperylooking a customer as mcgarrity name he asked finally patrick mcgarrity date of birth the sixth of january im capricorn good for you ever been in prison patrick mcgarrity just stared at him not to worry said chadwick well find out one way or another do you know why youre here because you bastards smashed the door down in the middle of the night and brought me here good guess i suppose you know we found drugs in the house mcgarrity shrugged nothing to do with me as a matter of fact chadwick went on they do have something to do with you my officers found a significant amount of cannabis resin in the same room where they found you asleep over two ounces in fact easily enough to sustain a dealing charge that wasnt mine it wasnt even my room i was just crashing there for the night whats your address im a free spirit i go where i choose no fixed abode then place of employment mcgarrity emitted a harsh laugh unemployed do you claim benefits silence ill take it that you do then otherwise there might be charges under the vagrancy act mcgarrity leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs his clothes looked old and worn like a tramps chadwick noticed not like the bright peacock fashions the others favored and everything he wore was black or close to it look he said why dont you just cut the crap and get it over with if youre going to charge me and put me in a cell do it all in good time patrick all in good time back to the cannabis where did it come from ask your pig friends they must have planted it nobody planted anything where did it come from i dont know okay tell me about this afternoon what about it what did you do i dont remember not much read a book went for a walk do you remember receiving a visitor cant say as i do a young woman no chadwicks muscles were aching from keeping the rage inside he felt like flinging himself across the table and strangling mcgarrity with his bare hands a woman you terrorized and assaulted i didnt do any such thing you deny the young woman was in the house i dont remember seeing anyone chadwick stood up so quickly he knocked over his chair ive had enough of this constable he said to bradley take him down and lock him up he glared at mcgarrity for a second before he left and said well talk again and the next time it wont be so polite outside in the corridor he leaned against the wall and took several deep breaths his heart was beating like a steam piston inside his chest and he could feel his skin burning slowly as he mopped his brow the rage subsided he straightened his tie and jacket and walked back to his office chapter fifteen detective sergeant kevin templeton relished his latest assignment and even more he relished the fact that winsome was to accompany him as an observer even though he had got nowhere with winsome not for lack of trying he still found her incredibly attractive and the sight of her thighs under the taut material of her pinstripe trousers still brought him out in a sweat hed always thought of himself as a breast man but winsome had soon put the lie to that he tried not to make his glances obvious as she drove out of town and on to the main lyndgarth road the farmhouse was at the end of a long muddy track and no matter how close to the door they parked there was no way of avoiding getting their shoes muddy christ it bloody stinks here dunnit templeton moaned its a farmyard said winsome yeah i know that look let me do the questioning right and you keep a close eye on the father okay templeton hopped on one leg by the doorway trying to wipe some of the mud off his best pair of converse trainers theres a shoe scraper said winsome what she pointed that thing there with the raised metal edge by the door its for scraping the mud off the undersides of your shoes well you live and learn said templeton making a try at the shoe scraper whatever will they think of next they thought of it a long time ago said winsome i know that i was being sarcastic yes sir nearby a dog was growling and barking fit to kill but luckily it was chained up to a post templeton shot winsome a glance no need for you to be sarcastic as well dont think i didnt catch your tone are you okay with the way the super wants us to play it im fine templetons eyes narrowed am i to take it you dont but before he could finish the door opened and calvin soames stood there police isnt it he said what do you want this time just come to clear a couple of things up mr soames said templeton bringing out his best smile and offering his hand soames ignored it is your daughter at home soames grunted all right if we come in wipe your feet and with that he turned back into the gloom and left them to their own devices after further wiping their feet on a bristly mat they followed him into the inner recesses of the house and heard him call out kelly its for you the girl came downstairs and her face registered disappointment when she saw templeton and winsome standing there in the hallway youd better come through she said leading them into the kitchen which was marginally brighter and smelled of bleach and overripe bananas a blackandwhite cat stirred lazily jumped off its chair and sidled out of the room they all sat on sturdy hardbacked chairs around the table calvin soames muttered something about work and headed out but templeton called him back this concerns you too mr soames he said please sit down soames let a moment pass then he sat whats this all about asked kelly ive told you everything already well thats just it you see said templeton being the untrusting detectives that we are we dont take anything at face value or on first account its like first impressions see they can so often be wrong any chance of a cup of tea ill put the kettle on said kelly she was definitely fit templeton thought as he watched her move toward the range with just the barest swinging of her hips encased in tight jeans her waist was slender as a wand and she wore a jet bellypiercing which made a nice contrast to her pale skin her blond hair was tied back but a few tresses had escaped and framed her pale oval face her breasts moved tantalizingly under the short yellow tshirt and templeton guessed that she wasnt wearing a bra lucky bugger that barber templeton thought if the last thing on earth he had done was shag kelly soames then it cant have been such a bad way to go he began to wonder if perhaps when theyd got this business over and done with he might be in with a chance himself when the tea was served winsome took out her notebook and templeton sat back in his chair right he said now you mr soames returned back here at about seven oclock on friday evening am i right thats right to check if youd turned off the gas ring its sometimes on so low he answered that a puff of air would blow it out a couple of times ive come home and smelled gas i thought it best to check as i dont live far from the cross keys about a fiveminute drive each way is that right about that aye and you miss soames you were working at the cross keys all evening right kelly chewed her thumbnail and nodded how long have you been working there about two years now theres not much else to do around here ever thought of moving to the big city kelly looked at her father and said no nice place to work is it the cross keys its all right good spot to meet lads i dont know what you mean oh come on kelly youre a barmaid you must meet lots of lads get chatted up a lot nicelooking girl like you she blushed at that and the ghost of a smile crossed her face templeton noticed maybe he was in with a chance after all as calvin soames looked on the frown deepened on his forehead in a series of lines down to the bridge of his nose do they tell you their troubles templeton went on how their wives dont understand them and theyre wasted on the jobs theyre doing kelly shrugged sometimes she said when its quiet what do you do for fun dunno go out with my mates i suppose but where do you go theres not exactly a lot for a young girl to do around here is there it cant be very exciting theres eastvale oh yes im sure you enjoy a saturday night out in eastvale with the lads listening to dirty jokes getting bladdered and puking your guts up with the rest of them around the market cross no i mean a girl like you there must be something better something more surely theres dances sometimes and bands kelly said who do you like dunno come on you must have a favorite she shifted in her chair i dunno really keane maybe ah keane you know them ive heard them said templeton nick barber was really into bands wasnt he kelly seemed to tense up again he said he liked music she said didnt he say he could get you into all the best concerts down in london i dont think so ive never been to london templeton felt winsomes gaze boring into the side of his head her legs were crossed and one of them was twitching she clearly didnt like the way he was drawing the interview out postponing the moment of glory but he was enjoying himself he closed in for the kill did nick barber promise to take you there no kelly shook her head panic showing on her face why would he do that gratitude perhaps calvin soamess face darkened what are you saying man templeton ignored him well kelly i dont know what youre on about i only talked to him at the bar when he ordered his drink he was nice polite thats all oh come off it kelly said templeton we happen to know that you slept with him on two occasions what calvin soames tried to get to his feet but templeton gently pushed him back down please stay where you are mr soames whats this all about soames demanded whats going on wednesday evening and friday afternoon templeton went on a bit of afternoon delight beats the dentists any day id say kelly was crying now and her father was fast turning purple with fury is this true kelly he asked is what hes saying true kelly buried her face in her hands i feel sick she said between her fingers is this true her father demanded yes all right damn you yes she said glaring at templeton then she turned to her father he fucked me daddy i let him fuck me i liked it you whoring slut soames raised his hand to slap her but winsome grabbed it first not a good idea mr soames she said templeton looked at soames are you telling me you didnt already know this mr soames he said soames bared his teeth if idve known id have youd have what templeton asked shoving his face close to soamess beat up your daughter killed nick barber what you heard me is that what you did you found out what kelly had been doing and you waited until she was back working behind the bar then you made an excuse to leave the pub for a few minutes you went to see barber what happened did he laugh at you did he tell you how good she was or did he say she meant nothing to him just another shag was the bed still warm from their lovemaking you hit him over the head with a poker maybe you didnt mean to kill him maybe something just snapped inside you it happens but there he was dead on the floor is that how it happened calvin if you tell us now itll go better for you im sure a judge and jury will understand a fathers righteous anger kelly lurched over to the sink and just made it in time winsome held her shoulders as the girl heaved well said templeton am i right soames deflated into a sad defeated old man all the anger drained out of him no he said without inflection i didnt kill anyone i had no idea he looked at kelly bent over the sink tears in his eyes not till now shes no better than her mother was he added bitterly nobody said anything for a while kelly finished vomiting and winsome poured her a glass of water they sat down at the table again her father wouldnt look at her finally templeton got to his feet well mr soames he said if you change your mind you know where to get in touch with us and in the meantime as they say in the movies dont leave town he pointed at kelly nor you young lady but nobody was looking at him or paying attention they were all lost in their own worlds of misery pain and betrayal that would pass though templeton knew and hed see kelly soames again under better circumstances he was certain of it outside at the car dodging the puddles and mud as best he could templeton turned to winsome rubbed his hands together and said well i think that went pretty well what do you think winsome do you think he knew banks had a great deal of information to digest he thought as he parked down by the coop store at the inner harbor and walked toward the shops and restaurants of west cliff he passed a reconstruction of the yellowandblack hms grand turk used in the hornblower tv series and stood for a moment admiring the sails and rigging what a hell of a life it must have been at sea back then he thought maybe not so bad if you were an officer but for the common sailor the bad maggotinfested food the floggings the terrible wounds of battle butchery thinly disguised as surgery of course hed got most of his ideas from hornblower and master and commander but they seemed pretty accurate to him and if they werent how would he know thinking back on what keith enderby had just told him he realized he would have been living in notting hill at around the same time as linda lofthouse and tania hutchison he was sure he would have remembered seeing someone as beautiful as tania even though she wasnt famous then but he couldnt there were he remembered a lot of beautiful young women in colorful clothes around at the time and he had met his fair share of them but tania and linda would have moved in very different circles banks didnt know anyone in a band for a start he paid for all his concert tickets like everyone else he knew he also didnt have the musical talent to perform in local clubs though he often went to listen to those who did but most of all perhaps was that he had always felt like an outsider had felt somehow merely on the fringes of it all he never wore his hair too long couldnt get much beyond wearing a flowered shirt or tie let alone caftans and beads couldnt bring himself to join in the political demonstrations and most times he found himself involved in any sort of counterculture conversation he thought it all sounded simplistic childish and boring banks leaned on the railing and watched the fishing boats bobbing at anchor in the harbor then he walked to a café he remembered that served excellent fish and chips one thing you could usually rely on in whitby he went into the café which was almost empty and ordered a pot of tea and jumbo haddock and chips with bread and butter for chip butties from a bored young waitress in a black apron and white blouse he sat down at the window which looked out over the harbor to the old part of town with its steps leading up to the ruined abbey and st marys church where the salt wind had robbed the tombstones of their names a group of young goths all black clothes white faces and intricate silver jewelry walked by the sheds where the fishermen unloaded their boats and sold their catch from what banks had read about them and the music he had heard they seemed obsessed with death and suicide as well as with the undead and the dark side in general but they were passive and pacifist and concerned with social matters such as racism and war banks liked joy division and he had heard them described as the archetypal goth band on balance he thought goths were no weirder than the hippies had been with their fascination with the occult poetry and druginduced enlightenment the year was a period of great transition for banks after leaving school with a couple of decent a levels he was living in a bedsit in notting hill and taking a course in business studies in london he hadnt felt much in common with his fellow students though so he had tended to fall in with a crowd from the art college two of whom lived together in the same building as him and they formed his real introduction rather late in the day to that strange blend of existentialism communalism hedonism and narcissism that was his take on latesixties culture they shared joints with him and jem from across the hall went to concerts and poetry readings discussed squatters rights vietnam and oz and played alices restaurant over and over again banks had no idea what to do with his life his parents had made it clear that they wanted him to have a crack at a whitecollar career rather than ending up in the brick factory or the sheetmetal factory like his father so business studies seemed like a logical step and he did so much need to escape the stifling provinciality of peterborough he loved the music and had hitchhiked with his first real girlfriend kay summerville to the blind faith concert in hyde park the summer of that year when he was still living at home in peterborough and to the rolling stones concert in memory of brian jones at which mick jagger freed all the caged butterflies that hadnt already died from the heat he also remembered dylan at the isle of wight coming on late and singing she belongs to me and to ramona two of bankss favorites but in peterborough he had been fairly isolated from the trendy fashions causes and ideologies of the times embarrassingly ignorant of what was really happening out there for all the hypedup change and revolution of the decade it was a salutary lesson to bear in mind that strawberry fields forever was kept from reaching number one by engelbert humperdincks release me and growing up in peterborough you could easily see why that first college year he remembered following with horror the saga of the manson family eventually arrested for the murders of sharon tate leno labianca and others it had all passed into the history books now of course but then as the story unfolded day by day in the newspapers and on television and as the real horrors came to light it had a powerful impact not least because the manson family seemed a bit like hippies and quoted the beatles and revolutionary slogans and then there were the girls mansons love slaves with strange names like patricia krenwinkel squeaky fromme and leslie van houten the way they dressed and wore their hair they might have been living in notting hill the famous photo of the bearded staring manson had given banks almost as many nightmares as the one of christine keeler sitting naked on a chair had prompted wet dreams altamont had taken place in late too he remembered where someone was stabbed by a hells angel during the stones performance there were other things he vaguely remembered the police charging a house in piccadilly to evict squatters rioting in northern ireland stories of women and children murdered by american troops in my lai violent antiwar protests four students shot by the national guard at kent state maybe it was hindsight but things seemed to be taking a turn for the worse back then falling apart or perhaps that had been happening for a while and he had only just noticed because he was there in the thick of it he probably wouldnt have noticed the change in political climate if hed stayed in peterborough perhaps the business career would have worked out if he hadnt got caught up in the tail end of the sixties in notting hill as it was by the end of his first year he had lost all interest in cost accounting industrial psychology and mercantile law but he had no memory of hearing about the murder of a girl at a festival in yorkshire back then the provinces especially in the north were of little interest to those at the center of things and local police forces worked far more independently of one another than they did today he wondered if enderby was right about linda lofthouses murder being the one nick barber had referred to he had been so certain it was robin merchant and he still wasnt ruling that possibility out but the news about linda lofthouse brought a whole new complexion to things even if her murder had been solved was the killer still in jail if not could he somehow be involved in nick barbers death the more banks thought about it no matter what catherine gervaise said the more he thought he was right and that barber had died for digging up the past which that someone wanted to remain buried banks noticed a few clouds drift in from the east as he ate his haddock and chips and by the time he had finished it was starting to drizzle he paid left a small tip and headed for his car before he set off he phoned ken blackstone in leeds and asked him to find out what he could about stanley chadwick and the linda lofthouse investigation sunday st september steve answered the door late that sunday afternoon and when he saw yvonne standing there he turned away and walked down the hall i never thought id see you again he said youve got a bloody nerve showing up here yvonne followed him into the living room but steve it wasnt my fault it was mcgarrity he tried to force himself on me hes dangerous youve got to believe me i didnt know what to do steve turned to face her so you went straight to daddy i was upset i didnt know what i was doing you never told me your father was a pig you never asked besides what does it matter what does it matter he violated our space him and the others we got busted thats what matters now were going to have to go to court tomorrow morning ill get a fine at least and if my parents find out im fucked theyll stop my allowance thats all down to you but it wasnt my fault steve im sorry really i am i didnt know they were going to bust you yvonne moved toward him and reached out to touch him he jerked away and sat down in the armchair oh come off it you must have known damn well wed be sitting around here smoking a few joints and listening to music its not as if you havent done it with us often enough yvonne knelt at his feet but i never sent them here honestly i thought they would just arrest mcgarrity thats all you know id never do anything to get you in trouble then youre more stupid than i thought you were look im sorry but i dont want you coming around here anymore whether you wanted to or not youve brought nothing but trouble who knows who might follow you yvonnes heart pounded in her chest she still had one card to play mcgarrity told me youve been seeing someone else steve laughed if only you could hear yourself is it true what if i have i thought we i mean i didnt oh yvonne for gods sake grow up you sound like such a child sometimes we can both see whoever we want i thought that was clear from the start but i dont want to see anyone else i want to see you what youre really saying is that you dont want me to see anyone else you cant own someone yvonne you cant control their affections but its true steve turned away his face well i dont want to see you thats just not on anymore but i mean it and you wont be welcome at bayswater terrace or carberry place either they got raided as well in case you didnt know people got busted and theyre not happy with you word gets around you know its still a small scene so what should i have done tell me what i should have done you shouldnt have done anything you should have kept your stupid mouth shut you should have known bringing the pigs in would only mean trouble for us but hes my father i had to tell someone i was so upset steve i was shaking like a leaf mcgarrity ive told you before hes harmless thats not the way he seemed to me you were stoned the way i hear it maybe your imagination was running away with you maybe you even wanted him to touch you maybe you should run away with your imagination instead i dont know what youre talking about steve sighed i cant trust you anymore yvonne we cant trust you anymore but i love you steve no you dont dont be stupid thats not real love youre talking about thats just romantic schoolgirl crap its possessive love all jealousy and control all the negative emotions youre not mature enough to know what real love is yvonne flinched at his words she felt herself turn cold all over as if she had been hit by a bucket of water and you are he stood up this is a fucking waste of time look im not arguing with you anymore why dont you just go and dont come back but steve steve pointed to the door and raised his voice just go and dont send your father and his piggy friends around here again or you might find yourself in serious trouble yvonne got slowly to her feet she had never known steve to look or sound so cruel what do you mean she asked never mind just fuck off yvonne looked at him he was bristling with anger there was clearly going to be no more talking to him not this afternoon maybe not ever feeling the tears start to burn down her cheeks she turned away from him abruptly and left its not so much what he said or did guv said winsome it was the pleasure he took in doing it annie nodded she was treating winsome to an afterwork drink in the black lion off an alley behind the market square away from the prying eyes and ears of western area headquarters winsome was visibly upset and annie wanted to get to the bottom of it kev can be insensitive at times she said insensitive winsome took a gulp of her vodka and tonic insensitive it was more like bloody sadistic im sorry guv but im still shaking see she stuck her hand out annie could see it was trembling slightly calm down she said another drink youre not driving are you no i can walk home from here ill have the same again thanks annie went to the bar and got the drinks there was nobody else in the place except the barmaid and a couple of her friends at the far end one of them was playing the machines and the other was sitting down watching over two toddlers cigarette in one hand drink in the other every time one of the little boys started to cry or make any sort of noise she told him to shut up time after time cry shut up cry shut up there was a tape of old music playing loudly house of the rising sun the young ones say a little prayer for me i remember you the sort of stuff banks would remember competing with the tv blaring out murder she wrote on one of the sky channels but the noise certainly drowned out anything annie and winsome were talking about annie was going to get a britvic orange for herself as she had to get back to harkside but she was still furious after her session with superintendent gervaise feeling far from calm and she needed another bloody stiff drink herself so she ordered a large vodka with her orange juice if she had too much shed leave the car and get one of the pcs to drive her home or get a taxi if the worst came to the worst it couldnt cost all that much she had been thinking of moving to eastvale recently as it would be convenient for the job but house prices there had gone through the roof and she didnt want to give up her little cottage even though it was now worth nearly twice what she had paid for it winsome thanked annie for the drink that poor girl she said look winsome i know how you feel i feel just as bad im sure kelly thinks im the one who betrayed her trust but ds templeton was only doing his job superintendent gervaise had asked him to check the girls story against her fathers and that was the way he did it it might seem harsh to you but it worked didnt it i cant believe youre defending them winsome said she took a gulp of vodka then put the drink down on the table you werent there or youd know what im talking about no im not working with him again you can transfer me do what you want but i wont work with that bastard again she folded her arms annie sipped her drink and sighed she had been foreseeing problems ever since kevin templeton got his promotion he had passed his sergeants boards ages ago but he didnt want to go back to uniform and he didnt want to transfer so it took a while for this opportunity to come up then he nipped a possible serial killers career in the bud and became the golden boy annie had always found him just a bit too full of himself and she worried what a little power might do to his already skewed personality and if he thought she didnt notice the way he had practically drooled down the front of her blouse the other day then he was seriously deluding himself the thing was he got the job done as he had done now banks did too but he managed to do it without treading on everyones toes only the brasss usually but templeton was one of the new breed he didnt care and here was annie defending him when she knew damn well that winsome who had also passed her boards with flying colors and didnt want to leave eastvale would have been a much better person for the job where is positive discrimination when you really need it she wondered obviously not in yorkshire i shouldnt have made a promise i couldnt possibly keep annie said the blames entirely mine i should have done it myself she knew that she had deliberately not made any such promise to kelly soames but she felt as if she had pardon me guv but like i said you werent there listen to me he enjoyed it enjoyed every minute of it the humiliation taunting her he drew it out to get more pleasure from it and in the end he didnt even know what hed done wrong i dont know if thats the worst part of it all okay winsome ill admit ds templeton has a few problems a few problems the mans a sadist and you know what what winsome shifted in her chair dont laugh but there was something sexual about it sexual yes i cant explain it but it was like he was getting off on his power over her are you certain i dont know maybe it was just me reading things wrongly it wouldnt be the first time but there was something really creepy about the whole thing even when the girl was being sick kelly was physically sick yes i thought id told you that no how did it happen she was just sick what did ds templeton do just carried on as if everything was normal have you told anyone else what happened no guv id tell superintendent gervaise if i thought it would do any good but she thinks the sun shines out of kevin templetons arse she does does she that didnt surprise annie just the mention of gervaise made her bristle the sanctimonious cow putting annie on statement reading a dcs job at best and making gibes about her private life anyway winsome went on i dont have to put up with it theres nothing in the book says i have to put up with behavior like that thats true said annie but life doesnt always go by the book it does when you agree with what the book says annie laughed so what do you want to do about it dunno said winsome nothing i can do i suppose cept i dont want to be near the creep anymore and if he ever tries anything ill beat seven shades of shit out of him annie laughed the phrase sounded odd coming from winsome with her jamaican lilt you cant avoid him all the time she said i mean i can do my best to make sure youre not paired up or anything but superintendent gervaise can overrule that if she wants and she seems to want to interfere with our jobs a bit more than superintendent gristhorpe did i liked mr gristhorpe said winsome he was oldfashioned like my father and he could be a bit frightening sometimes but he was fair and he didnt play favorites well annie thought that wasnt strictly true banks had certainly been a favorite of gristhorpes but in general winsome was right there was a difference between having favorites and playing them gristhorpe hadnt set out to build a little empire pick his teams and set people against one another the way it seemed gervaise was doing nor did he interfere in peoples private lives he must have known about her and banks but he hadnt said anything at least not to her he might have warned banks off she supposed but if he had it hadnt affected their relationship either on or off the job well gristhorpes gone and gervaise is here said annie and for better or worse weve got to live with it she looked at her watch she still had half her drink left look id better go winsome im not over the limit yet but i will be if i have any more you can stay at mine if you like winsome looked away im sorry guv i dont mean to be presumptuous i mean you being an inspector and all my boss but ive got a spare room its just that it helps talking about it thats all and i dont know about you but i feel like getting ratarsed annie thought for a moment what the hell she said finishing her drink ill get another round no you stay there its my shout annie sat and watched her walk to the bar a tall graceful longlegged jamaican beauty about whom she knew well not very much at all but then she didnt really know very much about anyone when it came right down to it she realized not even banks and as she watched she smiled to herself wouldnt it be funny she thought if she did stay at winsomes and superintendent gervaise found out what would the sad cow make of that monday nd september but weve got no real evidence stan detective chief superintendent mccullen argued on monday morning they were in his office and rain spattered the windows blurring the view chadwick ran his hand over his hair hed thought this out in advance hadnt done anything else but think it over all night he didnt want yvonne involved that was the main problem he had seen the bruise mcgarrity had caused on her arm and it was enough to bring assault charges but once he went that route he wouldnt be able to do anything for yvonne she was upset enough as it was and he didnt want to drag her through court if truth be told he didnt want his name tainted by his daughters folly either he thought he could make a decent case without her and he laid it out carefully for mccullen first off hes got form he said mccullen raised an eyebrow oh the most recents for possession of a controlled substance namely lsd november only possession they think he dumped his stash down the toilet when he heard them coming unfortunately he still had two doses in his pocket you said most recent yes the others a bit more interesting march how old was he then twentytwo and assault causing bodily harm he stabbed a student in the shoulder during a townandgown altercation in oxford which apparently is where he comes from unfortunately the student happened to be the son of a local member of parliament ouch said mccullen a sly smile touching his lips it didnt help that mcgarrity was a teddy boy as well apparently the judge didnt like teds threw the book at him he was a brasenose man too same as the student gave mcgarrity eighteen months if the wound had been more serious and if it hadnt been inflicted defensively during a scuffle apparently the gown lot were carrying cricket bats among other weapons then hed have got five years or more another interesting point chadwick went on is that the weapon used was a flickknife the same weapon used on the girl same kind of weapon go on theres not much more chadwick said we spent yesterday interviewing the people at the three houses who knew mcgarrity he definitely knew the victim how well theres no evidence of any sort of relationship and from what ive found out about linda lofthouse i very much doubt that there was one but he knew her anything else everyone said he was an odd duck they often didnt understand what he was talking about and he had a habit of playing with a flickknife what kind of flickknife just a flickknife with a tortoiseshell handle why did they put up with him if you ask me sir its down to drugs our lads found five ounces of cannabis resin hidden in the gas meter at carberry place apparently the lock was broken we think it belonged to mcgarrity defrauding the gas company too ill bet chadwick smiled same shilling again and again the drugs squad think hes a midlevel dealer buys a few ounces now and then and splits them up into quid deals probably what he used the knife for so the kids tolerate him yes sir he was also at the festival and according to the people he went with he spent most of the time roaming the crowd on his own no one can say where he was when the incident occurred mccullen tapped his pipe on the ashtray then said the knife no sign of it yet sir pity yes i suppose it might be a coincidence that mcgarrity simply lost his knife around the same time a young woman was stabbed with a similar weapon but weve gone to court with less before aye and lost from time to time well the judge has bound him over on the dealing charge no fixed abode so no bail hes all ours then get cracking and build up a murder case if you think youve got one but dont get tunnel vision here stan dont forget that other bloke you fancied for it rick hayes were still looking into him good and stan yes sir find the knife it would really help some people banks realized never travel very far from where they grow up and simon bradley was one of them he had he said transferred several times during his career to suffolk cumbria and nottingham but he had ended up back in leeds and when he had retired in at the age of fiftysix and the rank of superintendent traffic he and his wife had settled in a nice detached stonebuilt house just off shaw lane in headingley it was he told banks only a stones throw from where he grew up in more lowly meanwood beyond the high green gate was a welltended garden that bradley said was his wifes pride and joy bradleys pride and joy it turned out was a small library of floortoceiling shelves where he kept his collection of firstedition crime and thriller fiction primarily dick francis ian fleming len deighton ruth rendell p d james and colin dexter it was there he sat with banks over coffee and talked about his early days at brotherton house sitting in the peaceful booklined room banks found it hard to believe that just down the road was hyde park where one of that summers suicide bombers had lived i was young bradley said twentyfive in but i was never really one of that generation he laughed i suppose that would have been difficult wouldnt it being a hippie and a copper at the same time sort of like being on both sides at once im a few years behind you said banks but i did like the music still do really dreadful racket said bradley ive always been more of a classical man myself mozart beethoven bach i like them too said banks but sometimes you cant beat a bit of jimi hendrix each to his own i suppose i always associated the music too closely with the lifestyle and the things that went on back then bradley said with distaste a sound track for the drugs long hair promiscuity i was something of a young fogy a square i suppose and now ive grown up into an old fogy i went to church every sunday kept my hair cut short and believed in waiting until you were married before having sex still do much to my sons chagrin very unfashionable bradley was almost ten years older than banks and he was in good physical shape there was no extra flab on him the way there had been on enderby and he still had a fine head of hair he was wearing white trousers and a shirt with a gray vneck pullover a bit like a cricketer banks thought or the way cricketers used to look before they became walking multicolored advertisements for everything from mobile phones to trainers did you get on well with di chadwick banks asked remembering enderbys description of chiller as cold and hard after a fashion said bradley di chadwick wasnt an easy man to get close to hed had certain experiences during the war and he tended toward long silences you didnt dare interrupt he never spoke about it the war but you knew it was there defining him in a way as it did many of that generation but yes i suppose i got along with him as well as anyone do you remember the linda lofthouse case as if it were yesterday bound to happen eventually what was what happened to her linda lofthouse bound to i mean all those people rolling in the mud on lsd and god knows what bound to revert to their primitive natures at some point werent they strip away that thin but essential veneer of civilization and convention of obedience and order and what do you get the beast within mr banks the beast within someone was bound to get hurt stands to reason im only surprised there wasnt more of it but what do you think it was about linda lofthouse that got her killed at first when i saw her there in the sleeping bag you know with her dress bunched up i must confess i thought it was probably a sex murder she had that look about her you know what look a lot of young girls had it then as if shed invite you into her sleeping bag as soon as look at you but she was dead well yes of course i know that bradley gave a nervous laugh i mean im not a necrophiliac or anything im just telling you the first impression i had of her turned out it wasnt a sex crime after all but some madman as i said bound to happen when you encourage deviant behavior shed had an illegitimate baby you know linda lofthouse yes she was on the pill when we found her like most of them of course but obviously not when she was fifteen gave it up for adoption in did anyone find out what became of the child it didnt concern us we tracked down the father a kid called donald hughes garage mechanic and he gave us a couple of ideas as to the sort of life linda was leading and where she was living it but he had an alibi and he had no motive hed moved on got a proper job wanted nothing to do with linda and her hippie lifestyle that was why they split up in the first place if she hadnt been seduced by that corrupt lifestyle the baby might have grown up with a proper mother and father the childs identity might be an issue now banks thought a child born in the late sixties would be in his late thirties now and if he had discovered what had happened to his birth mother nick barber was thirtyeight but he was the victim banks was confusing too many crimes lofthouse merchant barber he had to get himself in focus at least the connection between barber and lofthouse was something he could check into and not come away looking too much of a fool if he was wrong what was the motive we never found out he was a nutcase that being the technical term for a psychopath back then its what we used to call them bradley said but i suppose psychopath or sociopath i never did know the difference would be more politically correct he confessed to the murder as good as what do you mean he didnt deny it when faced with the evidence the knife right with his fingerprints and linda lofthouses blood on it how did this person whats his name by the way mcgarrity patrick mcgarrity how did this mcgarrity first come to your attention we found out that the victim was known at various houses around the city where students and dropouts lived and sold drugs mcgarrity frequented these same places was a drug dealer in fact which was what we first arrested him for after a raid and then di chadwick became suspicious well yes we heard that mcgarrity was a bit of a nutcase and even the people whose houses he frequented were a bit frightened of him there was a lot of tolerance for weird types back then especially if they provided people with drugs which is why i say im surprised these things didnt happen more often this mcgarrity clearly had severe mental problems dropped on the head at birth for all i know he was older than the rest for a start and he also had a criminal record and a history of violence he had a habit of playing with this flickknife it used to make people nervous which was no doubt the effect he wanted there was also some talk about him terrorizing a young girl he was a thoroughly unpleasant character did this other young girl come forward no it was just something that came up during questioning mcgarrity denied it we got him on the other charges and that gave us all we needed you met him i sat in on some of the interviews look i dont know why you want to know all this now theres no doubt he did it im not doubting it said banks im just trying to find a reason for nick barbers murder well its got nothing to do with mcgarrity nick barber was writing about the mad hatters banks went on and vic greaves was linda lofthouses cousin the one that went bonkers if you care to put it that way yes said banks how else would you put it anyway im afraid i never met them di chadwick did most of the north riding side of the investigation with a ds enderby i do believe they interviewed the band yes ive talked to keith enderby bradley sniffed bit of a scruff and not entirely reliable in my opinion rather more like the types we were dealing with if you know what i mean ds enderby was a hippie well not as such but he wore his hair a bit long and on occasion he wore flowered shirts and ties i even saw him in sandals once with socks no well thank the lord for that said banks look i know youre being sarcastic said bradley with a smug smile its okay but the fact that remains is that enderby was a slacker and he had no respect for the uniform banks could have kicked himself for letting the sarcasm out but bradleys holierthanthou sanctimony was starting to get up his nose he felt like saying that enderby had described bradley as an arselicker but he wanted results not confrontation time to hold back and stick to relevant points only he told himself you say you think this writer was killed because he was working on a story about the mad hatters but do you have any reason for assuming that bradley asked well said banks we do know about the story he was working on that he mentioned to a girlfriend that it might involve a murder and we know that vic greaves now lives very close to the cottage in which nick barber was killed unfortunately all barbers notes were missing along with his mobile and laptop so we were unable to find out more that in itself is also suspicious though that his personal effects and notes were taken its not very much though is it i imagine robberys as common around your patch as it is everywhere these days we try to keep an open mind said banks there could be other possibilities did you have any other suspects yes there was a fellow called rick hayes he was the festival promoter he had the freedom of the backstage area and he couldnt account for himself during the period we think the girl was killed he was also lefthanded as was mcgarrity those were the only two yes so it was the knife that clinched it we knew we had the right man you must have had that feeling at times but we couldnt prove it at first we were able to hold him on a drugs charge and while we were holding him we turned up the murder weapon how long after you first questioned him it was october about two weeks or so where was it in one of the houses i assume those places were searched as soon as you had mcgarrity in custody yes but you didnt turn up the knife then you have to understand said bradley there were several people living in each of these houses at any one time they were terribly unsanitary and overcrowded people slept on the floors and in all kinds of unlikely combinations there was all sorts of stuff around we didnt know what belonged to whom they were all so casual in their attitudes toward property and ownership so how did you find out in the end we just kept on looking finally we found it hidden inside a cushion a couple of the people who lived there said theyd seen mcgarrity with such a knife it had a tortoiseshell handle and we were fortunate enough to find his prints on it hed wiped the blade of course but the lab still found blood and fiber where it joined the handle the blood matched linda lofthouses type simple as that did the knife match the wounds according to the pathologist it could have only could have he was in court you know what those barristers are like could have been her blood could have been the knife a blade consistent with the kind of blade blah blah blah it was enough for the jury the pathologist didnt try to match the knife with the wound physically on the body he couldnt the body had been buried by then and even if it had been necessary to exhume it the flesh would have been too decomposed to give an accurate reproduction you know that and mcgarrity didnt deny killing her thats right i was there when di chadwick presented him with the evidence and he just had this strange smile on his face and he said it looks like youve got me then those were his exact words it looks like youve got me then bradley frowned with annoyance it was over thirty years ago i cant promise those were the exact words but it was something like that youll find it in the files and the court transcripts but he was sneering at us being sarcastic ill be looking at the transcripts later said banks i dont suppose you had anything to do with the investigation into robin merchants death who he was another member of the mad hatters he drowned about nine months after the linda lofthouse murder bradley shook his head no sorry mr enderby was able to tell me a bit about it he was one of the investigating officers i was just wondering i understand di chadwick had a daughter yes i only ever saw her the once pretty young thing yvonne i think she was called wasnt there some trouble with her di chadwick didnt confide in me about his family life banks felt a faint warning signal bradleys answer had come just a split second too soon and sounded a little too pat to be quite believable the clipped tones also told banks that he perhaps wasnt being entirely truthful but why would he lie about chadwicks daughter to protect chadwicks family and reputation most likely so if enderby was right and this yvonne had been in trouble or was trouble it might be worth finding out exactly what kind of trouble he was talking about do you know where yvonne chadwick is now he asked im afraid not grown up and married i should imagine what about di chadwick havent seen hide nor hair of him for years not since the trial i should imagine hes dead by now i mean he was in his late forties back then and he wasnt in the best of health the trial took its toll but i transferred to suffolk in and i lost touch no doubt records will be able to tell you more coffee thanks banks held his mug out and gazed at the spines of the books nice hobby he thought collecting first editions maybe hed look into it graham greene perhaps or georges simenon there were plenty of those to spend a lifetime or more collecting so even after confessing mcgarrity pleaded not guilty yes it was a foolish move he wanted to conduct his own defense too but the judge wasnt having any of it as it was he kept getting up in court and interrupting causing a fuss making accusations that hed been framed i mean the nerve of him after hed as good as admitted it things didnt go well for him at all we got the similar fact evidence about the previous stabbing in the bailiffs had to remove him from the court at least twice he said hed been framed well they all do dont they was he more specific about it no couldnt be really could he seeing as it was all a pack of lies besides he was gibbering theres no doubt about it patrick mcgarrity was guilty as sin perhaps i should have a chat with him that would be rather difficult said bradley hes dead he was stabbed in jail back in something to do with drugs chapter sixteen is it just me or do i sense a bit of an atmosphere around here banks asked annie in the corridor on thursday morning atmosphere would be an understatement said annie her head still hurt despite the paracetamol she had taken before leaving winsomes flat that morning luckily she always carried a change of clothes in the boot of her car not because she was promiscuous or anything but because once years ago a mere dc when she had done a similar thing got drunk and stayed with a friend after a breakup with a boyfriend someone in the station had noticed and she had been the butt of unfunny sexist jokes for days and after that her ds had come on to her in the lift after work one day you look like shit said banks thank you want to tell me about it annie looked up and down the corridor to make sure no one was lurking great she thought she was getting paranoid in her own station now think we can sneak over the road to the golden grill without setting too many tongues wagging of course said banks he looked as if he was wondering what the hell she was talking about the day was overcast and chilly and most of the people windowshopping on market street wore sweaters under their windcheaters or anoraks they passed a couple of serious ramblers kitted out in all the new fancy gear each carrying the two long pointed sticks like ski poles well annie supposed they might be of some use climbing up fremlington edge but they werent a lot of use on the cobbled streets of eastvale their regular waitress greeted them and soon they were sitting over hot coffee and toasted tea cakes looking through the misted window at the streams of people outside annie felt a sudden rush of nausea when she took her first sip of black coffee but it soon waned it was always there though a lowlevel sensation in the background annie and winsome had certainly made a night of it shared more confidences than annie could ever have imagined it made her realize when she thought about it in the cold hangover dawn that she didnt really have any friends anyone to talk to like that be silly with do girly things with she had always thought it was a function of her job but perhaps it was a function of her personality banks was the same but at least he had his kids she had her father ray down in st ives of course but they only saw one another rarely and it wasnt the same for all his eccentricities and willingness to act as a friend and confidant he was still her father so what were you up to last night thats left you looking like death warmed up feeling like it too by the looks of you annie pulled a face you know how i love it when you compliment me banks touched her hand a shadow of concern passing over his face seriously if you must know i got pissed with winsome you did what i told you but winsome i didnt think she even drank me neither but its official now she can drink me under the table thats no mean feat my point exactly how was it well a bit awkward at first with the rank thing but you know ive never held that in very great esteem i know you respect the person not the rank exactly anyway by the end of the evening wed got beyond that and we had quite a giggle it was annie and winsome she hates winnie shes got a wicked sense of humor when she lets her hair down does winsome what were you talking about mind your own business it was girl talk men then such an ego what makes you think wed waste a perfectly good bottle of marks and spencers plonk talking about you lot that puts me in my place how was it when you met up at work this morning a bit embarrassing well itll be winsome and guv in the workplace but we had a bit of a giggle over it all so what started it annie felt another wave of nausea she let it go the way she did thoughts in meditation and it seemed to work at least for the moment ds templeton she said finally kev templeton was this about the promotion because no it wasnt about the promotion and keep your voice down of course winsomes pissed off about that who wouldnt be we know she was the right person for the job but we also know the right person doesnt always get the job even if she is a black female i know you white males always like to complain when a job goes elsewhere for what you see as political reasons but its not always the case you know so what then annie explained how templeton had behaved with kelly soames it sounds a bit harsh he said when she had finished but i dont suppose he was to know the girl would be physically sick he enjoyed it that was the point said annie so winsome thought yes look dont tell me youre going to go all male and start defending the indefensible here because if you are im off im not in the mood for an allladstogether rally christ annie you ought to know me better than that and theres only one lad here as far as i can see well you know what i mean annie ran her hand through her tousled hair shit im hungover and im having a badhair day too your hair looks fine you dont mean it but thank you anyway thats the story oh and superintendent bloody gervaise had a go at me yesterday in her office what were you doing there i went to complain about the personal remarks she made about me during the briefing at the very least i expected an apology and you got a bollocking more personal remarks and an assignment to statement reading thats steep very and she warned me off you what its true annie looked down into her coffee she seems to think were an item again where could she possibly have got that idea from i dont know annie paused templetons in thick with her so annie leaned forward and rested her hands on the table she knew about the pint you had at the cross keys that first night when we went to the scene of barbers murder and templeton was there too he knew about that but this look tell me if im being paranoid alan but dont you think its a bit suspicious i think kev templeton might be behind it but why would he think we were an item as you put it he knows that we were involved before and we turned up at moorview cottage together we also stayed overnight in london hes putting two and two together and coming up with five banks looked out of the window seeming to mull over what annie had said so whats he up to ingratiating himself with the new super it looks that way said annie kevs smart and hes also ambitious he thinks the rest of us are plods hes a sergeant already and hell pass his inspectors boards first chance he gets too but hes also smart enough to know he needs more than good exam results to get ahead in this job it helps to have recommendations from above we know our madame gervaise thinks shes cut out for great things chief constable at the very least so a bit of coattail riding wouldnt do templeton any harm at least thats my guess sounds right to me said banks and i dont like what you told me earlier about the soames interview sometimes we have to do unpleasant things like that though i believe in this case it could have all been avoided but we dont have to take pleasure in them winsome thinks hes a racist too shes overheard him make the odd comment about darkies and pakis when he thinks shes not listening that would hardly make him unique in the force sadly said banks look ill have a word with him fat lot of good that will do well we cant go to superintendent gervaise thats for certain red ron would probably listen but thats too much like telling tales out of school for me not my style no the way it looks is that if anythings to be done about kev templeton ill have to do it myself and what exactly might you do like i said ill have a word see if i can talk some sense into him on the other hand i think it might be even better if i tipped the wink to gervaise that were onto him shell drop him like the proverbial hot potato i mean its no bloody good having a spy who blows his cover on his first assignment is it and gets the wrong end of the stick into the bargain good point look i have to go to leeds to see ken blackstone later today want to come no thanks annie made a grim face statements to read and the way i feel today if im doing a menial job i might even just knock off early go home and have a long hot bath and an early night they paid and left the golden grill then walked across the road to the station in the light drizzle at the front desk the pc on reception called annie over got a message for you miss he said from lyndgarth local coppers just called in to say all hells broke loose up at the soames farm old man soames went berserk apparently were on our way said annie she looked at banks ken blackstone can wait he said wed better put our wellies on annie drove and banks tried to find out what he could over his mobile but coverage was patchy and in the end he gave up that bastard templeton annie cursed as she turned onto the lyndgarth road by the cross keys in fordham visions of flaying templeton alive and dipping him in a vat of boiling oil flitting through her mind ill have him for this hes not getting away with it calm down annie banks said lets find out what happened first whatever it is hes behind it its down to him if thats the case you might have to join the queue said banks annie shot him a puzzled glance what do you mean if you were thinking clearly right now one of the things that might cross your mind oh dont be so bloody patronizing annie snapped get on with it one of the things that might cross your mind is that if something has happened as a direct result of ds templetons actions then the first person to distance herself will be detective superintendent gervaise annie looked at him and turned into the drive of the soames farm she could see the patrol car up ahead parked outside the house but she told him to do it annie said banks just smiled that was when it seemed like a good idea annie pulled up to a sharp halt sending gobbets of mud flying and they got out and walked over to the uniformed officer the door to the farmhouse was open and annie could hear the sound of a police radio from inside pc cotter sir said the officer on the door my partner pc watkins is inside what happened banks asked its not entirely clear yet said cotter but we had a memo from eastvale major crimes asking us to report anything to do with the soameses were glad you were so prompt annie cut in is anybody hurt cotter looked at her yes maam he said young girl the daughter she rang the station and we could hear cursing and things breaking in the background she was frightened told us to come as soon as we could we came as soon as possible but by the time we got here well you can see for yourselves annie was first inside the farmhouse and she gave a curt nod to pc watkins who was standing in the living room scratching his head at the sight the room was a wreck broken glass littered the floor one of the chairs had been smashed into the table and splintered a window was broken and lamps knocked over the small bookcase had been pulled away from the wall and its contents joined the broken glass on the floor the kitchens just as bad said pc watkins but that seems to be the extent of the damage everythings fine upstairs wheres soames annie asked we dont know maam he was gone when we arrived what about his daughter kelly eastvale general maam we radioed ahead to a and e how bad is she pc watkins looked away dont know maam hard to say she looked bad to me he gestured back into the room lot of blood annie looked again she hadnt noticed it before but now she could see dark stains on the carpet and the broken chair leg kelly oh jesus christ okay said banks stepping forward i want you and your partner to organize a search for calvin soames he cant have gone far get some help from uniformed branch in eastvale if you need it yes sir banks turned to annie come on he said theres nothing more we can do here lets go pay a visit to eastvale general annie didnt need asking twice when they got back into the car she thumped the steering wheel with both fists and strained to hold back her tears of anger her head was still throbbing from the previous nights excess she felt bankss hand rest on her shoulder and her resolve not to cry strengthened im all right she said after a few moments gently shaking him off just needed to let off a bit of steam thats all and there was me thinking id go home early and have a nice bath you okay to drive im fine really to demonstrate annie started the car set off slowly down the long bumpy drive and didnt start speeding until she hit the main road tuesday rd september yes what is it chadwick said when karen stuck her head around his office door i told you i didnt want to be disturbed urgent phone call your wife chadwick picked up the phone darling im so glad youre there janet said i was worried i wouldnt be able to reach you i dont know what to do chadwick could sense the alarm in her voice what is it its yvonne the school have rung wanting to know where she is they said theyd tried to reach me earlier but i was out shopping you know what a busybody that headmistress is shes not at school no and shes not here either i checked her room just in case did you notice anything unusual no same mess as ever chadwick had left for the station before his daughter had even woken up that morning how did she seem at breakfast he asked quiet but she left for school as usual so i thought i mean she took her satchel and she was wearing her mac its not like her stan you know its not its probably nothing chadwick said trying to ignore the feeling of fear crawling in the pit of his stomach mcgarrity was in jail but what if one of the others had decided to take revenge for the drugs squad raids he had probably been foolish to identify himself to yvonnes boyfriend but how else was he supposed to make his point look ill come straight home you stay there in case she turns up should i call the hospitals you might as well said chadwick and have a good look around her room see if theres anything missing clothes and things at least that would give janet something to occupy her time until he got there im on my way ill be there as quick as i can eastvale general infirmary was the biggest hospital for some distance and as a consequence the staff there were overworked and its facilities were strained to the limit just down king street behind the police station it was a victorian pile of stone with high drafty corridors and large wards with big sash windows no doubt to let in the winters chill for the tb patients it used to house a and e wasnt terribly busy as it was only thursday lunchtime and they found kelly soames easily enough with the help of one of the admissions nurses the curtains were drawn around her bed but more the nurse said to give her privacy than for any more serious reasons when they went through and sat by her annie was relieved to see and hear that most of the damage was superficial the blood came almost entirely from a head wound by far the most serious of her cuts and abrasions but even this had only caused concussion and her head was swathed in bandages her face was bruised her lip split and there was a stitched cut over her eye but other than that the nurse assured them there were no broken bones and no internal injuries annie felt an immense relief that didnt diminish her anger against kevin templeton and calvin soames one bit it could have been so much worse she held kellys hand and said im sorry i didnt know i honestly didnt know anything like this was going to happen kelly said nothing just continued to stare at the ceiling can you tell us what happened banks asked isnt it obvious kelly said her speech was a little slurred from the painkillers she had been given and from the split lip but she made herself clear enough id rather hear it from you banks said annie continued to hold kellys hand tell us she said where is he kelly i dont know kelly said honestly the last thing i remember is feeling like my head was exploding it was a chair leg banks said someone hit you with a chair leg was it your father who else would it be what happened kelly took some of the water annie offered and flinched when the flexistraw touched the cut on her lip she put the glass aside and stared at the ceiling as she spoke in a listless voice hed been drinking not like usual just a couple of pints before dinner but real drinking like he used to whiskey he started at breakfast i told him not to but he just ignored me i caught the bus into eastvale and did some shopping and when i got back he was still drinking i could tell he was really drunk by then the bottle was almost empty and he was red in the face muttering to himself i was worried about him and scared as soon as i opened my mouth he went berserk asked me who i thought i was to tell him what to do to be honest i really thought he believed i was mother the way he was talking to me then he got really abusive i mean just shouting at first not violent or anything that was when i phoned the local police station but as soon as he saw me on the phone that was it he went mad he started hitting me just slapping and pushing at first then he punched me after that he started breaking things smashing the furniture it was all i could do to put my hands in front of my face to protect myself he didnt interfere with you in any way annie asked no no it wasnt like that at all he wouldnt do anything like that but the names he was calling me i wont repeat them they were the same ones he used to call mother when they fought what happened to your mother annie asked she died in hospital there was something wrong with her insides i dont know what it was and at first the doctors didnt diagnose it in time then they thought it was something else when they finally did get around to operating it was too late she never woke up dad said something about the anesthetic being wrong but i dont know we never got to the bottom of it and hes never been able to let it go and your fathers been overpossessive ever since hes only got me to take care of him he cant take care of himself kelly sipped some more water and coughed dribbling it down her chin annie took a tissue from the table and wiped it away thanks said kelly whats going to happen now wheres dad whats going to happen to him we dont know yet said annie glancing at banks well find him though then well see i dont want anything to happen to him kelly said i mean i know hes done wrong and all but i dont want anything to happen to him annie held her hand it was the old old story the abused defending her abuser well see she said well see just get some rest for now back at the station banks found detective superintendent gervaise in her office and told her about kelly soames he also hinted that he knew templeton had been passing her information and warned her not to put too much trust in its accuracy it was worth it just to see the expression on her face after that he tried to put kelly soames and her problems out of his mind for a while and focus on the nick barber investigation again before setting off to visit ken blackstone in leeds a couple of dcs had read through the boxes of barbers papers sent up from his london flat and found they consisted entirely of old articles photographs and business correspondence none of it relating to his yorkshire trip he had clearly brought all of his current work with him and now it was gone banks found a brahms cello sonata on the radio and settled down to have another look through the old mojo magazines that john butler had given to him in london it didnt take him very long to figure out that nick barber knew his stuff in addition to pieces on the mad hatters from time to time there were also articles on shelagh macdonald joann kelly comus and bridget st john his interest in the hatters seemed to have started as banks had been told about five years ago well after his original interest in music which he seemed to have had since he was a teenager childhood now banks remembered the little frisson of possibility he had experienced when simon bradley had talked about linda lofthouses unwanted pregnancy it shouldnt be too hard to find out whether he was right he decided picking up the phone and looking up the barbers number in the case file when he got louise barber on the phone banks told her who he was and said i know this is probably an odd question and its not meant to be in any way disturbing or upsetting but was nick adopted there was a short pause followed by a sob yes she said we adopted him when he was only days old we raised him as if he were our own and thats how we always think of him im sure you did said banks believe me theres no hint of criticism here i wouldnt expect it to enter your head at such a time and from all ive found out nick led a healthy and happy life with many advantages he probably wouldnt have had otherwise its just that well did he know did you tell him yes said louise barber we told him a long time ago as soon as we thought he would be able to absorb it and what did he do then nothing he said that as far as he was concerned we were his parents and that was all there was to it did he ever get curious about his birth mother its funny but he did yes when was this about five or six years ago any particular reason he told us he didnt want us to think there was a problem or that it was anything to do with us but a friend of his who was also adopted told him it was important to find out he said something about it making him whole complete did he find her he didnt really talk to us about it much after that you have to understand we found it all a bit upsetting and nicholas was careful not to hurt us he told us he found out who she was but we have no idea if he traced her or met her do you remember her name did he tell you that yes linda lofthouse but thats all i know we asked him not to talk to us about her again the name is enough said banks thank you very much mrs barber and i do apologize for bringing up difficult memories i suppose it cant be helped surely this cant have anything to do with with what happened to nicholas we dont know right now its just another piece of information to add to the puzzle goodbye goodbye banks hung up and thought so nick barber was linda lofthouses son he must have found out that his mother had been murdered only a couple of years after he was born and that she was vic greavess cousin which no doubt fueled his interest in the mad hatters already present to some extent because of his interest in the music of the period but the knowledge raised a number of new questions for banks had barber accepted the standard version of her murder did he believe that patrick mcgarrity had killed his mother or had he found out something else if he had stumbled across something that indicated mcgarrity was innocent or had not acted alone then he might easily have blundered into a situation without knowing how dangerous it was but it all depended on whether or not chadwick had been right about mcgarrity it was time to head for leeds and have a chat with ken blackstone banks made it to leeds in little over an hour coming off new york road at eastgate and heading for millgarth the leeds police headquarters at about half past three on thursday afternoon like many things he supposed this business could have been conducted over the telephone but he preferred personal contact if possible somehow little nuances and vague impressions didnt quite make it over the phone lines ken blackstone was waiting in his office a tiny space partitioned at the end of a room full of busy detectives nattily dressed as ever in his best next pinstripe dazzling white shirt and maroonandgraystriped tie held in place by a silver pin in the shape of a fountain pen with his wispy gray hair curling over his ears and his goldframed reading glasses he looked more like a university professor than a police officer he and banks had known one another for years and banks thought ken was the closest he had to a friend next to dirty dick burgess but burgess was in london first off said blackstone i thought you might like to see this he slid a photograph across his desk and banks turned it to face him it showed the head and shoulders of a man in his early forties perhaps neat black hair plastered flat with brylcreem hard angled face straight nose and square jaw with a slight dimple but it was the eyes that caught bankss attention the most they gave nothing away except perhaps for a slight hint of dark shadows in their depths if eyes were supposed to be the windows to the soul these were the blackout curtains this was a hard haunted uncompromising man banks thought and a moral one he didnt know why and realized he was being a bit fanciful but he sensed a hint of hard religion in the mans background hardly surprising as there had been plenty of that around in both scotland and yorkshire over the years interesting banks said passing it back stanley chadwick i assume blackstone nodded taken on his promotion to detective inspector in october he glanced at his watch look its a bit noisy and stuffy in here fancy heading out for a coffee im all coffeed out said banks but maybe we can have a late lunch i havent eaten since this morning fine with me im not hungry but ill join you they left millgarth and walked on to eastgate it had turned into a fine day with that mix of cloud and sun you got so often in yorkshire when it wasnt raining and just chilly enough for a raincoat or light overcoat did you manage to find out anything banks asked ive done a bit of digging said blackstone and it looks like pretty solid investigating on the surface of it only on the surface i havent dug that deeply yet and remember it was essentially a north yorkshire case so most of the paperworks up there ive seen it he said i was just wondering about the west yorkshire angle and about chadwick himself di chadwick was on loan to the north yorkshire constabulary from what i can glean hed had a few successes here since his promotion and was a bit of a golden boy at the time i heard he was tough and he certainly looks that way i never knew him personally but i managed to turn up a couple of retired officers who did he was a hard man by all accounts but fair and honest and he got results he had a strong scottish presbyterian background but one of his old colleagues told me he thought hed lost his faith during the war hardly bloody surprising when you consider the poor sod saw action in burma and was part of the dday invasion where is he now they waited until the lights changed then crossed vicar lane dead blackstone said finally according to our personnel records stanley chadwick died in march so young said banks that must have been a hell of a shock for all concerned he would only have been in his early fifties apparently his health had been in decline for a couple of years blackstone said hed had a lot of sick time and performancewise there were rumors that he was dragging his feet he retired due to ill health in late that seems a rather sudden decline banks said any speculation as to what it was well it wasnt murder if thats what youre thinking he had a history of heart problems hereditary apparently which had gone untreated perhaps even unnoticed for years he died in his sleep of a heart attack but you have to remember this is just from the files and the memory of a couple of old men i managed to track down and some of the old information is impossible to locate we moved here from brotherton house in which was well before my time and inevitably stuff went missing in the move so your guess is as good as mine as to the rest simon bradley had told banks hed heard chadwick wasnt in good health but banks hadnt realized things were that bad could there have been anything suspicious about his death first linda lofthouse then robin merchant then stanley chadwick banks couldnt imagine what linked them to one another chadwick had investigated the lofthouse case but had had nothing to do with merchants drowning he had however met the mad hatters at swainsview lodge and vic greaves was linda lofthouses cousin there had to be something he was missing maybe chadwicks daughter yvonne would help if he could find her they turned down briggate a pedestrian precinct there were plenty of shoppers in evidence many of them young people teenage girls pushing prams the boys with them looking too young and inexperienced to be fathers many of the girls looked too young to be mothers too but banks knew damn well they werent merely helping out their big sisters teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases were at appallingly high rates because he still had linda lofthouse and nick barber on his mind banks thought back to the sixties to what the media had dubbed the sexual revolution true the pill had made it possible for women to have sex without fear of pregnancy but it had also left them with little or no excuse not to have sex in the name of liberation women were expected to sleep around they had the freedom to do so the reasoning went so they should and there was subtle and not so subtle cultural and peer pressure on them to do so after all the worst anyone could get was crabs or a dose of clap so sex was relatively fearfree but there were plenty of unwanted pregnancies back then too banks remembered as not all girls were on the pill or willing to have abortions certainly in the provinces linda lofthouse had been one of them and norma coulton just down the street from where banks lived was another banks remembered the gossip and the dirty looks she got when she walked into the newsagents he wondered what had happened to her and her child at least he knew what had happened to linda lofthouses son he had met the same fate as his mother any idea what happened to chadwicks family he asked according to what i could find out he had a wife called janet and a daughter called yvonne both survived him but nobodys kept tabs on them i dont suppose it would be too difficult to track them down pensions or human resources might be able to help do what you can said banks i appreciate it and ill put winsome on it at our end shes good at that sort of thing the daughter may have married changed her name of course but well give it a try electoral rolls dvla pnc and the rest who knows we might get lucky before we have to resort to more time consuming methods they passed a thin bearded young man selling the big issue at the entrance to thorntons arcade blackstone bought a copy folded it and slipped it into his inside pocket two young policemen passed them both wearing black helmets and bulletproof vests and carrying heckler amp koch carbines its a fact of the times here im afraid said blackstone banks nodded what bothered him most was that the officers looked only about fifteen sorry im not being a lot of help blackstone went on nonsense said banks youre helping me fill in the picture and thats all i need right now i know ill have to read the files and the trial transcripts soon but i keep putting it off because those things bore me so much you can do that in my office after weve had a bite to eat i have to go out i know what you mean though id rather curl up with a good flashman or sharpe myself blackstone stopped at the end of an alley lets try the ship this time whitelocks is always too damned crowded these days and theyve changed the menu its getting too trendy and somehow i dont see you sitting out in the victoria quarter at the harvey nichols café eating a garlicandbrie frittata oh i dont know said banks youd be surprised i scrub up quite nicely and i dont mind a bit of foreign grub every now and then but the ship sounds fine they ordered pints of tetleys and banks chose the giant yorkshire pudding filled with sausages and gravy and sat down in the dim brass and dark wood interior blackstone stuck with his beer banks told blackstone about their troublesome new superintendent and the fact that templeton might be bringing in just too many apples for the teacher then he chatted about brian and his new girlfriend emilia turning up till their food came and they got back to stanley chadwick and linda lofthouse do you think im tilting at windmills ken banks asked it wouldnt be the first time but i dont have enough to go on to advise you on that score usually your windmills turn out to be all too human explain your reasoning banks sipped some beer trying to put his thoughts in order it was a useful if difficult exercise there isnt much really he said superintendent gervaise thinks the past is over and the guilty have been punished but im not so sure its not that i think vic greaves is a killer because he has mental problems christ it might even be chris adams for all i know he doesnt live that far away or even tania hutchison its not as if oxfordshires on the moon either i just think that if nick barber was as good and as thorough a music journalist as everyone says he was then he might have struck a nerve and vic greaves is one of the few people he had tried to speak to about the story before his murder ive also just discovered that nick was linda lofthouses son adopted at birth by the barbers and that he found out who his birth mother was about five years ago barber was a journalist and i think he simply tried to find out as much about her and her times as he could because he was already interested in the music and the period one thing he found out was that vic greaves was her cousin greaves also lives only walking distance away from barbers rented cottage and someone saw a figure running around at the time of the murder the only things i can find in the past that cast any sort of suspicions on greaves and the others are the murder of linda lofthouse because she was backstage at the brimleigh festival with tania hutchison and she was greavess cousin and the drowning of the mad hatters bassist robin merchant when greaves adams and tania hutchison were all present at swainsview lodge and theyre both closed cases linda lofthouses murderer was caught and merchants drowning was ruled death by misadventure right right and lindas killer was stabbed in jail so its not as if we can ask him to clear anything up for us sounds as if he was deranged in the first place but ruling out the angry husband or passing tramp theory thats the default line of inquiry pretty much so chris adams said barber had a coke habit but we cant find any evidence of that if he did it obviously wasnt bigtime have you got barbers phone records yet were working on it but we dont expect too much there why not there was no landline at the cottage where he was staying and he was out of mobile range if he needed to phone anyone hed have had to use the public telephone box either in fordham or in eastvale what about internet access youd think a savvy music journalist would be all wired up for that sort of thing wouldnt you not if he didnt have a phone line or even wireless access blackberry or bluetooth or whatever it is arent there any internet cafés in eastvale banks glanced at blackstone ate another mouthful of sausage and washed it down with a swig of beer good point ken apart from the library which is as slow as a horse and cart theres a computer shop in the market square eastvale computes and i suppose we could check there problem is the owners only got two computers available to the public and i should imagine the histories get wiped pretty often if nick barber used either of them itd have been a couple of weeks ago and all traces would be gone by now its still worth a try though so what next well said banks there are a few more people to talk to starting with tania hutchison and chadwicks daughter yvonne when we find her but for the moment ive got a cd collection with a lot of holes in it and borders is beckoning just up briggate annie got bankss phone call from blackstones office in leeds late that afternoon and welcomed the break from the dull routine of statement reading kelly soames was still holding her own and would most likely be discharged the following day they still hadnt found her father before annie left the squad room winsome came up trumps with nick barbers mobile service but the results were disappointing he had made no calls since arriving at the cottage because he had no coverage there he could of course have used his mobile in eastvale but according to the records he hadnt if he had been up to anything at all he had kept it very much to himself that wouldnt be surprising annie thought she had known a few journalists in her time and had found that they were a secretive lot on the whole they had to be as theirs was very much a firstcome firstserved kind of business templeton had just got back from fordham and annie noticed him watching closely as she leaned over winsomes shoulder to read the notes she whispered in winsomes ear then let her hand rest casually on her shoulder she could see the prurient curiosity in templetons gaze now enough rope she thought and if he knew that she had stayed at winsomes the other night who could guess what wild tales he might take to superintendent gervaise after her talk with banks annies anger had diminished though she still blamed templeton for what had happened she knew there was no point confronting him he just wouldnt get it banks was right let him crucify himself he was already well on his way annie picked up a folder from her desk plucked her suede jacket from the hanger by the door said shed be back in a while and walked down the stairs with a smile on her face a cool wind gusted across the market square and the sky was quickly filling with dirty clouds like ink spilled on a sheet of paper luckily annie didnt have far to go she thought as she pulled the collar of her jacket around her throat and crossed the busy square people leaned into the wind as they walked hair flying plastic bags from somerfields and boots fluttering as if they were filled with birds the darlington bus stood at its stop by the market cross but nobody seemed to be getting on or off eastvale computes had been open a couple of years now and the owner barry gilchrist was the sort of chap who loved a technical challenge as a consequence people came in to chat about their computer problems and barry usually ended up solving them for free whether he ever sold any computers or not annie had no idea but she doubted it with aldi and even woolworths offering much lower prices barry was one of those ageless young lads in glasses who looked like harry potter annie had been in the shop fairly often and she was on friendly enough terms with him she had even bought cdroms and printer cartridges from him in an effort to give some support to local business she got the impression that he rather fancied her because he got all tonguetied when he spoke to her and found it hard to look her in the eye it wasnt offensive though like templeton and she was surprised to find that she felt more maternal toward him than anything else she didnt think she was old enough for that sort of thing but supposed when she thought about it that she might at a pinch be old enough to be his mother if he was as young as he looked it was a sobering thought oh hello he said blushing as he looked up from a monitor behind the counter what can i do for you today its official business annie said smiling judging by the expression that crossed his face and the way he surreptitiously hit a few keystrokes annie wondered if hed been looking at internet porn she didnt have him down as that type but you never could tell especially with computer geeks you might be able to help us she added oh i see he straightened his glasses well of course er whatever i can do computer problems at the station nothing like that its internet access im interested in but i thought not for me a customer you might have had maybe a couple of weeks ago ah well i dont get very many especially at this time of year tourists like it of course to check their email but most of the locals either have their own computers or theyre just not interested not to be interested the way barry gilchrist said it sounded infinitely sad annie took a photograph from the folder she had brought and handed it to him this man she said we know he was in eastvale on wednesday two weeks ago we were just wondering if he came in here and asked to use your internet access yes said barry gilchrist turning a little pale i remember him the journalist thats the man who was murdered isnt it i saw it on the news what day of the week did he come in not wednesday i think it was friday morning the day he died annie thought did he tell you he was a journalist or did you hear it he told me said he needed a few minutes to do a spot of research that there was no access where he was staying how long was he on only about fifteen minutes i didnt even bother charging him now comes the tricky part said annie i dont suppose thered still be any traces of where he went online gilchrist shook his head im sorry no i mean i said i dont get a lot of customers this time of year but i do get some so i have to keep the histories and temporary internet files clean they say you can never quite get rid of everything on a computer do you think our technical unit could get anything if we took them in gilchrist swallowed took the computers away yes i hardly have to remind you this is a murder investigation do i no and im very sorry he seemed like a nice enough bloke said he had wireless access on his laptop but there were no signals around these parts i could sympathize with that it took long enough to get broadband so would they sorry what if they took the computers apart would they find anything oh but they dont need to do that he said whys that annie asked because i know the site he visited one of them at any rate the first one do tell i wasnt spying or anything i mean theres no privacy about it anyway as you can see the computers are in a public area anyone could walk in and see what site someone was visiting true said annie so youre saying he was making no efforts to hide his tracks he didnt erase the history himself for example he couldnt do that that powers limited to the administrator and thats me providing access is one thing but i dont want people messing with the programs fair enough so what was he doing he was at the mad hatters web site i could tell because it plays a little bit of that hit song of theirs when it starts up whats it called love got in the way annie knew the song it had been a huge hit about eight years ago are you sure she asked yes i had to go around the front to check the printer cartridge stock and i could see it over his shoulder photos of the band biographies discographies that sort of thing annie knew banks would be as disappointed as she was with this what could be more natural for a music journalist writing about the mad hatters than to visit their web site was that all i think so i mean i heard the music when he first started and he finished a short while after id checked the stock he could have followed any number of links in between but if he did he went back to the main site again gilchrist pushed his glasses back up the bridge of his nose with his forefinger does that help annie smiled at him every little bit helps she said theres one more thing yes well he was carrying a paperback book with him as if hed been sitting and having a read in a café or something i saw him writing something in the back of it with a pencil i couldnt see what it was interesting said annie remembering the ian mcewan book banks had found at moorview cottage he had said something about some penciled numbers in the back maybe she should have a look she thanked gilchrist for his time and headed out into the wind chapter seventeen because of roadworks and poor weather on the m it took banks almost three hours to drive to tania hutchisons house on friday morning and when he got to tanias village he was so thoroughly pissed off with driving that the beautiful rolling country of the english heartland was lost on him he had spent the latter part of thursday afternoon and a good part of the evening reading over the files on the linda lofthouse investigation and the patrick mcgarrity trial transcripts all to little avail so he had not been in the best of moods when he got up that morning brian was still in bed but emilia had been puttering around the place with a smile on her face and had made him a pot of coffee and some delicious scrambled eggs he was getting used to having her around tanias house perched on the edge of a tiny village wasnt especially large but it was built of golden cotswold stone with a thatched roof and it must have cost her a pretty penny the thing that surprised banks most was that he could drive right up to her front gate there was no security no high wall or fence merely a privet hedge he had rung earlier to let her know he was coming to get directions and to make sure she would be in but he had told her nothing about the reason for his visit tania greeted him at the door and though there was no one else present banks knew he would have been able to pick her out of a crowd easily it wasnt that she looked like a rock star or anything whatever a rock star looked like she was more petite than he had imagined from seeing her onstage and on television and she certainly looked older now but it wasnt so much the familiarity of her looks as a certain class a presence charisma banks supposed it wasnt something he came across often in his line of work for a moment banks felt absurdly embarrassed remembering the teenage crush he had had on her he wondered if she could tell from his behavior her clothes were of the casualexpensive kind understated designer jeans and a loose cableknit sweater she was barefoot toenails painted red and her dark hair in the past so long and glossy was now cut short and laced with delicate threads of gray there were lines around her eyes and mouth but otherwise her complexion seemed flawless and smooth she wore little makeup just enough to accentuate her full lips and her watchful green eyes and she moved with a certain natural grace as banks followed her through a broad arched hallway into a large living room where a lacquered grand piano stood by the french windows and the floor was covered with a lush persian carpet the other thing banks noticed was a heavy glass ashtray and tania wasted no time in lighting a cigarette once she had curled up in an armchair and gestured for banks to sit opposite her she held the long tipped cigarette in the v of her index and second fingers and took short frequent drags he felt like smoking with her but he suppressed the urge there was a fragility and a wariness about her as well as class and charisma as if shed been hurt or betrayed so many times that once more would cause her world to crumble her name had been romantically linked with a number of famous rock stars and actors over the years and with equally famous breakups but now banks had read recently she lived alone with her two cats and she liked it that way the cats one marmalade and one tabby were in evidence but neither showed much interest in banks as he made himself comfortable banks had to remind himself that tania was a suspect and he had to put out of his mind the vivid sexual fantasies he had once entertained about her and stop acting like a tonguetied adolescent she had been at brimleigh with linda lofthouse and had later been a member of the mad hatters she had also been present at swainsview lodge on the night robin merchant drowned she had no motive for either crime as far as banks knew but motives sometimes had a habit of emerging later once the means and the opportunity were firmly nailed in place you werent very forthcoming over the telephone you know she said a touch of reproach in her husky voice banks could still hear hints of a north american accent though he knew she had been in england since her student days its about nick barbers murder he said watching for a reaction nick barber the writer good lord i hadnt heard she turned pale what is it i spoke to him just a couple of weeks ago he wanted to talk to me he was doing a piece on the mad hatters did you agree to talk to him yes nick was one of the few music journos you could trust not to distort everything oh christ this is terrible she put her hand to her mouth if she was acting banks thought then she was damned good but she was a performer by trade he reminded himself as if sensing her grief one of the cats made its way over slowly and with a scowl at banks leaped onto her lap she stroked it absently and it purred im sorry he said i didnt realize you were close or i would have broken the news a bit more tactfully i assumed you knew we werent close she said i just knew him in passing thats all ive met him once or twice and i liked his work its a hell of a shock he was planning to come by and talk to me about my early days with the band when was this banks asked we didnt have a firm date he phoned two maybe three weeks ago and said hed get in touch with me again soon he never did did he say anything else no he said he was ringing from a public telephone and his phone card ran out what happened why would anyone murder nick barber that explained why they hadnt seen tanias number on barbers mobile or landline phone records banks thought i think it might be something to do with the story he was working on he said the story but how could it be i dont know yet but we havent been able to find any other lines of inquiry banks told her a little about barbers movements in yorkshire in particular his unsatisfactory meeting with vic greaves poor vic she said how is he banks didnt know how to answer that hed thought greaves was clearly off his rocker if not clinically insane but he seemed to function well enough with a little help from chris adams and he was certainly high on bankss list of suspects same as usual i suppose he said though he didnt know what was usual for vic greaves vic was one of the sensitive ones tania said much too fragile for the life he led and the risks he took what do you mean tania stubbed out her cigarette before answering there are people in the business whose minds and bodies can take an awful lot of substance abuse iggy pop and keith richards come to mind for example and there are those who go on the ride with them and fall off vic was one who fell off because he was sensitive she nodded some people could eat acid as if it were candy and have nothing but a good time like watching their favorite cartoons over and over again others saw the devil the jaws of hell or the four horsemen of the apocalypse and the horrors beyond the grave vic was one of the latter he had hammerhorror trips and the visions unhinged him so lsd caused his breakdown it certainly contributed to it but im not saying something wouldnt have happened anyway certainly the emotions and some of the images were in his mind already acid merely released them but maybe he should have kept the cork in the bottle why did he keep taking it tania shrugged theres really no answer to that acid certainly isnt addictive in the way heroin and coke are not all his trips were bad i think maybe he was trying to get through hell to something better maybe he thought if he kept on trying then one day he would find the peace he was looking for but he didnt youve seen him yourself you should know who was he riding with there wasnt any one particular person it was meant as a sort of metaphor for the whole scene back then the doors of perception and all that vic was a poet and he loved and wanted all that mystical decadent glamour he admired jim morrison a lot even met him at the isle of wight she smiled to herself apparently it didnt go well the lizard king was in a bad mood and he didnt want to know poor vic let alone read his poetry told him to fuck off that hurt too bad said banks what about the rest of the bands drug intake none of them was as sensitive as vic and none of them did as much acid robin merchant hardly id have put him down as one of the survivors if it hadnt been for the accident what about chris adams chris a flicker of a smile crossed her face chris was probably the straightest of the lot still is why do you think he takes such good care of vic greaves guilt over what i dont know banks said responsibility for the breakdown something like that no tania said shaking her head vigorously far from it chris was always trying to get vic off acid helping him through bad trips then why tania paused it was quiet outside and banks couldnt even hear any birds singing if you ask me she said id say it was because he loved him not in any homosexual sense you understand chris isnt like that or vic for that matter but as a brother dont forget they grew up together knew each other as kids on a workingclass estate they shared dreams if chris had had any musical talent hed have been in the band but he was the first to admit he couldnt even manage the basic three rock chords and he certainly couldnt carry even the simplest melody but he did turn out to have good business sense and vision and thats what shaped the band after all the tragedies it was all very well to tune in turn on drop out and say whatever man but someone had to handle the daytoday mechanics of making a living and if someone trustworthy like chris didnt do it you could bet your life that there were any number of unscrupulous bastards waiting in the wings ready to exploit someone elses talent interesting said banks so in some ways chris adams was the driving force behind the mad hatters he held things together yes and he helped us with a new direction when both robin and vic were gone was it chris who invited you to join the band tania twisted a silver ring on her finger yes its no secret we were going out together at the time i met him at brimleigh id seen him a couple of times before when my friend linda got me into mad hatters events but we hadnt really talked like we did at brimleigh i had a boyfriend then a student in paris but we soon drifted apart and chris was in london a lot hed phone me and finally i agreed to have dinner with him brimleighs something else i want to talk to you about said banks if you can cast your mind back that far tania gave him an enigmatic smile theres nothing wrong with my mind she said but if youre going to send me leafing through my back pages i think were going to need some coffee dont you she dumped the cat unceremoniously on the floor and headed into the kitchen the animal hissed at banks and slunk away banks was surprised that tania had no one to make the coffee for her no housekeeper or butler but then tania hutchison was full of surprises while she was gone he gazed around the room there was nothing to distinguish it particularly except a few modernist paintings on the walls originals by the look of them and an old stone fireplace that would probably make it very cozy on a winter evening there was no music playing and no evidence of a stereo or cds nor was there a television tania returned shortly with a cafetière mugs milk and sugar on a tray which she set on the low wicker coffee table well give it a few minutes shall we you do like your coffee strong yes said banks excellent tania lit another cigarette and leaned back can we talk about brimleigh naturally but as i remember it the man who killed linda was caught and put in jail thats true said banks where he has since died then i just want to get a few things clear thats all did you know the man patrick mcgarrity no id met him on a couple of occasions when i accompanied linda to her friends houses in leeds but i never spoke with him he seemed an odious sort of character to me pacing around with that silly smile on his face as if he was enjoying some sort of private joke at everyone elses expense gave me the creeps i suppose they only put up with him because of the drugs you knew about that that he was a dealer it was pretty obvious but he could only have been smalltime even most dealers had more class than him and they didnt smell as bad did you see him at brimleigh no but we were backstage all the time unless we went out front to the press enclosure to see the bands and of course when linda took her walk in the woods but we were never with the general audience no ive read through the files and trial transcripts said banks and apparently you werent worried about her no we both knew we might go our separate ways she knew i was heading off to paris the next day and she told me shed probably stay with friends in leeds so i had no cause to worry the very last thing you expected at a festival back then was a murder this was before altamont remember coming hot on the heels of successes at woodstock and the isle of wight everyone was high on rock festivals the bigger the better i appreciate that said banks did you see her talking to anyone in particular not really i mean we talked to a lot of people there was a sort of party atmosphere and i must admit it was a big thrill to be hanging out with the stars she gave banks a coy smile i was still an impressionable young girl back then you know anyway linda spent a bit of time with the hatters but she would wouldnt she i mean it was vic got us the passes in the first place and he was her cousin even if they werent especially close did anyone show unusual interest in her no people chatted her up if thats what you mean linda was a very attractive girl but she didnt go off with anyone not that i knew of tania leaned forward and pressed the plunger on the cafetière then she carefully poured two mugs she added milk and sugar to her own then offered them to banks who declined linda was in a very spiritual phase then into yoga and meditation tibetan buddhism she wasnt into drugs and i dont think she was into men all that much did you actually see her leave the enclosure not as such no but she told me she was going for a walk i was heading to the front to see led zeppelin and she said she needed a bit of space shed catch up with me later so where was linda when you last saw her backstage was she with anyone a group of people including i cant really remember that far back some of the hatters were there vic greaves vic was around but he took some acid after the show and who knows where he was most people went round the front it was a real crush in there i do remember that people trying to cop a feel in the crowd i couldnt say for certain who was there and who wasnt so you didnt see linda head for the woods no look youre not saying vic might have done this are you because i dont believe that whatever his problems vic was always a gentle soul still is only hes a bit disturbed they caught the killer fair and square they found his knife with lindas blood on it id seen mcgarrity with that knife myself at bayswater terrace i know said banks but he maintained at the trial that he was framed that the knife was planted tania snorted he would wouldnt he you of all people should know that banks had read all about mcgarritys bumbling efforts at defending himself in court and he had no doubts that the man had been his own worst enemy but if vic greaves had killed his cousin linda it made much more sense of later events including nick barbers murder greaves certainly had a violent streak as he had made evident at the cottage after bankss visit perhaps banks thought greaves wasnt quite as crazy as he made himself out to be but he couldnt tell tania this she was partisan she would stick by her friends he sipped some coffee it was strong and full of flavor delicious he said she inclined her head at the compliment blue mountain jamaica did you know that linda had an illegitimate child yes she told me she gave him up for adoption she was only sixteen at the time and that child was nick barber he what my god no i didnt know that how i mean thats an incredible coincidence not really said banks plenty of people are adopted maybe nick came by his love of music through lindas genes i dont know about that but the knowledge did give him a particular interest in the mad hatters when he found out his birth mother was actually related to one of them then when he found out she had been murdered i should imagine his journalistic curiosity got him sniffing around that too you dont think it was anything to do with what happened to him do you only in that it set him on the course that led to his death he probably wouldnt have been writing that story and found out what he did if indeed thats what happened if his mother hadnt been linda lofthouse but there again maybe he would have done it anyway he was already a mad hatters fan i just find it a curious detail thats all you were at swainsview lodge the night robin merchant died werent you yes said tania banks couldnt be certain but he thought he detected a certain reticence or tightness slip into her tone what was he like robin of all of them he was probably the brightest and the most intellectual the weirdest too what do you mean he always seemed remote unreachable to me you couldnt touch him you didnt know where he was what he was thinking yet on the surface he was always friendly and pleasant enough he was well educated and well read but musically a bit plodding what was he like with the girls oh they all fancied robin he was so pretty with that mass of dark curls and all but im not sure i mean i dont think he really cared that much for anyone underneath it all i didnt know him long but he never had any sort of relationship during that time it was all rather mechanical for him he took what he was offered then cast them aside he was more into metaphysical and occult things black magic tarot cards astrology eastern philosophy the cabala that sort of thing a lot of people were into it back then as they are again now said banks thinking of madonna and all the other stars who had discovered the cabala of late not to mention scientology which had also been a powerful presence in the late sixties if you just wait everything comes around again i suppose so tania said anyway robin was usually immersed in some book or other he didnt say much as i said i didnt really know him nobody did his life outside the band was a mystery to all of us if he had one did linda like him she said he was cute yeah but like i said she was into other things at the time men werent really high on her list of priorities but she wasnt off them completely oh no im sure shed have been interested if the right person had come along she was just tired of the attitude some of the guys had free love what they thought it meant was that they could screw any woman they wanted what about relations between robin and vic greaves nothing unusual really robin seemed upset sometimes that vic got more of his songs performed but vic was the better songwriter robins lyrics were too arcane too dark thats all yes as far as i know it was nothing more serious mostly they got along just fine and the rest of the band same there were disagreements of course as there always are when groups of people spend too much time cooped up together but they werent at each others throats all the time if thats what you mean id say as things go in this business as a group they were a pretty wellbehaved bunch of kids and ive seen some bad behavior in my time and after you joined everyone treated me with respect they still do what were the other members like as individuals well vic was the sensitive poet and robin as i said the intellectual and the mystic reg was the angry one the workingclass boy made good with a bloody great chip on his shoulder hes over it now more or less i think a few million quid might have had a bit to do with that but it was what drove him back then terry was the quiet one hed had a rough background apparently his father died when he was just a kid and his mother was really weird i think she ended up in an institution eventually he was troubled but he never really talked about it he seems to be a bit better adjusted these days at least he manages to smile and speak a civil word now and then and adrian well he was the joker the funlover still is laugh a minute adrian and you tania raised her delicately arched eyebrows me im the enigmatic one banks smiled what about your relationship with chris adams it faded over time its hard to keep a relationship going the punishing schedule we had those first two or three years we were touring or recording constantly but were still friends have been ever since the night robin merchant drowned banks said did you really expect the police to believe that you were all sound asleep in bed she seemed taken aback by the question but she answered without much hesitation they did didnt they death by misadventure but you werent all asleep all the time were you banks pressed shooting in the dark hoping for a hit tania looked at him her green eyes disconcerting he could tell she was trying to weigh him up figure out what he knew and how he might have found out its a long time ago she said i cant remember come off it tania banks said why did you all lie for gods sake nobody lied she shook her head puffing on her third cigarette oh what the hell it was just a lot easier that way none of us killed robin we knew that why would we if wed said we were all up and about theyd only have asked more stupid questions and we were all a bit the worse for wear we just wanted to be left alone so what really happened i honestly dont know i was drunk if you must know drugs some of the others i stuck to vodka believe it or not i never did anything else except for a few tokes once in a while anyway it was a big house people were all over the place you couldnt possibly keep track of one another even if you wanted to were people out by the swimming pool i dont know i wasnt if anybody saw robin in there then they knew it was too late to do anything for him so you just left him there until the gardener came the next morning youre putting words into my mouth im not saying thats what happened i didnt see him there and i dont know for a fact that anyone else did but someone could have of course someone could have but what use is could have especially now and someone could have pushed him in oh for christs sake why would anyone do that i dont know maybe things werent all as peachy as you say they were tania sat forward look ive had enough of this you come into my house and call me a liar to my face im not the one calling you a liar youve already admitted you lied to the police in why should i believe you now because im telling the truth i cant think of any reason on earth why any of us would have wanted robin dead im just trying to find the connection between then and now well maybe there isnt one have you thought of that yes ive thought of that but put yourself in my position i have one definite murder in september and though the killer was apparently caught and jailed theres still room for doubt in my mind we have another death in june easily explained as an accident at the time but now you tell me that people were up and about most of the night maybe theres some doubt about that too and the common factor to all of these the mad hatters and nick barber was going to write their story specifically vic greavess story and he made reference to a murder tania drew on her cigarette thought for a moment look she said i know when you put it like that it sounds suspicious but theyre all just coincidences i was at that party when robin died and to my recollection there were no arguments everyone just had a good time and that was that we all went off to bed i was with chris at the time but it was hard to sleep a hot night and maybe people got the munchies whatever and wandered around went to raid the fridge i mean i heard people around the place on and off voices laughter vic was tripping as usual maybe some of the group even swapped partners it happened you werent asleep the whole time of course not and chris adams was with you all night yes come on tania well i i mean maybe not every minute of the night so you woke up and he wasnt there it wasnt like that for crying out loud are you trying to blame chris now what is it with you believe it or not said banks im just trying to get at the truth maybe it was a lark maybe someone was playing around with robin beside the pool and he slipped and fell an accident in that case why does it matter now even if robin wasnt the only one by the pool at the time if it was an accident anyway why does it matter because if someone feels threatened by the truth and if nick barber was close to that truth then banks spread his hands couldnt there be some other explanation like what i dont know robbery well nicks laptop and his mobile were stolen but that just supports the theory that someone didnt want people to know what he was doing his girlfriend or something then a jealous lover arent most people killed by someone they know someone close to them true enough said banks and its an area weve been looking into along with a drug connection but weve had no luck there yet i just dont see how the past could have had anything to do with it its over judgments were handed down if theres one thing ive learned in all my years as a detective banks said its that the past is never over no matter what has been handed down banks was on his way back from visiting tania hutchison when two uniformed constables brought calvin soames into western area headquarters in eastvale annie cabbot had them put him in an empty interview room and let him wait there awhile where did you find him she asked one of the pcs daleside above helmthorpe maam he said he was hiding in an old shepherds shelter must have been there all night fair shivering he was is he okay he seems all right it might be a good idea to have a doctor check him out though just to be on the safe side thanks said annie ill put in a call to dr burns in the meantime i think ill have a little chat with mr soames myself annie called winsome over and noticed templeton looking at them anxiously from behind his desk what is it kev she called out sudden attack of conscience bit late for that isnt it she immediately regretted her outburst but it had no effect on templeton who just shrugged and got back to his paperwork annie could have throttled him but that way hed win calvin soames looked wet cold and miserable and old at least there was some heat in the otherwise bleak interview room and the constable had had the foresight to give him a gray blanket which he wore over his shoulders like a robe well calvin said annie after dealing with the preliminaries and making it clear on the tape that soames had refused the services of a duty solicitor what have you been up to soames said nothing he just stared at a fixed point ahead of him a nerve at the side of his jaw twitching whats wrong annie said cat got your tongue still soames said nothing annie leaned back in her chair hands resting on the desk youll have to talk eventually she said we already know what happened then you dont need me to tell you do you we do need to hear it in your own words i hit her something snapped and i hit her thats all you need to know why did you hit kelly you know what she did she slept with a man she liked is that so terrible thats not what he said annie looked puzzled what who said soames looked at winsome you know who he said he means kev templeton guv winsome said annie had worked that out for herself what did ds templeton say she asked i wont repeat the words he used soames said vile terrible things disgusting things so templetons inflammatory language had set soames off on his rampage annie thought as if she needed more evidence of his culpability even so she cursed him again under her breath what about the drink soames scratched his head i wont say im proud of that he said i used to be a harddrinking man but i got it under control down to a couple of pints for the sake of being sociable i let myself he stopped and put his head in his hands annie wasnt certain what the next words were but she thought she heard him say her mother mr soames she said gently calvin would you speak clearly please soames wiped his eyes with the backs of his hands i said she was just like her mother what was her mother like a goodfornothing slut kelly said she thought you were talking to her as if she were her mother is that true i dont know i just saw red i dont know what i was saying her mother was younger than me pretty the farm it wasnt her sort of life she liked the town and the parties and the dances there were men more than one she didnt care whether i knew about them or not she flaunted it laughed at me then she died yes that must have torn you apart said annie soames gave her a sharp glance i mean she caused you so much pain but there she was dying thanks to medical incompetence you must have felt for her despite how she hurt you it was gods judgment how did kelly react to all this i tried to keep it all from her he said but shes turned out to be just the same thats not true annie said she was aware that the tape was running and she was exceeding her role as interviewer but she couldnt help it let superintendent gervaise give her another bollocking if that was what it came down to just because kelly slept with someone it doesnt mean she was a slut or any other of those words men like to call women you should be talking to your daughter not beating her with a chair leg im not proud of what i did said soames ill face the consequences damn right you will said annie and so will kelly unfortunately what do you mean i mean shes lying there in a hospital bed because of you and do you know what shes worried about you about what will happen to you i sinned ill take my punishment and what about kelly shell be better off without me oh stop feeling sorry for yourself annie didnt trust herself to continue the interview she shoved a statement sheet over to him and stood up look write down in your own words exactly what happened what you can remember of it then dc jackman here will see that its typed up for you to sign in the meantime the police surgeon will be coming in to look you over just routine anything else you want to say kelly how is she recovering said annie her hand on the doorknob its nice of you to ask chapter eighteen as banks sifted through the files on his desk on saturday morning he noticed the extra photocopy he had made of the list of numbers at the back of nick barbers book it reminded him that he hadnt heard back from dc gavin rickerd yet so he picked up the phone rickerd answered on the third ring anything on those numbers i gave you yet banks asked sorry sir said rickerd weve been snowed under i havent had a lot of time to work on it any ideas at all it might be some kind of code but without a key it could be very difficult to crack i dont think we have any keys said banks well sir look just keep trying will you if i come up with anything that i think might help you ill let you know as soon as i can okay sir thanks gavin as banks put down the phone annie came in to tell him that after fairly exhaustive inquiries made by the metropolitan police there was no evidence to suggest that nick barber had been involved with the cocaine business thats interesting said banks seeing as it was chris adams who suggested we look there a bit of nifty misdirection looks like it to me i want another word with adams anyway maybe i can intimidate him with the old wastingpolicetime routine maybe said annie any news on kelly soames she was discharged from hospital this morning shes staying with an aunt here in eastvale for the time being calvin soames cant just walk away annie no matter how contrite he is you know that i know said annie you dont think i want him to get off scotfree do you but its kelly im concerned about at the moment kellys young shell get over it i doubt that any magistrate or jury is going to put calvin away should he even see the inside of a courtroom hell plead guilty he wants to be punished ill bet you kelly wont go into the witness box and we wont have much of a case without her testimony whats that annie pointed at the list on bankss desk he realized that she hadnt been with him when hed found it and he hadnt looked at it since he gave the copy to rickerd some figures nick barber had scribbled in the back of his book annie peered at it of course the kelly soames business put it right out of my mind but i was meaning to ask you about that barry gilchrist in the computer shop mentioned that he saw nick barber writing in the back of a book while he was on the web i wonder what it is does it mean anything to you banks asked no annie laughed but it does remind me of something oh what never mind seriously it could be important just something i used to do when i was younger thats all banks could hardly keep the exasperation out of his voice what annie gave him a look he could see that she was blushing you know she said ring dates what dates for crying out loud annie glanced over her shoulder and lowered her voice she still sounded as if she were shouting at him are you thick or something im trying not to be but youve lost me my period idiot i used to ring the day of the month my period was due its something a lot of girls do i know this isnt exactly the same not the same time between them for a start but its the same idea well pardon me but not being a girl and not having periods dont be sarcastic maybe its family birthdays or lottery numbers or whatever but it amounts to the same thing ive told you what you want to know it reminds me of when i used to ring dates on the calendar to mark the start of my period okay banks held his hands up okay he said i surrender annie snorted turned away abruptly and left the room still feeling the disturbed air buffeting in her wake banks sat and gazed at the numbers six rows many numbers duplicated and no list going beyond a calendar of some kind then ringed dates but why were they ringed and perhaps even more to the point which months which year did they refer to and why were some days missing it should be possible to find out banks thought perhaps with the help of a computer then he realized that each group was not even necessarily from the same month or the same year they could be strings of days taken over a period of say thirty years his spirits fell and he cursed nick barber under his breath for not being more clear with his notes realizing that this might be the clue he was looking for perhaps the only one nick had left and he felt about as far from understanding it now as he ever had annie had got over her irritation with banks by midafternoon when he came poking his head around the squad room door to tell her that ken blackstone had discovered the whereabouts of yvonne chadwick di stanley chadwicks daughter and would she like to accompany him to the interview she didnt need asking twice bugger superintendent gervaise she thought grabbing her jacket and briefcase she noticed kev templeton give her an evil eye as she left the room maybe he was already getting the cold shoulder from madame gervaise now that what had happened to kelly soames had made the local news banks was quiet as annie drove the unmarked car she had signed out of the police garage she kept snatching sideways glances at him and realized he was thinking well that was a good sign she drove on i checked the mad hatters web site by the way she said and definite possibilities for the numbers in the back of the book there are links to other fan sites with tour dates and all sorts of esoteric information ill need a lot more time to follow up on it all maybe when we get back sounds good yvonne chadwick or reeves as she was now called lived on the outskirts of durham which wasnt too far up the a from eastvale the road was busy with lorries as usual and on a couple of occasions the inevitable roadworks canceled out a lane or two and slowed traffic to a crawl annie glimpsed durham castle high on its hill and followed the directions banks had written down for her the house was a semi with a bay window in a pleasant leafy neighborhood where you wouldnt be afraid to let your children play in the street yvonne reeves turned out to be a rather plump nervous woman of about fifty who favored a gray peasant skirt and a shapeless maroon jumper if she dressed up a bit annie thought she would be much more attractive she wore her long graying hair tied back in a ponytail the interior of the house was clean and tidy bookcases lined the walls mostly philosophy and law with a sprinkling of literature the living room was a little cramped but comfortable once they had wedged themselves into the leather armchairs there wasnt much natural light and the room smelled of dark chocolate and old books this is all very intriguing said yvonne her voice still bore the traces of her yorkshire roots though many of the rough edges had been flattened over the years but ive no idea at all why you think i might be able to help you whats it all about have you heard about the death of a music journalist called nick barber banks asked i think i saw something in the paper yvonne said wasnt he murdered somewhere in yorkshire near lyndgarth said banks i still dont understand nick barber was working on a story about a group called the mad hatters do you remember them good lord yes of course i do in september there was a pop festival in north yorkshire at brimleigh glen remember you would have been about fifteen yvonne clapped her hands together sixteen i was there i wasnt supposed to be but i was my father was terribly strict he would never have let me go if id told him you might also remember then that a young girl was found dead when the festival was over her name was linda lofthouse of course i remember it was my fathers case he solved it yes a man called mcgarrity annie noticed yvonne give a little shiver at the name and an expression of distaste flitted across her features did you know him she asked before the moment was lost yvonne flushed mcgarrity how could i she was a poor liar annie thought i dont know you just seemed to react to the name thats all dad told me about him of course he sounded like a terrible person look yvonne annie persisted i get the feeling theres a bit more to it than that i know it was a long time ago but if you know anything that might help us then you should let us know how could knowing about back then possibly help you now because said banks we think the cases might be linked nick barber was linda lofthouses son she gave him up for adoption but he found out who his mother was and what happened to her that gave him a special interest in the mad hatters and the mcgarrity case we think that nick had stumbled across something to do with his mothers murder and that he was killed for it which means that we have to look very closely at what happened at brimleigh and afterward someone who worked on the case with your father let slip that mcgarrity had possibly terrorized another girl but that never came up at the trial or in the case notes we also heard that mr chadwick had a bit of trouble with his daughter that she was perhaps running with a wild crowd but we couldnt get anything more specific than that it might be nothing and i might be wrong but you are that daughter and if you do know something anything at all please tell us and let us be the judges yvonne said nothing for a few moments annie could hear a radio in the back of the house probably the kitchen talking not music yvonne chewed on her lip and stared over their heads at one of the bookcases yvonne annie said if theres anything we dont know about you should tell us it cant possibly harm you not now but it was all so long ago yvonne said god i was such an idiot an arrogant selfish stupid idiot that would describe quite a lot of sixteenyearolds annie said it broke the ice a little and yvonne managed a polite laugh i suppose so she said then she sighed i used to run with a wild crowd its true she said well not really wild but different hippies youd call them the kind of people my father hated hed go on about why he fought the war for lazy cowardly sods like that but they were harmless really well most of them and mcgarrity mcgarrity was a sort of hangeron older not really part of the crowd but they couldnt summon the energy or find a reason to kick him out so he drifted from place to place sleeping on floors and in empty beds nobody really liked him he was weird and he had a knife yes a flickknife with a tortoiseshell handle nasty thing of course he said he lost it but but the police found it in one of the houses said banks your father found it yes yvonne squinted at banks you seem to know plenty about this already its my job i read the trial transcripts but they didnt tell me about the girl he terrorized the one your father asked him about during the interrogation i suppose not it was you wasnt it me you knew mcgarrity something happened how else could you explain your fathers zeal in pursuing him or his reticence to pursue the issue he abandoned all his other leads and concentrated on mcgarrity now id say that was a little personal wouldnt you okay i told him yvonne said mcgarrity frightened me we were alone together in the front room at springfield mount and he frightened me what did he do it wasnt so much anything he did just the way he talked looked at me grabbed me he grabbed you my arm just a bruise and he touched my cheek it made me cringe mostly it was the things he said though he wanted to talk about linda and when that got him all excited he started going on about those murders in los angeles we didnt know who did it then manson and his family but we knew the people had been butchered and someone had written piggies on the walls in blood he found all that exciting and he said he go on yvonne annie urged her yvonne looked at her as she answered he said hed you know watched me with my boyfriend and that now it was going to be his turn so he threatened to rape you annie said thats what i thought thats what i was scared of did he have his knife banks asked i didnt see it what did he say about linda lofthouse just how pretty she was and how it was sad that she had to die but that it was an absurd and arbitrary world is that all then he talked about the manson murders and asked me if i would like to do something like that what happened next i made a break for it and ran for my life he was pacing spouting gibberish and then what i told my father he was furious i can understand that said banks i have a daughter myself and id feel exactly the same way what happened next the police raided springfield mount and a couple of other hippie pads that night they gave everyone a hard time brought some drugs charges against them but it was mcgarrity they really wanted hed been at the festival you see at brimleigh and plenty of people had seen him wandering around near the edge of the woods with his flickknife did you think he did it i dont know i suppose so i never really questioned it yet he went on to deny it said he was framed yes but all criminals do that dont they thats what my father told me its pretty common said banks so there look what is this all about hes not due to be released is he you need have no worries on that score he died in prison oh well i cant say im heartbroken what happened after the arrest and everything yvonne shook her head slowly i cant believe what an absolute idiot i was my father let my boyfriend at springfield mount know that he was my father and told him to stay away from me steve his name was what an awful selfobsessed little prick but a goodlooking one as i remember ive known one or two like that myself said annie banks glanced at her as if to say well get back to that later anyway yvonne went on it was the usual story i thought he loved me but he just wanted me out of the way it was so embarrassing you know its funny but the thing i remember most about the room is the goya print on the wall el sueño de la razón produce monstruos the sleep of reason produces monsters the one of the sleeping man surrounded by owls bats and cats it used to scare me and fascinate me at the same time if you know what i mean did you go there again after the raid yes the next day steve didnt want to know me none of them did he spread the word that i was a coppers daughter and i was ostracized by the lot of them she snorted nobody wants to share a joint with a coppers daughter what did you do i was really hurt i ran away from home took all the money i could and went to london i had one address there lizzie a girl whod stayed at springfield mount once she was nice and let me sleep in a sleeping bag on her floor but it wasnt very clean there were mice and they kept trying to get into the sleeping bag so i had to hold it tight around my neck and i couldnt really get any sleep she gave a little shiver and there were even more weird people about than there had been in leeds i was very depressed and i started to get frightened of my own shadow i think lizzie got really fed up with me she talked about negative energy and stuff like that i was feeling lost then really out of place like i didnt belong anywhere and nobody loved me typical adolescent angst i can see now but at the time so what did you do i went back home she gave a harsh laugh two weeks that was the sum of my lifes big adventure and how did your parents react relief and anger i hadnt rung them you see that was cruel of me if my daughter did that id be beside myself but thats how selfish and how upset i was my father being a policeman always thought the worst he had visions of me lying dead somewhere he even told me that at first he thought something had happened to me and that maybe it had something to do with mcgarrity or the others taking revenge on me for shopping them but he couldnt do anything official because he didnt want people to know it must have torn him apart he took his duty as a policeman so seriously didnt want people to know what about me and those hippies what was your father like during the investigation and trial he was working very hard very long hours i remember that and he was very tense tightly wound he started getting chest pains i remember but it was a long time before he would go to the doctor we didnt talk much he was under a lot of strain i think he was doing it for me he thought hed lost me and he was taking it out on mcgarrity and everyone else involved it wasnt a comfortable time in the house not for any of us but better than mice in the sleeping bag annie said yvonne smiled yes better than that but we were all glad when it was over and mcgarrity was convicted it seemed to take forever like a big black cloud over our heads i dont think the trial started until the following april then it went on for about four weeks things were pretty tense anyway in the meantime i went back to school got on with my a levels then i went to university in hull this would be the early seventies there were still a lot of longhairs about but i kept my distance id learned my lesson i applied myself to my studies and in the end i became a schoolteacher and married a university professor he teaches here at durham we have two children a boy and a girl both married now and thats the story of my life did you ever hear your father express any doubts about mcgarritys guilt banks asked no not that i can remember its as if he was on a crusade i cant imagine what he would have done if mcgarrity had got off it doesnt bear thinking about as it was the whole thing ruined his health and your mother mum stood by him she was a brick she was devastated when he died of course we both were but eventually she remarried and lived quite happily she died in we were close right until the end she only lived a short drive away and she loved her grandchildren thats nice said annie weve nearly finished now the only other thing we want to ask you about is the death of robin merchant the hatters bass player god i was absolutely gutted robin was so cool they were one of my favorite bands back when i used to listen to pop music and wed sort of claimed them as our own too you know they were from leeds yes said annie anyway what about him did your father say anything about it i dont think so why would he oh yes my god this is taking me back he talked to them during the mcgarrity thing and he got me an lp signed by all of them i think ive still got it somewhere must be worth a bob or two now said banks oh id never sell it still did he say anything about robin merchant no well it was nothing to do with him was it that was the next summer after mcgarrity had been sent to jail and my dads heart was starting to show the strain even more we never really talked about those sorts of things you know the music and hippie stuff not after i came back from london i mean i was done with that scene and my dad was grateful for that so he didnt go on at me about it anymore mostly i threw myself into my a levels does this mean anything to you banks brought out a photocopy of the ringed numbers from the back page of nick barbers book yvonne frowned at it im afraid not she said i didnt say i was a maths teacher we think it might be dates banks explained most likely dates connected with the mad hatters tour schedule or something similar but weve no idea which months or years leaves it pretty wide open doesnt it then annie looked at banks and shrugged well that banks said is just about it unless di cabbot has any more questions for you no said annie standing and leaning forward to shake yvonnes hand thanks for your time youre welcome im only sorry i couldnt be any more help what do you think about what yvonne told us annie asked banks over an afterwork drink with cheeseandpickle sandwiches in the queens arms the bar was half empty and the pool table happily not in use a couple of lateseason tourists sat at the next table poring over ordnance survey maps and speaking german i think what she said should make us perhaps just a little more suspicious of stanley chadwick and his motives said banks chadwick what do you mean if he really thought his daughter had been terrorized and threatened with rape and he was on a personal crusade who knows what he might have done i try to imagine how i would behave if anything like that ever happened to tracy and i tell you i can really frighten myself yvonne told us that mcgarrity talked about the dead girl to her about linda lofthouse admittedly she didnt say hed given her any information only the killer could have known but we both know that sort of thing mostly just happens on tv but what he did say sounded damn suspicious to me imagine how it sounded to her father at his wits end trying to catch a killer and worried about his daughter hanging around with hippies then he finds out this weirdo who terrorized her had a flickknife and was seen wandering around with it at brimleigh festival imagine he puts the two together and suddenly the light goes on yvonne told us he didnt really look at anyone else for the crime after that rick hayes went right out of the picture it was mcgarrity all the way and only mcgarrity but the evidence says mcgarrity did it no it doesnt everyone knew that mcgarrity carried a flickknife with a tortoiseshell handle including stanley chadwick it wouldnt have been that hard for him to get hold of one just like it dont forget yvonne says she didnt see the knife when mcgarrity terrorized her because hed already hidden it or lost it as he said i dont believe this said annie youd take the word of a convicted killer over a detective inspector with an unimpeachable reputation im just thinking out loud for gods sake trying to get a handle on nick barbers murder and have you banks sipped some black sheep im not sure yet but i do believe that chadwick could have obtained such a knife tricked mcgarrity into handling it and got access to linda lofthouses clothing and blood samples it might be a lot tougher now but not necessarily back then before pace someone in chadwicks position would probably have had free run of the place and i think he might have been driven to do it because of what had happened to his daughter remember this was a man on a mission convinced hes right but unable to prove it by legitimate means weve all been there so in this case because its personal and because of suspicious and disturbing things his daughter has told him about mcgarrity that he cant use without bringing her into it and losing all credibility he goes the extra mile and fabricates the vital bit of evidence he needs remember apart from the knife theres no case it falls apart and theres another thing what chadwicks health he was basically a decent godfearing lawabiding copper with a strong presbyterian background probably deeply repressed because of his war experiences and angry with what he saw around him the disrespect of the young the hedonism the drugs turned psychoanalyst now have you you dont need to be a psychoanalyst to know that if chadwick really did fabricate a case against mcgarrity even for the best of reasons it would tear a man like him apart as yvonne said he was a dedicated copper the law and basic human decency meant everything to him he might have lost his faith during the war but you cant change your nature that easily annie put her glass to her cheek but mcgarrity was seen near the murder scene he was known to be seriously weird he had a flickknife he was lefthanded and he had met the victim why do you insist on believing that he didnt do it and that a good copper turned bad im not insisting im just trying it out for size wed never prove it now anyway except by proving that someone else killed linda lofthouse well there is that who do you think my moneys on vic greaves why because he was mentally unstable thats part of it yes he had a habit of not knowing what he was doing and he had dark visions on his acid trips remember he took acid that night at brimleigh as well as on the night of robin merchants death it doesnt take a great stretch of the imagination to guess that maybe he heard voices telling him to do things but linda lofthouse was his cousin so if you work on the theory that most people are killed by someone they know particularly a family member it makes even more sense you dont think he killed robin merchant too do you its not beyond the bounds of possibility maybe merchant knew or guessed but greaves had no history of violence at all not to mention no motive okay ill give you all that but it doesnt mean he couldnt have flipped drugs do very strange things to people what about nick barber he found out how i havent got that far yet well said annie i still think stanley chadwick got it right and patrick mcgarrity did it even so rick hayes might be worth another look too if we can find him if you insist annie finished her britvic orange thats my good deed for the day she said what are you up to tomorrow banks asked tomorrow browsing web sites most likely why i just thought you might like to take an hour or two off and come out for sunday lunch with me and meet emilia emilia brians girlfriend didnt i tell you shes an actress been on telly really bad girls among others one of my favorites all right sounds good lets just keep our fingers crossed that nothing interrupts us like it did the other night for once it wasnt long after dark when banks got home having checked back at the station after his drink with annie and found things ticking along nicely brian and emilia were out somewhere which allowed him a few delicious moments alone to listen to a recent cd purchase of susan graham singing french songs and enjoy a glass of roys amarone when brian and emilia finally got back the cd was almost over and the glass of wine half empty banks went into the kitchen to greet them dad said brian putting packages on the table we went to york for the day we didnt know if you were going to be here so we picked up an indian takeaway theres plenty if you want to share no thank you said banks trying not to imagine what seismic reactions might occur in his stomach when curry met amarone im not really hungry i had a sandwich earlier how did you enjoy york great said emilia we did all the tourist stuff you know toured the minster visited jorvik we even went to the train museum you took her there banks said to brian dont blame me it was her idea its true emilia said taking brians hand i love trains i had to drag him they both laughed banks remembered taking brian to the national railway museum or york railway museum as it was then known on a day trip from london when he was about seven how he had loved climbing all over the immaculate steam engines and playing at being the driver brian and emilia ate their curry at the kitchen bench while banks sat sipping his wine and chatting with them about their day when they had finished eating brian tidied up an oddity in itself then said oh i forgot i bought you a present dad me said banks you shouldnt have its not much brian took an hmv bag from his backpack sorry i havent had a chance to wrap it properly banks slipped the case out of the plastic bag it was a dvd the mad hatters story judging by the account on the back of the box it contained footage from every stage of the bands career including the earliest lineup with vic greaves and robin merchant should be interesting banks said do you want to watch it with me i wouldnt mind emilia emilia took a book out of her shoulder bag reading lolita in tehran not me she said with a smile im tired its been a long day i think ill go to bed and read for a while and leave you boys together she kissed brian then turned to banks and said good night good night banks said look before you go would the two of you like to come out for sunday lunch with annie and me tomorrow if we can get away that is brian raised his eyebrows and looked at emilia who nodded sure he said then added with the weight of many broken engagements if you can get away i promise you are staying a while longer arent you if thats okay said brian of course it is if were not cramping your style that is banks felt himself blush no why should you i mean emilia said good night again smiled and went upstairs she seems like a nice girl he said to brian when she was out of earshot brian grinned she is is it serious well yes i suppose thats what i meant too early to say but i like her enough that id hurt if she left me as the song says which song ours idiot the last single ouch i dont buy singles i know that dad i was teasing and it wasnt even for sale on a cd you had to download it from itunes hey wait a minute i know how to do that now ive got an ipod im not a complete luddite you know brian laughed and grabbed a can of lager from the fridge banks refilled his glass and the two of them went into the entertainment room the dvd started with manager chris adams giving a potted history then segued into a documentary made up of old concert footage and interviews banks found it amusing and interesting to see the band members of thirtyfive years ago in their bellbottoms and floppy hats manage to sound pretentious and innocent at the same time as they spoke about peace and love man vic greaves looking wasted as usual in a interview went off at a tangent punctuated with long pauses every time the interviewer asked him a question about his songs there was something icily detached and slightly more cynical about robin merchant and his cool practical intelligence often provided a welcome antidote to the vapid and meandering musings of the others but it was the concert footage that proved most interesting there was nothing from brimleigh unfortunately except a few stills of the band relaxing with joints backstage but there were some excellent latesixties films of the band performing at such diverse places as the refectory at leeds university bristols colston hall and the paradiso in amsterdam at one of the gigs an outrageously stoned and enthusiastic mc yelled in a thick cockney accent and now ladies and gentlemen lets ave a uge and for the atters the music sounded wonderfully fresh and vic greavess innocent pastoral lyrics had a haunting and timeless sadness about them meshing with his delicate spacey keyboards work and terry watsons subtle riffs like many bass players robin merchant just stood and played expressionlessly but well and like many drummers adrian pritchard thrashed around at his kit like a maniac keith moon and john bonham were clearly big influences there there was something a bit odd about the lineup but banks was only half watching and half talking to brian and the next thing he knew both vic greaves and robin merchant were gone and the lovely if rather nervous tania hutchison was making her debut with the band at londons royal festival hall in early banks thought about his meeting with her the other day she was still a goodlooking woman and he might have fancied his chances but he thought he had alienated her with his probing questions that seemed to be the story of his life alienating women he fancied the documentary went on to portray the bands upward trajectory until their official retirement in with clips from the few reunion concerts they had performed since then along with interviews from an older chainsmoking shorthaired tania and a completely bald bloated and illlooking adrian pritchard reg cooper and terry watson must have declined to be interviewed because they appeared only in the concert footage when the film came to a sequence about disagreements within the band banks noticed brian tense a little since the investigation had taken him farther into the world of rock than he had ever been before he had thought a lot about brian and the life he was living not just drugs but all the trappings and problems that fame brought with it he thought of the great stars who had destroyed themselves at an early age through selfindulgence or despair kurt cobain jimi hendrix tim buckley janis joplin nick drake ian curtis jim morrison the list went on brian seemed all right but he was hardly likely to tell his father if he had a drug problem for example anything wrong banks asked wrong no why what could be wrong i dont know its just that you havent talked about the band much thats because theres not much to say so things are going fine brian paused well what is it he turned to face banks who turned down the dvd volume a notch or two dennys getting weird thats all if it gets much worse we might have to get rid of him denny banks knew was the bands other guitaristvocalist and brians songwriting partner get rid of him i dont mean kill him honestly dad sometimes i wonder about the effect your job has on you so do i banks thought but he also thought about killing off disruptive band members robin merchant for example and how easy it would have been just a gentle nudge in the direction of the swimming pool vic greaves had been disruptive too but he had made his own voluntary exit weird how he asked ego mostly i mean hes getting into really offthewall musical influences like acid celtic punk and hes trying to import it into our sound if you challenge him on it he gets all huffy and goes on about how its his band how he brought us together and all that shit what do the others have to say about him everybodys sort of retreated into their own worlds were not communicating very well were going through the motions theres no talking to denny we cant write together anymore what happens if he goes brian gestured toward the video we get someone else but were not going pop youre doing just fine as you are arent you we are i know were selling more and more people love our sound its got an edge but its accessible you know thats the problem denny wants to change it and thinks hes got a right to do so what about your manager geoff denny keeps sucking up to him banks immediately thought of kev templeton and how is geoff dealing with that brian scratched his chin come to think of it he said hes getting sick of it i think at first he liked it that someone in the band was giving him a lot of attention not to mention telling tales out of school but i dont know if youve ever noticed this its a weird thing but eventually people get fed up with their toadies from the mouths of babes banks thought as a lightbulb went on in his brain though brian was hardly a baby it was as he had suspected templeton was digging his own grave nobody needed to do anything sometimes the best thing to do is nothing annie ought to appreciate that too banks thought with her interests in taoism and zen have drugs got anything to do with it he asked brian looked at him drugs no if you mean have i ever done any drugs then the answers yes ive smoked dope and taken e i took speed once but when i came down i was depressed for a week so ive never touched it since nothing stronger and as it happens i still prefer lager okay okay said banks its good of you to be so frank but i was thinking more about the others brian smiled now i see how you trick confessions out of people anyway the answers still no believe it or not were a pretty straight band so what next banks asked brian shrugged dunno geoff said we all needed to take a breather wed been working so hard in the studio and on tour when we get back well see either denny will have changed his ideas or he wont what do you predict that he wont and then hell have to go does that worry you a bit not too much though i mean they did all right didnt they the mad hatters were performing their jaunty rocking number one hit young at heart the band will survive its more the lack of communication that upsets me i mean denny was a mate and now i cant talk to him losing friends is always sad said banks aware of how pathetic and pointless that observation was its just one of those things though when you first get together with someone its a great adventure finding out stuff youve got in common you know places you love music books then the more you get to know them the more you start to see other things yeah like a whingeing lying manipulative bastard said brian then he laughed and shook his empty can want another glass of plonk he asked banks whose glass was also empty sure why not said banks and he watched the lovely tania sway in pastel blue diaphanous robes that flowed around her like water while brian got the drinks there is one thing id like to know he said after a sip of amarone plonk indeed whats that brian asked just what the hell does acid celtic punk sound like chapter nineteen annie jotted something down then turned back to the computer monitor and scrolled it was monday morning on sunday most of the team had taken a welldeserved day off their first since nick barbers murder almost two weeks ago annie had spent the morning doing household chores the afternoon on the mad hatters web site and the evening enjoying that long bath and the trashy magazines she had been promising herself at lunchtime she had gone out with banks brian and emilia to the bridge in grinton emilia had been absolutely charming and annie had been secretly awestruck to meet an upandcoming actress more so than by meeting bankss rock star son whom she had met before though brian had also in his way been charming and far less full of himself than she remembered from previous occasions they had met he seemed to have matured and become comfortable with his success no longer the young tearaway with something to prove the coffee at her right hand was lukewarm and she made a face when she took a sip there was plenty of activity around her in the squad room but she was still on the web oblivious to most of it as she felt herself finally zooming in on the mystery of the numbers in the back of nick barbers book it wasnt such an esoteric solution after all she realized with a sense of disappointment it didnt suddenly make everything clear and solve the case and it was nothing she wouldnt have expected him to make a note of anyway she hadnt found everything she wanted at the official mad hatters web site but she had found links there that took her to more obscure fan sites as nick barber must have done in eastvale computes but all the owner had heard was the snatch of song that played when he accessed the official site now she negotiated her way through bright orange and red gothic print black backgrounds with stylized logos and flashing arrows all signs that some young web designer was eager to show off and lacked restraint before long her eyes were starting to buzz and her eyeballs felt as if they had been massaged with sandpaper once she had the final string jotted down she printed the whole document bookmarked the web site url and closed the browser then she rubbed her eyes and went in search of a fresh cup of coffee only to find that it was her turn to make a fresh pot when she finally got back to her desk it was close to lunchtime and she felt like a break from the office i was just thinking about you she said when banks popped his head around the door and asked her how she was getting on im feeling cooped up here why dont you take me to that new bistro by the castle and we go over what ive found so far what said banks lunch together two days in a row people will talk a working lunch annie said okay sounds good to me with templetons deepening frown following them annie picked up her papers and they walked out into the cobbled market square it was a fine day for the time of year scrubbed blue sky and just a hint of chill in the wind and a couple of coachloads of tourists from teesside were disembarking by the market cross and making a beeline for the nearest pub the church clock struck twelve as banks and annie crossed the square and took the narrow lane that wound up to the castle the bistro was down a small flight of stone stairs about halfway up the hill it had only been open about three months and had garnered some good local reviews because it was early only two of the tables were occupied already and the owner welcomed them giving them the pick of the rest they chose a corner table with their backs to the whitewashed walls that way nobody would be able to look over their shoulders little light got through the halfwindow and all you could see were legs and feet walking by but the muted wall lighting was good enough to read by they both decided on sparkling mineral water partly because annie rarely drank at lunchtime and banks said he was beginning to find that even one glass of wine so early in the day made him drowsy banks went for a steak sandwich and frites and annie chose the cheese omelette and green salad the food ordered and fizzy water poured they began to go over the results of her mornings work soft music played in the background eastvales idea of parisian chic charles aznavour edith piaf a little françoise hardy but it was so quiet as to be unobtrusive banks broke off a chunk of baguette buttered it and looked at annies notes put simply she said its the mad hatters tour dates from october to may but thats eight months and there are only six rows they didnt tour in december or february annie said she showed banks the printout from the web site i got this all from a site run by what must be their most devoted fan the trivia some of these people put out there is amazing anyway it must have been a godsend to a writer like nick barber but is it all accurate im sure there are errors annie said after all these web sites are unedited and its easy to make a mistake but on the whole id say its probably pretty close so the mad hatters were on tour the sixth eighth ninth twentyfirst twentysecond and twentyfifth of october thats how it goes yes said annie she handed him the printout and these were the places they played the dome brighton the locarno ballroom sunderland the guildhall portsmouth they got around they certainly did and the ringed dates just three of them as you can see said annie the twelfth of january the nineteenth of april and the nineteenth of may all in any significance in those two nineteenths i havent figured out the significance of any of the ringed dates yet maybe it was one of his girlfriends periods annie gave him a sharp nudge in the ribs dont be rude anyway periods dont come that irregularly not usually at any rate so you did consider it annie ignored him and prepared to move on just as their food arrived they took a short pause to arrange papers plates and knives and forks then carried on the first gap is three months the second is one drug scores perhaps what about the venues annie consulted her notes on the twelfth of january they were playing at the top rank suite in cardiff on the nineteenth of april they were at the dome in brighton and on the nineteenth of may they were at the van dyke club in plymouth you cant get much more diverse than that said banks okay now we need to find out if theres any significance at all to those dates and places the owner came over to see if everything was all right they assured him it was and he scooted off that kind of solicitude wouldnt last long in yorkshire annie thought finding herself wondering if his french accent was as false as his hairpiece ill enlist winsomes aid after lunch she said you i think its time i paid another visit to vic greaves said banks see if i can get any more sense out of him this time i was thinking of taking jenny fuller along but shes off on the lecture circuit and theres no on else around i can really trust for that sort of thing be careful said annie remember what happened to nick barber when he got too interested in greaves dont worry i will and good luck annie added by the sound of him youll need it banks cut off a lump of glutinous brown gristle from his steak and put it on the side of his plate the sight of it made annie feel vaguely queasy and very glad to be a vegetarian you know banks said i still cant decide whether greaves is truly bonkers or just a genuine english eccentric maybe there isnt much of a difference annie said have you thought of that there were plenty of cars parked on lyndgarths village green early on monday afternoon and several groups of walkers in serious gear had assembled for briefings nearby banks found a spot to park near the post office and headed up the lane to vic greavess cottage he was hoping that the man might be a bit more coherent this time and had a number of questions prepared to jog the exkeyboard players memory if he needed to since his last visit he had come to believe that stanley chadwick had been seriously misguided about patrick mcgarritys guilt for personal reasons and he now knew that not only had greaves been linda lofthouses cousin but that nick barber was her son which meant that greaves and barber were also related in some complicated way that banks couldnt quite figure out but most important it meant connections between the different cases and connections always excited banks he walked up the short path and knocked on the door the front curtains were closed no answer he remembered the last time how it had taken greaves a while to answer so he knocked again when he still got no answer he walked around to the back where there was a small cobbled yard and a storage shed he peeked through the grimy kitchen window and saw that things were in pretty much the same spotless order as they had been when he had first visited greaves curious banks tried the back door it opened he was treading on dangerous ground now he knew entering a suspects premises alone without a search warrant but he thought that if he had to he could justify his actions vic greaves was mentally unstable and banks feared that he might have come to some harm or harmed himself in some way even so he hoped he didnt stumble across the one piece of vital evidence that linked greaves inextricably with barbers murder or with linda lofthouses or he might have a hard time getting it admitted in court what he would do he decided was not touch anything and return with full authorization if he had to as he entered banks felt a shiver of fear run down his spine annie had been right in her warning if he indicated that he was at all close to the truth then greaves might lash out as banks thought he had done at nick barber he might already know who was at his door might be lying in wait armed and ready to attack banks moved cautiously through the dim kitchen at least all the knives were in their slots in the wooden block where greaves kept them banks stood still in the doorway that led through to the living room and listened nothing but the wind whipping the tree branches and the distant sounds of a car starting and a dog barking from what he could make out in the pale light that filtered through the curtains the living room was just as it had been too with newspapers and magazines piled everywhere banks stood at the bottom of the stairs and called out greavess name again still no answer tense and alert he started to walk up the stairs they creaked as he moved every once in a while he would pause but still he heard nothing he stood on the upstairs landing and listened again nothing it was a small cottage and in addition to the toilet and bathroom there were only two bedrooms banks checked the first and found it almost as full of newspapers and magazines as the living room then he went into the second which was obviously greavess bedroom in one corner lay a mattress heaped with sheets and blankets it reminded banks of nothing so much as a nest of some kind carefully he poked around with his toe in the bedsheets but no one was there either hiding or dead though the sheets were piled in an untidy mess they were clean and smelled of apples there was nothing else in the room except a wardrobe and a dresser full of old but clean and neatly folded clothes and underwear after a cursory glance in the toilet and bathroom which told him nothing banks went back downstairs into the living room it was an ideal opportunity for him to poke around but it didnt seem as if greaves had anything worth poking around for there were no mementos no mad hatters memorabilia no photos or keepsakes of any kind in fact as far as banks could tell the cottage contained nothing but a few basic toiletries clothes kitchenware and newspapers idly he started looking at some of the papers on the top of the pile northern echo and darlington amp stockton times along with the yorkshire evening post dating back about three years as far as he could tell the magazines covered just about everything from computing though greaves had no computer as far as banks had seen to coin collecting though there were none on the subject of rock music or music of any kind many of the magazines still had free gifts stuck to their covers and some hadnt even been removed from their cellophane wrapping finding nothing of interest among the papers banks headed for the shed in the backyard it had a padlock but it was already open just hanging there loosely on the hasp banks opened the door he expected more newspapers at the very least but the shed was empty it had no particular smell except for soil and wood spiders went about their webs in the corners and one particularly large specimen scuttled across the window banks shuddered he had hated spiders ever since he had found one under his pillow when he was about five banks closed the door behind him and left it as it was there was one thing he guessed that should have been there but wasnt vic greavess bicycle so had greaves gone rideabout or had he gone somewhere specific banks went back to his car and took out his mobile the signal was poor but at least there was one chris adams answered almost immediately mr adams said banks where are you at home why do you have any idea where vic greaves is im not his keeper you know no but youre the closest hes got to one sorry no i dont know why ive just been to see him and his bikes not there he does go out from time to time anywhere in particular he just rides i dont know where he goes look are you telling me theres some reason to be worried not at all im just trying to find him to ask him a few more questions what about things seem to be coming to a head i think were almost there you know who killed nick barber not yet but i think im getting close and vic knows this i dont know what he knows ill bet he can be remarkably perceptive at times though you never know with vic what goes in what goes straight through any idea where he might go no i told you he goes for bike rides from time to time helps keep him in shape if you hear from him please let me know okay one more thing mr adams yes the night robin merchant drowned were you up and around at the time who told you that were you of course not i was fast asleep you and i both know thats a load of bollocks mr adams and the police probably knew it even then they just didnt have any evidence to suggest robin merchant might have been murdered or that his death might have been caused by someone else in some way this is absurd is it tania have you been talking to tania why would that make a difference because she was pissed if youve talked to her shes no doubt told you we were what they call an item at the time her drug of choice was alcohol vodka mostly she was probably so drunk she didnt know her arse from her elbows so you werent up and about of course not besides tanias got it in for me we havent exactly been on the best of terms these past few years that wasnt exactly what tania had told him banks remembered who was lying oh whys that a mixture of business and personal matters and none of your business really now look this connections getting worse and worse im going to hang up now id like to talk to you again can you come by the station ill be passing nearby on my way to london next week ill try to drop in if i have the time try to make time and ring first i will if i can remember goodbye mr banks as banks was putting his mobile away he noticed he had voice mail waiting curious he pressed the button and after the usual introduction heard annies voice i hope things are going well with vic greaves she said winsome and i seem to be making some progress here and wed like to have a chat with you about the possibilities weve raised can you come back to the station as soon as you have a moment it could be important cheers well banks thought turning his car toward eastvale and slipping in an old roy harper cd flashes from the archives of oblivion at least someone was making progress winsome said she didnt need to use the online computer anymore so they adjourned to the privacy of bankss office the market square was busy with tourists and shoppers coming in and out of the narrow streets that radiated from it the day was warming up so banks opened his window about six inches to let some fresh air in the noise of the cars snatches of music laughter and conversations all sounded distant and muffled a whiff of diesel fumes from the revving coaches drifted in youve been busy by the looks of it banks said as winsome dropped a pile of paper on his desk yes sir she said ive been on the telephone or the internet over three hours now and i think youll find the results very interesting go ahead they sat in a semicircle around bankss desk so they could all see well winsome began pulling out the first sheet lets start with twelfth january top rank suite cardiff what happened there banks asked nothing at least not at the top rank suite where then hold your horses a minute said annie let winsome tell it her own way i spoke with the archivist at one of the big newspapers down there winsome went on the south wales echo and he seemed surprised that somebody else was asking him about that particular date somebody else exactly winsome went on it seems that nick barber did quite a bit of background work before he went up to yorkshire specifically into the mad hatters tour dates between the brimleigh festival and robin merchants death which makes me wonder why he needed to check the web sites at eastvale computes and jot what he found down in the back of his book said annie john butler the editor at mojo told me that barber was meticulous about checking his facts said banks he checked everything at least twice before he went after a story i should imagine he was getting it right preparing for another chat with vic greaves makes sense said annie go on winsome well sometimes he had to contact the local papers to see if they kept back issues but mostly he didnt need to most of what he wanted is available at the british library newspapers catalogue and he could read the papers on microfilm at the librarys newspaper reading room his london phone records by the way show quite a few calls to the library as well as to the local newspapers concerned in plymouth cardiff and brighton what did he discover in the first place winsome went on i should guess that he was simply looking for reviews of mad hatters performances maybe a few little quotes from the time to spice up his article as you said sir he was thorough and it looks as if he was also trying to get a broader context of the times you know little local snippets about what was going on that day in bristol or plymouth what was of interest to the people there that sort of thing background nothing unusual in that either banks said he was a music journalist i imagine he was also scrounging around for any old photos or live bootleg recordings he could find yes sir winsome said obviously he couldnt research every gig they played over a hundred towns and cities during that period but he did cover a fair bit of ground in the reading room ive spoken to the librarian he dealt with down there and she was able to give me a list of what he did get around to and fax me prints from the microfilm reader of the newspapers for the three dates in question she was very helpful sounded quite excited to be part of a police investigation actually it was the issues on the days after the gigs that interested barber of course because that was when the reviews appeared said banks exactly well winsome went on theres nothing especially interesting in the reviews apparently they were in good form that night even vic greaves its another item of news that i suspect was more interesting to nick barber she picked a sheet from her pile and turned it on the desk so that banks could read it im sorry about the quality sir she said but it was the best she could do at short notice the print was tiny and banks had to take out his reading glasses the story was about a young woman called gwyneth harris who was found dead in bute park near the city center of cardiff at six oclock in the morning of thirteenth january by an elderly man walking his dog gwyneth had apparently been held from behind and stabbed five times in the heart with a blade resembling that of a flickknife there were no more details jesus christ said banks linda lofthouse theres more said annie nodding to winsome who slipped out another sheet monday twentieth april the brighton amp hove gazette the day after the mad hatters played at the dome there not very well apparently the reviewer mentioned that greaves in particular seemed barely conscious and at one point reg cooper had to go over to him and direct his fingers to the right keys for the chords but theres a piece about a young girl called anita higgins found dead on a stretch of beach not far from the west pier stabbed said banks yes sir this time from the front and i suppose the same thing happened at the third circled gig western evening herald wednesday twentieth may a review of the mad hatters gig and an item about elizabeth tregowan aged seventeen found dead in hoe park plymouth this one was strangled so if it was the same person said banks he was getting bolder more daring more personal the first two he didnt even want to see him the third he stabbed from the front and the last he strangled is that all yes sir said winsome there may be more but these are the only three nick barber got around to uncovering it must have been enough for him its enough for anyone said banks if you count linda lofthouse at brimleigh thats four girls been murdered within close proximity to a mad hatters gig were any of them at the concerts had they any connection with the group we dont know yet annie said winsome thought it best to bring you uptodate as soon as possible on this and weve still got a lot of legwork to do we need followup stories if any are available and we need to get on to the local forces see what theyve got in their archives you know we never give everything out to the newspapers theres one more thing winsome said it might be of interest i dont know but the mad hatters were on tour in france most of august so said banks the flickknife said winsome theyre illegal here but you can get them easily enough in france and i dont think they had metal detectors all over the place back then right said banks excellent work so where does this lead us before he left for yorkshire nick barber found out about a trail of bodies after mad hatters gigs in the late sixties and early seventies starting with that of his birth mother clearly the local forces at the time had no communication about these killings which isnt surprising even as late as the eighties lack of interforce communications botched the yorkshire ripper investigation stanley chadwick thought hed got his man for good reason so he had no further interest in the case he also had problems of his own to deal with yvonne besides one of the victims was strangled not stabbed different mo even if chadwick had come across the story which is unlikely it wouldnt have meant anything to him and whod be looking at the mad hatters as a common denominator clearly nick barber was said annie before his second interview with vic greaves on the day of his murder friday he went to eastvale computes in the morning to verify his dates and he made a note of what he found what he already knew in the back of a book he was carrying we already know from the landlord of the cross keys that barber was in the habit of carrying a book with him when he went for a drink or a meal lucky for us he was so thorough said banks seeing as all his other research material was stolen so you think vic greaves is the killer annie asked i dont know when you put it like that it does sound a bit absurd doesnt it well somebody killed those girls annie argued and vic greaves was definitely around for each one why did he stop banks asked we dont know that he did annie answered though id guess he just became too disorganized to function obviously chris adamss been shielding him protecting him you think adams knows the truth probably annie said why would he shield greaves theyre old friends isnt that what you said tania hutchison told you they grew up together what about robin merchant he might have found out so you think greaves killed him too it wouldnt have been difficult just a little nudge trouble is said banks were not likely to get much sense out of greaves at least we can try yes banks stood up and grabbed his jacket great work winsome carry on with the followup get all you can from the locals where are you going i think i know where vic greaves is said banks im going to have a word with him dont you think you should take backup sir said winsome i mean if he really is the one he could be dangerous if you corner him no said banks remembering that annie had given him the same warning thats one thing thatll likely lose him to us for good he cant handle social interaction and hes especially afraid of strangers i can only imagine how hell react if a few carloads of coppers turn up at least hes seen me before i dont think ive got anything to fear from him i hope youre right said annie so did banks as he started the porsche and negotiated his way out of eastvale toward lyndgarth he recalled the fear he had felt searching greavess cottage and it made his mouth dry people as disturbed as vic greaves could sometimes summon up amazing almost superhuman strength at least banks had told annie and winsome where he was going before he set off and asked them to give him a twentyminute start before they sent in a patrol car as backup he couldnt be certain that greaves was where he thought he was he realized as he crossed the bridge over the swain and headed for lyndgarth but he had a damned good idea the estate agent had told him that someone had been seen in the vicinity of swainsview lodge and greaves had turned uncommunicative at the mention of the place it must have had very strong associations for him from a particular period of his life and it would be natural enough for him to gravitate there in times of stress or confusion or so banks hoped as he parked on the bleak daleside and the wind whipped at his face when he opened the car door the door through which he had previously entered was securely locked and banks was certain nobody could get in that way an unpaved lane ran down the hill by the side of the lodge to the riverside hamlet of brayke and at the top of the lane was a side entrance leading to two large garages both also locked a fairly high drystone wall ran down the hill parallel to the lane but it would be easy enough for anyone to climb banks thought especially in one section which had lost a few stones you might not be able to get into the house without breaking a window he realized but anyone could gain access to the grounds bankss first clue was a bicycle partially hidden in the ditch and covered with a blue plastic sheet held down by two stones flapping in the wind clearly greaves couldnt get himself and his bicycle over the wall too convinced that he was right now banks hopped the wall and found himself in the garden beyond the swimming pool where the vast neglected lawn started its long slope down to the river he moved up to the edge of the pool the familiar dark cracked stone covered with moss and lichens and the pool itself choked with weeds littered with broken glass and empty carlsberg tins he called out vic greavess name but the wind blew it back there were shadows everywhere and banks found himself jumping at each one a heavy knot at the center of his chest he was in the open he realized and wished he could be more certain of his assessment that vic greaves was harmless an empty coke tin came skittering out of the grass onto the patio and banks turned tense ready to defend himself when he reached the side of the pool closest to the house he thought he could see something sticking out from behind one of the pillars under the upper terrace close to where the french windows from the studio opened into the courtyard the area was in the shadows so it was hard to be sure but he thought it was the lower half of a leg with the trousers tucked into the boot when he got closer he saw it was actually a bicycle clip hello vic he said arent you going to come out after what seemed like a long time the leg moved and vic greavess shiny bald head appeared from behind the pillar you remember me dont you vic banks said theres no need to be afraid i came to see you at the cottage still vic didnt respond or move he just kept looking at banks come on out vic banks said i just want to ask you a few questions thats all vics not here the small voice said finally yes he is said banks vic held his ground banks circled a little so he could at least get a better view all right he said if you want to stay there stay ill talk to you from here okay the wind was howling in the recess made by the overhanging terrace but banks could just about make out greavess agreement he was sitting with his back to the wall hunched over arms hugging his knees to his chest ill do the talking said banks and you can tell me whether im right or wrong okay greaves studied him with serious narrowed eyes and said nothing it goes back a long time banks began to when the mad hatters played the brimleigh festival there was a girl backstage called linda lofthouse your cousin she got a backstage pass because of you she was with her best friend tania hutchison who became a member of the band about a year later but thats getting ahead are you with me so far greaves still didnt say anything but banks could swear he detected a flicker of interest in his expression cut forward to late on that last night of the festival led zeppelin were playing and linda needed a little space to clear her head so she went for a walk in the woods someone followed her was that you vic greaves shook his head are you sure banks persisted maybe you were tripping maybe you didnt know what you were doing but something happened didnt it something changed that night something snapped in you and you killed her perhaps you didnt realize what youd done perhaps it was like looking down on someone else doing it but you did it didnt you vic finally greaves found his voice no he said no hes wrong vics a good boy his words were almost blown into silence by the wind tell me how im wrong vic banks went on tell me what im wrong about i want to know cant said greaves cant tell yes you can am i wrong about how it happened what about cardiff what about brighton and plymouth were there any others greaves just shook his head from side to side muttering something banks couldnt hear for the wind im trying to help you said banks but i cant help if you dont tell me the truth there is no truth said greaves there must be who killed those girls who killed nick barber did he find out is that why did he confront you with the evidence why dont you leave him alone said a deep voice behind banks you can tell he doesnt know whats going on banks turned and saw chris adams standing by the pool ponytail blowing in the wind bulbous face red potbelly sagging over his jeans banks walked over to him i think he does he said but seeing as youre here why dont you tell me i think you know as much about it as he does it was all over and done with years ago said adams you may wish it was but it isnt thats what nick barber found out about isnt it so vic here killed him no thats not what happened what about the girl in cardiff the one in plymouth what about them adams paled you know it wasnt that hard once we started following in nick barbers footsteps he was thorough and even his killer didnt manage to obliterate everything hed found out why have you been protecting vic greaves all these years look at him mr banks said adams what would you do hes my oldest friend we grew up together for crying out loud hes like a baby hes a killer that means he could kill again you werent able to supervise him twentyfour hours a day i imagine you only came down here because i phoned you and told you things were coming to a head that i was close to finding out who killed nick barber you guessed where vic was hes been here before hasnt he and told you about it too ill bet the place does seem to attract him said adams calmly but youre wrong about the rest vics no killer at first banks thought adams was blowing smoke but something snagged at his mind a little thing and it pulled until it brought a number of other little things tumbling into the open with it as the wind howled around his head banks found himself rearranging the pieces inside and putting them together in a different pattern one he could have kicked himself for not seeing sooner he still wasnt sure about everything yet but it was all starting to add up was greaves lefthanded he tried to remember from their meeting which hand greaves had been stirring the stew with but he couldnt he was certain of one thing though when he was watching the mad hatters dvd the previous evening with brian he had noticed that robin merchant played his bass lefthanded like paul mccartney he had simply registered it unconsciously at the time not really made anything of it or tried to link it to the case but now as he thought about it he realized that the last killing they knew of was on the nineteenth of may about a month before robin merchants drowning unless there were other later incidents that barber hadnt uncovered the timing worked he glanced at his watch he had been at swainsview lodge for only ten minutes robin merchant he said bravo said adams robin merchant was one sick puppy as they say oh he was glib and charming enough on the surface but beyond that it was a case of jekyll and hyde his mind was polluted by all that aleister crowley stuff he immersed himself in have you heard about crowley i know the name said banks he was a drug addict and a womanizer the selfproclaimed wickedest man in the world the great beast his motto was do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law robin merchant took him quite literally do you know robin even tried to justify his sacrifices as he called them to me he had no conscience even before he got involved in drugs and black magic and all that shit it just made him worse made him think he was more godlike or more devillike i should say but he hid it so well he got obsessed with those los angeles murders too the ritualistic elements he thought he saw some sort of occult significance in them i dont know if you remember but they finally caught manson that october and robin started to identify with him and his power trip he saw himself as some sort of messenger of darkness he didnt murder rich piggies though he murdered beauty and purity the flower was his signature what happened why should i tell you because you know ill find out adams sighed and stared across the pool as if he were staring across forty years of bad history he reached in his pockets for a cigarette dipped his head and cupped his hand to light it against the wind i saw him he said finally the fifth time in winchester you dont know about that one do you no said banks thats because i saved her life adams spoke without any hint of vanity or selfsatisfaction as if he were stating a mere fact i had my suspicions about robin and i was about the only one who ever bothered to read the newspapers back then i saw our reviews and i read the stories about those girls at first i thought nothing of it its hard to really believe that the person sitting next to you on the tour bus is a killer but i should have known it all kept adding up things he said the way he talked about people then i remembered brimleigh the first i still couldnt be certain it was robin couldnt accept it i suppose but i didnt know where he was at the time anyway at winchester this would be june just a week or so before his death i followed him after the show there was a girl taking a shortcut through a cemetery of all places the fool and thats where he pounced i was just behind him i shouted something it was dark and i dont know if he recognized me but he growled at me like some sort of wild animal then he belted off like nobodys business the girl was all right i made sure she got home okay without letting on who i was i dont know if she reported the incident or not but i heard nothing more of it now the problem became what to do about robin i talked to him he didnt deny it thats when he gave me all that aleister crowley and charles manson crap trying to justify himself and his actions i couldnt let him go on killing people but at the same time a trial conviction it was unthinkable i mean back then a rock band could get away with most things but murder especially that kind of murder wed have been tarnished forever especially in the wake of the manson family trial wed never have survived the band would never have survived vic i couldnt allow that to happen to the others after all the hard years theyd put in fortunately the problem took care of itself no said banks you killed robin merchant you werent in bed with tania hutchison that night you went to confront him here by the pool im not sure whether you intended to kill him but you saw something unstoppable in him and you felt you had no other choice it worked perfectly so easy he glanced over to the terrace vic greaves was still there apparently listening but someone saw you didnt he chris vic saw you fifteen minutes had now passed since banks arrived im not admitting to killing anybody said adams you think what you like you cant prove a thing and you killed nick barber banks went on it was your silver mercedes the tourist couple and the girl in the youth hostel saw that night the running figure was just a jogger it was foolish of me to think that vic could have done anything like that himself everyone was right about him he might be a bit off in the head but hes a gentle soul at heart vic was upset and he told you in that roundabout way of his that a music journalist had come around pestering him with questions about the past about brimleigh linda lofthouse and the other murders cardiff brighton plymouth questions to which only you and vic knew the answers the journalist said he was going to come back hed left his card you didnt think vic could take the strain of another interview you thought he would soon break down and tell all given what hed witnessed all those years ago so you killed barber you couldnt kill vic could you even though he was the one who was carrying the secret the most obvious victim did you know that linda lofthouse was nick barbers birth mother adams put his fist to his chest and seemed to stagger back a pace or two as if he had been hit my god no he said im not admitting to anything he went on i talked to robin yes made sure that he knew i knew and that i was watching him thats all the rest was an accident you killed him to make certain you knew he wouldnt stop that there would be more victims and you knew hed get caught eventually and bring it all tumbling down the worlds a safer place without him and thats a fact but im still not admitting anything im guilty of no crime theres nothing you can do to me anyway it would have been very easy just to reach out and adams reached out his arm to demonstrate and let his hand fall on bankss shoulder then he smiled sadly and just give a little push almost twenty minutes now the cavalry would arrive in moments but he didnt push banks who had tensed ready for a struggle felt the hand relax on his shoulder and he knew that adams was about to turn away that he had reached the end of his resources killing nick barber and seizing his notes was one thing but killing a copper in cold blood was quite another it all happened at once before banks could move or say anything he heard footsteps running down the lane and someone shouted out his name then he heard a terrible scream from his left and a dark powerful figure came hurtling forward crashing right into adams and toppling both of them over into the deep end of the empty pool the cavalry had arrived but they were too late by the time annie and winsome arrived on the scene the ambulances had been and gone it was getting dark and the wind was howling through the trees and the nooks and crannies of swainsview lodge fit to wake the dead the socos had lit the scene with bright arc lamps and were still strutting about in their white boilersuits like spacemen on a mission there were spatters of blood at the bottom of the pool mixed in with the other detritus annie saw banks standing alone head bowed by the poolside and walked over to him touching him gently on the shoulder okay she said fine i heard what happened greaves thought adams was going to do to me what he saw him do to robin merchant all those years ago then the uniforms came dashing down the lane and frightened him its nobodys fault i doubt that anyone could have foreseen it and stopped him wasnt adams going to push you in no he ran out of steam but you think greaves witnessed adams push merchant im certain of it he was on lsd at the time that was what sent him over the edge can you imagine it adams has taken care of him ever since protected him as much for his own sake as anything persuaded him not to talk maybe even persuaded him that it happened some other way greaves was so confused he couldnt trust his own judgment but when he saw adams rest his hand on my shoulder by the pool it all came back something like that in whatever fragmented and chaotic way greavess mind works these days however it happened he snapped hed been like a coiled spring all those years adams protected him from anything that was likely to push him toward the snapping point but when barber appeared with his questions about plymouth cardiff and brighton it was too much greaves had heard adamss conversation with merchant at the pool so somewhere in his messedup mind he knew about these things what merchant had done but he couldnt confront it he told adams who was terrified that barber would push too hard and crack the veneer so he killed him barber didnt think he had anything to fear he knew who adams was thought hed come to talk to him he was just having a chat turning away reaching for his cigarettes then adams picked up the poker seized the moment luckily for him he still had time to gather barbers stuff before the power cut can we prove it i dont know hes tired of it all but he wouldnt admit to anything hes not stupid you should have seen him down there crying like a baby cradling greavess head in his lap even though he must have been in considerable pain himself whats the extent of his injuries dislocated shoulder couple of broken ribs cuts and bruises according to the paramedics and greaves landed badly broke his neck died instantly annie was silent for a moment staring into the harshly lit swimming pool maybe its a blessing maybe said banks god knows he was a tortured soul what now we try to get as much evidence as we can on adams hes not getting away with this not if i can help it well go over the forensics check and recheck witness statements interview the entire village again probe his alibi the lot there has to be something there to link him to barbers murder not merchants thats too long ago and theres no way well get him for that now stefan says hes got some prints and hair from the living room that dont match anyone elses so far banks looked at her a hint of a smile on his face then id say weve got him wouldnt you an amateur like adams would never be able to clean up completely after himself besides when the fact that greaves is dead sinks in i think weve also got a better chance of appealing to his conscience hes got no one to protect anymore what about the mad hatters the past the reputation arent they supposed to be doing some reunion tour theres every chance none of it will get out anyway cardiff brighton plymouth why should it if adams pleads guilty those cases are long over and the killer died more than thirtyfive years ago maybe the local forces can put a tick in a box and claim another success in their statistics of crimes solved but thatll be about as far as it goes until another nick barber comes along perhaps said banks but thats none of our business winsome talked to people in plymouth and cardiff who were able to dig up the old files annie said and in the file it said that each girl had a flower painted on her cheek a cornflower banks nodded merchants signature just like linda lofthouse they didnt release that to the general public funny isnt it said banks if they had we might not be here now he turned up the collar of his jacket his teeth were chattering cold annie said getting there by the way she said i just saw kev templeton come storming out of superintendent gervaises office with a face like a slapped arse banks smiled so there is some justice in the world he glanced at his watch seventhirty im starving he said and i could do with a stiff drink how about it sure youre up to it banks gave her an unreadable glance his features cast into planes of light and shadow by the bright arc lights his eyes a piercing blue lets go he said turning away ive finished here monday th september the deserted stretch of canal ran by a scrapyard where the pattering rain echoed on the piles of rusty old metal stanley chadwick walked along the towpath with his raincoat collar turned up he knew that what he was about to do was wrong that it went against everything he believed in but he felt that it was the only way he couldnt just leave things to chance because in his experience chance had no history of supporting the right side without a little help and he was right of that he was certain proving it was another matter yvonne had been gone almost a week run away from home janet had found some items of her favorite clothes missing along with an old rucksack they used to carry pop and sandwiches in when they went on family hikes from the primrose valley caravan chadwick was worried about his daughter but at least he knew that no immediate harm had come to her not that the cities were safe for vulnerable sixteenyearold girls but he was certain that she wasnt as foolish as some and he hoped that she would soon come back he couldnt make her disappearance official set the countrys police forces looking for her so he would just have to bide his time and hope she got homesick it tore at his heart but he could see no other way for the moment he and janet had told curious friends and neighbors that yvonne had gone to stay with her aunt in london she probably had gone to london anyway chadwick realized most runaways ended up there the figure approached from under the kirkstall viaduct as arranged jack skelgate was a smalltime fence who rather resembled a ferret and he had been useful to chadwick as an informer on many occasions chadwick had chosen skelgate because he had so much on him he could send him away for the next ten years and if there was one thing that terrified skelgate more than anything else it was the idea of prison which chadwick had often thought ought to have made him consider another more honest occupation but some people just dont manage to make the connection they dont get it thats why the jails are always full like so many of the people chadwick had met and interviewed over the past couple of weeks skelgate was as thick as two short planks but this would play to chadwicks advantage miserable bloody day innit said skelgate by way of greeting he was always sniffling as if he had a permanent cold there was a burglary in cross gates the other night chadwick said someone drove off with fifty canteens of cutlery nice ones silver i wonder if any of them happened to find their way into your hands silver cutlery you say cant say as ive seen any of that in quite a while but youd let me know if you did of course i would mr chadwick we think the newton gang might be behind it and you know how interested i am in putting them away skelgate cringed at the words even though they referred to someone else the newtons you say nasty lot them they may be planning other raids if you happen to hear anything we could come to the usual arrangement ill keep my ears open mr chadwick that i will skelgate looked around with his ferrety eyes paranoia was another trait of his he always thought someone was watching or listening in is that all mr chadwick can i go now only i dont want us to be seen together those newtons are a violent bunch think nothing of putting a man in hospital for a month they wouldnt just keep your eyes and ears open chadwick paused tensing as he realized he was reaching the point of no return for weeks he had been moving among people who despised everything he valued and somewhere in the midst of it all he had become unglued he knew this and he also knew there was no going back all he wanted was for yvonne to come home and mcgarrity to go to jail for the murder of linda lofthouse then he hoped perhaps he might find some peace but deep down he also knew that there was every chance peace would elude him forever his strict religious upbringing told him he would be damning himself to eternal hellfire for what he was about to do but so be it he felt a sudden heaviness in his chest not a sharp pain or anything just a heaviness the way he always thought the sort of heartbreak that torch singers describe would feel he had felt it just once before when he ran out of the landing craft on the morning of the sixth of june but that day he had soon forgotten it in the noise and smoke in dodging the mortar and machinegun fire there is one more thing id like you to do for me he said skelgate clearly didnt like the sound of that he was practically bobbing up and down on the balls of his feet what he said you know i do what i can for you i want a flickknife there hed said it a flickknife yes with a tortoiseshell handle but why do you want a flickknife chadwick gave him a hard look can you get me one of course said skelgate nothing could be easier when when do you want it soon same place same time tomorrow thatll do fine said chadwick be here dont worry i will skelgate said then glanced around saw nothing to worry about and scurried down the towpath chadwick stood watching him go and wondered just what it was that had brought him to this godforsaken place on this ungodly mission then he turned in the other direction and walked back in the rain to his car
