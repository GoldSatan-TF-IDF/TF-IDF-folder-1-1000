iain m banks inversions for michelle prologue the only sin is selfishness so said the good doctor when she first expressed this opinion i was young enough initially to be puzzled and then to be impressed at what i took to be her profundity it was only later in my middleage when she was long gone from us that i began to suspect that the opposite is just as true arguably there is a sense in which selfishness is the only true virtue and therefore that as opposites are given to cancelling each other out selfishness is finally neutral indeed valueless outside a supporting moral context in later years still my maturity if you will or my old age if you wish i have with some reluctance again come to respect the doctors point of view and to agree with her tentatively at least that selfishness is the root of most evil if not all of course i always knew what she meant that it is when we put our own interests before those of others that we are most likely to do wrong and that there is a commonality of guilt whether the crime is that of a child stealing coins from his mothers purse or an emperor ordering genocide with either act and all those in between we say our gratification matters more to us than whatever distress or anguish may be caused to you and yours by our actions in other words that our desire outranks your suffering my middleyears objection was that only by acting on our desires by attempting to bring about what pleases us because it feels agreeable are we able to create wealth comfort happiness and what the good doctor would have termed in that vague generalising way of hers progress eventually though i came to admit to myself that while my objection might be true it is insufficiently allembracing to cancel out the doctors assertion entirely and that while it may sometimes be a virtue selfishness by its nature is more often a sin or a direct cause of sin we never like to think of ourselves as being wrong just misunderstood we never like to think that we are sinning merely that we are making hard decisions and acting upon them providence is the name of the mystical divinely inhuman court before which we wish our actions to be judged and which we hope will agree with us in our estimation both of our own worth and the culpability or otherwise of our behaviour i suspect the good doctor you see i judge her too in naming her so did not believe in providence i was never entirely sure what she did believe in though i was always quite convinced that she believed in something perhaps despite all she said about selfishness she believed in herself and nothing else perhaps she believed in this progress that she talked about or perhaps in some strange way as a foreigner she believed in us in the people she lived with and cared for in a way that we did not believe in ourselves did she leave us better off or not i think undeniably better did she do this through selfishness or selflessness i believe that in the end it does not matter in the least except as it might have affected her own peace of mind that was another thing she taught me that you are what you do to providence or progress or the future or before any other sort of judgment apart from our own conscience what we have done not what we have thought is the result we are judged by so the following is the collected chronicle of our deeds one part of my tale is presented as something i can vouch for for i was there as to the other part i cannot confirm its veracity i stumbled across its original version by sheer chance long after the events described in it had taken place and while i believe it forms an interesting counterpoint to the story in which i was involved i present it more as an artistic flourish than as a judgment born of intense study and reflection nevertheless i believe the two tales belong together and carry more weight united than they could separately it was i think there is no doubt a crucial time geographically the crux was divided but after all much was then division was the only order i have tried in what i have written here not to judge yet i confess that i hope the reader a sort of partial providence perhaps will do just that and not think badly of us i freely admit that a specific of my motive especially in amending and adding to my earlier selfs chronicle as well as in refining the language and grammar of my coteller is to try to make sure that the reader will not think ill of me and of course that is a selfish desire yet still i would hope that such selfishness might lead to good for the simple reason that otherwise this chronicle might not exist again the reader must decide whether that would have been the more fortunate outcome or not enough a young and rather earnest man wishes to address us the doctor master it was in the evening of the third day of the southern planting season that the questioners assistant came for the doctor to take her to the hidden chamber where the chief torturer awaited i was sitting in the living room of the doctors apartments using a pestle and mortar to grind some ingredients for one of the doctors potions concentrating on this it took me a moment or two fully to collect my wits when i heard the loud and aggressive knocking at the door and i upset a small censer on my way to the door this was the cause both of the delay in opening the door and any curses which unoure the questioners assistant may have heard these swearwords were not directed at him neither was i asleep or even remotely groggy as i trust my good master will believe no matter what the fellow unoure a shifty and unreliable person by all accounts may say the doctor was in her study as was usual at that time in the evening i entered the doctors workshop where she keeps the two great cabinets containing the powders creams ointments draughts and various instruments that are the stock of her trade as well as the pair of tables which support a variety of burners stoves retorts and flasks occasionally she treats patients in here too when it becomes her surgery while the unpleasantsmelling unoure waited in the living room wiping his nose on his already filthy sleeve and peering round with the look of one choosing what to steal i went through the workshop and tapped at the door to the study which also serves as her bedroom oelph the doctor asked yes mistress come in i heard the quiet thud of a heavy book being closed and smiled to myself the doctors study was dark and smelled of the sweet istra flower whose leaves she habitually burned in roofhung censers i felt my way through the gloom of course i know the arrangement of the doctors study intimately better than she might imagine thanks to the inspired foresight and judicious cunning of my master but the doctor is prone to leaving chairs stools and shelfsteps lying where one might walk and accordingly i had to feel my way across the room to where a small candle flame indicated her presence sitting at her desk in front of a heavily curtained window she sat upright in her chair stretching her back and rubbing her eyes the handthick forearmsquare bulk of her journal lay on the desk in front of her the great book was closed and locked but even in that cavedarkness i noticed that the little chain on the hasp was swinging to and fro a pen stood in the ink well whose cap was open the doctor yawned and adjusted the fine chain round her neck which holds the key for the journal my master knows from my many previous reports that i believe the doctor may be writing an account of her experiences here in haspide to the people of her homeland in drezen the doctor obviously wishes to keep her writings secret however sometimes she forgets that i am in the room usually when she has set me the task of tracking down some reference in one of the books in her extravagantly endowed library and i have been silently doing so for some time from the little that i have been able to glimpse of her writings on such occasions i have determined that when she writes in her journal she does not always use haspidian or imperial though there are passages in both but sometimes uses an alphabet i have never seen before i believe my master has thought of taking steps to check with other natives of drezen regarding whether in such instances the doctor writes in drezeni or not and to this end i am attempting to commit to memory as much as i can of the doctors relevant journal writings whenever i can on this occasion however i was unable to gain a view of the pages she had surely been working on it is still my wish to be able to serve my master better in this regard and i would respectfully again submit that the temporary removal of her journal would allow a skilled locksmith to open the journal without damaging it and a better copy of her secret writings to be taken so allowing the matter to be settled this could easily be done when the doctor is elsewhere in the palace or better sill elsewhere in the city or even when she is taking one of her frequent baths which tend to be prolonged it was during one of her baths that i procured for my master one of the doctors scalpels from her medicine bag which has now been delivered i would add that i was careful to do this immediately after a visit to the poor hospital so that someone there would be suspected however i do of course how to my masters superior judgment in this regard the doctor frowned at me youre shaking she said and indeed i was for the sudden appearance of the torturers assistant had been undeniably unsettling the doctor glanced past me towards the door to the surgery which i had left open so that unoure might be able to hear our voices and so perhaps be dissuaded from any mischief he might be contemplating whos that she asked whos what mistress i asked watching her close the cap of the ink well i heard somebody cough oh that is unoure the questioners assistant mistress hes come to fetch you to go where to the hidden chamber master nolieti has sent for you she looked at me without speaking for a moment the chief torturer she said evenly and nodded am i in trouble oelph she asked laying one arm across the thick hide cover of her journal as if looking to provide or gain protection oh no i told her youre to bring your bag and medicines i glanced round at the door to the surgery edged with light from the living room a cough came from that direction a cough that sounded like the sort of cough one makes when one wants to remind somebody that one is waiting impatiently i think its urgent i whispered hmm do you think chief torturer nolieti has a cold the doctor asked rising from her chair and pulling on her long jacket which had been hanging on the back of the seat i helped her on with her black jacket no mistress i think there is probably somebody being put to the question who is umm unwell i see she said stamping her feet into her boots and then straightening i was struck again by the doctors physical presence as i often am she is tall for a woman though not exceptionally so and while for a female she is broad at the shoulder i have seen fishwives and netwomen who look more powerful no what seems most singular about her i think is her carriage the way she comports herself i have been afforded tantalising halfglimpses of her after one of her many baths in a thin shift with the light behind her stepping in a coil of powdered scented air from one room to another her arms raised to secure a towel about her long damp red hair and i have watched her during grand court occasions when she has worn a formal gown and danced as lightly and delicately and with as demure an expression as any expensively tutored seasonmaiden and i freely confess that i have found myself drawn to her in a physical sense just as any man youthful or not might be to a woman of such healthy and generous good looks yet at the same time there is something about her deportment which i and i suspect most other males find offputting and even slightly threatening a certain immodest forthrightness in her bearing is the cause of this perhaps plus the suspicion that while she pays flawless lip service to the facts of life which dictate the accepted and patent preeminence of the male she does so with a sort of unwarranted humour producing in us males the unsettlingly contrary feeling that she is indulging us the doctor leaned over the desk and opened the curtains and the shutters to the mideve seigen glow in the faint wash of light from the windows i noticed the small plate of biscuits and cheese at the edge of the doctors desk on the far side of the journal her old battered dagger lay also on the plate its dull edges smeared with grease she picked up the knife licked its blade and then after smacking her lips as she gave it a final wipe on her kerchief slipped the dagger into the top of her right boot come on she said mustnt keep the chief torturer waiting is this really necessary the doctor asked looking at the blindfold held in questioners assistant unoures grubby hands he wore a long butchers apron of bloodstained hide over his filthy shirt and loose greasylooking trousers the black blindfold had been produced from a long pocket in the leather apron unoure grinned displaying a miscellany of diseased discoloured teeth and dark gaps where teeth ought to have been the doctor winced her own teeth are so even that the first time i saw them i naturally assumed they were a particularly fine false set rules unoure said looking at the doctors chest she drew her long jacket closed across her shirt youre a foreigner he told her the doctor sighed glancing at me a foreigner i told unoure forcibly who holds the kings life in her hands almost every day doesnt matter the fellow said shrugging he sniffed and went to wipe his nose with the blindfold then looked at the expression on the doctors face and changed his mind using his sleeve again instead thats the orders got to hurry he said glancing at the doors we were at the entrance to the palaces lower levels the corridor behind us led off from the littleused passageway beyond the westwing kitchens and the wine cellars it was quite dark a narrow circular lightwell overhead cast a dusty sheen of slaty light over us and the tall rusted metal doors while a couple of candles burned dimly further down the corridor very well the doctor said she leaned over a little and made a show of inspecting the blindfold and unoures hands but im not wearing that and youre not tying it she turned to me and pulled a fresh kerchief from a pocket in her coat here she said but unoure said then jumped as a bell clanged somewhere beyond the flaking brown doors he turned away stuffing the blindfold into his apron cursing i tied the scented kerchief across the doctors eyes while unoure unlocked the doors i carried the doctors bag with one hand and with my other hand led her into the corridor beyond the doors and down the many twisting steps and further doors and passageways to the hidden chamber where master nolieti waited halfway there the bell rang again from somewhere ahead of us and i felt the doctor jump and her hand become damp i confess my own nerves were not entirely settled we entered the hidden chamber from a low doorway we each had to stoop under i placed my hand on the doctors head to lower her head her hair felt sleek and smooth the place smelled of something sharp and noxious and of burned flesh my breathing seemed to be quite beyond my control the odours forcing their way into my nostrils and down into my lungs the tall wide space was lit by a motley collection of ancient oil lamps which threw a sickly bluegreen glow over a variety of vats tubs tables and other instruments and containers some in human shape none of which i cared to inspect too closely though all of them attracted my wideopen eyes like suns attract flowers additional light came from a tall brazier positioned underneath a hanging cylindrical chimney the brazier stood by a chair made from hoops of iron which entirely enclosed a pale thin and naked man who appeared to be unconscious the entire frame of this chair had been swivelled over on an outer cradle so that the man appeared caught in the act of performing a forward somersault resting on his knees in midair his back parallel with the grid of a broad lightwell grille above the chief torturer nolieti stood between this apparatus and a broad workbench covered with various metal bowls jars and bottles and a collection of instruments that might have originated in the workplaces of a mason a carpenter a butcher and a surgeon nolieti was shaking his broad scarred grey head his rough and sinewy hands were on his hips and his glare was fastened on the withered form of the encaged man below the metal contraption enclosing the unfortunate fellow stood a broad square tray of stone with a drain hole at one corner dark fluid like blood had splattered there long white shapes in the darkness might have been teeth nolieti turned round when he heard us approach about fucking time he spat fixing his stare on first me then the doctor and then unoure who i noticed as the doctor stuffed her kerchief back into a pocket in her jacket was making a show of folding the black blindfold he had been told to use on her my fault the doctor said in a matteroffact manner stepping past nolieti she bent down at the mans rear she grimaced nose wrinkling then came to the side of the apparatus and with one hand on the iron hoops of the framechair brought it squeaking and complaining round until the man was in a more conventional sitting position the fellow looked in a terrible state his face was grey his skin was burned in places and his mouth and jaw had collapsed little rivulets of blood had dried under each of his ears the doctor put her hand through the iron hoops and tried to open one of the mans eyes he made a terrible low groaning sound there was a sort of sucking tearing noise and the man gave a plaintive moan like a kind of distant scream before settling into a ragged rhythmic bubbling noise that might have been breathing the doctor bent forward to peer into the mans face and i heard her give a small gasp nolieti snorted looking for these he asked the doctor and flourished a small bowl at her the doctor barely glanced at the bowl but smiled thinly at the torturer she rotated the iron chair to its previous position and went back to look at the caged mans rear she pulled away some bloodsoaked rags and gave another grimace i thanked the gods that he was pointing away from me and prayed that whatever the doctor might have to do would not require my assistance what seems to be the problem the doctor asked nolieti who seemed momentarily nonplussed well the chief torturer said after a pause he wont stop bleeding out his arse will he the doctor nodded you must have let your pokers get too cold she said casually squatting and opening her bag and laying it by the side of the stone draintray nolieti went to the doctors side and bent down over her how it happened isnt any of your fucking business woman he said into her ear your business is to get this fucker well enough to be questioned so he can tell us what the king needs to know does the king know the doctor asked looking up an expression of innocent interest on her face did he order this does he even know of the existence of this unfortunate or was it guard commander adlain who thought the kingdom would fall unless this poor devil suffered nolieti stood up none of that is your business he said sullenly just do your job and get out he bent down again and stuck his mouth by her ear and never you mind the king or the guard commander im king down here and i say youd best attend to your own business and leave me to mine but it is my business the doctor said evenly ignoring the threatening bulk of the man poised over her if i know what was done to him and how it was done i might be better able to treat him oh i could show you doctor the chief torturer said looking up at his assistant and winking and we have special treats we save just for the ladies dont we unoure well we havent time to flirt the doctor said with a steely smile just tell me what you did to this poor wretch nolietis eyes narrowed he stood up and withdrew a poker from the brazier in a cloud of sparks its yellowglowing tip was broad like the blade of a small flat spade latterly we did him with this nolieti said with a smile his face lit by the soft yelloworange glow the doctor looked at the poker then at the torturer she squatted and touched something at the encaged mans rear was he bleeding badly she asked like a man pissing the chief torturer said winking at his assistant again unoure quickly nodded and laughed better leave this in then the doctor muttered she rose im sure its good you enjoy your job so chief torturer she said however i think youve killed this one youre the doctor you heal him nolieti said stepping back towards her brandishing the orangered poker i do not think he intended to threaten the doctor but i saw her right hand begin to drop towards the boot where her old dagger was sheathed she looked up at the torturer past the glowing metal rod ill give him something that might revive him but he may well have given you all he ever will dont blame me if he dies oh but i will nolieti said quietly thrusting the poker back into the brazier cinders splashed to the flag stones you make sure he lives woman you make sure hes fit to talk or the kingll hear you couldnt do your job the king will hear anyway no doubt the doctor said smiling at me i smiled nervously back and guard commander adlain too she added perhaps from me she swung the man in the cagechair back upright and opened a vial in her bag wiped a wooden spatula round the inside of the vial and then opening the bloody mess that was the mans mouth applied some of the ointment to his gums he moaned again the doctor stood watching him for a moment then stepped to the brazier and put the spatula into it the wood flamed and spluttered she looked at her hands then at nolieti do you have any water down here i mean clean water the chief torturer nodded at unoure who disappeared into the shadows for a while before bringing a bowl which the doctor washed her hands in she was wiping them clean on the kerchief which had been her blindfold when the man in the chair cage gave a terrible screech of agony shook violently for a few moments then stiffened suddenly and finally went limp the doctor stepped towards him and went to put her hand to his neck but she was knocked aside by nolieti who gave an angry anguished shout of his own and reached through the iron hoops to place his finger on the pulsepoint on the neck which the doctor has taught me is the best place to test the beat of a mans vitality the chief torturer stood there quivering while his assistant gazed on with an expression of apprehension and terror the doctors look was one of grimly contemptuous amusement then nolieti spun round and stabbed a finger at her you he hissed at her you killed him you didnt want him to live the doctor looked unconcerned and continued drying her hands though it seemed to me that they were both already dry and shaking i am sworn to save life chief torturer not to take it she said reasonably i leave that to others what was in that stuff the chief torturer said quickly squatting to wrench open the doctors bag he pulled out the open vial she had taken the ointment from and brandished it in her face this what is it a stimulant she said and dipped a finger into the vial displaying a small fold of the soft brown gel on her finger tip so that it glinted in the light of the brazier would you like to try it she moved the finger towards nolietis mouth the chief torturer grabbed her hand in one of his and forced the finger back towards her own lips no you do it do what you did to him the doctor shook her hand free of nolietis and calmly put her finger to her mouth spreading the brown paste along her top gum the taste is bittersweet she said in the same tone she uses when she is teaching me the effects last between two and three bells and usually have no side effects though in a body seriously weakened and in shock fits are likely and death is a remote possibility she licked her finger children in particular suffer severe side effects with almost no restorative function and it is never recommended for them the gel is made from the berries of a biennial plant which grows on isolated peninsulae on islands in the very north of drezen it is quite precious and more usually applied in a solution in which form too it is most stable and longlasting i have used it to treat the king on occasion and he regards it as one of my more efficacious prescriptions there is not much left now and i would have preferred not to waste it on either those who are going to die anyway or on myself but you did insist i am sure the king will not mind i have to report master that as far as i am aware the doctor has never used this particular gel of which she has several jars on the king and i am not sure she had ever used it to treat any patient the doctor closed her mouth and i could see her wipe her tongue round her top gum then she smiled are you sure you wont try some nolieti said nothing for a moment his broad dark face moving as though he was chewing on his tongue get this drezen witch out of here he said eventually to unoure and then turned away to stamp on the braziers footbellows the brazier hissed and glowed yellow showering sparks up into its sooty chimney nolieti glanced at the dead man in the cagechair then take this bastard to the acid bath he barked we were at the door when the chief torturer still working the footbellows with a regular thrusting stroke called out doctor she turned to look at hire as unoure opened the door and fished the black blindfold from his apron yes chief torturer she said he looked round at us smiling as he continued to fire the brazier youll be here again drezen woman he said softly to her his eyes glittered in the yellow brazier light and next time you wont be able to walk out the doctor held his gaze for a good while until she looked down and shrugged or you will appear in my surgery she told him looking up and may be assured of my best attention the chief torturer turned away and spat into the brazier his foot stamping on the bellows and breathing life into that instrument of death as we were ushered out of the low door by the assistant unoure two hundred heartbeats later we were met at the tall iron doors which led into the rest of the palace by a footman of the royal chamber its my back again vosill the king said turning on to his front on the wide canopied bed while the doctor rolled up first her own sleeves and then the kings tunic top and shift and we were in the principal bedchamber of king quiences private apartments deep within the innermost quadrangle of efernze the winter palace of haspide capital of haspidus this has become such a regular haunt of mine indeed such a regular place of work that i confess i am inclined to forget that i am honoured indeed to be present when i stop to consider the matter though i think great gods i an orphan of a disgraced family am in the presence of our beloved king and regularly and intimately at such moments master i thank you in my soul with all the vigour that is mine to command for i know that it was only your kindness wisdom and compassion that put me in such an exalted position and entrusted me with such an important mission be assured that i shall continue to try with all my might to be worthy of that trust and fulfil that task wiester the kings chamberlain had let us into the apartments will that be all sir he asked bending and hunching over as well as his ample frame would allow yes thats all for now go the doctor sat on the side of the kings bed and kneaded his shoulders and back with her strong capable fingers she had me hold a small jar of richsmelling unguent which she dipped her fingers into every now and again spreading the ointment across the kings broad hairy back and working it into his pale gold skin with her fingers and palms as i sat there with the doctors medicine bag open at my side i noticed that the jar of brown gel which she had used to treat the wretch in the hidden chamber was still lying opened on one of the bags ingeniously fashioned internal shelves i went to stick my own finger into the jar the doctor saw what i was doing and quickly took hold of my hand and pulled it away from the jar and said quietly i wouldnt oelph if i were you just put the top back on carefully whats that vosill the king asked nothing sir the doctor said replacing her hands on the kings back and leaning forward on to him ouch the king said mostly muscular tension the doctor said softly flicking her head so that her hair which had partly fallen across her face was sent spilling back over her shoulder my father never had to suffer so the king said morosely into his goldthreaded pillow his voice made deeper by the thickness and weight of fabric and feathers the doctor smiled quickly at me what sir she said you mean he never had to suffer my clumsy ministrations no the king said groaning you know what i mean vosill this back he never had to suffer this back or my leg cramps or my headaches or my constipation or any of these aches and pains he was silent a moment as the doctor pushed and pressed at his skin father never had to suffer anything he never had a days illness in his life the doctor said in chorus with the king the king laughed the doctor smiled at me again i held the jar of ointment inexpressibly happy for just that moment until the king sighed and said ah such sweet torture vosill whereupon the doctor paused in her rocking kneading motion and a look of bitterness even contempt passed briefly over her face the bodyguard this is the story of the man known as dewar who was principal bodyguard to general urleyn prime protector of the tassasen protectorate for the years to imperial most of my tale takes place in the palace of vorifyr in crough the ancient capital city of tassasen during that fateful year of i have chosen to tell the story after the fashion of the jeritic fabulists that is in the form of a closed chronicle in which if one is inclined to believe such information of consequence one has to guess the identity of the person telling the tale my motive in doing so is to present the reader with a chance to choose whether to believe or disbelieve what i have to say about the events of that time the broad facts of which are of course well known even notorious throughout the civilised world purely on the evidence of whether the story rings true for them or not and without the prejudice which might result from knowing the identity of the narrator closing the mind of the reader to the truth i wish to present and it is time the truth was finally told i have read i think all the various accounts of what happened in tassasen during that momentous time and the most significant difference between those reports seems to be the degree to which they depart most outrageously from what actually happened there was one travesty of a version in particular which determined me to tell the true story of the time it took the form of a play and claimed to tell my own tale yet its ending could scarcely have been wider of the mark the reader need only accept that i am who i am for its nonsensicality to be obvious i say this is dewars story and yet i freely admit that it is not the whole of his story it is only part and arguably only a small part measured solely in years there was a part before too but history allows only the haziest notion of what that earlier past was like so this is the truth as i experienced it or as it was told to me by those i trusted truth i have learned differs for everybody just as no two people ever see a rainbow in exactly the same place and yet both most certainly see it while the person seemingly standing right underneath it does not see it at all so truth is a question of where one stands and the direction one is looking in at the time of course the reader may choose to differ from me in this belief and is welcome to do so dewar is that you the prime protector first general and grand aedile of the protectorate of tassasen general urleyn shaded his eyes from the glare of a fanshaped plasterandgem window above the halls polished jet floor it was midday with xamis and seigen both shining brightly in a clear sky outside sir dewar said stepping from the shadows at the edge of the room where the maps were kept in a great wooden lattice he bowed to the protector and set a map on the table in front of him i think this is the map you might need dewar a tall muscular man in early middleage darkhaired darkskinned and darkbrowed with deep hooded eyes and a watchful brooding look about him that quite suited his profession which he once described as assassinating assassins he seemed both relaxed and yet tensed like an animal perpetually hunkered back ready to pounce yet perfectly capable of remaining in that coiled position for as long as it might take for its prey to come into range and let drop its guard he was dressed as ever in black his boots hose tunic and short jacket were all as dark as an eclipsenight a narrow sheathed sword hung from his right hip a long dagger from his left you fetch maps for my generals now dewar urleyn asked amused the general of generals of tassasen the commoner who commanded nobles was a relatively small man who by dint of the bustling busy force of his character made almost everybody feel that they were no taller than he his hair was brindled grey and thinning but his eyes were bright people generally called his gaze piercing he was dressed in the trousers and long jacket he had made the fashion amongst many of his fellow generals and large sections of the tassasem trading classes when my general sends me away from him sir yes dewar replied i try to do whatever i can to help and such actions help prevent me dwelling on the risks my lord might be exposing himself to when he has me leave his side dewar tossed the map on to the table where it unrolled the borders ladenscion urleyn breathed patting the soft surface of the old map then looking up at dewar with a mischievous expression my dear dewar the greatest danger i expose myself to on such occasions is probably a dose of something unpleasant from some lass newly brought in or possibly a slap for suggesting something my more demure concubines find excessively rude the general grinned hitching up the belt round his modest potbelly or a scratched back or bitten ear if im lucky eh the general puts us younger men to shame in many ways dewar murmured smoothing out the parchment map but it is not unknown for assassins to have less respect for the privacy of a great leaders harem than say his chief bodyguard an assassin prepared to risk the wrath ofmy dear concubines would almost deserve to succeed urleyn said eyes twinkling as he pulled at his short grey moustache providence knows their affection is rough enough at times he reached out and tapped the younger mans elbow with one bunched fist eh indeed sir still i think the general could ah the rest of the gang urleyn said clapping his hands as the double doors at the far end of the hall opened to admit a number of men all clad similarly to the general and a surrounding flock of aides in military uniforms frockcoated clerks and assorted other helpers yetamidous the protector cried walking quickly forward to greet the big roughfaced man leading the group shaking his hand and clapping his back he greeted all of the other noble generals by name then caught sight of his brother ruleuin back from the thrown isles is all well he wrapped his arms round the taller thickerset man who smiled slowly as he nodded and said yes sir then the protector saw his son and bent down to lift him into his arms and lattens my favourite boy you finished your studies yes father the boy said he was dressed like a little soldier and flourished a wooden sword good you can come and help us decide what to do about our rebellious barons in the marches just for a while brother ruleuin said this is a treat his tutor needs him back on the bell ample time for lattens to make all the difference to our plans urleyn said sitting the child on the map table clerks and scribes scuttled over to the great wooden map lattice on one wall fighting to be first never mind the general called after them heres the map he shouted as his brother and fellow generals clustered round the great table somebody already the general began looking round the table for dewar then shaking his head and returning his attention to the map behind him hidden from the protector by the taller men gathered about him but never more than a sword length away his chief bodyguard stood arms casually crossed hands resting on the pommels of his most obvious weapons unnoticed and almost unseen gaze sweeping the surrounding crowd once there was a great emperor who was much feared throughout what was then all the known world save for the outer wastelands which nobody with any sense bothered about and where only savages lived the emperor had no equals and no rivals his own realm covered the better part of the world and all the kings of all the rest of the world bowed down before him and offered him generous tribute his power was absolute and he had come to fear nothing except death which comes eventually for all men even emperors he determined to try and cheat death tooby building a monumental palace so great so magnificent so spellbindingly sumptuous that death itself which was believed to come for those of royal birth in the shape of a great fiery bird visible only to the dying would be tempted to stay in the great monument and dwell there and not return to the depths of the sky with the emperor clutched in its talons of flame accordingly the emperor caused a great monumental palace to be built on an island in the centre of a great circular lake on the edge of the plains and the ocean some way from his capital city the palace was fashioned in the shape of a mighty conical tower half a hundred storeys tall it was filled with every imaginable luxury and treasure the empire and kingdoms could provide all secured deep within the furthest reaches of the monument where they would be hidden from the common thief yet visible to the fiery bird when it came for the emperor there too were placed magical statues of all the emperors favourites wives and concubines all guaranteed by his holiest holy men to come alive when the emperor died and the great bird of fire came to take him the chief architect of the palace was a man called munnosh who was renowned throughout the world as the greatest builder there had ever been and it was his skill and cunning that made the whole great project possible for this reason the emperor showered munnosh with riches favours and concubines but munnosh was ten years younger than the emperor and as the emperor grew old and the great monument neared completion he knew that munnosh would outlive him and might speak or be made to speak of how and where the great cache of riches had been placed within the palace once the emperor had died and was living there with the great bird of fire and the magically alive statues munnosh might even have time to complete a still greater monument for the next king who ascended to the imperial throne and became emperor with this in mind the emperor waited until the great mausoleum was all but finished and then had munnosh lured to the very deepest level of the vast edifice and while the architect waited in a small chamber deep underground for what he had been promised would be a great surprise he was walled in by the imperial guards who closed off all that part of the lowest level the emperor had his courtiers tell munnoshs family that the architect had been killed when a great block of stone fell on him while he was inspecting the building and they grieved loudly and terribly but the emperor had misjudged the cunning and wariness of the architect who had long suspected something just like this might happen accordingly he had had constructed a hidden passage from the lowest cellars of the great monumental palace to the outside when munnosh realised he had been immured he uncovered the hidden passage and made his way to the ground above where he waited until the night and then stole away on one of the workers boats gliding across the circular lake when he returned to his home his wife who thought she was a widow and his children who thought they were without a father at first thought he was a ghost and shrank from him in fear eventually he persuaded them that he was alive and that they should accompany him into exile away from the empire the whole family made their escape to a distant kingdom where the king had need of a great builder to oversee the construction of fortifications to keep out the savages of the wastelands and where everybody either did not know who this great architect was or pretended not to for the sake of the fortifications and the safety of the kingdom however the emperor heard that a great architect was at work in this distant kingdom and through various rumours and reports came to suspect that this master builder was indeed munnosh the emperor who was by now very frail and elderly and near death ordered the secret openingup of the great mausoleums lower levels this was done and of course munnosh was not there and the secret passageway was discovered the emperor ordered the king to send his master builder to the imperial capital the king at first refused asking for more time because the fortifications were not ready yet and the savages of the wasteland were proving more tenacious and better organised than had been anticipated but the emperor still nearer to death now insisted and eventually the king gave in and with great reluctance sent the architect munnosh to the capital the architects family treated his departure as they had the false news that he had been killed those many years ago the emperor at this time was so close to dying that he spent almost all his time in the great deathdefying palace munnosh had constructed for him and it was there that munnosh was taken when the emperor saw munnosh and knew that it was his old chief architect he cried out munnosh treacherous munnosh why did you desert me and your greatest creation because you had me walled up within it and left to die my emperor munnosh replied it was done only to assure the safety of your emperor and to preserve your own good name the old tyrant told munnosh you ought to have accepted what was done and let your family mourn you decently and in peace instead you led them into benighted exile and only ensured that now they will have to mourn you a second time when the emperor said this munnosh fell to his knees and began to weep and to plead for forgiveness from the emperor the emperor held out one thin shaking hand and smiled and said but that need not concern you because i have sent my finest assassins to seek out your wife and your children and your grandchildren to kill them all before they can learn of your disgrace and death at this munnosh who had concealed a masons store chisel beneath his robes leapt forward and tried to strike the emperor down aiming the chisel straight at the old mans throat instead munnosh was struck down before his blow could fall by the emperors chief bodyguard who never left his masters side the man who had once been imperial chief architect landed dead at his emperors feet head severed by a single terrible blow from the bodyguards sword but the chief bodyguard was so full of shame that munnosh had come so close to the emperor with a weapon and also so appalled at the cruelty which the emperor intended to visit on the innocent family of the architect which was but the grain that breaks the bridge for he had witnessed a lifetimes cruelty from the old tyrant that he killed the emperor and then himself with another two swinging blows from his mighty sword before anybody else could move to stop him the emperor got his wish then dying within the great palatial mausoleum he had built whether he succeeded in cheating death or not we cannot know but it is unlikely as the empire fell apart very soon after his death and the vast monument he caused to be constructed at such crippling expense to his empire was looted utterly within the year and fell quickly into disrepair so that now it is used only as a ready source of dressed stone for the city of haspide which was founded a few centuries later on the same island in what is now called crater lake in the kingdom of haspidus what a sad tale but what happened to the family of munnosh asked the lady perrund the lady perrund had once been the first concubine of the protector she remained a prized partner of the generals household and one whom he was still known to visit on occasion the bodyguard dewar shrugged we dont know he told her the empire fell the kings fought amongst themselves the barbarians invaded from all sides fire fell from the sky and a dark age resulted that lasted many hundreds of years little historical detail survived the fall of the lesser kingdoms but we may hope that the assassins heard their emperor was dead and so did not carry out their mission may we not or that they were caught up in the chaos of the empires collapse and had to look to their own safety would that not be likely dewar looked into the eyes of the lady perrund and smiled perfectly possible my lady good she said crossing one arm across the other and settling back to lean over the game board again that is what i shall choose to believe then now we can restart our game it was my move i believe dewar smiled as he watched perrund put one clenched fist to her mouth her gaze beneath long fair lashes flicked this way and that across the game board coming to rest on pieces for a few moments then sweeping away again she wore the long plain red daygown of the senior ladies of the court one of the few fashions the protectorate had inherited from the earlier kingdom which the protector and his fellow generals had overthrown in the war of succession it was a given within the court that perrunds seniority was founded more upon the intensity of her earlier service to the protector urleyn than on her physical age a reputation that of most favoured concubine to a man who had not yet chosen a wife she was still fiercely proud of therewas another reason for her promotion to such seniority and the mark of that was the second badge she wore the sling also red that supported her withered left arm perrund anybody in the court would tell you had given more of herself in the service of her beloved general than any other of his women sacrificing the use of a limb to protect him from an assassins blade and indeed very nearly losing her life altogether for the same cut that had severed muscles and tendons and broken bone had opened an artery as well and she had come close to bleeding to death even as urleyn had been hurried away from the melee by his guards and the assassin had been overpowered and disarmed the withered arm was her only blemish even if it was a terrible one otherwise she was as tall and fair as any fairytale princess and the younger women of the harem who saw her naked in the baths inspected her goldenbrown skin in vain for the more obvious signs of encroaching age her face was broad too broad she thought and so framed it carefully in her long blonde hair to make it look slimmer when she did not wear a headdress and chose headdresses which performed the same function when she was to be seen in public her nose was slim and her mouth at first plain until she smiled which she often did her pupils were gold flecked with blue and her eyes were large and open and somehow innocent they could quickly look hurt at insults and when she was told tales of cruelty and pain but such expressions were like summer storms over quickly and immediately replaced by a prevailing temperate brightness she seemed to take an almost childish delight in life in general which was never far from being embodied in the sparkle of those eyes and people who thought they knew about such things said they believed she was the only person in the court whose force of gaze could match that of the protector himself there she said composedly moving a piece across the board into dewars territory and then sitting back her good hand massaged the withered one which lay in the red sling motionless and unresponding dewar thought it looked like the hand of a sickly child it was so pale and thin and the skin so nearly translucent he knew that she still experienced pain from the disabled limb three years after the initial injury and that she did not always realise when her good hand stroked and kneaded the sick one as it did now he saw this without looking at it his gaze held by hers as she leaned further back into the couchs cushions which were as plump red and numerous as berries on a winter bush they sat in the visiting chamber of the outer harem where on special occasions close relatives of the concubines were sometimes allowed to visit them dewar once again waiting on urleyn while the general spent a while with the harems most recent young recruits had for some time been granted the singular dispensation of being allowed to enter the visiting chamber whenever the protector was in the harem this meant that dewar was a little closer to urleyn than the general would ideally have preferred his chief bodyguard to be during such interludes and much further away than dewar felt comfortable with dewar knew the sort of jokes that circulated the court about him it was said that his dream was to be so close to his master at all times that he could wipe the generals backside in the toilet and his prick in the haremalcove another was that he secretly desired to be a woman so that when the general wanted sex he need look no further than his faithful bodyguard and no other bodily contact need be risked whether stike the harems chief eunuch had heard that particular rumour was moot certainly he watched the bodyguard with what appeared to be great and professional suspicion the chief eunuch sat massively in his pulpit at one end of the long chamber which was lit from above by three porcelain lightdomes the chambers walls were entirely covered with thickly pendulous swathes of ornately woven brocade while further loops and bowls of fabric hung suspended from the roof spaces between the domes ruffling in the breeze from the ceiling louvres the chief eunuch stike was dressed in great folds of white and his vast waist was girdled with the gold and silver keychains of his office he occasionally spared a glance for the few other veiled girls who had chosen the visiting chamber for their giggled conversations and petulant games of card and board but he concentrated on the only man in the room and his game with the damaged concubine perrund dewar studied the board ahha he said his emperor piece was threatened or certainly would be in another move or two perrund gave a dainty snort and dewar looked up to see his opponents good hand held up flat against her mouth painted fingernails golden against her lips and an expression of innocence in her wide eyes what she asked you know what he said smiling youre after my emperor dewar she said tutting you mean im after your protector hmm he said putting his elbows on his knees and his chin on his bunched fists officially the emperor was called the protector piece now after the dissolution of the old empire and fall of the last king of tassasen new sets of the game of monarchs dispute sold in tassasen these days came in boxes which to those who could read proclaimed the game they contained to be leaders dispute and held revised pieces a protector instead of an emperor generals in place of kings colonels instead of dukes and captains where before there had been barons many people either fearful of the new regime or simply wishing to show their allegiance to it had thrown out their old sets of the game along with their portraits of the king it seemed that only in the palace of vorifyr itself were people more relaxed dewar lost himself studying the position of the pieces for a few moments then he heard perrund make another noise and looked up again to see her shaking her head at him eyes glittering now it was his turn to say what oh dewar she said i have heard people in the court say you are the most cunning person they know in it and thank providence that you are so devoted to the general because if you were a man of independent ambition they would fear you dewar shrugged really i suppose i ought to feel flattered but and yet you are so easy to play at dispute perrund said laughing am i yes and for the most obvious reason you do too much to protect your protector piece you sacrifice everything to keep it free from threat she nodded at the board look you are thinking about blocking my mounted piece with your eastern general leaving it open to my tower after weve exchanged caravels on the left flank well arent you dewar frowned deeply staring at the board he felt his face flush he looked up again at those golden mocking eyes yes so i am transparent is that it you are predictable perrund told him softly your obsession with the emperor with the protector is a weakness lose the protector and one of the generals takes its place you treat it as though its loss would be the end of the game i was wondering did you ever play a kingdom unjustly divided before you learned monarchs dispute she asked do you know of it she added surprised when he looked blank in that game the loss of either king does indeed signify the end of the game ive heard of it dewar said defensively picking up his protector piece and turning it over in his hands i confess i havent played it properly but perrund clapped her good hand on her thigh attracting the frowning stare of the watchful eunuch i knew it she said laughing and rocking forward on the couch you protect the protector because you cant help it you know its not really the game but it would hurt you to do otherwise because you are so much the bodyguard dewar put the protector piece back down on the board and drew himself up on the small stool he sat upon uncrossing his legs and adjusting the positions of his sword and his dagger its not that he said pausing to study the board again briefly its not that its just my style the way i choose to play the game oh dewar perrund said with an unladylike snort what nonsense that is not style its fault if you play like that its like fighting with one hand tied behind your back she looked down ruefully at the arm in the red sling or one hand wasted she added then held up her good hand to him as he went to protest now just you never mind that attend to my point you cannot stop being a bodyguard even when playing a silly game to pass the time with an old concubine while your master dallies with a younger one you must admit it and be proud secretly or not its equal to me or i shall be quite thoroughly upset now speak and tell me im right dewar sat back holding both hands out wide in a gesture of defeat my lady he said it is just as you say perrund laughed dont give in so easily argue i cant youre right i am only glad that you think my obsession might be commendable but it is just as you say my job is my life and i am never offduty and i never will be until i am dismissed i fail in my job or providence consign such an eventuality to the distant future the protector dies a natural death perrund looked down at the board in a ripe old age as you say she agreed before looking up at him again and do you still feel youre missing something which might prevent such a natural end dewar looked awkward he picked up the protector piece again and as though addressing it in a low voice said his life is in more danger than anybody here seems to think certainly it is in more danger than he appears to believe he looked up at the lady perrund a small hesitant smile on his face or am i being too obsessive again i dont know perrund said sitting closer and dropping her voice too why you seem so sure that people want him dead of course people want him dead dewar said he had the courage to commit regicide the temerity to create a new way of governing the kings and dukes who opposed the protector from the start found him a more skilled politician and far better field commander than theyd expected with great skill and a little luck he prevailed and the acclamation of the newly enfranchised in tassasen has made it difficult for anybody else in the old kingdom or indeed anywhere in the old empire to oppose him directly there must be a but or a however about to make its appearance here perrund said i can tell it indeed but there are those who have greeted urleyns coming to power with every possible expression of enthusiasm and who have gone out of their way to support him in most public ways yet who secretly know that their own existence or at the very least their own supremacy is threatened by his continued rule they are the ones im worried about and they must have made their plans for our protector the first few attempts at assassination failed but not by much and only your bravery stopped the most determinedof them lady dewar said perrund looked away and her good hand went to touch the withered one yes she said i did tell your predecessor that as i had stepped in to perform his job he ought to do the decent thing and attempt to fulfil mine one day but he just laughed dewar smiled commander zespiole tells that story himself still hmm well perhaps as commander of the palace guard zespiole does such a good job keeping wouldbe assassins away from the palace that none ever achieve the sort of proximity that might call for your services perhaps but either way they will be back dewar said quietly i almost wish they had been back by now the absence of conventional assassins makes me all the more convinced there is some very special assassin here just waiting for the right time to strike perrund looked troubled even sad the man thought but come dewar she said is this not too gloomily contrary perhaps there are no attempts on the protectors life because no one of moment any longer wishes him dead why assume the most depressing explanation can you never be if not relaxed then content dewar took a deep breath and then released it he replaced the protector piece these are not times when people in my profession can relax they say the old days were always better do you think so dewar no lady i do not he gazed into her eyes i think a lot of nonsense is talked about the old days but dewar they were days of legends days of heroes perrund said her expression indicating she was not being entirely serious everything was better everybody says so some of us prefer history to legends lady dewar said heavily and sometimes everybody can be wrong can they indeed once everybody thought the world was flat many still do perrund said raising one brow few peasants want to think they might fall out of their fields and a lot of us who know the truth find it hard to accept nevertheless it is the case dewar smiled it can be proved perrund smiled too with sticks in the ground and shadows and mathematics perrund gave a quick sideways nod it was a mannerism that seemed to acknowledge and dismiss at the same time what a very certain if rather dismal world you seem to live in dewar it is the same world that everyone inhabits if they but knew my lady its just that only some of us have our eyes open perrund drew in a breath oh well those of us still stumbling around with our eyes tightly shut had best be grateful to people like you then i should think id have thought that you at least my lady would have no need of a sighted guide i am just a crippled illeducated concubine dewar a poor orphan who might have met a terrible fate if i had not caught the eye of the protector she made her withered arm move by flexing her left shoulder towards him sadly i later caught a blow as well as a glance but i am as glad of one as the other she paused and dewar drew a breath to speak but then she nodded down at the board and said are you going to move or not dewar sighed and gestured at the board is there any point if i am so deficient an adversary you must play and play to win even if you know you will probably lose perrund told him otherwise you should not have agreed to begin the game in the first place you changed the nature of the game when you informed me of my weakness ah no the game was always the same dewar perrund said sitting suddenly forward her eyes seeming to flash as she added with a degree of relish i merely opened your eyes to it dewar laughed indeed you did my lady he sat forward and went to move his protector piece then sat back again and with a despairing gesture said no i concede my lady you have won there was some commotion amongst the group of concubines nearest to the doors which led into the rest of the harem in his high pulpit the chief eunuch stike wobbled to his feet and bowed to the small figure bustling into the long chamber dewar the protector urleyn called hauling his jacket on over his shoulders as he strode towards them and perrund my dear my darling perrund stood suddenly and dewar watched her face come alive again the eyes widening her expression softening and her face blossoming into the most dazzling smile as urleyn approached dewar stood too the faintest of hurt expressions vanishing from his face to be replaced by a relieved smile and a look of professional seriousness the doctor master you asked to know most particularly of any sorties which the doctor made outside the palace of efernze what i am about to relate took place the afternoon following our summons to the hidden chamber and our encounter with the chief torturer nolieti a storm raged above the city making of the sky a darkly boiling mass fissures of lightning split that gloom with an eyeblinding brightness as though they were the concentrated blues of the everyday sky fighting to prise the blackness of the clouds apart and shine upon the ground again however briefly the westerly waters of crater lake leapt against the citys ancient harbour walls and surged amongst the deserted outer docks it made even the ships within the sheltered inner quays roll and shift uneasily their hulls compressing the cane fenders to make them creak and crack in protest while their tall masts swung across the black sky like a forest of disputing metronomes the wind whistled through the streets of the city as we made our way out of the blister gate and headed across market square towards the warren an empty stall had been blown over in the square and its sack roof flapped and tore in the gusts clapping against the cobblestones like a trapped wrestler slapping the ground as he begs for mercy the rain came in blustery torrents stinging and cold the doctor handed me her heavy medicine bag as she wrapped and buttoned her cloak more tightly about her i still believe that this along with her jacket and coat should be purple as she is a physician however when she had first arrived two years earlier the doctors of the city had let it be known that they would take a dim view of her pretending to this badge of their rank and the doctor herself had seemed indifferent in the matter and so as a rule she wore mostly dark and black clothes though sometimes in a certain light in some of the garments she paid to have made by one of the court tailors i thought one could just catch a hint of purple in the weave the wretch who had brought us out into this awfulness limped on ahead glancing back at us every now and again as if to make sure we were still there how i wished we were not if ever there was a day for curling up by a roaring fire with a cup of mulled wine and a heroic romance this was it come to that a hard bench a tepid cup of leaf and one of the doctors recommended medical texts would have seemed like bliss to me compared to this filthy weather eh oelph yes mistress they do say the weather has been much more violent since the fall of the empire which is either providence punishing those who helped overthrow it or an imperial ghost exacting revenge froze beyond the grave the cur who had lured us into this absurd mission was a hobblelegged child from the barrows the palace guards hadnt even let her into the outer bastion it had been sheer bad luck that some fool of a servant bringing the guards a note of instruction had overheard the brats preposterous pleadings and taken sympathy on her coming to find the doctor in her workshop mortar and pestling her pungently arcane ingredients with my help and report that her services were requested by some bastard from the slums i could not believe it when she agreed couldnt she hear the storm groaning round the lanterns in the roof above hadnt she noticed id had to light all our lamps in the room was she deaf to the gurgle of drain water in the walls we were on our way to see some destitute breed who were distantly related to the servants of the mifelis the chiefs of the trader clan the doctor had worked for when she had first come to haspide the kings personal physician was about to pay a call in a storm not on anyone noble likely to be ennobled or indeed even respectable but on a family of slackwitted allrunt neerdowells a tribe of contagiously flead happenills so fundamentally useless they were not even servants but merely the hangerson of servants itinerant leeches on the body of the city and the land coinless and hopeless to be short about it and even the doctor might have had the sense to refuse but for the fact that she had bizarrely heard of this sickly urchin she has a voice from another world shed told me as shed swirled on her cloak as though this was all the explanation required please hurry mistress wailed the whelp whod come to summon us her accent was thick and her voice made irksome by her diseasedark snaggle teeth dont tell the doctor what to do you worthless piece of shit i told her trying to be helpful the lame brute ducked and hobbled away in front across the glistening cobbles of the square oelph kindly keep a civil tongue in your head the doctor told me grabbing her medicine bag back from me but mistress i protested at least though the doctor had waited until our limping guide was out of earshot before chastising me she screwed up her eyes against the lashing rain and raised her voice above the howl of the wind do you think we can get a cab i laughed then turned the offending noise into a cough i made a show of looking around as we approached the lower edge of the square where the lame child had disappeared down a narrow street i could just make out a few scavenging people scattered along the eastern side of the square flapping back and forth in their rags as they collected the halfrotted leaves and rainsodden husks which had been blown there from the centre of the square where the vegetable market had been not another soul to be seen certainly not a cabbie rickshaw puller or chair carrier they had more sense than to be out in weather like this i think not mistress i said oh dear the doctor said and seemed to hesitate for one wonderful moment i thought she might see sense and return us both back to the warmth and comfort of her apartments but it was not to be oh well she said holding the top of her cloak closed at her neck settling her hat more firmly on her gatheredup hair and putting her head down to hurry onwards never mind come on oelph cold water was creeping down my neck coming mistress the day had passed reasonably well until then the doctor had bathed spent more time writing in her journal then we had visited the spice market and nearby bazaars while the storm was still just a dark brew on the western horizon she had met with some merchants and other doctors at the house of a banker to talk about starting a school for doctors i was consigned to the kitchen with the servants and so heard nothing of consequence and little of sense then we walked smartly back up to the palace while the sky clouded over and the first few rain squalls swept in over from the outer docks i fondly and quite mistakenly congratulated myself for escaping back to the comfort and warmth of the palace before the storm set in a note on the door to the doctors rooms informed us that the king desired to see her and so it was off towards his private apartments as soon as wed put down our bags full of spices berries roots and earths a servant intercepted us in the long corridor with news that the king had been wounded in a practice duel and hearts in our mouths we made quickly for the game halls sire a leech we have the finest the rare emperor leech from brotechen nonsense a burnglass veining is what is required followed by an emetic a simple letting will suffice your majesty if i may no get away from me you wittering purple rogues away and become bankers the lot of you admit what you really love wheres vosill vosill the king cried up the broad stairs as he started up them left hand clutched round his right upper arm we were just starting down the king had been injured in a duelling round and it seemed as if every other doctor of repute in the city must have been in the duelling chamber that day for they were clustered round the king and the two men at his side like purplecoated chasers round a beast at bay their own masters followed at their heels holding duelling swords and halfmasks with one large greyfaced individual isolated near the rear presumably being the one whod cut the king guard commander adlain was to one side of the king duke walen on the other adlain i will record only for posterity is a man the nobility and grace of whose features and carriage are matched only by our good king though the guard commanders appearance is swarthy where king quiences is fair a faithful loyal shadow ever at the side of our splendid ruler but what monarch could wish for a more glorious shadow duke walen is a short stooped man with leathery skin and small deeply recessed eyes which are slightly crossed sir are you sure you wont let my physician tend to that wound walen said in his high grating voice while adlain shooed away a couple of the harrying doctors look the duke cried its dripping the royal blood oh my word physician physician really my lord this doctor fellow is quite the best let me just no the king bellowed i want vosill where is she the lady would appear to have more pressing engagements adlain said not unreasonably lucky its just a scratch eh my lord then he looked up the steps to see the doctor and myself descending his expression became a smile vo the king roared head down as he bounded up the curve of steps briefly leaving both walen and adlain behind here sir the doctor said stepping down to meet him vosill where in the name of all the skies of hell have you been i never mind that lets to my chambers you and the king addressed me see if you can hold off this pack of bloodsucking scavengers heres my duelling sword the king handed me his own sword you have full permission to use it on anyone who looks remotely like a physician doctor after you sir yes of course after me vosill i am the king dammit it has always struck me how well our glorious king resembles the portraits one sees displayed of him in paintings and in the profiles which grace our coins i was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to study those magnificent features that midxamis in the kings private apartments while the doctor treated the duelling wound and the king stood clad in a long gown with one sleeve rolled up in silhouette against the luminous expanse of an ancient plaster window face raised and jaw set as the doctor worked at his outheld arm what a noble visage what a regal demeanour a mane of majestically curling blond hair a brow of intelligence and stern wisdom clear flashing eyes the colour of the summer sky a sharply defined heroic nose a broad gracefully cultured mouth and a proud brave chin all set on the frame both strong and lithe which would be the envy of an athlete in his prime and the king is in his most magnificent middleage when most men have started to go to fat they do say that king quience is excelled in his appearance and physique only by his late father drasine whom they are already calling drasine the great i am happy to report and rightly so oh sir oh dear oh my goodness oh help oh what a calamity oh leave us wiester the king said sighing sir yes sir immediately sir the fat chamberlain still alternately waving and kneading his hands left the apartments muttering and moaning i thought you had armour to stop this sort of thing happening sir the doctor said she wiped the last of the blood away with a swab which she then handed to me for disposal i handed her the alcohol in exchange she soaked another swab and applied it to the gash on the kings bicep the wound was a couple of fingers long and a couple of pinches deep ouch im sorry sir aow aow are you sure this isnt some quackery of your own vosill the alcohol kills the ill humours which can infect a wound the doctor said frostily sir as does you claim mouldy bread the king snorted it has that effect and sugar that too sir in an emergency sugar the king said shaking his head dont you sir what have armour of course we have armour you imbecile aow of course we have armour but you dont wear it in the duelling chamber in the name of providence if you were going to wear armour you might as well not duel at all but i thought it was a practice sir for real fighting well of course its a practice vosill if it wasnt a practice the fellow who cut me wouldnt have stopped and damn near fainted hed have leapt in for the kill if it was that sort of duel anyway yes it was a practice the king shook his magnificent head and stamped one foot damn me vosill you ask the most stupid questions i beg your pardon sir its only a scratch anyway the king looked around then gestured at a footman standing by the main doors who quickly went to a table and drew his majesty a glass of wine how much less than a scratch is an insect bite the doctor said and yet people die from those sir they do the king said accepting the wine goblet so ive been taught a poisonous humour transmitted from the insect to the bloodstream hmm the king said looking sceptical he glanced at the wound still just a scratch adlain wasnt very impressed he drank i imagine it would take a great deal to impress guard commander adlain the doctor said though not i think unkindly the king gave a small smile you dont like adlain do you vosill the doctor flexed her brows i dont regard him as a friend sir but equally i dont regard him as an enemy either we both seek to serve you in our appointed ways according to the skills at our command the kings eyes narrowed as he considered this spoken like a politician vosill he said quietly expressed like a courtier i shall take that as a compliment sir he watched her clean out the wound for a while still perhaps you ought to be wary of him eh the doctor looked up i believe she might have been surprised if your majesty says so and duke wen the king said with a grunt your ears should burn when he talks about women being doctors or for that matter women being anything other than whores wives and mothers indeed sir the doctor said through gritted teeth she looked to me to ask for something then saw that i already held the appropriate jar in my hand i was rewarded with a smile and a nod of appreciation i took the alcoholsoaked swab and dropped it in the rubbish bag whats that the king said brows furrowed in suspicion its an ointment sir i can see its an ointment vosill what does it oh as you feel sir it dulls the pain also it fights the particles of ill humour which infest the air and aids the healing process is that like the stuff you put on my leg that time on the abscess it is sir what an excellent memory your majesty has that was the first time i treated you i believe the king caught sight of his reflection in one of the great mirrors which adorned his private resting chambers and drew himself up straighter he looked at the footman by the door who came over and took the wine goblet from him then the king lifted up his chin and pushed his hand through his hair shaking his head so that his locks which had been flattened by the sweat under his duelling halfmask fell bouncing free again thats right he said inspecting his noble outline in the looking glass i was in a poor state from what i can recall all the sawbones thought i was going to die i was very glad your majesty sent for me the doctor said quietly binding the wound it was an abscess that killed my father you know the king told the doctor so i have heard sir she smiled up at him but it did not kill you the king smiled and looked ahead no indeed then he grimaced but then he did not suffer from my twisted guts or my aching back or my other aches he is not recorded as mentioning such things sir the doctor said rolling the dressing round and round the kings mightily muscled arm he looked at her sharply are you suggesting im a whiner doctor vosill looked up surprised why no sir you bear your many unfortunate ills with great fortitude she kept on unwinding the bandage the doctor has bandages specially made for her by the court tailor and insists upon the cleanliness of the conditions of their manufacture even so before she will use then she boils them in alreadyboiled water which she has treated with the bleaching powder she also has specially made for her by the palace apothecary indeed your majesty is to be extolled for his willingness to talk of his ailments the doctor told him some people taking stoicism manly pride or simple reticence beyond its fit limit suffer in silence until they are at deaths door and then promptly pass over that threshold when a word a single complaint at a much earlier stage in their illness would have let a doctor diagnose the problem treat it and cause them to live pain or even just discomfort is like the warning sent by a frontier guard sir you are free to choose to ignore it but you should not be unduly surprised if you are subsequently overrun by invaders the king gave a small laugh and looked on the doctor with a tolerant kindly expression your cautionary military metaphor is duly appreciated doctor thank you sir the doctor adjusted the bandage so that it would sit properly on the kings arm there was a note on my door which said you wanted to see me sir i assume whatever that was about must have predated your fencing injury oh the king said yes he put one hand up to the back of his neck my neck that stiffness again you might look at it later of course sir the king sighed and i could not help noticing that his stance altered so that he was less upright less regal even father had the constitution of a haul they say he once took on a yoke and pulled one of the poor beasts backwards through a paddy i heard it was a calf sir so a haul calf weighs more than most men the king said sharply and besides were you there doctor i was not sir no you werent the king stared into the distance a look of sadness on his face but youre right i think it was a calf he sighed again the old stories talk of the kings of old lifting hauls adult hauls doctor lifting hauls above their heads and then throwing them at their enemies ziphygr of anlios ripped a wild ertheter in half with his bare hands scolf the strong tore off the head of the monster gruissens with one hand mimarstis the sompolian might these not be simply legends sir the king stopped talking and looked straight ahead for a moment i confess i froze then he turned as far round towards the doctor as he could with the bandage still being wound doctor vosill he said quietly sir you do not interrupt the king did i interrupt you sir you did do you know nothing app do they teach you naught in this archipelago anarchy of yours do they instil no manners whatsoever in their children and their women are you so degenerate and impolite that you have no conception of how to behave towards your betters the doctor looked hesitantly at the king you may answer he told her the archipelagic republic of drezen is notorious for its ill manners sir the doctor said with every appearance of meekness i am ashamed to report that i am considered one of the polite ones i do apologise my father would have had you flogged vosill and that was if hed decided to take pity on you as a foreigner and therefore unused to our ways i am grateful that in your sympathy and understanding you surpass your noble father sir i will try never to interrupt you again good the king resumed his proud stance the doctor kept on winding the last of the bandage manners were better in the old days too the king said im sure they were the doctor said sir the old gods walked amongst our ancestors the times were heroic great deeds could still be done we had not fallen from our strength then the men were greater and braver and stronger and the women were more fair and more graceful im sure it was just as you say sir everything was better then just so sir the doctor said tearing the end of the bandage lengthwise everything just gets worse the king said with another sigh hmm the doctor said securing the dressing with a knot there sir is that better the king flexed his arm and shoulder inspected his bulging arm then rolled the gowns sleeve down over the wound how long till i can fence again you can fence tomorrow gently pain will let you know when to stop sir good the king said and clapped the doctor on the shoulder she had to take a step to one side but looked pleasantly surprised i thought i saw a blush on her face well done vosill he looked her up and down shame youre not a man you could learn to fence too hmm indeed sir the doctor nodded to me and we started to put away the instruments of her profession the sick brats family lived in a pair of filthy stinking rooms at the top of a cramped and rickety tenement in the barrows above a street the storm had turned into a rushing brown sewer the concierge was not worthy of the name she was a fat drunken harridan a repulsively odoured tolltaker who demanded coin from the doctor on the pretext that our coming in from the street with such filth on our feet and hose would mean shed be put to extra work removing it judging from the state of the hallway or as much of it as could be made out in the onelamp gloom the city fathers might as well charge her for bringing the muck of its interior out on to the streets of the city but the doctor just tutted and dug into her purse the harridan then demanded and got more coin for letting the crippled child up the stairs with us i knew better than to attempt to say anything on the doctors behalf and so had to content myself with glaring at the obese nag in the most threatening way i could the way up the narrow creaking alarmingly pitched staircase led us through a variety of stenches i experienced in turn sewage animal ordure unwashed human bodies rotting food and some foul form of cooking this medley was accompanied by an orchestration of noises the buffeting screech of the wind outside the wail of babies crying from what seemed like most of the rooms the shouts curses screams and thuds of an argument behind one halfsplintered door and the woefulsounding lowing of beasts shackled in the courtyard raggedly dressed children ran up and down the stairs in front of us squealing and grunting like animals people crowded on to the cramped and illlit landings on each level to watch us pass and make remarks about the fineness of the doctors cloak and the contents of her big dark bag i kept a handkerchief to my mouth all the way up the stairs and wished i had soaked it in perfume more recently than i had achieved by a final flight of stairs even more fragilelooking and shaky than those we had encountered on the way up the top floor of this cesspile was i swear swaying in the wind certainly i felt dizzy and sick the two cramped crowded rooms we found ourselves in were probably unbearably hot in the summer and cold in the winter the wind howled through two small windows in the first chamber they had probably never had any plaster in them just a frame with material for blinds and perhaps some shutterplanks the shutters were long gone probably burned for winter fuel and the ragged flaps which were all that remained of the blinds did little to keep out the gales blast letting wind and rain billow in in this room ten or more people from babesinarms to shrunken ancients huddled on the floor and a single pallet bed their hollow eyes watched as we were ushered quickly towards the room beyond by the crippled waif whod brought us to this middenrack we entered this next chamber by pushing through a tattered fabric doorcovering behind us the people muttered to each other with a harsh lisping sound that might have been a native dialect or a foreign language this room was darker its shutters just as absent as in the room before but its windows covered with the bellying forms of coats or jackets pinned across the frames rain had collected in the sodden fabric of the garments before flowing in little rivulets from their bottom edges down the stained plaster of the walls to the floor where it had pooled and spread the floor was curiously sloped and ridged we were in one of those extra storeys that are added to already cheaply built tenements by builders landlords and residents who value economy above safety there was a slow groaning noise from the walls and a sharp cracking snapping noise from overhead water leaked from the sagging ceiling in a handful of places dripping to the grimy strawcovered floor a thickset wildhaired woman in a gruesomely filthy dress greeted the doctor with much wailing and crying and hoarse foreignsounding words and led her through a press of dark foulsmelling bodies to a low bed set against the far end of the room beneath a bowed wall whose lathe showed through strawhung lumps of plaster something scuttled away along the wall and disappeared into a long crack near the ceiling how long has she been like this i heard the doctor ask kneeling by the lamplit bed and opening her bag i edged forward to see a thin girl dressed in rags lying on the bed her face grey her thin dark hair plastered to her forehead her eyes bulging behind her tremulous flickering eyelids while her breath came in quick shallow gasps her whole body shook and quivered on the bed and her head twitched and her neck muscles spasmed continually oh i dont know wailed the woman in the dirty gown who had greeted the doctor under the unwashed scent she smelled of something sickly sweet she sat down heavily on a torn straw cushion by the bed making it bulge she elbowed a few of the other people around her out of the way and put her head in her hands while the doctor felt the sick childs forehead and pulled one of her eyelids open all day maybe doctor i dont know three days said a slight child standing near the head of the bed her arms clamped round the thin frame of the crippled one whod brought us here the doctor looked at her youre anowir the girl replied she nodded at the slightly older girl on the bed zea is my sister oh no not three days not my poor dear girl the woman on the straw cushion said rocking back and forth and shaking her head without looking up no no no we wanted to send for you before now anowir said looking from the wildhaired woman to the stricken face of the crippled girl she was holding and who was holding her but oh no no no the fat woman wailed from behind her hands some of the children whispered to each other in the same tongue wed heard in the outer room the thickset woman ran her grubby fingers through her unkempt hair anowir the doctor said in a kindly fashion to the girl holding the crippled child can you and some of your brothers and sisters go down to the docks as fast as you can and find an ice merchant fetch some ice it doesnt have to be in firstquality blocks crushed is fine in fact its best here the doctor reached into her purse and counted out some coins how many want to go she asked looking round the host of mostly young tearful faces quickly a number was settled on and she gave them a coin each this struck me as far too much for ice at this point in the season but the doctor is unworldly in these matters you may keep any change she told the suddenly eagerlooking children but you must each bring all you can carry apart from anything else she said smiling itll help weigh you down in that gale outside and stop you blowing away now go the room suddenly emptied and only the sick child on the bed the fat woman on the cushion whom i took to be the invalids mother and the doctor and i were left some of the people in the outer room came to peer through the tattered doorcloth but the doctor told them to keep away then she turned to the wildhaired woman you must tell me the truth mrs elund she said she nodded to me to open her bag while she pulled the sick child further up the bed and then had me bunch the straw mattress up underneath her back and head as i knelt to this i could feel the heat coming off the girls fevered skin has she been like this for three days three two four who knows wailed the wildhaired woman all i know is my precious daughter is dying shes going to die oh doctor help her help us all for no one else will the thickset woman suddenly threw herself with some awkwardness off the cushion and on to the floor burying her head in the folds of the doctors cloak even as the doctor was unfastening the garment and trying to free herself from it ill do what i can mrs elund the doctor said and then looked at me as she let the cloak fall off her shoulders and the girl on the bed started to splutter and cough oelph well need that cushion too mrs elund sat up and looked round thats mine she cried as i gathered up the burst cushion and stuffed it behind the sick girls head while the doctor held her upright where am i to sit ive given up my bed for her already you must find somewhere else the doctor told her she reached down and pulled up the girls thin dress i looked away as she examined the childs midparts which appeared inflamed the doctor bent closer rearranging the childs legs and taking some instrument from her bag after a while she put the girls legs back together and pulled the patients dress and skirts back down she busied herself with the childs eyes and mouth and nose and held her wrist for a while eyes closed there was silence in the room save for the noises of the storm and the occasional sniffle from mrs elund who had settled on the floor with the doctors cape wrapped half around her i had the distinct impression the doctor was trying to control a desire to shout and scream the money for the song school the doctor said tersely if i went to the school now do you think they would tell me it had been spent there on zeas lessons oh doctor were a poor family the wildhaired woman said putting her face in her hands again i cant watch what they all do i cant keep watch on what she does with the money i give her she does what she wants to do that one i tell you oh save her doctor please save her the doctor shifted her position where she knelt and reached in under the bed she pulled out a couple of fat clays one stoppered one not she sniffed the empty clay and shook the stoppered one it sloshed mrs elund looked up her eyes wide she swallowed i caught a whiff from the clay the smell was the same as that on mrs elunds breath the doctor looked at the other woman over the top of the empty clay how long has zea known men mrs elund the doctor asked replacing the clays under the bed known men the wildhaired woman screeched sitting upright she and on this bed too id think the doctor said pulling up the girls dress to look at the beds covers again thats where shes picked up the infection somebodys been too rough with her shes too young she looked at mrs elund with an expression i can only say i was devoutly glad was not directed at me mrs elunds jaw worked and her eyes went wide i thought she was about to speak then the doctor said i understood what the children said when they left mrs elund they thought zea might be pregnant and they mentioned the sea captain and the two bad men or did i misunderstand something mrs elund opened her mouth then she went limp and her eyes closed and she said oooh and fell in what looked like a dead faint to the floor folding herself on to the doctors cloak the doctor ignored mrs elund and busied herself at her bag for a moment before bringing out a jar of ointment and a small wooden spatula she drew on a pair of the rikes bladder gloves shed had the palace hidetailor make for her and pulled the girls dress up once more i looked away again the doctor used various of her precious ointments and fluids on the sick child telling me as she did so what effect each ought to have how this one alleviated the effects of high temperature on the brain how this one would fight the infection at its source how this one would do the same job from inside the girls body and how this one would give her strength and act as a general tonic when she recovered the doctor had me remove her cloak from underneath mrs elund and then hold the cloak out of a window in the other room waiting with arms that became increasingly sore until it was saturated with water before bringing it back inside and placing its dark sopping folds over the child whose clothes save for a single tatty shift the doctor had removed the girl continued to shake and twitch and seemed no better than when we had arrived when mrs elund made the noises that indicated she was coming back from her faint the doctor ordered her to find a fire a kettle and some clean water to boil mrs elund seemed to resent this but left without too many curses muttered under her breath shes burning up the doctor whispered to herself one graceful longfingered hand on the childs forehead it occurred to me then for the first time that the girl might die oelph the doctor said looking at me with worry in her eyes would you see if you can find the children hurry them up she needs that ice yes mistress i said wearily and made for the stairs and their mixture of sights sounds and smells i had just been starting to think that parts of me were drying off i exited into the loud darkness of the storm xamis had set by now and poor seigen somewhere beyond the clouds seemed to have no more power to penetrate them than an oil lamp the rainlashed streets were deserted and gloomy full of deep shadows and buffeting squalls that threatened to bowl me over into the gurgling open sewer overflowing at the centre of each thoroughfare i headed downhill under the darkly threatening bulk of the overhanging buildings in what i imagined must be the direction of the docks hoping that i could find my way back and starting to wish that id taken one of the people in the outer room as a guide i think sometimes the doctor forgets that i am not a native of haspide certainly i have lived here longer than she for she only arrived a little over two years ago but i was born in the city of derla far to the south and passed the majority of my childhood in the province of ormin even since i came to haspide most of the time i have spent here has been not in the city itself but in the palace or in the summer palace in the yvenage hills or on the road to it or on the way back from it i wondered if the doctor had really sent me out to look for the children or whether there was some arcane or secret treatment she intended to carry out which she did not want me to witness they say all doctors are secretive i have heard that one medical clan in oartch kept the invention of birthing forceps secret for the best part of two generations but i had thought doctor vosill was different perhaps she was perhaps she really did think id be able to make the ice shed requested arrive quicker though it seemed to me there was little i could really do a cannon boomed out over the city marking the end of one watch and the start of another the sound was muffled by the storm and seemed almost like part of it i buttoned my coat up as far as i could while i was doing this the wind whipped my hat off my head and sent it tumbling down the street until it fetched up in the streets central drain i ran after it and lifted it out of the stinking stream wrinkling my nose in disgust at the smell i rinsed it as best i could under an overflowing drain wrung it out and sniffed at it then threw it away i found the docks after a while by which time i was thoroughly soaked again i hunted in vain for an ice warehouse and was told in no uncertain terms by the odd seafaring and trading types i discovered in a few small ramshackle offices and a couple of crowded smokestuffed taverns that i was in the wrong place to find ice warehouses this was the saltfish market i was able to confirm this when i slipped on some fish guts lying rotting under a windruffled puddle and was nearly pitched into the troubled tossing waters of the dock alongside i could have got wetter as a result of such a fall but unlike the doctor i cannot swim eventually i found myself being forced by a tall stone wall which started sheer on a windwhipped quay and extended off into the distance to walk back uphill into the maze of tenements the children had beaten me to it i arrived back at the accursed building ignored the frightful threats of the foulsmelling harridan at the door dragged myself up the steps past the smells and through the cacophony of sounds following a trail of dark water spots to the top floor where the ice had been delivered and the girl packed in it still covered in the doctors cloak and now again surrounded by her siblings and friends the ice arrived too late we had arrived too late perhaps by a day or so the doctor struggled through into the night trying everything she could think of but the girl slipped away from her in a blazing fever the ice could not alleviate and sometime around when the storm started to abate in the midnight of xamis while seigen still struggled to pierce the tattering dark shrouds of the storm clouds and the voices of the singers were carried away and lost on the quickness of the wind the child died the bodyguard let me search him general we cant search him dewar hes an ambassador zespiole is right dewar we cant treat him as though hes some peasant supplicant of course not dewar said bileth who was the protectors advisor on most matters foreign he was a tall thin imperious man with long scant hair and a short considerable temper he did his best to look down his very thin nose at the taller dewar what sort of ruffians do you want us to appear the ambassador certainly comes with all the usual diplomatic accoutrements urleyn said striding onwards along the terrace from one of the sea companies sir dewar protested theyre hardly an imperial delegation of old they have the clothes and the jewels and the chains of office but do any of them match match urleyn said mystified i think zespiole said the chief bodyguard means that all their finery is stolen ha bileth said with a shake of his head aye and recently too dewar said nevertheless urleyn said in fact all the more so because of that sir all the more so bileth looked confused for a moment then nodded wisely general urleyn came to a sudden stop on the white and black tiles of the terrace dewar seemed to stop in the same instant zespiole and bileth a moment later those following them along the terrace between the private quarters and the formal court chambers generals aides sbes and clerks the usual attenders bumped into each scribes other with a muffled clattering of armour swords and writing boards as they drew to a stop behind the sea companies may be all the more important now that the old empire is in tatters my friends general urleyn said turning in the sunlight to address the tall balding figure of bileth the still taller and shadowdark bodyguard and the smaller older man in the uniform of the palace guard zespiole a thin wizened man with deeply lined eyes had been dewars predecessor as chief bodyguard now instead of being charged with the immediate protection of urleyns person he was in command of the palace guard and therefore with the security of the whole palace the sea companies knowledge urleyn said their skills their ships their cannons they have all become more important the collapse of the empire has brought us a surfeit of those who call themselves emperors at least three brother ruleuin called precisely urleyn said smiling three emperors a lot of happy kings or at least kings who are happier than they were under the old empire and indeed a few more people calling themselves kings who would not have dared to do so under the old regime not to mention one for whom the title king would be an insult indeed a demotion sir yetamidous said appearing at the generals shoulder urleyn clapped the taller mans back you see dewar even my good friend general yetamidous rightly numbers me with those who have benefited from the demise of the old order and reminds me that it was neither my cunning and guile nor exemplary generalship which led me to the exalted position i now hold urleyn said his eyes twinkling general yetamidous said his broad furrowed rather doughylooking face taking on a hurt expression i meant to imply no such thing the grand aedile urleyn laughed and clapped his friend on the shoulder again i know yet dont worry but you take the point dewar he said turning to him again yet raising his voice to make it clear he was addressing all the rest of those present not just his chief bodyguard we have been able urleyn told them to take more control of our own affairs because we do not have the threat of imperial interference hanging over us the great forts are deserted the drafts are returned home or have become aimless bands of brigands the fleets were sunk vying with one another or left rotting deserted a few of the ships had commanders who could hold them together with respect rather than fear and some of those ships are now part of the sea companies the older companies have found a new power now that the empires ships no longer harry them with that power they have a new responsibility a new station in life they have become the protectors not the raptors the guards not the raiders urleyn looked round all the people in the group standing blinking on the terrace of black and white tiles under the fierce glare of xamis and seigen at their mid bileth nodded even more wisely than before indeed sir i have often the empire was the parent urleyn went on and the kingdoms and the sea companies to a lesser degree were the children we were left to play amongst ourselves for much of the time unless we made too much noise or broke something whereupon the adults would come and punish us now the father and the mother are dead the degenerate relatives dispute the will but it is too late and the children have grown to young adulthood left the nursery and taken over the house indeed we have quit the treehouse to occupy the whole estate gentlemen and we must not show too much disrespect to those who used to play with their boats in the pond he smiled the least we can do is treat their ambassadors as we would wish ours to be treated he clapped bileth on the shoulder making the taller man waver dont you think absolutely sir bileth said with a scornful look at dewar there you are urleyn said he turned on his heel come he paced away dewar was still at his side a piece of blackness moving across the tiles zespiole had to walk fast to catch up bileth took longer strides delay the meeting sir dewar said let it be held in less formal circumstances invite the ambassador to meet you in the baths say then in the baths dewar the general scoffed how ridiculous bileth said zespiole just chuckled i have seen this ambassador sir dewar told the general as the doors were opened for them and they entered the coolness of the great hall where half a hundred courtiers officials and military men were waiting scattered about its plain stone floor he does not fill me with confidence sir dewar said quietly quickly looking round in fact he fills me with suspicion especially as he has requested a private meeting they stopped near the doors the general nodded to a small alcove set into the thickness of the wall where there was just enough room for two to sit excuse us bileth commander zespiole he said zespiole looked discomfited but nodded bileth drew back a little as though profoundly insulted but then bowed gravely urleyn and dewar sat in the alcove the general held up one hand to prevent the people approaching them from coming too close zespiole held out his arms keeping people back what do you find suspicious dewar he asked softly he is like no ambassador ive ever seen he doesnt have the look of one urleyn laughed quietly what is he dressed in seaboots and a storm cape are there barnacles on his heels and seabirdshit on his cap really dewar i mean his face his expression his eyes his whole bearing i have seen hundreds of ambassadors sir and they are as various as you might expect and more they are unctuous openseeming blustering resigned modest nervous severe every type but they all seem to care sir they all seem to have some sort of common interest in their office and function this one dewar shook his head urleyn put his hand on the other mans shoulder this one just feels wrong to you is that right i confess you put it no better than i sir urleyn laughed as i said dewar we live in a time when values and roles and people are changing you do not expect me to behave as other rulers have behaved do you no sir i do not just so we cannot expect every functionary of every new power to conform to expectations formed in the days of the old empire i understand that sir i hope i am already taking that into account what i am talking about is simply a feeling but it is if i may term it so a professional feeling and it is partly for those sir that you employ me dewar searched his leaders eyes to see if he was convinced if he had succeeded in transmitting any of the apprehension he felt but the protectors eyes still twinkled amused more than concerned dewar shifted uncomfortably on the stone bench sir he said leaning closer his expression pained i was told the other day by someone whose opinion i know you value that i am incapable of being other than a bodyguard that my every waking moment even when i am meant to be relaxing is spent thinking of how better to keep you from harm he took a deep breath my point is that if i live only to shield you from danger and think of nothing else even when i might how much more must i attend to my anxieties when i am at the very core of my duty as now urleyn regarded him for a moment you ask me to trust your mistrust he said quietly now the protector does put it better than i could have urleyn smiled and why would any of the sea companies wish me dead in the first place dewar dropped his voice still further because you are thinking of building a navy sir am i urleyn asked with seeming surprise arent you sir why would anyone think that you turned over some of the royal forests to the people and then recently introduced the condition that some of the older trees might be thinned theyre dangerous they are healthy sir and of the age and shape for ships timbers then there is the mariners refuge in tyrsk a naval college in the making and enough have i been so indiscreet are the sea companies spies so numerous and so perceptive and you have held talks with haspidus and xinkspar about enlisting id imagine the wealth of one and the skills of the other in the formation of such a navy urleyn looked troubled now you know about this you must eavesdrop from a great distance dewar i hear nothing that you would not expect me to hear through simple proximity sir what i hear without searching then x out are rumours people are not stupid and functionaries have their specialities sir their areas of expertise when an exadmiral comes to call one may guess it is not to discuss breeding better pack animals for crossing the breathless plains hmm urleyn said looking out at the people gathered around them but not seeing them he nodded you can draw the blinds in a brothel but people still know what youre doing exactly sir urleyn slapped his knee and made to stand dewar was on his feet first very well dewar to humour you well meet in the painted chamber and well make the meeting more private even than he has asked for just me and him you may eavesdrop are you mollified sir fleet captain oestrile ambassador of the keps haven sea company dressed in an ornate rendition of a nautical uniform with long turnedover boots of blue hide trousers of grey pikefish skin and a thick highcollared frock coat of aquamarine edged with gold all topped by a tricorn hat embellished with angelbird feathers strode slowly into the painted chamber in the palace of vorifyr the ambassador walked down a narrow carpet of gold thread which ended at a small stool set a couple of strides from the front of the only other article of furniture which the gleaming wooden floor supported namely a small dais topped by a plain chair on which sat the prime protector first general and grand aedile of the protectorate of tassasen general urleyn the ambassador took off his hat and executed a small bow to the protector who motioned the ambassador to the stool the ambassador looked at the low stool for a moment then unbuttoned a couple of buttons at the lower edge of his coat and sat carefully laying his extravagantly feathered hat to one side he had no obvious weapons not even a ceremonial sword though around his neck was a belt supporting a stout cylinder of polished hide with a buttoned cap at one end and finished with inscribed gold filigree the ambassador looked round the walls of the chamber the walls were painted in a series of panels depicting the various parts of the old kingdom of tassasen a forest full of game a dark and towering castle a bustling city square a harem a pattern of fields sectioning a flood plain and so on if the subjects were relatively mundane the artwork was almost definitively so people who had heard of the painted chamber which was rarely opened and even more rarely used and who expected something special were invariably disappointed the paintings were it was generally agreed rather dull and unexceptional ambassador oestrile the protector said he was dressed in his usual style of the long jacket and trousers he had made the fashion the old tassasen chain of state with the crown removed was his only concession to formality sire the fellow said urleyn thought he saw in the ambassadors manner a little of what dewar had meant there was a sort of empty gleam in the young mans gaze an expression which included such open eyes and such a wide smile in such a young shiningly smooth face ought not to be quite as disquieting as it somehow contrived to be the fellow was of average build his hair was short and dark though redpowdered after some fashion urleyn did not recognise he sported fine whiskers for one so young young perhaps that was part of it thought urleyn ambassadors tended to be older and fatter well he should not talk of changing times and changing roles and then be himself surprised your journey urleyn asked i trust it was unexciting unexciting the young fellow said seemingly confused how so i meant safe the protector said your journey was safe the fellow looked relieved for a moment ah he said smiling broadly and nodding yes safe our journey was safe very safe he smiled again urleyn began to wonder if the young fellow was entirely right in the head perhaps he was young for an ambassador because he was some doting fathers favourite son and the father was blind to the fact the lad was soft in the brain he didnt speak imperial very well either but urleyn had heard a few strange accents from those who were of the nautical powers well ambassador he said holding his hands out to each side you asked for an audience the young mans eyes went wider still yes an audience he slowly took the belt from round his neck and then looked down at the polished hide cylinder in his lap first of all sir he said i have a gift for you from the fleet captain vritten he looked up expectantly at urleyn i confess i have not heard of fleet captain vritten but continue the young fellow cleared his throat he wiped sweat from his brow perhaps urleyn thought he has a fever it is a little warm in here but insufficiently so to make a man sweat like that the sea companies spend much of their time in the tropics so it cannot be that he is unused to heat sea breezes or not the captain undid the buttoned end of the cylinder and withdrew another cylinder also clad in goldinscribed hide though its ends appeared to be gold or brass and one end was tapered by a series of shining metal rings what i have here sir the ambassador said looking down at the cylinder which he now held in both hands is a seeingpiece an optiscope or telescope as such instruments are also known yes urleyn said i have heard of such things naharajast the last imperial mathematician claimed to have used one directed at the skies to make his predictions concerning the firerocks which appeared in the year of the empires fall last year an inventor or someone who claimed to be an inventor came to our palace and showed us one i had a look through it myself it was interesting the view was cloudy but it was undeniably closer the young ambassador seemed not to hear the telescope is a fascinating device a most fascinating device sir and this one is a particularly fine example he pulled the device apart so that it clicked out to three or so times its compacted length then held it up to one eye looking at urleyn then round the painted panels of the room urleyn formed the impression he was hearing a memorised script hmm the young ambassador said nodding his head extraordinary would you care to try it sir he stood and held out the instrument to the protector who motioned the ambassador to approach clutching the hide instruments protective cylinder awkwardly in his other hand the captain stepped forward offering the eyepiece end of the device to urleyn who leant forward in his chair and duly took hold of it the ambassador let go of the thicker end of the instrument it began to fall to the floor oh heavy isnt it urleyn said quickly bringing his other hand round to save the device he had almost to jump out of the chair to keep his balance going down on one knee towards the young captain who took a single step back ambassador oestriles hand suddenly held a long thin dagger which he swept up and then brought swinging down urleyn saw this even as his knee hit the dais and he finally caught the seeingpiece with his hands full still offbalance and kneeling beneath the other man urleyn knew instantly that there was nothing he could do to parry the blow the crossbow bolt slammed into ambassador oestriles head an instant after glancing off the high collar of his coat the bolt lodged in his skull just above his left ear most of its length protruding if either man had had the time and inclination to look they would have seen that a small hole had appeared in the painting of the bustling city square oestrile staggered back still clutching the dagger his feet slipping on the polished wooden floor urleyn let himself fall back against the chair putting both hands to the eyepiece end of the telescope he started to swing it back behind him thinking to use it as a club ambassador oestrile gave a roaring bellow of pain and rage put one hand to the crossbow bolt and gripped it shaking his head then suddenly threw himself forward again at urleyn dagger first with a resounding crash dewar burst through the thin plaster panel depicting the city square a wave of dust rolled out across the gleaming floor and plaster shards scattered everywhere as dewar sword already drawn thrust the blade straight at the ambassadors midriff the blade broke dewars momentum carried him onwards so that he sidecharged into the ambassador still roaring the ambassador was toppled to the floor with a thud waving his dagger dewar threw away the broken sword spun to one side and drew his own dagger urleyn had dropped the heavy telescope and stood he drew a small knife from his jacket and took shelter behind the tall chair oestrile reared to his feet the crossbow bolt still in his skull his boots struggled to find purchase on the polished wooden floor as he stumbled towards the protector dewar bare footed was on him before hed taken half a step coming quickly up behind him putting one hand over his face and pulling his head back with fingers stuck into the mans nostrils and one eye ambassador oestrile screamed as dewar sliced his dagger across the mans exposed throat blood sprayed and bubbled as the scream was drowned oestrile crashed to his knees finally dropped the dagger then fell sideways neck spurting blood on to the gleaming floor sir dewar asked urleyn breathlessly still half watching the body twitching on the floor sounds of a commotion came from outside the chambers doors thuds sounded sir protector general a dozen voices babbled im fine stop breaking the damn door down urleyn shouted the commotion became a little less intense he looked at where the painted plaster scene of the busy city square had been in the little cupboardsized room which had been revealed behind there was a stout wooden post with a crossbow fastened to it urleyn looked back at dewar and put his own small knife back in its pocket sheath no damage done thank you dewar and you i am uninjured too sir sorry t had to kill him he looked down at the body which gave out one final bubbling sigh and then seemed to collapse in on itself a little the pool of blood on the floor was deep and dark and still spreading viscously dewar knelt keeping his dagger at what was left of the mans throat as he felt for a pulse never mind the protector said took some killing too did you not think he gave an almost girlish chuckle i think some of his strength and his bravery came from a potion or some such drugbrew sir hmm urleyn said then looked to the doors will you shut up he yelled im perfectly all right but this piece of shit tried to kill me palace guard aye sir five present shouted a muffled voice get commander zespiole tell him to find the rest of the diplomatic mission and arrest them clear everybody away from those doors then enter nobody but the palace guards are allowed in here until i say so got all that sir the commotion intensified for a while then began to subside again until there was almost no noise in the painted chamber dewar had unbuttoned the failed assassins coat chain mail he said fingering the coats lining he tapped the garments collar and metal he gripped the shaft of the crossbow bolt strained then stood and put one bare foot on ambassador oestriles head eventually pulling the bolt free with a delicate crunching noise no wonder it was deflected urleyn stepped to the side of the dais where did the dagger come from i didnt see dewar crossed to the tall chair leaving bloody footprints he lifted first the telescope and then the hide cylinder it had been transported within he peered into the case theres some sort of clip at the bottom he inspected the telescope there is no glass at the large end the dagger must have nested inside the device when it was inside the case sir a voice came from the door what urleyn shouted guard sergeant hieliris and three others here sir come in urleyn told them the guards entered looking warily about all looked surprised at the hole where the city painting had been you have not seen that the protector told them they nodded dewar stood cleaning his dagger on a piece of cloth urleyn stepped forward and kicked the dead man in the shoulder sending him flopping on to his back take this away he told the guards two of them sheathed their swords and took one end of the body each better take a limb each lads dewar told them that coats heavy see to the clearup will you dewar asked urleyn i should be at your side sir if this is a determined attack there might be two assassins the second waiting for us to relax when we think the attack has failed urleyn drew himself up and took a deep breath dont worry about me im going off to lie down now he said dewar frowned are you sure youre all right sir oh im fine dewar the protector said following the trail of blood as the guards carried the body to the doors im going off to lie down on top of somebody very young and plump and firm he grinned back at dewar from the doors proximity to death does this to me he announced he laughed looking down at the trail of blood then at the black pool of it by the dais i should have been an undertaker the doctor master it was now about the time of year when the court works itself into the most excited and febrile state as everyone prepares for the circuition and the move to the summer palace the doctor was busy with her preparations just as everybody else was busy with theirs though of course in her case there might have been expected to be an added excitement given that this would be her first circuition i did all that i could to help her though i was constrained in this for a while by a slight fever which kept me in my bed for a few days i confess i hid the symptoms of my illness for as long as i could feeling that the doctor would think me weak and also because i had heard from the apprentices of other doctors that however kindly and pleasant their masters might be with their paying patients when their own devoted helpers took poorly they were to a man which naturally they all were notoriously brusque and unsympathetic doctor vosill was however a very agreeable and understanding doctor to me while i was ill and tended to my needs as though she were my mother which i do not think she is quite old enough to be i would not record anything beyond my brief infirmity and might even have skipped over it entirely save to explain to my master why there was a gap in my reports but for the following which struck me as possibly shedding some light on the doctors mysterious past before she appeared in the city two years ago i was i freely confess in a strange state at the height of my sickness devoid of appetite sweating freely and falling into a state of semiunconsciousness whenever i closed my eyes i was convinced i was seeing odd and vexatious shapes and figures who tormented me with their manic and incomprehensible shiftings and cavortings my greatest fear as may be imagined was that i might say something that would reveal to the doctor the fact that i had been charged with reporting on her actions of course given that she is obviously a good and trustworthy person from all that i have seen and reported so far and so evidently devoted to our good king it may be that no ultimate damage would result from such a revelation but however that may be i will of course heed my masters wishes and keep my mission a secret be assured then master that no word or hint of that assignment was transmitted by me and the doctor remains none the wiser regarding these reports still while that most precious confidence remained locked well within myself other of my normal inhibitions and selfconstraints had slackened off due to the influence of the fever and i found myself on my bed in my cell one day while the doctor who had just returned from treating the king he had a bad neck around this time i think was washing my muchsweated upper body you are too good to me doctor a nurse should do this a nurse will do this if i am called away to the king again our dear king how i love him i cried which was sincere if a little embarrassing as do we all oelph the doctor said squeezing water from a cloth over my chest and with what seemed like a thoughtful look rubbing my skin clean she was crouched at the side of my bed which is a very low one due to the constraints of space within my cell i looked into the doctors face which seemed sad just then i thought dont fear doctor you will keep him well he worries that his father was the stronger man and he died young but youll keep him well wont you what yes yes of course oh you werent worried about me were you and i confess my heart gave a little leap within my hot and breathless chest for what young man would not be taken with the idea of a good and handsome woman especially one tending so intimately to his bodily needs as at that point worrying about and caring for him dont worry i said putting out a hand im not going to die she looked uncertain so i added am i no oelph she said and smiled kindly no youre not going to die youre young and strong and ill look after you another halfday and you should start to come round again she looked down at the hand i had extended to her which i now realised was on her knee i gulped ah this old dagger of yours i said not so fevered that i could not feel embarrassed i tapped the old knifes pommel where it protruded from the top of the doctors boot near where my hand had rested it has ah always fascinated me what sort of knife is it have you ever had to use it i dare say it cannot be a surgical tool it looks too dull or is it some ceremonial token what the doctor smiled and put one hand over my lips quieting me she reached down and pulled the dagger from its sheath in her boot handing it to me here she said i took its batteredlooking length in my hands id tell you to be careful she said still smiling but theres little point nor much in the way of edge i said running one sweaty thumb along it the doctor laughed loudly why oelph a joke she said clapping me gently on the shoulder and one that works in many a language too you must be getting better her eyes looked bright i felt suddenly shy you have looked after me so well mistress i was not sure what else to say and so i studied the dagger it was a heavy old thing about a hand and a half long and made of old steel which had become minutely pitted with small rusty holes the blade was slightly bent and the tip had been broken off and rounded with time there were a few nicks on each bladeedge which truly were so dull one would have to saw away with some force to cut anything much more robust than a jellyfish the tusk grip was pitted too though on a larger scale around the pommel and in a trio of lines down the length of the grip down to the stop there were a few semiprecious stones each no bigger than a crop grain and many holes where it appeared similar stones had once rested the top of the pommel was formed by a large dark smoky stone which when i held it up to the light i could just see through round the pommels bottom rim what i mistook at first for some wavy carving was really a line of little pits which had lost all but one of the small pale stones i ran a finger down them you should have this repaired mistress i told her the palace armourer would oblige im sure for the stones do not look expensive and the workmanship is not of the first order let me take it down to the armoury when i am well i know the deputy armourers assistant it would be no trouble it would please me to do something for you there is no need the doctor said i like it well enough just as it is it has sentimental value i carry it as a keepsake from whom mistress the fever normally i would not have been so bold an old friend she said easily mopping off my chest and then putting the cloths aside and sitting back on the floor from drezen from drezen she nodded given to me the day i set sail it was new then she shook her head it was old then the thin light of a seigen sunset shone through a crackedopen window and reflected redly on her netted gathered hair a family heirloom they do not take very good care of their heirlooms if they let them fall into such disrepair mistress there must be more holes than stones she smiled the stones that are missing were used to good effect some bought protection in uncultured places where a person travelling alone is seen more as prey than as guest and others paid my way on some of the sea passages that brought me here they do not look very valuable they are more highly prized elsewhere perhaps but the knife or what it carried kept me safe and it kept me moving i have never had to use it well i have had to brandish it and wave it around a bit but i have never had to use it to hurt anyone and as you say that is just as well for me for it is quite the dullest knife i have seen since i arrived here quite so mistress it would not do to have the dullest dagger in the palace all the others are so very sharp she looked at me and i can only say she looked at me sharply for that was a piercing gaze she gently took the dagger from me and rubbed a thumb down one blade i think perhaps i will have you take it to the armoury though only to have an edge put on it they might repoint it too mistress a dagger is for stabbing indeed she put it back in its sheath oh mistress i cried suddenly full of fear im sorry for what oelph she said her beautiful face so concerned suddenly close to mine for for talking to you like this for asking you personal questions i am only your servant your apprentice this is not seemly oh oelph she said smiling her voice soft her breath cool on my cheek we can ignore seemliness at least in private dont you think may we mistress and i confess my heart fevered though it was leapt at these words wildly expecting what i knew i could not expect i think so oelph she said and took my hand in hers and squeezed it gently you may ask me whatever you like i can always say no and i am not the type to take offence easily i would like us to be friends not just doctor and apprentice she tilted her head a quizzical amused expression on her face is that all right with you oh yes mistress good well then the doctor cocked her head again listening to something theres the door she said rising excuse me she returned holding her bag the king she said her expression it seemed to me was halfregretful halfradiant apparently his toes are sore she smiled will you be all right by yourself oelph yes mistress ill be back as soon as i can then maybe well see if youre ready for something to eat it was a fiveday later i think that the doctor was called to the slave master tunch his house was an imposing one in the merchants quarter overlooking the grand canal its tall raised front doors sat imposingly above the sweeping double staircase leading from the street but we were not able to enter that way instead our hired seat was directed to a small quay a few streets away where we transferred to a little cabinpunt which took us shutters closed down a side canal and round to the rear of the building and a small dock hidden from the public waters what is all this about the doctor asked me as the punts shutters were opened by the boatman and the vessel bumped against the dark timbers of a pier it was well into summer yet still the place seemed chilly and smelled of dankness and decay mistress i said fastening a spiced kerchief round my mouth and nose this secrecy and why are you doing that she asked obviously annoyed as a servant helped the boatman secure the punt what this mistress i asked pointing to the kerchief yes she said standing up and rocking our small craft it is to combat the evil humours mistress oelph i have told you before that infectious agents are transmitted in breath or bodily fluids even if they are insect body fluids she said a bad smell by itself will not make you ill thank you the servant accepted her bag and laid it carefully on the small dock i did not reply no doctor knows everything and it is better to be safe than sorry anyway she said i am still unclear why all this secrecy is required i think the slave master does not want his own doctor to know of your visit i told her as i clambered on to the dock they are brothers if this slaver is so close to death why isnt his doctor at his side the doctor said come to that why isnt he there as his brother the servant held out a hand to help the doctor out of the boat thank you she said again she is always thanking servants i think the menials of drezen must be a surly lot or just spoiled i dont know mistress i confessed the masters brother is in trosila maam the servant said which just goes to show what happens when you start speaking to servants is he the doctor said the servant opened a small door leading to the rear of the house yes maam he said looking nervously at the boatman he has gone in person to seek some rare earth which is said to help the condition the master is suffering from i see the doctor said we entered the house a female servant met us she wore a severe black dress and had a forbidding face indeed her expression was so bleak my first thought was that slave master tunch had died however she gave the tiniest of nods to the doctor and in a precise clipped voice said mistress vosill thats me she nodded at me and this my apprentice oelph very good follow me the doctor looked round as we started up some bare wooden stairs a conspiratorial look on her face i was caught in the act of directing a most harsh stare at the black back of the woman leading us but the doctor just smiled and winked the servant who had talked to the doctor locked the dock door and disappeared through another which i guessed led to the servants floor the passageway was steep and narrow and unlit save for a slit window every storey where the wooden steps twisted to double back on themselves there was a narrow door at each floor too it crossed my mind that perhaps these confined quarters were for children for the slaver tunch was well known for specialising in child slaves we came to the second landing how long has slaver tunch the doctor began please do not talk on these stairs the strictlooking woman told her others may hear the doctor said nothing but turned back to look at me again her eyes wide and the corners of her mouth turned down we were led into the rest of the house at the third storey the corridor we found ourselves in was broad and plush paintings adorned the walls and facing us were wallhigh glass windows letting in the sight of the tops of the grand houses on the far side of the canal and the sky and clouds beyond a series of tall wide doors opened off the corridor we were ushered towards the tallest and widest the woman put her hand on the doors handle the servant she said on the dock yes said the doctor he talked to you the doctor looked into the womans eyes for a moment i asked him a question she said this is one of the few times i have ever heard the doctor directly lie i thought so the woman said opening the door for us we stepped into a large dark room lit only by candies and lanterns the floor underfoot felt warm and furry at first i thought id stepped on a hound there was a perfume of great sweetness in the room and i thought i detected the scent of various herbs known to have a healing or tonic effect i tried to detect a smell of sickness or corruption but could not a huge canopied bed sat in the middle of the room it held a large man attended by three people two servants and a welldressed lady they looked round as we entered and light flooded into the room the light started to wane behind us as the severelooking woman closed the doors from outside the doctor turned round and said through the narrowing gap the servant will be punished the woman said with a wintry smile the doors thudded shut the doctor breathed deeply and then turned to the candlelit scene in the centre of the room you are the woman doctor the lady asked approaching us my name is vosill the doctor told her lady tunch the woman nodded can you help my husband i dont know maam the doctor looked round the shadowy halfhidden spaces of the room as if trying to guess its extent it would help if i could see him is there a reason for the curtains being drawn oh we were told the darkness would reduce the swellings lets take a look shall wethe doctor said we crossed to the bed walking on the thick floor covering was an odd disconcerting experience like walking on the deck of a pitching ship the slave master tunch had by repute always been a huge man he was bigger now he lay on the bed breathing quickly and shallowly his skin grey and blotched his eyes were closed he seems to sleep almost all the time the lady told us she was a thin little thing scarcely more than a child with a pinched pale face and hands that were forever kneading each other one of the two servants was mopping her husbands brow the other was fussing at the bottom of the bed tucking in bed clothes he was soiled just earlier the lady explained did you keep the stool the doctor asked no the lady said shocked we have no need to the house has a water closet the doctor took the place of the servant mopping the mans brow she looked into his eyes she looked in his mouth and then she pulled back the coverings over the huge bulge of his body before pulling up his shirt i think the only fatter people i have seen have been eunuchs master tunch was not just fat though goodness knows there is nothing wrong with being fat he bulged oddly i saw this myself even before the doctor pointed this out she turned to the lady i need more light she told her would you have the curtains opened the lady hesitated then nodded to the servants light washed into the great room it was even more splendid than i had imagined all the furniture was covered in gold leaf cloth of gold hung from the beds great frame it was drawn up into a great sphincter shape in the centre of the ceiling and even formed the curtains themselves paintings and mirrors covered every wall and pieces of sculpture mostly nymphs and a few of the old wanton goddesses stood on the floor or sat upon the tables desks and sideboards where a veritable profusion of what looked like human skulls covered in gold leaf were scattered the carpets were a soft and lustrous blueblack and were i guessed zuleon fur from the far south they were so thick i wasnt surprised that walking on them had been unsettling slave master tunch looked no better in the light of day than he had by candle glow his flesh was everywhere puffy and discoloured and his body seemed a strange shape even for one so large he moaned and one fat hand came fluttering up like a doughy bird his wife took it and held it to her cheek onehanded there was an awkwardness about the way she tried to use both hands that mystified me at the time the doctor pressed and prodded the giant frame in a variety of places the man groaned and whimpered but uttered no intelligible word when did he start to bloat like this she asked about a year past i think the lady said the doctor looked at her quizzically the lady looked bashful we were only married a halfyear ago the slavers wife said the doctor was looking at her oddly but then she smiled was there much pain at the start the housemistress has told me that his last wife said it was about harvest when he began to get the pains and then his she patted her own waist his girth began to become greater the doctor kept prodding the great body did he become ill tempered the lady smiled a small hesitant smile oh i think he was always he was never one to suffer fools gladly she started to hug herself then winced with pain before she could cross her arms settling instead for massaging her upper left arm with her right hand is your arm sore the doctor asked her the lady stepped back eyes wide no she exclaimed still clutching her arm no theres nothing wrong with it its fine the doctor pulled the mans night dress back down and drew the covers over him well theres nothing i can do for him best let him sleep sleep the lady wailed all day like an animal im sorry the doctor said i should have said best let him remain unconscious is there nothing you can do for him not really the doctor said the illness is so advanced that he is hardly even feeling the pain now its unlikely hell come round again i can write you a prescription for something to give him if he does but i imagine his brother has already dealt with that the lady nodded she was staring at the great form that was her husband one fist at her mouth her teeth biting on her knuckle hes going to die almost certainly im sorry the lady shook her head eventually she tore her gaze away from the bed should i have called you earlier if i had would that it would have made no difference the doctor told her there is nothing any doctor could have done for him some diseases are not treatable she looked down with a cold expression it seemed to me at the body lying panting on the great bed happily some are also not transmissible she looked up at the lady you need have no fear on that point she glanced round at the servants as she said this how much do i owe you the wife asked whatever you think fit the doctor said i have been able to do nothing perhaps you feel i deserve nothing no no not at all please the lady went to a bureau near the bed and took out a small plain purse she handed it to the doctor you really should have that arm seen to the doctor said softly while studying the other womans face and her mouth most closely it might mean no the lady said quickly looking away and then walking off to the nearest of the tall windows i am perfectly well doctor perfectly thank you for coming good day we sat in the hired chair on the way back wobbling and weaving through the crowds of land street heading for the palace i was folding away my spiced kerchief the doctor smiled sadly she had been in a thoughtful even morose mood all the way back we had left the same way we had arrived via the private dock still worried about ill humours oelph it is how i was raised mistress and it seems like a sensible precaution she sighed heavily and looked out at the people ill humours she said and seemed to be talking more to herself than to me those ill humours you talked about from insects mistress i began recalling something that my master had communicated to me hmm can they be extracted from the insects and used i mean might some assassin say be able to have made a concentrate of such insects and administer the potion to a victim i tried to look innocent the doctor had a look about her i thought i recognised usually it meant that she was about to launch into some extremely long and involved explanation concerning how some aspect of medicine worked and how all the assumptions that i might have held about the subject were completely wrong on this occasion though she seemed to fall back from the brink of such a lecture and looked away and just said no there was silence between us for a while during that time i listened to the braided canes of the chair as they creaked and cracked around us what was wrong with the lady tunchs arm mistress i asked eventually the doctor sighed it had been broken i think and then set badly she said but any sawsmith can set a bone mistress it was probably a radial fracture those are always more difficult she looked out at the milling people all walking bargaining arguing and yelling on the street but yes a rich mans wife especially one with a doctor in the family she looked round slowly at me you would think such a person would receive the best of attention wouldnt you instead of it would seem none but i began then started to understand ah ah indeed the doctor said we both watched the people for a while as our quartet of hired men carried the chair through them uphill towards the palace the doctor sighed after a while and said her jaw had been broken not long ago too it hadnt been treated either then she took the purse mistress tunch had given her out of her coat and said something that wasnt really like her at all look heres a drinking house lets go for a drink she looked at me closely do you drink oelph i dont that is im not really well i have but not she held a hand up out of the side of the chair one of the rear men shouted to those in front and we drew to an orderly halt right outside the door of the inn come on she said slapping me on the knee ill teach you the bodyguard the concubine lady perrund attended at a discreet distance by a eunuch of the harem guard took her daily constitutional as usual a little after breakfast her route that day took her to one of the higher towers on the east wing where she knew she could gain access to the roof it was a fine clear day and the view could be particularly fine looking out over the palace grounds to the spires and domes of the city of crough the plains beyond and the hills in the deep distance why dewar the chief bodyguard dewar sat in a large sheetcovered chair that was one of twenty or so pieces of furniture which had been stored in the tower room his eyes were closed his chin was resting on his chest his head jerked up he looked around and blinked the concubine perrund sat in a seat beside him her red gown bright against the dark blue of the sheet the whiteclad eunuch guard stood by the door dewar cleared his throat ah perrund he said he drew himself up in the chair and straightened his black tunic how are you pleased to see you dewar though surprised she told him smiling you looked as though you were slumbering i thought of all people the protectors chief bodyguard would be the least likely to need sleep during the day dewar glanced round at the eunuch guard the protector has given me the xamismorning off he said theres a formal breakfast for the xinkspar delegation there are guards everywhere he thinks i am surplus you think otherwise he is surrounded by men with weapons just because theyre our guards doesnt mean there isnt a threat naturally i think i ought to be there but he will not be told dewar rubbed his eyes so you became unconscious out of pique did i look asleep dewar asked innocently i was only thinking and very fast athought you looked what did you conclude that i must not answer so many questions a fine decision people do pry so and you oh i rarely think there are so many people who think or think they think better than l it would be presumptuous i meant what brings you here is this your morning walk yes i like to take the air from the roof i must remember not to position myself here next time i want to think i vary my route dewar there is no certain escape in any public part of the palace the only safe place might be within your own chambers i shall try to remember good i trust you are happy now happy why would that be there has been an attempt on the protectors life i understood you were there ah that aye that yes i was there so are you happy now the last time we talked you expressed dismay that there had been so few assassins recently taking this as incontrovertible proof that we must be entirely surrounded by them dewar smiled ruefully ah yes then no i am no happier my lady i thought not the lady perrund rose to go dewar stood as she did i understand the protector visits us in the harem later today she said will you be joining us then i imagine so good ill leave you to your thinking the lady perrund smiled then made for the door which led to the roof followed by the eunuch guard dewar watched her and the guard go then stretched and yawned the palace concubine yalde was a favourite of general yetamidous and was often called to his home in the palace grounds the girl could not speak though she appeared to have a tongue and everything else required for speech and understood imperial well enough and the local language of tassaseni a very little she had been a slave perhaps there was something that had happened to her during that time which had addled whatever part of her brains would normally have granted her the power of speech still she could whimper and moan and shout when she was being pleasured as the general never tired of telling his friends yalde sat on the same vast couch as the general in the principal receiving room of his house feeding him finger fruits from a crystal bowl while he played with her long black hair twisting and untwisting it in one large hand it was night a bell or so after a small banquet yetamidous had thrown the men still wore their dining robes present with yetamidous were ruleuin urleyns brother bredelle the protectors physician guard commander zespiole the generals duke simalg and duke ralboute and a few aides and court juniors no there are paper screens or something said ruleuin he must have burst through those it was the ceiling i tell you think it would be the best place hint of danger and whumpf straight down why you could just drop a cannon ball on whoever was causing the trouble quite easy really a fool could do it nonsense the walls zespiole should know yetamidous said interrupting ruleuin and simalg zespiole what do you have to say i wasnt there zespiole said waving a goblet around and the painted chamber was never used while i was chief bodyguard still you must know of it yetamidous said of course i know of it zespiole said he stopped waving his goblet round long enough for a passing servant to fill it with wine lots of people know of it but no one goes in there so how did dewar surprise the sea company assassin simalg asked simalg was a duke with vast lands in the east but had been one of the first of the old noble families to declare for urleyn during the war of succession he was a thin everlanguorouslooking man with long straight brown hair the ceiling was it not zespiole do tell me im right the walls ruleuin said through a painting a portrait in which the eyes had been cut out i cant say but you must simalg protested its a secret is it it is there we are yetamidous said to the others it is a secret does the protector say so or his smug saviour ralboute asked a stout but muscled man duke ralboute had been another early convert to urleyns cause you mean dewar zespiole asked does he not seem smug to you ralboute asked and drank from his goblet yes smug doctor bredelle said and too clever by half or even more and hard to pin down ralboute added pulling his dining robe more loosely over his huge frame and brushing some crumbs away try lying on him simalg suggested ill lie on you ralboute told the other noble i think not do you think dewar would lie with the protector yetamidous asked do we think he really is a lover of men or are these only rumours you never see him inside the harem ruleuin said would he be allowed bredelle asked the court physician was only allowed to make professional calls to the harem when its own female nurse could not cope chief bodyguard zespiole said yes he could pick amongst the household concubines the ones dressed in blue ah yetamidous said and stroked under the chin of the darkhaired girl at his side the household girls one level beneath my little yalde i think dewar does not make use of that particular privilege ralboute said they say he keeps the company of the concubine perrund ruleuin said the one with the wasted arm yetamidous nodded i have heard that too bredelle agreed one of urleyns own simalg looked aghast you dont mean that he has her providence the protector would make sure he could stay in the harem as long as he liked as a eunuch i cannot imagine that dewar is that foolish or so intemperate bredelle said it could only be courtly love or they could be plotting something could they not simalg suggested i hear he visits a house in the city though not often ruleuin said a house with girls yetamidous asked not boys girls ruleuin confirmed i think id ask for double fare if i were a girl who had to accommodate that fellow simalg said he has a sour smell about him have you never noticed you may have a nose for these things said doctor bredelle perhaps dewar has a special dispensation from the protector ralboute suggested a secret one which lets him bed perrund shes crippled yetamidous said yet still i think beautiful simalg said and it must be said that some people have been known to find infirmity attractive doctor bredelle added cleaving the regal lady perrund a privilege you enjoyed zespiole ralboute asked the older man sadly not zespiole said and i do not think dewar does either i suspect theirs is a meeting of minds not bodies too clever by twice simalg muttered beckoning more wine what privileges do you most miss from the post dewar now has ralboute asked looking down as he peeled a piece of fruit he shooed away a servant who offered to do this for him i miss being near the protector every day but little else it is an unnerving job a young mans job my present post is quite exciting enough without having to deal with murderous ambassadors oh come zespiole ralboute said sucking at his fruit and then spitting out a mush of seeds into a waste bowl before sucking again and swallowing he wiped his lips you must resent dewar mustnt you he usurped you zespiole was silent for a moment usurpation can be the right course sometimes duke dont you think he looked round the others we all of us usurped the old king it needed to be done absolutely said yetamidous of course ruleuin agreed mmmm bredelle nodded mouth full of a sweetmeat ralboute nodded simalg gave a sigh our protector did the usurping he said the rest of us helped and proud to do so yetamidous said slapping the edge of his couch so you dont resent the fellow at all ralboute asked zespiole you are a child of providence indeed he shook his head and used his fingers to break the flesh of another fruit i no more resent him than you ought to resent the protector zespiole said ralboute was stopped in his eating why should i resent urleyn he asked i honour urleyn and what he has done including putting us here in the palace simalg said we might have still been juniors out of favour we owe the grand aedile as much as any trader who pins his voting document what do you call it franchisement his franchisement high on his wall just so zespiole said and yet if anything was to happen to the protector providence forbid yetamidous said might not a duke such as you a person of high birth under the old regime yet who had also been a faithful general under the protectors new order be just the sort of person the people might turn to as successor or theres the boy simalg said yawning this talks uncomfortable ruleuin said no zespiole said looking at ruleuin we must be able to talk of such things those who wish tassasen and urleyn ill most certainly will not shrink from such talk you need to think of such things ruleuin you are the protectors brother people might turn to you if he was taken from us ruleuin shook his head no he said i have risen so considerably on his cloaktails people already think i have climbed too far he glanced over at ralboute who looked back with wide expressionless eyes oh yes simalg said waving a hand we dukes are frightfully against such accidents of birth wheres that housemaster yetamidous said yalde be a dear and go and fetch the musicians back would you all this talk is making my head ache we need music and songs here there there he is quick catch him catch him quickly aah too late i win i win i win you win again what cunningness in one so young perrund picked the boy up with her good arm and swung him on to the seat beside her lattens urleyns son squirmed as he was tickled then yelped and dived under a fold in the concubines gown and tried to hide there as dewar who had run most of the length of the visiting chamber of the outer harem in a vain attempt to head lattens off arrived panting and growling wheres that child he demanded gruffly child why what child could that be the lady perrund asked hand at her throat her blueflecked eyes wide ach never mind ill just have to sit down here to get my breath back after chasing the young scamp there was a giggle as dewar sat down right beside the boy whose hose and shoes stuck out from the womans robe whats this here are that rascals shoes and look dewar grabbed lattens ankle there was a muffled shriek and his leg ill bet the rest is attached yes here he is perrund pulled away the fold of her gown to let dewar tickle the boy then brought a cushion from another part of the couch and put it under the boys bottom dewar plonked him there do you know what happens to boys who win at hideandseek dewar asked lattens wideeyed shook his head and made to suck his thumb perrund gently stopped him from doing this they get dewar growled coming very close to the child sweets perrund handed him the box of crystallised fruits lattens squealed with delight and rubbed his hands together staring into the box and trying to decide which to have first eventually he grabbed a small handful huesse another redgowned concubine sat heavily down on a couch across from perrund and dewar she too had been involved in the game of hideandseek huesse was lattens aunt her sister had died giving birth to lattens towards the start of the war of succession huesse was a plumply supple woman with unruly fair ringleted hair and have you had your lessons for today lattens perrund asked yes the boy said he was small made like his father though he had the redtinged golden hair of his mother and his aunt and what did you learn today more things about equal triangles and some history about things which have happened i see perrund said settling the boys collar back down and patting his hair flat again there was this man called narajist the boy said licking his fingers free of sugar dust naharajast dewar said perrund motioned him quiet who looked in a tube at the sky and told the emperor lattens screwed up his eyes and peered up at the three glowing plaster domes lighting the chamber poeslied puiside dewar muttered perrund frowned severely and tutted there were big fiery rocks up there and watch out the boy stood and shouted the last two words then sat down again and leant over the box of sweets one finger to his lips and the emperor didnt and the rocks killed him dead well its a little simplified dewar began what a sad story perrund said now ruffling the boys hair the poor old emperor yes the boy shrugged but daddy came along and made everything all right again the three adults looked at each other and laughed indeed he did perrund said taking away the box of sweets and hiding it behind her tassasen is powerful again isnt it mmhmm lattens said trying to squirm behind perrund in pursuit of the box of sweets i think it might be time for a story perrund said and pulled the boy back to a sitting position dewar dewar sat and thought for a moment well he said its not much of a story but it is a story of sorts then tell it it is suitable for the boy huesse asked i shall make it so dewar sat forward and shifted his sword and dagger once upon a time there was a magical land where every man was a king every woman a queen each boy a prince and all girls princesses in this land there were no hungry people and no crippled people were there any poor people asked lattens that depends what you mean in a way no because they could all have any amount of riches they wanted but in a way yes for there were people who chose to have nothing their hearts desire was to be free from owning anything and they usually preferred to stay in the desert or in the mountains or the forests living in caves or trees or just wandering around some lived in the great cities where they too just roved about but wherever they chose to wander the decision was always theirs were they holy people lattens asked well in a way maybe were they all handsome and beautiful too huesse asked again that depends what you mean by beautiful dewar said apologetically perrund sighed with exasperation some people see a sort of beauty in ugliness dewar said and if everybody is beautiful there is something singular in being ugly or just plain but generally yes everybody was as beautiful as they wanted to be so many ifs and buts perrund said this sounds a very equivocal land in a way dewar smiled perrund hit him with a cushion sometimes dewar continued as people in the land brought more of it under cultivation what was the name of the land lattens interrupted oh lavishia of course anyway sometimes the citizens of lavishia would discover whole groups of people who lived a bit like the wanderers that is like the poor or holy people in their own land but who did not have the choice of living like that such people lived like that because they had to these were people who hadnt had the advantages in life the people of lavishia were used to in fact dealing with such people soon became the biggest problem the people of lavishia had what they had no war famine pestilence taxes perrund asked none and no real likelihood of the last three i feel my credulity being stretched perrund muttered so in lavishia everybody was happy huesse asked as happy as they could be dewar said people still managed to make their own unhappinesses as people always do perrund nodded now it begins to sound plausible in this land there lived two friends a boy and a girl who were cousins and who had grown up together they thought they were adults but really they were still just children they were the best of friends but they disagreed on many things one of the most important things they disagreed about was what to do when lavishia chanced upon one of these tribes of poor people was it better to leave them alone or was it better to try and make life better for them even if you decided it was the right thing to do to make life better for them which way did you do this did you say come and join us and be like us did you say give up all your own ways of doing things the gods that you worship the beliefs you hold most dear the traditions that make you who you are or do you say we have decided you should stay roughly as you are and we will treat you like children and give you toys that might make your life better indeed who even decided what was better lattens was shifting and wriggling on the couch perrund was trying to keep him still were there really not any wars the child asked yes perrund said looking concernedly at dewar this may all be a little abstract for a child of lattens age dewar smiled sadly well there were some very small wars very far away but to be brief the two friends decided that they would put their arguments to a test they had another friend a lady who very much liked both of the friends and who was very clever and very beautiful and who had a favour which she was prepared to grant either of them dewar looked at perrund and huesse either of them perrund asked with a small smile huesse looked at the floor she was broadminded dewar said and cleared his throat anyway it was agreed that the two cousins would present their arguments to her and whoever lost the argument had to leave and let the favour be granted to the other one alone did this third friend know about the cousins amusing agreement perrund inquired names what are the names lattens demanded yes what are they called huesse said the girl was called sechroom and the boys name was hiliti their beautiful friend was called leleeril dewar looked at perrund and no she did not know about the agreement tut perrund pronounced so the three met in a hunting lodge in the high high mountains as high as the breathless plains lattens asked not so high but steeper with very sharp peaks now and which cousin believed in what perrund asked hmm oh sechroom believed that one should always interfere or try to help while hiliti thought it best to leave people be dewar said anyway they had good food and fine wine and they laughed and told each other stories and jokes and the two friends sechroom and hiliti explained their different ideas to leleeril and asked which she thought was right she tried to say that they were both right in their own ways and that sometimes one was right and one wrong and sometimes the other way round but eventually sechroom and hiliti said leleeril had to choose one or the other and she chose hiliti and poor sechroom had to leave the hunting lodge what was it leeril was going to give hiliti lattens asked something sweet dewar said and magicianlike produced a crystallised fruit from his pocket he presented the sweet to the delighted boy who bit happily into it what happened huesse asked leleeril found out that her favours had been subject to a bet and she was hurt she went away for a while did she have to go away perrund asked you know the way girls in polite society sometimes have to while nature takes its course no she just wanted to be somewhere else away from everybody she knew what without her parents huesse asked sceptically without anybody then sechroom and hiliti realised that perhaps leleeril had felt more for one of them than they had imagined and that they had done a bad thing there are three emperors now lattens said suddenly munching on his sugary fruit i know their names perrund shushed him leleeril came back dewar told them but she had made new friends where she had been and she had changed while she had been away and so went away again to stay as far as is known she lived happily ever after sechroom became a soldiermissionary in the lavishian army to help fight in the very small very faraway wars a female soldier asked huesse of a sort dewar said perhaps more missionary or even spy than soldier perrund shrugged the balnimes of quarreck are said all to be warrior women dewar sat back smiling oh huesse said looking disappointed is that all she asked thats all for now dewar shrugged you mean theres more perrund said youd better tell us the suspense might be too much to bear perhaps ill tell you more some other time what about hiliti huesse asked what became of him after his cousin left dewar just smiled very well then perrund chided him be mysterious where is lavishia lattens asked i know geography far away dewar told the boy far away across the sea far away over the sea further than tyrsk much further further than the thrown isles oh a lot further than that further than drizen even further than drezen in the land of makebelieve and are the mountains sugar hills lattens asked all of them and the lakes are fruit juice and all the game animals grow on trees ready cooked and other trees grow their own treehouses and catapults and bows and arrows grow on them like fruits and i suppose the rivers run with wine huesse asked yes and the houses and the buildings and the bridges are made of diamond and gold and everything precious ive got a pet eltar lattens told dewar its called wintle want to see it certainly its in the garden in a cage ill fetch it come on lets go lattens said to huesse pulling her on to her feet probably time he had his run round the garden anyway huesse said i shall be back soon with the unruly wintle dewar and perrund watched the woman and the child leave the chamber under the watchful eyes of a whiteclad eunuch in the high pulpit now then mr dewar perrund said you have delayed long enough you must tell me all about this ambassador assassin you foiled dewar told her as much as he felt he could about what had happened he left out the details of exactly how he had been able to respond so promptly to the assassins attack and perrund was too polite to press him further what of the delegation that came with the sea companys ambassador dewar looked troubled i think they knew nothing of what he intended one of them did maybe he had charge of the drugs the assassin had taken but the rest were ignorant naive innocents who thought this was a great adventure were they sorely questioned perrund asked quietly dewar nodded he looked down at the floor only their heads are going back im told at the end they were glad to lose them perrund put her hand briefly on the mans arm then drew it away again glancing at the eunuch in the pulpit the blame lies with their masters who sent them to their deaths not with you they would not have suffered less if their plan had succeeded i know that dewar said smiling as best he could perhaps it might be called professional lack of empathy my training is to kill or disable as quickly as possible not as slowly so are you really not content perrund asked there has been an attempt and a serious one at that do you not feel this disproves your theory that there is someone here at court perhaps dewar said awkwardly perrund smiled you are not really appeased by this at all are you no dewar admitted he looked away well yes a little but more because i think i have decided you are right i will worry whatever happens and always put the worst construction on it i am unable not to worry worrying is my natural state so you should not worry about worrying so much perrund suggested a smile playing about her lips that is more or less it otherwise one might never stop most pragmatic perrund leant forward and put her chin in her hand what was the point of your story about sechroom hiliti and leleeril dewar looked awkward i dont really know he confessed i heard the story in another language it doesnt survive the translation very well and there was more than just the language that needed translation some of the ideas and ways that people do things and behave required alteration to make sense too well then you were mostly successful did your story really happen yes it really happened dewar said then sat back and laughed shaking his head no im jesting with you how could it happen search the latest globes scour the newest maps sail to the ends of the world you will not find lavishia i swear oh perrund said disappointed so you are not from lavishia how can one be from a place that does not exist but you are from mottelocci wasnt it mottelocci indeed dewar frowned i dont recall ever telling you that there are mountains there arent there it is one of the what are they called now the halfhiddens yes the halfhidden kingdoms unreachable half the year but a small paradise they say half a paradise in spring and summer and autumn it is beautiful in winter it is terrible three seasons from four would be sufficient to please most people not when the fourth season lasts longer than the other three put together did something like your story happen there perhaps were you one of the people maybe sometimes perrund said sitting back with a look of exasperation on her face i can quite understand why rulers employ torturers oh i can always understand dewar said softly just not he seemed to catch himself then sat upright pulling his tunic tighter down he looked up at the vague shadows cast on the softly glowing bowl of the light dome overhead perhaps we have time for a game of something what do you say perrund remained looking at him for a moment then sighed and also drew herself upright i say we had better play monarchs dispute it is the one game you might be suited for though there are also she said waving to a servant at a distant door liars dice and secret keep dewar sat back on the couch watching perrund as she watched the servant approach and subterfuge she added and blaggards boast and whiff of truth and travesty and the gentleman misinformant and the doctor my master has a plan for your mistress a little surprise ill bet more like a big one eh so would mine there were various other comments and whistles from round the table though nothing in retrospect that seemed much like wit what do you mean i asked feulecharo apprentice to duke walen just winked he was a stocky fellow with wild brown hair that resisted all attempts to control it save those employing shears he was polishing a pair of boots while the rest of us tucked into our evening meal in a tent on the prospect plain one day into the th circuition on this first rest stop it was traditional for the senior pages and apprentices to dine together feulecharo had been allowed to join us by his master but he was being punished for one of his regular misdemeanours with extra work hence the boots and a set of rustily ancient ceremonial armour he was supposed to polish before we set off the next day what sort of plan i insisted what can the duke want with the doctor lets just say hes suspicious feulecharo said tapping his nose with a polishing brush of what my master is suspicious too unoure said breaking a piece of bread in half and smearing some gravy round his plate how very true drawled epline page to guard commander adlain well he is unoure insisted sullenly still testing out his new ideas on you is he unoure one of the other pages called he turned to the others we saw unoure in the baths once aye it would be the once what year was that we did continued the page and you should see the lads scars i tell you nolieti is a perfect beast to him he teaches me everything unoure said standing up his eyes bright with tears shut up unoure jollisce said dont let this rabble bait you so slight but elegantly fair and older than most of us jollisce was page to duke ormin who was the doctors employer after the mifeli trading family and before the king commandeered her services unoure sat down again muttering under his breath what plans feulecharo jollisce asked never mind feulecharo said he started whistling and began to pay uncharacteristically close attention to the boots he was polishing and soon started to talk to them as though trying to persuade them to clean themselves that boy is intolerable jollisce said and took up a pitcher of the watered wine which was the strongest drink we were allowed a little after supper jollisce and i wandered along one edge of the camp hills stretched ahead of us and on both sides behind us past the lip of the prospect plain xamis was still slowly setting in a fiery riot of colour somewhere far beyond the nearcircle of crater lake falling over the round edge of sea clouds caught half in xamiss dying light and half in the late morning glare of seigen were lit with gold on one side and red ochre vermilion orange scarlet a wide wilderness of colours we walked amongst the settling animals as each was quieted some the hauls mostly had a bag over their heads the better mounts had elegant eyemuffs while the best had their own travelling stables and lesser beasts merely warranted a blindfold made of whatever rag came to hand one by one they folded themselves to the ground and prepared to sleep jollisce and i walked among them jollisce smoking a long pipe he was my oldest and best friend from the time when i had briefly been in the service of the duke before being sent to haspide probably its nothing he said feulecharo likes to listen to himself talk and he likes to pretend he knows something everybody else doesnt i wouldnt worry about it but if you think you ought to report it to your mistress then of course you must do so hmm i said i recall looking back on that earlier self from this more mature vantage point that i was not sure what to do duke walen was a powerful man and a schemer he was not the sort of man somebody like the doctor could afford to have as an enemy and yet i had to think of my own real master as well as my mistress should i tell neither of them or one if so which or both listen jollisce said stopping and turning to me and it seemed to me hed waited until there was nobody else around before he divulged this last piece of intelligence if its any help i have heard that walen might have sent somebody to equatorial cuskery cuskery yes do you know of it sort of its a port isnt it port citystate sea company sanctuary lair of sea monsters if you believe some people but the point is its about the furthest north people come in any numbers from the southern lands and they supposedly have quite a number of embassies and legations there yes well apparently one of duke walens men has been sent to cuskery to look for somebody from drezen from drezen i said then lowered my voice as jollisce frowned and looked about us over the sleeping bodies of the great animals but why i cant imagine jollisce said how long does it take to get to cuskery it takes nearly a year to get there the journey is somewhat quicker coming back they say he shrugged the winds thats a long way to send somebody i said wondering i know jollisce said he sucked on his pipe my man assumed it was some trade thing you know people are always expecting to make their fortunes from spices or potions or new fruits or something if they can get stuff past the sea companies and avoid the storms but well my master came by some information that indicated walens fellow was looking for just one person oh hmm jollisce stood and faced the xamisset his face made ruddy by the glow of flamecoloured cloud in the west good sunset he said drawing deep on his pipe very i agreed not really looking best ones were just around the time the empire fell of course didnt you think hmm oh yes naturally providences recompense for the sky falling in on us jollisce mused frowning into the bowl of his pipe hmm yes who to tell i thought who to tell master the doctor attended the king in his tent each day during the circuition from haspide to yvenir because our monarch was afflicted with an aching back the doctor sat on the side of the bed king quience lay upon if its really that sore sir you should rest it she told him rest the king said turning over on to his front how can i rest this is the circuition you idiot if i rest so does everybody else and then by the time we get to the summer palace itll be time to come back again well the doctor said pulling the kings shift up out of his riding breeches to expose his broad muscled back you might lie on your back in a carriage sir that would hurt too he said into his pillow it might hurt a little sir but it would quickly become better sitting on a mount will only make it worse those carts they sway all over the place and the wheels bang down into holes and ruts these roads are much worse than they were last year im sure wiester sir the fat chamberlain said quickly stepping out of the shadows to the kings side have somebody find out whose responsibility this bit of road is are the appropriate taxes being collected if they are are they being spent on it and if not where are they going at once sir wiester bustled off leaving the tent you cant trust dukes to levy taxes properly vosill the king sighed at any rate you cant trust their tax collectors they have too damn much authority far too many tax collectors have bought themselves baronies for my liking indeed sir the doctor said yes ive been thinking i might set up some sort of more town or citysized umm authority sir yes yes authority a council of responsible citizens perhaps just to oversee the roads and city walls and so on at first things they might care about more than dukes who only bother about their own houses and how much game is in their parks im sure thats a very good idea sir yes im sure it is too the king looked round at the doctor you have them dont you councils sir yes im sure youve mentioned them probably comparing our own backward arrangements unfavourably i dont doubt would i do that sir oh i think you would vosill our arrangements do seem to produce comfortable roads i would certainly claim that but then the king said glumly if i take power from the barons theyll get upset well make them all archdukes sir or give them some other awards the king thought about this what other awards i dont know sir you might invent some yes i might the king said but then if i go giving power to the peasants or the tradespeople and so on theyll only want more the doctor continued to massage the kings back we do say that prevention is better than cure sir she told him the time to look after the body is before there is anything wrong with it the time to rest is before you feel too tired to do anything else and the time to eat is before hunger consumes you the king frowned as the doctors hands moved over his body how i wish it was all so easy he said with a sigh i think the body must be a simple thing in comparison to a state if it can be maintained on the basis of such platitudes the doctor i thought looked a little hurt by this then i am glad that my concern is for the health of your body sir not that of your country i am my country the king said sternly though with an expression which belied his tone then be glad sir that your kingdom is in a better state than its king who will not lie in a carriage like a sensible monarch would dont treat me like a child vosill the king said loudly twisting round towards her ow he said grimacing and collapsed back again what you dont realise vosill he said through gritted teeth being a woman i suppose is that in a carriage you have less room for manoeuvre they take up the whole road you see a man on a mount why he can negotiate his way around all the irregularities on the road surface i see sir nevertheless it is a fact that you are spending the whole day in the saddle bouncing up and down and compressing the small pads between your vertebrae and forcing them into the nerve thats what is making your spine hurt lying in a carriage almost no matter how much it shakes and bounces will certainly be better for you look vosill the king said in an exasperated tone levering himself up on one elbow and looking round at the doctor how do you think it would look if the king took to a pleasuring couch and laid amongst the perfumed pillows of a ladies carriage like some porcelainarsed concubine what sort of monarch could do that eh dont be ridiculous he laid carefully back on his front again i take it your father never did such a thing sir no he the king began then looked suspiciously back at the doctor before continuing no he didnt of course not he rode and i will ride i shall ride and make my back sore because thats whats expected of me you shall make my back better because thats whats expected of you now do your job doctor and stop this damned prattling providence preserve me from the wittering of women aow will you be careful i have to find out where it hurts sir well youve found it now do what youre supposed to do which is make it stop hurting wiester wiested another servant came forward hes just stepped out sir music the king said i want music fetch the musicians sir the servant turned to go the king snapped his fingers bringing the servant back sir and wine sir what a beautiful sunset dont you think oelph yes mistress providences recompense for the sky falling in upon us i said recalling jollisces phrase i was sure it was one hed heard from somebody else anyway i suppose its something the doctor agreed we were sitting on the broad front bench of the covered wagon which had become our home i had been counting i had slept in the carriage for eleven of the last sixteen days the other five i had been billeted with the other senior pages and apprentices in buildings in one of the towns we had camped within and i would probably sleep in it again for another seven days out of the next ten until we reached the city of lepskatacheis where we would stop for half a moon thereafter the wagon would be my home for eighteen days out of twentyone until we reached yvenage perhaps nineteen out of twentytwo if we encountered difficulties on the hill roads and were delayed the doctor looked away from the sunset gazing up the road which was lined with tall trees standing in sandy earth on both sides an orangebrown haze hung in the air above the swaying tops of the grander carriages ahead are we nearly there yet very nearly mistress this is the longest days travel on either leg the scouts should be in sight of the camp ground and the forward party ought to have the tents erected and the field kitchens set up it is a long draw but they say the way to look at it is as saving a day ahead of us on the road were the grand carriages and covered wagons of the royal household immediately in front of us were two hauls their broad shoulders and rumps swaying from side to side the doctor had refused a driver she wanted to take the whip herself though she used it little this meant that we had to feed and care for the beasts ourselves each evening i did not appreciate this though my fellow pages and apprentices certainly did so far the doctor had taken on a much higher proportion of this menial work than id expected but i resented doing any of it at all and found it hard to believe that she could not see she was exposing both of us to ridicule by taking on such a degrading task she was looking at the sunset again the light caught the edge of her cheek outlining it in a colour like that of red gold her hair falling loose across her shoulders was glossily radiant with highlights like spun ruby were you still in drezen when the rocks fell from the sky mistress hmm oh yes i didnt leave until about two years later she seemed lost in thought and her expression suddenly melancholy did you come by way of cuskery by any chance mistress why yes oelph i did the doctor said her expression lightening as she turned to me youve heard of it vaguely i said my mouth had gone quite dry while i wondered whether to say anything about what i had heard from walens page and jollisce umm is it far from there to here the voyage is a good half a year the doctor said nodding she smiled up at the sky a very hot place lush and steamy and full of ruined temples and various odd animals that have the run of the place because they are held to be sacred by some ancient sect or another the air is saturated with the smell of spices and when i was there there was a full night when xamis and seigen had both long set almost together and gidulph jairly and foy were in the day sky and iparine was eclipsed by the world itself and for a bell or so there was only the starlight to shine on the sea and the city and the animals all howled into the darkness and the waves i could hear from my room sounded very loud though it was not really dark just silver people stood in the streets very quiet looking at the stars as though relieved to find their existence was not a myth i wasnt in the street just then i was id met a terribly nice sea company captain that day very handsome she said and sighed in that instant she was like a young girl and i a jealous youth did your ship go straight from there to here oh no there were four voyages after cuskery to alyle on the sea company barquentine face of fairly she said and smiled broadly staring ahead then from there to fuollah on a trireme of all things a farossi vessel eximperial navy then overland to osk and from there to illerne by an argosy out of xinkspar finally to haspide on a galliot of the mifeli clan traders it all sounds most romantic mistress she gave what looked like a sad smile it was not without its privations and indignities on occasion she said tapping at the top of her hoot and once or twice this old dagger was drawn but yes looking back it was very romantic she took a deep breath and let it out then swivelled and looked up into the skies shading her eyes from seigen fairly has not yet risen mistress i said quietly and was surprised at the coldness i felt she looked at me oddly some sense returned to me no matter that since my fever in the palace when she had said that we ought to be friends she was still my mistress and i was still her servant as well as her apprentice and as well as a mistress i had a master probably nothing i could find out from the doctor would be new to him for he had many sources but i could not be sure and so i supposed i had an obligation to him to find out all i could from her in case some small piece of it might prove useful was that i mean taking the mifeli clan ship from illerne to haspide how you came to be employed by the mifelis no that was just coincidence i helped around the seamens infirmary for a while after i first landed before one of the younger mifelis needed treatment on a homebound ship it had signalled ahead to the sentry isles the mifelis own doctor then suffered terribly from seasickness and would not go out on the cutter to meet the galleon i was recommended to prelis mifeli by the infirmarys head surgeon so i went instead the boy lived the ship came in and i was made the mifeli headfamily doctor right there on the docks old man mifeli doesnt waste time making decisions and their old doctor pensioned off she shrugged i watched the rear end of the two hauls for a while one of them shat copiously the steaming shit disappeared under our wagon but not before wreathing us in its vapours dear me what an awful smell the doctor said i bit my tongue this was one of the reasons that people who were in a position to do so usually kept as much distance between themselves and beasts of burden as they could mistress may i ask you a question she hesitated for a moment you have been asking me various questions already oelph she said and graced me with a sly amused look i take it you mean may you ask me a question that may be impertinent umm ask away young oelph i can always pretend i didnt hear you i was just wondering mistress i said feeling most awkward and very warm all of a sudden why you left drezen ah she said and taking up the whip waggled it over the yokes of the two hauls barely tickling their necks with the end of it she looked briefly at me partly the urge to have an adventure oelph just the desire to go somewhere nobody i knew had been before and partly partly to get away to forget somebody she smiled brightly dazzlingly at me for a moment before looking away up the road again i had an unhappy love affair oelph and i am stubborn and proud having made up my mind to leave and having announced that i would travel to the other ends of the world i could not i would not back down and so i hurt myself twice once by falling for the wrong person and then a second time by being too obstinate even in a more temperate mood to retreat from a commitment made in a fury of injured pride was this the person who gave you the dagger mistress i asked already hating and envying the man no she said with a sort of snorting laugh which i thought was most unladylike i had been wounded by him quite enough without carrying such a token of his she gazed down at the dagger sheathed as usual in the top of her right boot the dagger was a gift from the state some of the decoration on the dagger was given to me by another friend one i used to have terrible arguments with a doubleedged gift what was it you argued about mistress lots of things or lots of aspects of the same thing whether the might beyond might had a right to impose its values on others she looked at my puzzled expression and laughed we argued about here for one thing here mistress i asked looking around about she seemed to catch herself then said about haspide the empire about this whole other hemisphere she shrugged i wont bore you with the details in the end i left and he stayed though i did hear later that he too sailed away some time after i did do you regret coming here now mistress no she said smiling for most of the voyage to cuskery i did but the equator signalled a change as they say it often does and since then no i still miss my family and friends but i am not sorry now that i made the decision do you think you will ever go back mistress i have no idea oelph her expression was troubled and hopeful at once then she produced another smile for me i am the doctor to the king after all i would consider that i have not done my job properly if he would let me leave i may be forced to look after him until hes an old man or until he grows displeased with me because i grow whiskers on my lips and my hair thins on my head and my breath smells and he has my head chopped off because i interrupt him once too often then you might have to become his doctor oh mistress was all i could say i dont know oelph she confided in me im not so sure about making plans ill wait and see which way fate takes me if providence or whatever we wish to call it has me stay then ill stay if it somehow calls me back to drezen ill go she dipped her head towards me and with what she probably thought was a conspiratorial look said who knows my destiny might lead me back through equatorial cuskery i might get to see my handsome sea company captain again she winked at me was the land of drezen much affected by the rocks from the sky mistress i asked she did not seem to heed my tone which i had worried might seem excessively frosty more than here in haspidus she said but much less than the inlands of the empire one city on a far northern island was washed almost entirely away by a wave killing ten or more thousand people and some ships were lost and of course the crop yields all over were down for a couple of growing seasons so the farmers moaned but then the farmers always do no we escaped relatively lightly do you think it was the work of the gods mistress there axe those who say that providence was punishing us for something or perhaps just punishing the empire others hold that it was the work of the old gods and that they are coming back what do you think i think it could be any of those things oelph the doctor said thoughtfully though there are some people in drezen philosophers who have a much more bleak explanation mind you which is what mistress that such things happen for no reason at all no reason no reason beyond the workings of pure chance i thought about this do they not think that there is good and bad and that one deserves to be emulated and the other not but rather punished a very small number would say that there are no such entities most agree there are but that they only exist in our minds the world itself without us does not recognise such things just because they are not things they are ideas and the world contained no ideas until people came along so they believe that man was not created with the world thats right or at least not people with wits are they then seigenists do they believe that the lesser sun created us some would say it did they would claim that people were once no more than animals and that we too used to fall asleep promptly when xamis set and rise when it rose some believe that all we are is light that the light of xamis holds the world together like an idea like a hugely complicated dream and the light of seigen is the very expression of us as thinking beings i tried to comprehend this curious concept and was just starting to decide that it was not so different from normal beliefs when the doctor asked suddenly what do you believe in oelph her face turned to me was the colour of the soft tawny dusk seigenlight caught fallen wisps of her halfcurled red hair what why what all other civil people believe mistress i said before thinking that perhaps she coming from drezen where they obviously had some odd ideas might believe something quite different that is to say what people hereabouts that is in haspidus yes but what do you personally believe i frowned at her an expression such a graceful gentle face did not deserve to have directed at it did the doctor really imagine that everybody went around believing different things one believed what one was told to believe what it made sense to believe unless one was a foreigner of course or a philosopher i believe in providence mistress but when you say providence do you really mean god no mistress i dont believe in any of the old gods no one does any more no one of sense at any rate providence is the rule of laws mistress i said i was trying not to insult her by sounding as though i was talking to a child i had experienced aspects of the doctors naïveté before and ascribed it to simple ignorance of the manner in which matters were organised in what was to her a foreign land but even after the best part of a year it appeared there were still subjects that each of us assumed we viewed in a mutual light and from a similar perspective which in fact we saw quite differently the laws of nature determine the ordering of the physical world and the laws of man determine the ordering of society mistress hmm she said with an expression that might have been simply thoughtful or tinged with scepticism one set of laws grows out of the other as do plants from the common clay i added remembering something id been taught in natural philosophy my determined and strenuous endeavours to take in absolutely nothing of what i had regarded as entirely the most irrelevant part of my schooling had patently not met with total success which is not so dissimilar to the light of xamis ordering the major part of the world and that of seigen illuminating the human she mused staring towards the sunset again i suppose not mistress i agreed struggling to follow ha she said all very interesting yes mistress i said dutifully adlain duke walen a pleasure as ever welcome to my humble tent please walen adlain a some wine what about food have you eaten w a glass thank you a wine ill take some too thank you epline so you are well w well enough you a fine w i wonder could you a what epline yes of course epline would you ill call now then walen there is nobody else here w hmm very well this doctor vosill a still her eh dear duke this is becoming an obsession do you really find her that interesting perhaps you ought to tell her she may prefer older men w mocking the wisdom that comes with age is a fit sport only for those who expect never to attain much of it themselves adlain you know the substance of my complaint a i regret i dont duke w but you have told me of your own doubts did you not have her writing checked in case it was a code or something similar a i thought about it i decided not to directly w well perhaps you should directly she is a witch or a spy one of the two a i see and what strange old gods or other demons do you think she serves or which master w i do not know we will not know unless we put her to the question a ahha would you like to see that happen w i know it is unlikely while she retains the kings favour though that might not last for ever in any event there are ways she might simply disappear and be questioned informally as it were a nolieti w i have not discussed this with him as such but i have already ascertained most reliably that he would be more than happy to oblige he suspects strongly that she released through death one of those he was questioning a yes he mentioned that to me w did you think to do anything a i told him he should be more careful w hmm at any rate she might be discovered in such a manner though that would be somewhat risky and she would have to be killed thereafter anyway working to force her from the kings favour might take longer and could pressing the matter as one may have to entail risks which were hardly less than those attached to the former course of action a obviously you have given the matter considerable thought w of course but if she was to be taken without the kings knowledge the help of the guard commander might be crucial a it might mightntit w so would you help a in what way w provide the men perhaps a i think not we might have one lot of the palace guard fighting their fellows and that would never do w well then otherwise a otherwise w damn it man you know what i must mean a blind eyes gaps in rosters that sort of thing w yes that a sins of omission rather than commission w expressed however you wish it is the acts or lack of them i would know about a then perhaps w no more merely perhaps a were you thinking of doing this in close proximity to the present dear duke w perhaps a ha now you see unless you w i dont mean today or tomorrow i am looking for an understanding that should it become necessary such a plan might be put into effect with as little delay as possible a then if i was convinced of the urgency of the cause it might w good that is better at last providence you are the most a but i would have to believe that the safety of the monarch was threatened doctor vosill is a personal appointee of the king to move against her might be seen as moving against our beloved quience himself his health is in her hands perhaps as much as it is in mine i do my modest best to keep at bay assassins and others who might wish the king ill while she combats the illnesses that come from within w yes yes i know she is close he depends on her it is already too late to act before her influence achieves its zenith we might only work to hasten the descent but by then it might be too late a you think that she means to kill the king or influence him or does she merely spy reporting to another power w her brief might include all of those depending a or none w you seem less concerned in this than i imagined adlain she has come from the ends of the world entered the city barely two years ago doctored to one merchant and one noble both briefly and then suddenly shes closer to our king than anybody else providence a wife would spend less time with him a yes one might wonder whether she performs any of the more intimate duties of a wife w hmm i think not to bed ones physician is unusual but that only arises from the unnaturalness of having a woman claiming to be a doctor in the first place but no i have seen no sign why do you know a i merely wondered if you knew w hmm a of course she does seem to be a rather good doctor at the very least she has done the king no obvious harm and that in my experience is far more than one might reasonably expect from a court physician perhaps we should leave her alone for now while we have nothing more definite than your suspicions however reliable they have proved in the past w we might will you have her watched a well no more than at present w hmm and besides i have another investment in the truth or otherwise of her story that may yet yield her a you do how so w i shall not trouble you with the details but i have my doubts concerning certain of her claims and hope presently to bring before the king one who can discredit her and show her to have borne false witness to him it is a longterm investment but it should bear interest during our time at the summer palace or if not then shortly thereafter a i see well we must hope that you do not lose your capital can you tell me what form it takes w oh it is the coin of man and land and tongue but i must hold mine ill say no more a i think i shall have more wine will you join me w thank you no i have other matters to attend to a allow me w thank you ah my old bones at least i am able to ride though next year i may take carriage i thank providence the way back is easier and that we are not far from lep now a im sure in the hunt you can outjump men half your age duke w i am sure i cannot but your flattery is still gratifying good day a good day duke epline all this i copied with a few deletions to make the narrative less tedious from the part of the doctors journal written in imperial i never did show it to my master could she have overheard all this it seems inconceivable the guard commander adlain had his own physician and im sure he never once called upon the doctors services what would she have been doing anywhere near his tent could they have been lovers and she was hiding under some bed covers all the time that seems no more likely i was with her almost all of the time every single day also she confided in me sincerely i am convinced she simply did not like adlain indeed she felt threatened by him how could she suddenly have tumbled into bed with a man she feared never giving the remotest sign before that she desired to or afterwards that she had i know that illicit lovers can be ingenious in the extreme and suddenly find within themselves reserves of guile and the ability to act that even they did not until then know they possessed but to imagine the doctor and the guard commander in such a sexual conspiracy is surely to draw the bow one notch too far was epline the source did she have some sort of hold over him i do not know they seemed not really to know each other but who can tell they may have been lovers but the same unlikeliness attaches to that liaison as does to that of her and adlain i cannot think who else could have heard all of this it did occur to me that she might have made it all up that what she wrote here constituted her darkest imaginings regarding what others in the court might be planning for her yet somehow that too does not feel right either in the end i am left with something that i am certain reflects a genuine conversation but with no clear idea how the doctor came by it but there we are some things never do make perfect sense there must be some explanation and it is perhaps a little like the doctrine of the perfect partner we must be content to know that she exists somewhere in the world and try not to care overmuch that we will probably never meet her we arrived without incident at the city of lepskatacheis on the morning after we arrived the doctor and i went to the kings chambers before the business of the day was due to start as usual on such occasions the kings business and much of the courts comprised of hearing certain legal disputes which had been deemed too complicated or too important for the city authorities and the marshal to decide upon according to my experience gained during the three previous years i had travelled this way such sitting in judgment was not a function of his responsibilities the king relished the kings chambers were on a corner of the citymarshals palace overlooking the reflecting terraces of the pools which led down towards the distant river swifts and darts played in the warm air outside wheeling and tumbling beyond the cool stone of the balcony balustrades the chamberlain wiester let us in fussing as usual oh are you on time was there the bell or a cannon i did not hear the bell did you a few moments ago the doctor told him following him across the reception room to the kings dressing chamber providence he said and opened the doors ah the good doctor vosill the king exclaimed he was standing on a small stool in the centre of the great dressing chamber being dressed in his ceremonial judicial robes by four servants one wall of plaster windows south facing flooded the room with soft creamy light duke ormin stood nearby tall and slightly stooped and dressed in judicial robes how are you today the king asked i am well your majesty a very good morning to you doctor vosill duke ormin said smiling duke ormin was ten or so years older than the king he was a lankylegged sort of a fellow with a very broad head and a surprisingly large torso which always looked to me at least stuffed as though he had a couple of pillows forced up his shirt an oddlooking fellow then but most civil and kind as i knew myself having been briefly in his employ though at a fairly menial level the doctor too had been retained by him more recently when she had been his personal physician before she had become the kings duke ormin the doctor said bowing ah the king said and i was favoured with a your majesty usually i am lucky to escape with a sir i beg the kings pardon the doctor said bowing now to him granted quience said putting back his head and letting a couple of servants gather his blond curls together and pin a skull cap in place i am obviously in a magnanimous mood this morning wiester sire inform the good lord judges i shall be joining that i am in such a good mood they will have to be certain to be at their most sourly pitiless in court this morning to provide a balance for my irrepressible leniency take heed ormin duke ormin beamed his eyes almost disappearing as his face screwed up in a grin wiester hesitated then started to make for the door at once sire wiester sire i was joking ah ha ha the chamberlain laughed the doctor put her bag down on a seat near the door yes doctor the king asked the doctor blinked you asked me to attend you this morning sir did i the king looked mystified yes last night this was true oh so i did the king looked surprised as his arms were raised and a sleeveless black robe edged in some shiningly white fur was placed over his shoulders and fastened he flexed shifting his weight from stockinged foot to stockinged foot clenching his fists executing a sort of rolling motion with his shoulders and his head and then declaring you see ormin i am becoming quite forgetful in my old age why now sir you have barely left your youth the duke told him if you go calling yourself old as though by royal decree what must we think who are significantly older than you and yet who still fondly harbour the belief that we are not yet old have mercy please very well the king agreed with a roll of the hand i declare myself young again and well he added with a renewed look of surprise as he glanced at the doctor and me why i seem to be quite bereft of any aches and pains for you to treat this morning doctor oh the doctor shrugged well thats good news she said picking up her bag and turning for the door ill bid you good day then sir ah the king said suddenly we each turned again sir the king looked most thoughtful for a moment then shook his head no doctor i can think of nothing with which to detain you you may go i shall call you when i need you next of course sir wiester opened the doors for us doctor the king said as we were in the doorway duke ormin and i go hunting this afternoon i usually fall off my mount or get torn up by a barb bush so i may well have something for you to treat later duke ormin laughed politely and shook his head i shall start to prepare the relevant potions now the doctor said your majesty providence twice the bodyguard am i so trusted now or i am probably because i am regarded as being beyond the interest of any but the most desperate of men or because the general does not intend to visit me again and so careful dewar grabbed at perrunds arm just as she was about to step from the streetside into the path of a tenteam of mounts hauling a war carriage he pulled her back towards him as first the panting sweatlathered team and then the great swaying bulk of the cannonwagon itself raced past shaking the cobblestones beneath their feet a smell of sweat and oil rolled over them he felt her draw away from it all pressing her back against his chest behind him the stone counter of a butchers shop dug into his back the noise of the wagons manhigh wheels resounded between the cracked uneven walls of the two and threestorey buildings leaning over the street on top of the huge black gun carriage a bombardier uniformed in the colours of duke ralboute stood lashing wildly at the mounts the wagon was followed by two smaller carriages full of men and wooden cases these in turn were trailed by a ragged pack of shouting children the wagons thundered through the open gates set within the inner citys walls and disappeared from view people on the street who had shrunk back from the speeding vehicles flowed back into the thoroughfare again muttering and shaking their heads dewar let perrund go and she turned to him he realised with a flush of embarrassment that in his instinctive reaction to the danger he had taken hold of her by the withered arm the memory of its touch through the sleeve of her gown the sling and the fold of her cloak seemed imprinted in the bones of his hand as something thin fragile and childlike im sorry he said blurting the words she was still very close to him she stepped away smiling uncertainly the hood of her cloak had fallen revealing her laceveiled face and her golden hair which was gathered inside a black net she drew the hood back up oh dewar she chided you save somebodys life and then you apologise you really are oh i dont know she said readjusting the hood dewar had time to be surprised he had never known the lady perrund lost for words the hood she was struggling with fell back again caught by a gust of wind damn thing she said taking hold of it with her good arm and pulling it back once more he had started to put his hand up to help her with the hood but now had to let his hand fall back there she said thats better here ill take your arm now let us walk dewar checked the street and then they crossed it carefully avoiding the small piles of animal dung a warm wind blew up between the buildings lifting whirls of straw from the cobblestones perrund held dewars arm with her good hand her forearm laid lightly on his in dewars other hand he held a cane basket she had asked him to carry for her when theyd left the palace obviously i am not fit to be let out by myself she told him i have spent far too long in rooms and courtyards and on terraces and lawns everywhere in fact where there is no traffic any larger or more threatening than a eunuch with an urgently needed tray of scented waters i didnt hurt you did i dewar asked glancing at her no but if you had i think i might still count it better than being mangled beneath the iron wheels of a piece of siege artillery proceeding at a charge where do you think they are going in such a hurry well they wont go anywhere very far at that rate the mounts already looked half exhausted and that was before theyd left the city i imagine that was a show for the locals but they will be heading for ladenscion eventually i imagine is the war begun then what war my lady the war against the troublesome barons of ladenscion dewar i am not an idiot dewar sighed and looked around checking that nobody in the street was paying them too close attention it is not officially begun yet he said putting his lips close to the hood of her cloak she turned towards him and he smelled her perfume sweet and musky but i think one might safely say it is inevitable how far away is ladenscion she asked they ducked under displays of fruit hanging outside a grocers about twenty days ride to the border hills will the protector have to go himself i really couldnt say dewar she said softly with what sounded like disappointment he sighed and looked around again i shouldnt think so he said he has much to do here and there are more than enough generals for the job it it shouldnt take too long you sound unconvinced do i they stopped at a side street to let a small herd of hauls pass heading for the auction grounds i seem to be in a minority of one in thinking the war suspicious suspicious perrund sounded amused the barons complaints and their stubbornness their refusal to negotiate seem disproportionate you think theyre inviting war for its own sake yes well not just for its own sake only a madman would do that but for some further reason than the desire to assert their independence from tassasen but what else could their motive be it is not their motive that troubles me then whose someone behind them they are being encouraged to make war it feels so to me but i am just a bodyguard the protector is cloistered with his generals now and believes he needs neither my presence nor my opinion and i am grateful for your company but i had formed the impression the protector valued your counsel it is most valued when it most closely accords with his own view dewar you are not jealous are you she stopped and turned to him he looked into her face shaded and half hidden by the hood of the cloak and the thin veil her skin seemed to glow in that darkness like a hoard of gold at the back of a cave maybe i am he admitted with a bashful grin or perhaps i am once again exercising my duties in areas which are inappropriate as in our game as in our game they turned together and walked on she took his arm again well then who do you think might be behind the vexatious barons kizitz breistler velfasse any one or combination of our three claimant emperors kizitz will make mischief wherever he can breistler has a claim to part of ladenscion itself and might seek to offer his forces as compromise occupants to keep the barons and our armies apart velfasse has his eye on our eastern provinces drawing our forces to the west might be a feint faross would like the thrown isles back and may have a similar strategy then theres haspidus haspidus she said i thought king quience supported urleyn it may suit him to be seen to support urleyn for now but haspidus lies behind beyond ladenscion it would be easier for quience to provide the barons with materiel than anybody else and you think quience opposes the protector out of regal principle because urleyn dared to kill a king quience knew the old king he and beddun were as close to being friends as two kings can be so there might be something of the personal in his animosity but even without that quience is no fool and he has no pressing problems to occupy him at the moment he has the luxury of time to think long and the brains to know that urleyns example cannot go unopposed for ever if he wishes to pass on the crown to his heirs but quience has no children yet does he none that are regarded as mattering and he has yet to decide who to marry but even if he was concerned only for his own reign he might still want to see the protectorate fail dear me i had no idea we were quite so surrounded by enemies im afraid we are my lady ah here we are the old stonebuilt building across the crowded street from them was the paupers hospital it was here perrund had wanted to come with her basket of foods and medicines my old home she said staring over the heads of the people a small troop of colourfully dressed soldiers appeared round a corner and came marching down the street attended by a boy drummer at their head tearful women to each side and capering children behind everybody turned to look except perrund her gaze remained fixed on the worn stained stones of the old hospital across the street dewar looked this way and that have you been back since he asked no but i have kept in touch i have sent them some little things in the past i thought it would be amusing to deliver them myself this time oh what are those the troop of soldiers was passing in front of them the soldiers wore bright red and yellow uniforms and polished metal hats each carried a long woodmounted metal tube slung slanted across their shoulders and waving in the air above their gleaming helmets musketeers my lady dewar told her and that is duke simalgs banner at their head ah these are the musket guns i have heard about them dewar watched the troop pass with a troubled distracted look urleyn wont have them in the palace he said eventually they can be useful on the battlefield the sound of the beating drum faded the street filled again with its ordinary commerce a gap opened in the traffic of carts and carriages between them and the hospital and dewar thought they would take advantage of it but perrund lingered on the pavement her hand clutching at his forearm while she stared at the ornate and timestained stonework of the ancient building dewar cleared his throat will there be anybody there from when you were the present matron was a nurse when i was here its her ive corresponded with still she did not move were you here long only ten days or so it was only five years ago but it seems much longer she kept staring at the building dewar was not sure what to say it must have been a difficult time from what he had succeeded in teasing from her over the past few years dewar knew that perrund had been brought here suffering from a terrible fever she and eight of her sisters brothers and cousins had been refugees from the war of succession during which urleyn had taken control of tassasen following the fall of the empire travelling from the southlands where the fighting had been worst they had made for crough along with a large part of the rest of the population of tassasens south the family had been traders in a market town but most of them had been killed by the kings forces when they had taken the town from urleyns troops the generals men had retaken it with urleyn at their head but by then perrund and her few remaining relatives were on the road for the capital they had all contracted some form of plague on the journey and only a hefty bribe had got them through the city gates at all the least sick of them had driven their wagon to one of the old royal parks where refugees could camp and the last of their money had paid for a doctor and medicines most of them had died then perrund had been found a place in the paupers hospital she had come close to death but then recovered when she had gone in search of the rest of her family her quest had ended at the lime pits beyond the city walls where people had been buried hundreds at a time she had thought of killing herself then but was afraid to and besides considered that as providence had seen fit to have her recover from the plague perhaps she was not meant to die quite yet there was anyway a general feeling that the worst of times might be over the war had ended the plague had all but disappeared and order had returned to crough and was returning to the rest of tassasen perrund had helped out at the hospital sleeping on the floor of one of the great open wards where people wept and shouted and moaned throughout the day and night she had begged for food in the street and she had turned down many an offer that would have let her buy food and comfort with her sex but then a eunuch of the palace harem urleyns now that the old king was dead had visited the hospital the doctor who had found perrund a place in the hospital had told a friend at court that she was a great beauty and once she had been persuaded to clean her face and put on a dress the eunuch had thought her suitable so she was recruited to the languid opulence of the harem and became a frequent choice of the protector what would have seemed like a restrictive kind of luxury even a sort of wellfurnished prison to the young woman she had been a year earlier when she and her family were living together and peaceably in their prosperous little market town she saw instead after the war and everything that had come with it as a blessed sanctuary then had come the day when urleyn and various of his court favourites including some of his concubines were to be painted by a famous artist the artist brought with him a new assistant who turned out to have a mission of rather more serious intent than simply helping to fix urleyns and the others likenesses in paint and only perrund throwing herself between his knife and urleyn had saved the protectors life shall we dewar asked when perrund still had not moved from the pavement she looked at him as though she had forgotten he was there then she smiled from the depths of the hood yes she said yes lets she held his arm tightly as they crossed the street tell me more about lavishia where oh lavishia let me think well now in lavishia everybody is able to fly like birds lattens asked just like birds dewar confirmed they can leap from cliffs and tall buildings of which there are a great many in lavishia or they can just run along the street and jump into the air and soar away up into the sky do they have wings they do have wings but they are invisible wings can they fly to the suns not on their own to fly to the suns they have to use ships ships with invisible sails dont they burn in the heat of the suns not the sails theyre invisible and the heat goes straight through them but the wooden hulls scorch and blacken and burst into flame if they go too close of course how far is it to the suns i dont know but people say that they are different distances away and some clever people claim that they are both very far away indeed these would be the same clever people called mathematicians who tell us the world is a ball and not flat perrund said they would dewar confirmed a travelling troupe of shadow players had come to court they had set up in the palaces theatre whose plaster windows had shutters which could be closed against the light they had stretched a white sheet very tightly across a wooden frame whose lower edge was just above head height below the frame hung a black cloth the white screen was lit from behind by a single strong lamp set some distance back two men and two women manipulated the twodimensional puppets and their accompanying shadowscenery using thin sticks to make the characters limbs and bodies swivel effects like waterfalls and flames were achieved using thin strips of dark paper and bellows to make them flutter using a variety of voices the players told ancient stories of kings and queens heroes and villains fidelity and betrayal and love and hate it was the interval now dewar had been round the back of the screen to make sure that the two guards he had stationed there were still awake and they were the shadow players had objected at first but he had insisted the guards stay there urleyn was sitting in the middle of the small auditorium a perfect and stationary target for somebody behind the screen with a cross bow urleyn perrund and everybody else who had heard about the two guards behind the screen thought dewar was once again taking his duties far too seriously but he could not have sat there and watched the show comfortably with nobody he trusted behind the screen he had stationed guards by the window shutters too with instructions to open them promptly if the lantern behind the screen went out these precautions taken he had been able to watch the shadow players performance from the seat immediately behind urleyn with a degree of equanimity and when lattens had clambered over the seat in front and come and sat on his lap demanding to know more about lavishia he had felt sufficiently relaxed to be happy to oblige perrund sitting one seat along from urleyn had turned round to ask her question about mathematicians she watched dewar and lattens with an amused indulgent expression can they fly under the water too lattens asked he wriggled off dewars lap and stood in front of him an intent look on his face he was dressed like a little soldier with a wooden sword at his side in a decorated scabbard they certainly can they are very good at holding their breath and can do it for days at a time and can they fly through mountains only through tunnels but they have lots of tunnels of course some of the mountains are hollow and others are full of treasure are there wizards and enchanted swords yes enchanted swords by the cisternfull and lots of wizards though they tend to be a trifle arrogant and are there giants and monsters plenty of both though they are all very nice giants and extremely helpful monsters how boring perrund murmured reaching out her good hand and patting down some of lattens more wayward curls urleyn turned round in his seat eyes twinkling he drank from a glass of wine then said whats this dewar are you filling my boys head with nonsense there would be a wonder said bileth from a couple of seats away the tall foreign minister looked bored with the proceedings im afraid i am sir dewar admitted to urleyn ignoring bileth im telling him about kind giants and pleasant monsters when everybody knows that giants are cruel and monsters are terrifying preposterous bileth said whats that ruleuin asked also turning round urleyns brother sat beside him on the other side from perrund he was one of the few generals who had not been sent off to ladenscion monsters we have seen monsters on the screen havent we lattens which would you rather have lattens urleyn asked his son good giants and monsters or bad ones bad ones lattens shouted he drew his wooden sword from its scabbard so i can cut their heads off thats the boy his father said indeed indeed bileth agreed urleyn shoved his wine goblet at ruleuin and then reached over to pull lattens up off his feet depositing him in front of him and making to fence the child with a dagger still in its sheath lattens face took on a look of great concentration he fenced with his father thrusting and parrying feinting and dodging the wooden sword clicked and clacked off the sheathed dagger good his father said very good dewar watched commander zespiole get up from his seat and shuffle sideways towards the aisle dewar excused himself and followed meeting up with the other man in the privy beneath the theatre where one of the shadow players and a couple of guards were also making use of the facility did you receive your report commander dewar asked zespiole looked up surprised report dewar about my and the lady perrunds trip to her old hospital why should that occasion a report dewar i thought it might because one of your men followed us there from the palace really who was that i dont know his name but i recognised him shall i point him out the next time i see him if he was not acting on your orders you may wish to ask him why he has taken to following people going about their honest and officially sanctioned business in the city zespiole hesitated then said that will not be necessary thank you im sure that any such report supposing it had been made would state only that yourself and the concubine concerned paid a perfectly innocent visit to the said institution and returned without incident im sure it would too dewar returned to his seat the shadow players announced they were ready to begin the second half of their show lattens had to be calmed down before it could be resumed when it did he squirmed in his seat between his father and perrund for a while but perrund stroked his head and made quiet shushing soothing noises and before too long the shadow players stories started to reclaim the boys interest he had the seizure about halfway through the second half suddenly going rigid and starting to shake dewar noticed it first and sat forward about to say something then perrund turned her face glowing in the screen light shadows dancing across it a frown forming there lattens she said the boy made a strange strangling sound and jerked falling off his seat at the feet of his father who looked startled and said what perrund left her seat and sank down by the boy dewar stood up and turned to face the rear of the theatre guards the shutters now the shutters creaked and light spilled down the banked rows of seats startled faces peered out of the sudden light people started looking round at the windows muttering the shadow players screen had gone white the shadows disappearing the mans voice telling the background story halted confused lattens urleyn said as perrund started to set the boy into a sitting position lattens eyes were closed his face grey and sheened with sweat lattens urleyn lifted his child up into his arms dewar remained standing his gaze flitting about the theatre others were standing too now a bank of worriedlooking faces were arranged before him all looking down at the protector doctor dewar shouted when he saw bredelle the portly doctor stood blinking in the light the doctor master i thought it right to include in my report mention of the events which took place in the hidden gardens on the day duke quettil presented geographer kuins latest map of the world to the king we had arrived at the summer palace of yvenir in the yvenage hills on schedule and were happily settled into the doctors quarters in a round tower of the lesser house the view from our rooms took in the scattered houses and pavilions set within the wooded lower slopes of palace hill these buildings gradually increased in number while the distances between them shrank until they merged against the ancient walls of mizui city itself which filled the flat bottom of the valley immediately beneath the palace on the valley floor to either side of mizui could be seen numerous farms fields and water meadows while behind these climbed gently forested hills themselves surmounted by the round snowcovered mountains in the distance the king had indeed fallen off his mount while hunting near lepskatacheis though it had been on the last day of our stop there not the first and had been hobbling round since then on a badly twisted ankle the doctor had strapped the ankle and done what she could but the kings duties were such that he could not rest the limb as much as the doctor wanted him to and so it took a while to heal you yes more wine no not that stuff that ah adlain come and sit by me majesty wine for the guard commander come on you have to be quicker than that a good servant acts to carry out a masters wishes even as the wish is still being formed isnt that so adlain i was about to say that myself sir im sure you were what news oh mostly the woes of the world sir hardly fit to be revealed in a fine place like this it might spoil the view we were in the hidden gardens behind the great palace almost at the summit of the hill the red creepercovered garden walls hid all but the highest towers of the palace the view from the little hanging valley which contained the gardens led the eye down to the distant plains which were blue with distance and faded out into the light of the sky at the horizon any sign of quettil the king asked hes supposed to be giving me something or other all has to be arranged of course being quettil cant just happen no doubt were due to get the full pomp the duke quettil is not one to murmur when a shout might attract more attention adlain agreed taking off his hat and setting it on the long table but i understand the map he intends to present to you is a particularly fine one and long in the making i expect we shall all be most impressed duke quettil occupied the dukes palace within the grounds of palace hill the province and dukedom of quettil of which the city of mizui and the yvenage hills were but a modest part was entirely his to command and he was by repute not shy about imposing his authority he and his retinue were due to enter the hidden gardens shortly after the midday bell to present the king with his new map adlain the king said you know the new duke ulresile duke ulresile adlain said to the thin sallow youth at the kings left side i was sorry to hear about your father thank you the boy said he was barely older than i and less substantial more wispy the fine clothes he wore looked too big for him and he appeared uncomfortable he had i thought yet to take on the look of a powerful man duke walen adlain said bowing to the older man who sat to the kings right adlain walen said you look as though the mountain air suits you i have yet to find air that does not thank you duke king quience sat at a long table set within a shady pergola attended by the dukes walen and ulresile a smattering of lesser nobility and various servants including a pair of palace serving girls who were identical twin sisters and to whom the king seemed to have taken a particular shine each had goldgreen eyes yellowwhite tangles of hair and seemed to be almost but not entirely in control of tall sinuous bodies that in places appeared to defy the law of gravity each was clothed in a creamcoloured dress edged with red piping and ruffled with lace which if not exactly what a rustic shepherdess might wear was perhaps what a famously handsome and wellendowed actress might have worn if she was taking part in an expensively produced romantic play which featured rustic shepherdesses one such creature might have caused a normal fellows heart to melt into his boots that there were two such beauties capable of occupying the same world at once seemed unfair especially as both seemed quite as taken with the king as he did with them i confess that i had been unable to take my eyes off the two goldenbrown globes which bulged like swollen fawn moons at the lacy cream horizon of each girls bodice the sunlight poured down over those perfect orbs highlighting the nearly invisibly fine down there their voices tinkled like the fountains their musky perfume filled the air and the kings very talk and tone taunted and teased with the implication of romance yes those little red ones some of those mmm delicious how one does enjoy those little red ones eh the two girls giggled hows it looking vosill the king said still smirking when can i start chasing these girls he made to lunge at the shepherdesses and tried to grab them but they yelped and danced out of the way they keep getting away from me dammit when can i start hunting them properly properly sir how would that be the doctor asked the doctor and i were there tending to the kings ankle the doctor changed the strapping on it every day sometimes she changed it twice a day if the king had been out riding or hunting as well as the swelling from the sprain there was a small cut on the ankle which was taking its time to heal and the doctor was scrupulous in keeping this cleaned and treated nevertheless it still seemed to me that any common nurse or even chamberservant could have performed this function however the king appeared to want the doctor to do it each day herself and she seemed quite happy to acquiesce i cannot think of any other doctor who might have made an excuse not to treat the king but she was quite capable of it why properly in the sense of having a decent chance of catching them vosill the king said leaning forward towards the doctor and using what is i believe called a stage whisper the two shepherdesses laughed tinklingly decent sir how so the doctor asked and blinked it seemed to me more than the flower and leafshaded sunlight called for vosill stop asking these childish questions and tell me when i may run again oh you may run now sir but it would be most painful and your ankle would probably give way within a few dozen steps but you most certainly can run aye run but fall over the king said sitting back and reaching for his wine glass the doctor glanced at the two shepherdesses well she said perhaps something soft would break your fall she sat at the kings feet with her back to duke walen crosslegged this odd and unladylike position was one she adopted often seemingly without thinking and which made her adoption of mens clothes or at least some part of them almost a necessity for once the doctor had changed out of her long boots she wore dark hose and soft pointed shoes of velvet the kings feet rested on solid silver footstools topped with plump cushions vividly dyed and patterned the doctor washed the kings feet as usual inspected them and on this occasion carefully trimmed his toenails i was left to sit on a small stool at her side holding her bag open while she lost herself in this labour would you break my fall my lovelies the king asked sitting back in his chair the two girls dissolved into laughter again the doctor i think muttered something about being most sure to if he landed on their heads they might break your heart sir adlain observed smiling indeed walen said with one to pull in each direction a man might suffer terribly the two serving girls giggled and fed more little pieces of fruit to the king who made to tickle them with a long feather from a fantailed tsigibern musicians played on a terrace behind us fountains plashed melodiously insects hummed but did not annoy us the air was fresh and full of the scent of flowers and freshly tilled and watered earth and the two servant girls bent and leant to pop fruits into the kings mouth then squealed jumped and jiggled when he lunged at them with his feather i confess i was glad i did not have to pay too much attention to what the doctor was doing do try to keep still sir she muttered as the king stabbed at the two girls with the tsigibern feather chamberlain wiester came panting up the path beneath the flowers and vines his splendidly buckled shoes glinting in the sunlight and crunching on the semiprecious path stones duke quettil your majesty he announced a blare of trumpets and a clash of cymbals sounded from the garden gates followed by the roaring scream of what sounded like a fierce and angry animal and retinue wiester added duke quettil arrived with a bevy of maidens scattering scentcrushed petals in his path a troupe of jugglers tossing glittering clubs back and forth across the path a band of trumpeteers and cymbalists a pride of chokered growling galkes each with its own grim oiled and muscled handler straining to keep his charge in order a school of identically dressed clerks and retainers a clutch of beefylooking men clad only in loin cloths supporting what looked like a tall thin wardrobe on a bier and a pair of tall pitchskinned equatorials holding a tasselled parasol over the duke himself who was transported on a litter glittering with precious metals and cut stones by an octet of toweringly statuesque goldenskinned balnimes each bald and naked save for a tiny cachesex and accoutred with a huge long bow slung over their shoulder the duke was dressed as they say fit to embarrass an emperor his robes were predominantly red and gold and his ample frame displayed them to some effect as the balnimes lowered his litter a stepstool was placed by his slippered feet and he stepped on to a goldcloth carpet above his round full eyebrowless face his jewelled headdress sparkled in the sun and his manyringed fingers were heavy with gems as he made a sweeping if awkward bow to the king the trumpets and cymbals fell silent the musicians on the terrace had given up trying to compete with the trumpeteers and cymbalists as soon as theyd entered so we were left with the sounds of the garden itself plus the galkes growling duke quettil said the king an impromptu visit quettil smiled broadly the king laughed good to see you duke i think you know everybody here quettil nodded to walen and ulresile then to adlain and a few others he couldnt see the doctor because she was on the far side of the table still tending to the kings feet your majesty quettil said as a further token of our honour at being allowed to play host to you and your court here again for the summer iwish to make a presentation the oiled musclemen brought the bier in front of where the king sat and set it down they opened the richly carved and inlaid doors of the thin container to reveal a huge square map easily the height of a man set within the square was a circle filled with the shapes of continents and islands and seas and embellished with monsters drawings of cities and small figures of men and women in a huge variety of dress a map of the world sir quettil said prepared for you by the master geographer kuin from the very latest intelligence purchased by your humble servant and passed on to him by the most brave and reliable captains of the four waters thank you duke the king sat forward in his seat peering at the map does it show the site of anlios of old quettil looked at one of his liveried servants who stepped forward quickly and said yes your majesty here he pointed what of the lair of the monster gruissens believed to be here your majesty in the region of the vanishing isles and sompolia ah home of mimarstis the mighty quettil said so people claim the king said here your majesty and is haspide still in the centre of the world the king asked ah said the servant in every sense but the physical sir quettil said looking a little discomfited i did ask master geographer kuin for the most accurate map it might be possible to draw up with the latest and most trustworthy information and he has chosen one might almost say decreed that the equator must be the waistband of the world for the purposes of accurate mapmaking as haspide lies some goodly distance from the equator it cannot therefore assume the quettil it doesnt matter the king said airily waving one hand i prefer accuracy to flattery it is a most magnificent map and i thank you sincerely it will sit in my throne room so that all may admire it and i shall have more utilitarian copies drawn up for our sea captains i think i have never seen a single object which contrives to be at once so decorous and yet so useful come and sit by me duke walen will you kindly make room for our visitor walen muttered that he would be glad to and servants scraped his chair away from the kings leaving room for the balnimes to swing quettils litter round the table and set it by the king the duke resumed his seat the balnimes smelled strongly of some animalistic musk my head seemed to spin they retreated to the rear of the terrace and squatted on their haunches long bows aslant behind and what is this quettil said looking down from his fabulous seat at the doctor and myself my physician the king told him smiling broadly at the doctor what a footdoctor quettil asked is this some new fashion of haspide ive not heard about no a doctor for all the body as any royal physician must be as tranius was to my father and to me yes duke quettil said looking around tranius what of him he fell prey to shaking hands and blurred sight the king told him he retired to his farm in junde apparently the rural life suits him adlain added for by all accounts the old fellow has made a full recovery ormin recommended doctor vosill without reserve quience told the duke save that for the loss of her services to himself and his family but a woman quettil said letting one of his servants taste his wine and then accepting the crystal you entrust more than one organ to a womans care you are a brave man indeed sir the doctor had sat back and twisted a little so that she had her back to the table in this position she was able to face both the king and quettil she said nothing though there was a small tight smile on her face i began to be alarmed doctor vosill has been invaluable this last year the king said whats that without value valueless quettil said with a humourless smile and reached out with one slippered foot to prod the doctor in the elbow she rocked back slightly and looked down at the place where the jewelled slipper had touched her i felt my mouth become dry indeed without value because she is beyond value quience said smoothly i value my life above all else and the good doctor here helps to preserve it she is as good as part of me part of you quettil scoffed but it is a mans part to be part of a woman sir you are as ever far too generous my king i have heard guard commander adlain said people say something of that nature that the kings only fault is that he is too indulgent in fact he is precisely as indulgent as he needs to be to discover those who would take advantage of his sense of fairness and his desire to be tolerant having so discovered them yes yes adlain the duke quettil said waving a hand towards the guard commander who fell silent and looked down at the table im sure but even so to let a woman look after you your majesty i am only thinking of the good of the kingdom which you inherited from the man i was privileged to regard as my best friend your good father what would he have said quiences expression darkened for a moment then it brightened and said he might have let the lady speak for herself the king folded his hands and looked down at the doctor doctor vosill sir i have been given a present by duke quettil a map of the world would you care to admire it perhaps you can even give us your thoughts on it as you have travelled over more of the globe than the rest of us the doctor rose smoothly from her crosslegged sitting position to stand and swivel and look at the great map displayed on the far side of the table she gazed at it for a moment then reversed her earlier motion turning and folding herself down again and taking up a small pair of scissors before she applied them to the kings toenails she looked at the duke and said the representation is inaccurate sir duke quettil looked down upon the doctor and gave a small high laugh he glanced at the king and looked as though he was trying to control a sneer you think so madam he said in an icy tone i know so sir the doctor said busying herself at the quick of the kings left big toe and frowning mightily oelph the smaller scalpel oelph i jumped dug in her bag and handed her the tiny instrument with a shaking hand what do you know of such matters might i ask madam the duke quettil asked glancing at the king again perhaps the lady doctor is a mistress geographer adlain suggested perhaps she should be taught some manners duke walen said testily i have travelled round the world duke quettil the doctor said as though addressing the kings toe and seen the reality of much of what is shown rather fancifully on your map doctor vosill the king said not unkindly it might be more polite if you were to stand and look at the duke when you address him might it sir the king withdrew his foot from her hand as he sat forward and said sharply yes madam it might the doctor gave the king such a look i began to whimper though i think i was able to turn the sound into a clearing of the throat however she paused handed me back the small scalpel and stood smoothly again she bowed to the king and then the duke with your permission sirs she said then took up the tsigibern feather which the king had left lying on the table she dropped ducking under the long table and appearing on the far side she pointed at the lower part of the great map with the feather there is no continent here only ice there are island groups here and here the northern isles of drezen are simply not as shown they are more numerous generally smaller less regular and extend further to the north here the westernmost cape of quarreck is shown twenty sails or so too far to the east cuskery she tipped her head to one side considering is shown fairly accurately fuol is not here its here though the whole continent of morifeth is shown slanted to the west here illerne is north of chroe not opposite it these are the places i know of from personal knowledge i have it on good authority that there is a great inland sea here as for the various monsters and other nonsenses thank you doctor the king said and clapped his hands your views have been most amusing im sure duke quettil has doubtless gained great insight from watching his splendid plan suffer such correction the king turned to a grimfaced quettil you must forgive the good doctor my dear duke she is from drezen where their brains seem to suffer from being upsidedown all the time obviously all is topsyturvy there and the women think it fit to tell their lords and masters what is what quettil forced a smile indeed sir i quite understand still it was a most diverting display i always held with your father that it was both unseemly and unnecessary that women be allowed on to a stage when castrati were so readily available however i see that womens fanciful and imaginative nature may be put to good use when it comes to providing us with such humorous vignettes i see now that such frivolity and such licence is indeed most welcome as long as one does not take it too seriously of course i was watching the doctor closely and with great trepidation as the duke spoke these words her expression much to my relief stayed calm and untroubled do you think the duke asked the king that she holds similarly picturesque views regarding the location of the organs within the human body as she does the features of the globe we must ask her doctor the king said do you disagree with our best physicians and surgeons as you so obviously do with our most esteemed navigators and mapmakers on location no sir but from your tone adlain said you disagree on something what would that be function sir the doctor told him but that is mostly to do with plumbing and so not perhaps of paramount interest tell me woman duke walen said did you have to leave this land of drezen to escape justice the doctor looked coldly at duke walen no sir strange i thought perhaps you might have tried the patience and forbearance of your masters there too and so have had to flee to escape their punishment i was free to stay and free to leave sir the doctor said evenly i chose to leave to travel the world and see how things are elsewhere and found little you agree with it would seem duke quettil said i am surprised you have not returned to wherever it was you came from i have found the favour of a good and just king sir the doctor said laying the feather back on the table where she had found it then looking at the king as she put her hands behind her back and drew herself up i am privileged to be able to serve him as best i can for as long as it pleases him i consider that worth all the hardships my journey entailed and everything that i have found disagreeable since i left my home the truth of it is that the doctor is far too valuable to let go the king assured duke quettil she is practically our prisoner though we dont let her know that or she would at the very least go into the most awful huff would you not doctor the doctor lowered her head with a look that might almost have been demure your majesty might banish me to the ends of the world i would still be the prisoner of his regard providence it can be almost civil at times quettil roared suddenly slapping one hand on the table she can even look handsome in the right clothes and with her hair done properly the king said picking up the tsigibern feather again and twirling it in front of his face we shall have a ball or two while we are here i dare say the doctor will put on her most feminine finery and amaze us all with daintiness and grace wont you vosill if it please the king she said though i noticed that her lips were tight something we can all look forward to duke ulresile said suddenly then appeared to blush and quickly busied himself with cutting a piece of fruit the other men looked at him then all smiled and exchanged knowing looks the doctor looked at the young man who had just spoken i thought i saw her eyes cross for a moment just so the king said wiester your majesty music i think certainly sir wiester turned to the musicians on the terrace behind quettil dismissed most of his retinue ulresile concentrated on eating enough to feed both the departed galkes and the doctor returned to the kings feet rubbing fragrant oils into the harder parts of the skin the king sent the two shepherdesses away adlain was about to give us some news were you not adlain i thought we might wait until we were inside sir the king looked round i see nobody we cannot trust quettil was looking down at the doctor who looked up and said shall i go sir have you finished no sir then stay providence knows i have trusted you with my life often enough and quettil and walen probably dont think you have the memory or the wit to be an adequate spy so assuming that we trust young oelph sir the doctor told the king she smiled at me i have found him an honest and trustworthy apprentice young oelph here i think we can talk with reasonable freedom my dukes and guard commander may choose to spare you their more spicy phrases doctor or they may not but i suspect you would not blush to hear them anyway adlain the king turned to the guard commander very well sir there have been several reports that someone in a sea company delegation tried to assassinate the regicide urleyn about twelve days ago what the king exclaimed i take it we must conclude that sadly this attempt did not succeed walen said adlain nodded the protector escaped unharmed what sea company the king asked eyes narrowed one that probably does not really exist adlain said one that several of the others fashioned specifically to make the attempt a single report has it that the members of the delegation died under torture without revealing anything except their own sad ignorance this is due to all the talk of forming a navy walen said looking at quience it is foolishness sir perhaps the king agreed but foolishness we must appear to support for now he looked at adlain contact all the ports send a message to each of the companies that enjoy our favour to the effect that any further attempt on urleyns life will meet with our most profound and practical displeasure but sir walen protested urleyn continues to enjoy our support the king said with a smile we cannot be seen to oppose him no matter how much his demise may please us the world is a changed place and too many people are watching tassasen to see what happens there we must trust to providence that the regicidal regime fails of its own accord and so convinces others of its wrongness if we are seen to intervene to bring about its downfall from without we shall only persuade the sceptical that there must have been some threat and therefore by their way of thinking some merit in the enterprise but sir walen said leaning forward and looking past quettil so that his old chin was almost on the table providence does not always behave as we have the right to expect i have had too many opportunities to observe this in my life sir even your dear father a man without peer in such matters could be too prone to waiting for providence to accomplish with most painful slowness what a quick and even merciful act could have achieved in a tenth of the time providence does not move with the alacrity and dispatch one might expect or desire sir sometimes providence needs to be given a nudge in the right direction he looked defiantly round the others aye and a sharp nudge at that i thought older men usually counselled patience adlain said only when that is what is required walen told him now it is not nevertheless the king said with perfect equanimity what will happen to general urleyn will happen i have an interest in this that you may guess at my dear duke walen but neither you nor anybody else who holds my favour worth the having may anticipate it patience can be a means of letting matters mature to a proper state for action not just a way of letting time slip away walen looked at the king for a good few moments then seemed to accept what the king had said forgive an old man for whom the furthest scope of patience may lie beyond that of his own grave your majesty we must hope that will not be so for i would not wish you such an early death dear duke walen looked reasonably mollified at this quettil patted his hand which the older man seemed not so sure about the regicide has more to worry about than assassins in any event duke quettil said ah the king said sitting back with a contented look our eastern problem rather say urleyns western one sir quettil smiled we have heard that he continues to send forces towards ladenscion simalg and ralboute two of his best generals are already in the city of chaltoxern they have issued an ultimatum to the barons that they must open the high passes and allow the protectorates forces free passage to the inner cities by jairlys new moon or suffer the consequences and we have reason to believe that the barons position might be more robust than urleyn believes the king said with a sly smile rather a lot of reasons quettil said in fact about he began but the king held up one hand and made a sort of halfpatting halfwaving motion and partially closed his eyes quettil glanced round about us and gave a small slow nod duke ormin sir chamberlain wiester said the stooped figure of the duke ormin came awkwardly up the path he halted by the tall map case smiling and bowing sir ah duke quettil ormin the king said quettil gave the most perfunctory of nods good to see you how is your wife much better sir a slight fever no more sure you dont want vosill here to take a look at her quite sure sir ormin said raising himself up on his feet to look over the table ah doctor vosill sir the doctor said to the duke bobbing briefly come and sit with us the king said he looked around duke walen would you no no duke walens face had taken on the look of a man told a poisonous insect has just fallen into his riding boot you moved before didnt you adlain would you make room for the duke with pleasure sir ah a most magnificent map duke ormin said as he took his seat isnt it the king said sir your majesty the young man to walens right piped up duke ulresile the king said might i go to ladenscion the young duke asked he appeared at last to be animated and even excited when he had expressed his anticipation at seeing the doctor dressed for a ball he had seemed only to make himself more callow now he appeared enthused his expression passionate i and a few friends we have all the military means and a good number of men we would put ourselves under the authority of whatever baron you most trust and would gladly fight for the my good ulresile the king said your enthusiasm does you no end of credit but grateful though i am for the expression of such an ambition its fulfilment would lead only to my fury and contempt how so sir the young duke asked blinking furiously his face flushing you sit here at my table duke ulresile you are known to enjoy my favour and to accept my advice and that of quettil here then you go to fight the forces of one i have pledged to support and must i repeat be seen to support at least for now but you will find in any event ulresile duke quettil said glancing at quience that the king prefers to rely on his paid generals rather than his nobles to command forces of any significance the king gave quettil a controlled smile it was the custom of my dear father to trust major battles to those trained from an early age in war and nothing else my nobles command their lands and their own leisure they gather harems improve their palaces commission great works of art manipulate the taxes that we all benefit from and oversee the improvement of land and the furbishment of cities in the new world that exists about us now that would appear to provide more than enough indeed perhaps too much for a man to think about without having to concern himself with the exigencies of war as well duke ormin gave a small laugh king drasine used to say he said that war is neither science nor art it is a craft with elements of both the scientific and the artistic about it but a craft nevertheless and best left to craftsmen trained to it but sir duke ulresile protested the king held up one hand to him i have no doubt that you and your friends might carry many a battle all on your own and be easily the equal of any one of my waged generals but in winning the day you might lose the year and even jeopardise the reign matters are in hand ulresile the king smiled at the young duke though he could not see it because he was staring tightlipped at the table however the king continued a tone of tolerant amusement in his voice that had ulresile look up briefly by all means keep that fire stoked and your blade sharp your day will come in due time sir ulresile said looking back at the table now the king began then became aware of some sort of commotion at the gates to the palace majesty wiester said frowning in the same direction and drawing himself up on tiptoes to see better wiester what can you see the king asked a servant sir hurrying indeed running at this point both the doctor and i looked round under the table and indeed there was a plump youth in the uniform of the palace footmen running up the path i thought they were not allowed to run for fear of scattering the stones over the flower beds the king said shading his eyes against the sunlights new slant indeed so sir wiester said and assumed his most stern and censorious expression as he stepped to the end of the table and walked purposefully down to meet the lad who stopped before him and bent over to lean his hands on his knees while he panted sir what boy wiester bellowed sir theres been a murder sir a murder wiester said taking a step back and seeming to shrink in on himself the guard commander adlain was on his feet instantly whats this quettil asked what did he say walen said where adlain demanded from the youth sir in the questioning chamber of master nolieti sir duke quettil gave a small high laugh why is that unusual who is murdered boy adlain said walking down the path towards the servant sir master nolieti sir the bodyguard once upon a time there was a land called lavishia and two cousins lived there called sechroom and hiliti i think you have already told this story dewar lattens said in a small croaky voice i know but there is more to it some peoples lives have more than one story this is a different one oh how are you feeling are you well enough to hear one of my stories i know they are not very good i am well enough mr dewar dewar plumped the boys cushions up and got him to drink a little water he was in a small but luxurious room off the private apartments near the harem so that concubines like perrund and huesse could come and sit with him but close to his fathers quarters and that of doctor bredelle who had pronounced the boy prone to nervous exhaustion and pressure of blood on the brain and was bleeding him twice a day there had been no return of the fits the boy had suffered that first day but he was recovering his strength only very slowly dewar came to see the boy when he could which was usually when lattens father was visiting the harem as now well if you are sure i am please tell your story very well one day the two friends were playing a game what sort of a game a very complicated one fortunately we dont need to concern ourselves with the details of how the game is played all that matters is that they were playing it and they came to disagree about the rules because there were more than one set of rules regarding how the game should be played that is strange yes but it was just that sort of game so they disagreed what it boiled down to was that sechroom said that as in life in general you should always do what seemed like the right thing to do at the time while hiliti said that sometimes you had to do what appeared to be the wrong thing at the time in order to do the right thing eventually do you see im not sure hmm let me see i know that little pet eltar of yours whats it called what wintle yes wintle remember when you brought it inside and it peed in a corner yes lattens said and we had to take it and rub its nose in its own mess so that it wouldnt do it again yes well that wasnt very nice for poor little wintle now was it no can you imagine if somebody did that to you when you were young if youd done a pee in the corner eurgh but it was the right thing to do because eventually wintle will stop doing that when hes brought inside and so he can be brought in and enjoy himself with us instead of having to stay in the cage in the garden all the time yes and that is the sort of thing that people mean when they talk about being cruel to be kind have you heard that phrase before yes my teacher says it often yes i think it is a phrase adults say to children quite often but that was what sechroom and hiliti disagreed about sechroom said that you should never be cruel to be kind sechroom thought there must always be another way of teaching people lessons and that good people had a duty to try and find those ways and then to use them hiliti thought this was silly and that throughout history it had been proved that sometimes you did have to be cruel to be kind whether what you were trying to teach was a little pet eltar or a whole people a whole people you know like an empire or a country like tassasen everybody oh so one day after they had fallen out over this game hiliti decided that he would teach sechroom a lesson he and sechroom had grown up playing tricks and pranks on each other and each had come to expect such behaviour from the other this day a short time after their disagreement over the game hiliti and sechroom and two other friends rode on their great mounts to one of their favourite places a was this before or after the other story when the lady leeril gave hiliti sweets this was afterwards the four of them came to this place in the hills where there was a clearing and a tall waterfall and lots of fruit trees all around and lots of rocks were any of the rocks sugar rocks lots of them in many different flavours though sechroom and hiliti and their two friends had brought their own picnic so they ate the picnic and they swam in the pool at the foot of the waterfall and they played some games of hideandseek and so on and then hiliti said he had a special game he wanted to show sechroom hiliti asked the other two friends to remain where they were by the side of the pool while hiliti and sechroom climbed up the rocks until they were at the top of the waterfall standing right beside where the waters fell over the edge now sechroom didnt know but hiliti had ridden up there the day before and hidden a wooden plank by the side of the waterfall hiliti brought this plank out of the bushes and said that sechroom had to stand on the end of the plank with the other end sticking out over the drop then hiliti would walk out on to the plank towards the end but and this was where sechroom started to get a little frightened hiliti would put on a blindfold first so that he couldnt see what he was doing sechroom would have to guide him and the thing was to see how close to the end of the plank sechroom would let him get how much did they really trust each other that was the question then assuming that hiliti didnt fall off the plank and tumble to his death on the rocks below or if he was lucky miss the rocks but land in the pool it would be sechrooms turn and she would have to do the same thing with hiliti standing on the end of the plank and telling sechroom to go forward or stop sechroom wasnt very sure about any of this but eventually agreed because she didnt want to seem lacking in trust anyway hiliti put the blindfold on told sechroom to adjust the length of the plank hanging over the drop until she was happy with it then he stepped on to the plank and went shuffling and wobbling along towards the end with his hands and arms outstretched like this did he fall off no he didnt sechroom told him to stop when he got right to the very end of the plank and hiliti could feel the edge hiliti undid the blindfold and stood there arms out waving at the two girls sitting far below they were cheering and waving hiliti turned carefully and went back to the safety of the cliff edge and then it was sechrooms turn sechroom put on the blindfold and heard hiliti adjust the amount the plank stretched out over the drop then she stepped on to it sliding her feet very slowly and carefully and keeping her arms out to each side just as hiliti had done like this like that well the plank went up and down and sechroom felt very frightened a breeze had started up and it blew against sechroom and made her feel even more frightened but she kept sliding her feet along towards the end of the plank which by now was starting to seem very far away just as she got to the end hiliti told her to stop and she did then she slowly put her hands to the back of her head and undid the blindfold like this like that she waved down to the friends standing on the grass like this like that then she turned round to walk back along the plank just as hiliti stepped off the plank and let it and sechroom fall no yes now the plank didnt fall very far because hiliti had tied a length of rope to the end but sechroom fell screaming into the pool at the foot of the waterfall and hit the water with a tremendous splash and disappeared their two friends dashed and splashed into the water to help while hiliti calmly drew the plank back up and then knelt on the side of the cliff looking down waiting for sechroom to surface but sechroom did not surface the two other friends swam around looking for her and diving down into the depths of the pool and searching amongst the rocks all jumbled at the sides of the pool but they could find no sign of sechroom up on the cliff hiliti was horrified at what hed done he had only meant to teach sechroom a lesson to show her that you could not trust anybody he wanted to be cruel to be kind because he thought that sechrooms ideas might be the death of her one day if she was not taught to be more careful but now it looked like his hilitis ideas had been the death of his cousin and best friend for much time had passed by then and sechroom could not possibly have survived so long under water did hiliti dive into the water too yes he dived into the pool and hit the water so hard that he knocked himself out but the two other friends rescued him and brought him back to the grass by the side of the pool they were still slapping his cheeks and trying to press water out of his lungs when sechroom appeared from the water her head and neck all bloody and stumbled up to see how her friend was she was alive she had struck her head on an underwater rock when shed fallen into the pool and had nearly drowned but shed been brought up to the surface behind the waterfall and floated along with the current until shed wedged between some rocks there she had recovered and had realised what hiliti had been up to she was angry with hiliti and with the two other friends as well because she thought mistakenly that they were in on the trick too and so she hadnt shouted out when the two had swum nearby and had ducked under the water so that they wouldnt see her only when she thought hiliti had injured himself too did she swim and wade out of the pool did sechroom forgive hiliti mostly though the two were never quite so close friends again but they were both all right hiliti came to quickly and was mightily relieved to see his friend sechrooms head wound was not as bad as it looked though to this day she bears a funny triangular scar on her head where the rock hit just here above the left ear luckily her hair covers the scar hiliti was bad hiliti was trying to prove a point people often behave badly when they are trying to prove a point of course he claimed that he had proved it he said that he had taught sechroom exactly the lesson he had sought to teach her and taught it so well that sechroom put the results of that lesson into effect almost instantly for what was sechroom doing hiding there amongst the rocks behind the waterfall but trying to teach hiliti a lesson ahha ahha indeed so hiliti was right sechroom would never agree to that sechroom held that her head was damaged and her brains were addled at the time and that that proved her point which had become that it was only damaged people with confused brains who ever saw the justice in trying to be cruel to be kind mmm lattens yawned that was a better story than the last one but quite a difficult one i think you must rest now you have to get better dont you like sechroom and hiliti did thats right they got better dewar tucked the boy in as lattens eyes slowly closed the boy reached out and felt for something his hand closed on a square of worn pale yellow material which he gripped tightly in one small hand and brought up to hold by his cheek settling his head further down into the pillow with a few small nestling movements dewar got up and made for the door nodding to the nurse sitting knitting by the window the general met his bodyguard in the visiting chamber of the outer harem ah dewar urleyn said walking swiftly from the doors to the harem and settling his long jacket over his shoulders did you see lattens i did sir dewar said falling into step as they exited the harem two men of the palace guard who had been effectively tripling the guard on the harem entrance trailed them by a few steps this additional escort for the protector was dewars response to the increased danger he perceived urleyn to be in after the attack by the sea company ambassador and the start of the war in ladenscion which had begun a few days earlier he was asleep when i looked in urleyn said ill see him later how was he still recovering i think the doctor bleeds him too much now dewar each to his own bredelle knows what hes doing i dare say you would not appreciate him trying to teach you the finer points of swordplay indeed not sir but even so dewar looked awkward for a moment there is something id like to do sir yes what id like to have lattens food and drink tasted just to make sure that he is not being poisoned urleyn stopped and looked at his bodyguard poisoned purely as a precaution sir im sure he has some normal illness trivial enough but just to be on the safe side with your permission urleyn shrugged very well if you think it necessary i dare say my tasters wont object to the odd extra bit of food he set off again striding quickly they exited the harem and set off up the steps to the rest of the palace two at a time until urleyn stopped about halfway up and then continued one step at a time he rubbed his lower back occasionally my body chooses to remind me of my true age he said he grinned and tapped dewar on the elbow i believe i deprived you of your opponent dewar my opponent sir your gameplaying companion he winked perrund ah i tell you dewar these young things are all very well but you realise theyre still girls when you have a real woman he put his hand to his back again providence though she puts me through my paces i tell you he laughed and stretched his arms if ever i expire in the harem dewar perrund may be to blame and yet no blame will attach yes sir they approached the kings chamber where urleyn had taken to holding his daily briefings on the war a buzz of conversation could be heard from beyond the guarded double doors urleyn turned to dewar right dewar i shall be in here for the next couple of bells dewar looked at the doors with a pained expression as a small boy with no coin might look at a sweet shop counter i really do think i ought to be with you during these briefings sir now dewar urleyn said taking hold of his elbow i shall be safe with my military men and there will be a double guard on the doors here sir leaders who have been assassinated have usually believed that they were safe until the instant before it happened dewar urleyn said kindly i can trust all these men with my life i have known almost all of them for most of it certainly i have known most of them for longer than i have known you i can trust them but sir and you make some of them uncomfortable dewar urleyn said with a hint of impatience they think a bodyguard should not be so opinionated as you have been and your mere presence suffices to unsettle some of them they think theres an extra shadow in the room i shall dress in motley put on the uniform of a fool you will not urleyn told him and put his hand on the other mans shoulder i order you to amuse yourself as you see fit for the next two bells and then return here and resume your duties after my generals have told me how many more towns weve taken since yesterday he clapped dewars shoulder now be gone and if im not here when you come back i shall have returned to the harem for another bout with your opponent he grinned at the other man and squeezed his arm all this talk of war and victorious battles seems to put a young mans blood in my cock he left dewar standing there staring at the tiled floor of the corridor while the doors opened and closed on the sound of talking men the two palace guards joined their comrades on either side of the doors dewars jaw worked as though he was chewing on something then he spun and walked quickly away the plasterer had almost finished the remedial work on the painted chamber a final layer was drying and he was kneeling on his whitespotted sheet surveying his tools and buckets and trying to remember the correct order to put them away this was a job normally done by his apprentice but he had had to do it himself on this job because it was all so secret the chambers door was unlocked and the blackclad figure of dewar the protectors bodyguard walked in the plasterer felt a chill go through him when he saw the look on the tall mans dark face providence they didnt intend to kill him now hed done his job did they hed known it was secret what he had plastered up was a hidden alcove for someone to spy on people that was obvious but could it be so secret theyd kill him afterwards to stop him from talking hed done jobs in the palace before he was honest and he kept his mouth shut they knew that they knew him one of the palace guards was his brother he could be trusted he wouldnt tell anyone about this hed swear to that on his childrens lives they couldnt kill him could they he shrank back as dewar approached the bodyguards sword wagged from side to side in its black scabbard while the long dagger at his other hip bounced in its own dark sheath the plasterer looked into the other mans face and saw only a blank cold expression that was more terrifying than a look of pitiless fury or an assassins lying smile he tried to find his voice but could not he felt his bowels start to loosen dewar hardly seemed to see him he glanced down at him then at the new plaster partition still drying between the other painted panels like a blooddrained lifeless face between living ones then he walked past to the small dais the plasterer his mouth dry swivelled round where he knelt to watch the bodyguard clutched one arm of the small throne on the dais then he went and stood before a panel on the far side of the room which showed a scene set within a harem full of stylised images of languidly buxom ladies in revealing dresses all lounging around playing games and sipping from tiny glasses the black figure stood there for a moment when he spoke the plasterer jumped is the panel finished he asked his voice was loud and hollowsounding in the bare room the plasterer swallowed coughed dryly and eventually was able to croak yeyeyes yes sir ready for the ppainter by tomorrow still facing the painting of the harem still with hollowsounding voice the bodyguard said good then without warning and with no backswing just a single startlingly sudden thrust he rammed his right fist straight through the panel he was standing in front of on the other side of the chamber the plasterer yelped dewar stood there a moment longer half his lower arm protruding from the harem painting a few painted plaster pieces fell dryly to the floor as he slowly withdrew his arm again the plasterer trembled he wanted to get up and run but he felt glued to the spot he wanted to raise his arms to defend himself but they seemed pinned to his sides dewar stood looking down at his right forearm slowly brushing the white plaster dust off the black material then he spun on his heel and walked quickly to the door where he paused and looked back with a face that seemed now to have taken on an expression of inconsolable torment he glanced at the panel he had just punctured you may find another panel which needs repair it must have been broken earlier must it not the plasterer nodded vigorously yes yes oh yes of course sir oh yes very very definitely i noticed it myself earlier sir ill attend to it immediately sir the bodyguard looked at him for a moment good the guard will let you out then he was gone and the door closed and was locked the doctor the guard commander of yvenir palace held a scented kerchief to his nose before him was a stone slab fitted with iron manacles legirons and hide straps none of these was required to restrain the current occupant of the slab for spread upon it lay the limp body of the kings chief torturer nolieti naked save for a small cloth draped over his genitals beside guard commander polchiek stood ralinge chief torturer to duke quettil and a young greyfaced and sweating scribe sent by guard commander adlain who had taken personal command of the hunting party seeking the apprentice unoure these three were faced on the other side of the slab by doctor vosill her assistant that is myself and doctor skelim personal physician to duke quettil the questioning chamber underneath the palace of yvenir was relatively small and lowceilinged it smelled of a variety of unpleasant things including nolieti himself it was not that the body had started to decay the murder had happened only a couple of hours ago but from the dirt and grime visible on the otherwise pale skin of the dead chief torturer it was obvious that he had not been the most personally hygienic of men guard commander polchiek watched a flea crawl out from beneath the cloth over the mans groin and start to travel up the slack curve of his stomach look doctor skelim said pointing at the tiny black shape moving over the mottled grey skin of the corpse somebodys leaving the sinking ship looking for warmth doctor vosill said reaching quickly out to the insect it disappeared an instant before her hand got there jumping away polchiek looked amused and i too wondered at the doctors naïveté what was that proverb about there being only so many ways to catch a flea but then the doctors fingers snapped closed in mid air she inspected what she had there nipped their tips more tightly together and then brushed the remains off on her hip she looked up at polchiek whose face wore a surprised expression it might have jumped on one of us she said a lightwell above the slab had been opened for what was to judge from the amount of dust and debris that rained down upon the unfortunate scribe sent to do the opening by doctor vosill the first time in a long time a brace of floorstanding candelabra added their own light to the gruesome scene may we proceed the guard commander of yvenir asked in a rumbling voice polchiek was a big tall man with a single great scar from grey hair line to chin a fall while hunting the previous year had left him with a knee that could not bend it was for this reason that adlain and not he was in charge of the search for unoure i have never enjoyed attending any sort of event down here i dont imagine the subjects of those events did either doctor vosill observed nor did they deserve to doctor skelim said one of his small hands playing nervously with his collar ruff as his gaze flicked round the barrelvaulted walls and ceiling it is a cramped oppressive sort of place isnt it he glanced at the guard commander polchiek nodded nolieti used to complain that there was barely room to swing a whip he said the greyfaced scribe began to make notes in a small slatebook the fine point of the chalk made a scratching squeaking noise on the stone skelim snorted well he will swing no more of those is there any word on unoure guard commander we know which way he went polchiek said the hunting party should pick him up before dark do you think he will be in one piece asked doctor vosill adlain is not unused to hunting in these woods and my hounds are well trained the youth may suffer a bite or two but hell be alive when he is delivered to master ralinge here polchiek said glancing at the wide little barrel of a man standing at his side and staring with a sort of greedy fascination at the wound that had gone most of the way towards separating nolietis head from his shoulders ralinge looked slowly up at polchiek when he heard his name mentioned and smiled showing a full set of teeth which he was proud to have removed from his victims and which he had used to replace his own diseased items polchiek made a rumbling disapproving noise yes well unoures fate is what concerns me here gentlemen doctor vosill said really madam polchiek said keeping his kerchief at his mouth and nose what concern of yours is his fate he turned to ralinge i believe his destiny now lies in the hands of those of us on this side of the table doctor or does the lad have a medical condition that may rob us of the chance to question him on the matter unoure is unlikely to have been the murderer the doctor said doctor skelim made a derisory snorting noise polchiek looked up at the ceiling which for him was not far away ralinge did not take his gaze off the wound really doctor polchiek said sounding bored and what brings you to that strange conclusion the man is dead skelim said angrily waving one thin hand at the corpse murdered in his own chamber his assistant was seen running into the woods while the body was still oozing blood his master used to beat him and worse everybody knows that only a woman would not see the obvious in this oh let the good lady doctor have her say polchiek said i for one am already quite fascinated doctor indeed muttered skelim looking away to one side the doctor ignored her colleague and bent over to grip the ragged flaps of skin that had been nolietis neck i found myself swallowing hard the wound was caused by a serrated instrument probably a large knife she said astonishing skelim said sarcastically there was a single cut from left to right the doctor said teasing apart the flaps of skin near the corpses left ear i confess that her assistant was feeling a little queasy at this juncture though like the torturer ralinge i could not tear my gaze from the wound it severed all the major blood vessels the larynx the what skelim said the larynx the doctor said patiently pointing to the roughly slashed pipe inside nolietis neck the upper part of the windpipe we call it the upper part of the windpipe here doctor skelim told her with a sneer we have no need for foreign words quacks and the like tend to use them when theyre trying to impress people with their spurious wisdom but if we look deeper the doctor said levering the corpses head right back and lifting its shoulders partly off the surface of the slab oelph would you put that block underneath the shoulders here i picked a piece of wood shaped like a miniature executioners block up off the floor and stuck it under the dead mans shoulders i was feeling sick hold his hair would you oelph the doctor said forcing nolietis head back still further there was a glutinous sucking noise as the wound opened further i took hold of nolietis sparse brown hair and looked away as i pulled on it looking deeper the doctor repeated seemingly quite unaffected as she bent close over the tangle of multicoloured tissues and tubes that had been nolietis throat we can see that the murder weapon cut so deep it nicked the victims upper spinal column here at the third cervical vertebra doctor skelim snorted derisively again but from the corner of my eye i saw him leaning closer to the opened wound a sudden retching sound came from the far side of the table as guard commander adlains scribe turned quickly away and doubled over by a drain his slatebook clattering to the ground i felt my own bile rising and tried to swallow it back here do you see lodged in the cartilage of the voice box a splinter of the vertebra deposited there as the weapon was withdrawn very interesting im sure polchiek said what is your point the direction of the cut would indicate the murderer was righthanded almost certainly the right hand was used in any event the depth and penetration points to a person of considerable strength and incidentally reinforces the likelihood that the murderer was using his favoured hand for people are rarely able to apply so much power so accurately and so certainly with their nonfavoured hand also the angle of the cut the way the wound slopes upward relative to the victims throat implies that the murderer was a good head or so taller than the victim oh providence doctor skelim said loudly why not rip out his innards and read them like the priests of old to find the murderers name i guarantee they will say unoure in any event or whatever his name is doctor vosill turned to skelim dont you see unoure is shorter than nolieti and lefthanded i imagine he is of average strength perhaps a little more but he does not have the look of a particularly powerful man perhaps he was in a rage polchiek suggested people can gather an inhuman strength in certain circumstances i have heard they do so particularly in a place like this and nolieti might have been kneeling down at the time doctor skelim pointed out or unoure was standing on a stool ralinge said in a voice that was surprisingly soft and sibilant he smiled the doctor glanced towards a nearby wall nolieti was standing at that workbench when hewas attacked from behind arterial blood sprayed the ceiling and venous blood fell directly on the bench itself he was not kneeling the scribe completed his retching picked up his fallen slatebook and stood again returning to his place by the table with an apologetic look at polchiek who ignored him mistress i ventured yes oelph might i let go his hair now yes of course oelph i beg your pardon what does it matter exactly how unoure did it doctor skelim said he must have been here when it happened he ran away after it had happened of course he did it doctor skelim looked disgustedly at doctor vosill the doors to the chamber were neither locked nor guarded the doctor pointed out unoure may have been on any sort of errand and come back to find his master killed as for doctor skelim shook his head and held up one hand towards the doctor these womanly fancies and this unhealthy attraction to mutilation may represent a form of sickness in the mind on your part madam but they have little to do with the business of apprehending the culprit and getting the truth out of him the doctor is right polchiek told the doctor it is clear that you know your way around a corpse madam but you must accept that i know mine around an act of villainy running is invariably a sign of guilt i have found unoure may simply have been frightened the doctor said he did not appear to be possessed of a great amount of wit he may simply have panicked not thinking that running away was the most suspicious thing he could have done well we shall shortly apprehend him polchiek said with an air of finality and ralinge here will find out the truth when the doctor spoke it was with a degree of venom i think all of us found surprising will he indeed she said ralinge smiled broadly at the doctor polchieks scarred face took on a look of some grimness yes madam he will he told her he flapped one hand at the corpse still lying between us this has all been most diverting im sure but on the next occasion you wish to impress some of your betters with your macabre knowledge of human anatomy i would ask you not to include those of us with better things to do and certainly not me good day polchiek turned and left ducking under the doorway and acknowledging the salute of a guard the scribe who had been sick looked up hesitantly from his incomplete notes and appeared uncertain what to do next i agree doctor skelim said with a note of relish in his voice as he brought his small face up towards the doctors you might have bewitched our good king for now madam but you do not deceive me if you have any regard for your own safety you will request leave to depart from us as quickly as possible and return to whatever decadent regime raised you good day the greyfaced scribe hesitated again watching the doctors impassive face as skelim swept smartly out of the chamber head held high then the scribe muttered something to the still smiling ralinge closed his slatebook with a snap and followed the small doctor they dont like you duke quettils chief torturer said to the doctor his smile broadened still further i like you the doctor looked across the slab at him for a few moments then held up her hands and said oelph a wet towel if you please i ran and fetched a pitcher of water from a bench picked a towel from the doctors bag and soaked it then watched her as she washed her hands not taking her gaze off the small round man across the slab from her i handed her a dry towel she dried her hands ralinge kept on smiling you might think you hate what i am lady doctor he said softly his voice sounded distorted by his grisly collection of teeth but i know how to give pleasure as well as pain the doctor handed me the towel and said let us go oelph she nodded at ralinge and then we walked towards the door and pain can be pleasure too ralinge called after us i felt my scalp crawl and the urge to be sick returned the doctor did not react at all its just a cold sir ha just a cold ive known people die from colds indeed sir but you should not how is your ankle today lets take a look at it shall we i believe it is getting better will you change the dressing of course oelph would you i took the dressing and a few instruments from the doctors bag and arranged them on a cloth on the kings huge bed we were in the kings private chamber the day after nolietis murder the kings apartments at yvenir are arranged within a splendid domed cupola set high at the rear of the palace upon what is the roof to the main part of the great building the goldleafcovered dome is set back from the terraced edge of the roof and separated from it by a small formal garden as the roof level is just above the height of the tallest trees on the ridge behind marking the summit of the hills on this side of the valley the view from the northfacing windows which bring light into the most spacious and airy apartments is of nothing but sky beyond the clipped geometrical perfections of the gardens and the white tusk balustrade at their edge this lends the apartments a strange enchanted air of detachment from the real world i dare say the clear mountain air contributes to this effect of isolated purity but there is something most especially about that lack of sight of the mundane disorder of the landscape of men which gives the place its singular spirit will i be well enough for the ball at the next small moon the king asked the doctor as he watched her prepare the new dressing for his ankle in truth the old dressing looked spotless as the king had taken to his bed with a tingly throat and sneezing fits shortly after the news of nolietis demise had been communicated to us in the hidden gardens the day before i should imagine you will be able to attend sir the doctor said but do try not to sneeze over everybody i am the king vosill the king told her sniffing into a fresh handkerchief i shall sneeze over whom i please then you will spread the ill humour to others they will incubate it while you grow well again they will perhaps subsequently inadvertently sneeze in your presence and consequently reinfect you who will play host to it again while they recover and so on dont lecture me doctor im in no mood for it the king looked round at the slumped pile of pillows propping him up opened his mouth to call a servant but then started to sneeze his blond locks bouncing as his head went back and forth the doctor stood up from her chair and while he was still sneezing pulled the king upright and rearranged his pillows the king looked at her in some surprise you are stronger than you look are you not doctor yes sir the doctor said with a modest smile as she went back to undoing the dressing on the kings ankle and yet still weaker than i would be she was dressed as she had been the day before her long red hair was more carefully prepared than was usual combed and plaited and hanging down her long dark jacket almost to her slim waist she looked at me and i became aware that i was staring i looked down at my feet poking out from under the great beds valance was a corner of creamcoloured clothing that looked oddly familiar i wondered at this for a moment or two until with a pang of jealousy for the right of kings i realised it was part of a shepherdesss costume i pushed it further under the valance with my shoe the king settled himself back amongst his pillows what is the news on that boy who ran away the one who killed my chief questioner they caught him this morning the doctor said busying herself with the old dressing however i do not think he committed the murder really the king said personally master i did not think he sounded as if he particularly cared one way or the other what the doctor thought on this matter but this was the cue for the doctor to explain in some detail especially to a man however exalted who had a cold and had just eaten a light breakfast exactly why she had convinced herself that unoure had not killed nolieti i have to say that the consensus amongst the other apprentices assistants and pages arrived at in the kitchen parlour of the palace the previous evening was that the only perplexing aspect about the whole business was how unoure had been able to put off the dark decd fox so long well the king said i dare say quettils fellow will get the truth out of him the truth sir or what is required to satisfy the prejudices of those already convinced they know the truth what the king said dabbing at his reddened nose this barbaric custom of torture sir it produces not the truth but rather whatever those commanding the questioner wish to hear for the agonies involved are so unbearable that those subject to them will confess to anything or more precisely will confess to what they think their tormentors wish them to confess to in the hope of causing the suffering to cease the king looked at the doctor with an expression of confusion and disbelief people are beasts vosill lying beasts the only way to get the truth out of them sometimes is to wring it from them the king snorted mightily my father taught me that the doctor looked at the king for a long moment then started to undo the old dressing indeed well im sure he could not possibly have been wrong sir she said she supported the kings foot with one hand and unwound the white dressing with the other she started sniffing too the king kept on sniffing and snorting and staring at the doctor doctor vosill he asked eventually as the last of the dressing floated free from his ankle and the doctor gave it to me to put away sir she asked wiping her eyes on her cuff and looking away from quience madam have i upset you no the doctor said quickly no sir she made as though to start applying the new dressing then put it aside and made an exasperated clicking noise with her mouth she busied herself with the inspection of the small wound healing on the kings ankle and then ordered me to fetch water and soap which i had already provided and set by the bed she seemed annoyed that i had done this but quickly ensured the wound was clean washed and dried the kings foot and began to secure the new dressing the king appeared discomfited during all this when the doctor was finished he looked at her and said you will be looking forward to the ball yourself doctor she smiled briefly at him of course your majesty we packed our things away as we were about to take our leave the king reached out and took the doctors hand there was a troubled uncertain look i did not think i had seen before in his eyes he said women bear pain better than men they say doctor his eyes seemed to search hers it is ourselves we hurt most when we question the doctor looked down at her hand held within the kings women bear pain better because we must give birth sir she said in a low voice such pain is generally regarded as being unavoidable but is alleviated to whatever extent it can be by those of my calling she looked up into his eyes and we only become beasts we become worse than beasts when we torment others sir she took her hand carefully from his picked up her bag and with a small bow to the king turned and headed for the doors i hesitated half expecting the king to call her back but he did not he just sat there in his vast bed looking hurt and sniffing i bowed to the king and followed the doctor unoure never was put to the question a few hours after he was captured and brought back to the palace while the doctor and i were attending the king and while ralinge was still preparing the chamber for his inquisition a guard looked in on the cell where the youth was being held somehow unoure had slit his own throat with a small knife his arms and legs were tightly chained behind him and he had been stripped naked before being placed in the cell the knife had been wedged hiltfirst into a crack in the stone walls of the cell at about waist height unoure had been able to kneel before it at the extremity of the reach the chains securing him would allow and slice his neck across its blade before collapsing and bleeding to death i understand that the two guard commanders were furious the guards who had been charged with unoures custody were lucky they were neither punished nor put to the question themselves it was eventually agreed that unoure must have placed the knife there before his attack on nolieti in case he was captured and brought back to the palace our shared station might dictate both that we knew little and that our opinions were worth less but none of us who had had occasion to experience the full extent of unoures intelligence forethought and cunning found this explanation even remotely convincing quettil good duke how very pleasant it is to see you is this not a fine view walen hmm i find you well quettil q in most rude health you w tolerable q i thought you might want to sit down see i have arranged for chairs w thank you no let us go over here q oh well very well well here we are and afforded an even finer view however i cannot imagine you wished to meet me up here to admire my own estates w hmm q allow me to hazard a guess you have some misgivings about what was his name nolieti nolietis death or rather about his and his apprentices w no i believe that matter is closed i attach no great significance to the death of a pair of torturers theirs is a despicable if necessary craft q despicable oh no no indeed why i would call it a form of art at its most elevated my man ralinge is a veritable master i have only avoided singing his praises to quience because im afraid he might take him from me and that would be most upsetting i should feel deprived w no my concern is with one whose profession is concerned with the alleviation of pain not the causing of it q really ah you mean that woman who calls herself a doctor yes what does the king see in her cant he just fuck her and have done with it w perhaps he has more likely he has not she looks at him in a way that leads me to believe she would like to be tumbled but i care not either way the point is that he seems convinced of her efficacy as a physician q and what there is someone you would rather see in her place w yes anybody i believe she is a spy or a witch or something between the two q i see have you told the king w of course not q ahha well my own physician is of much the same opinion as yourself if that is any comfort which i warn you it ought not to be really given that my physician is a selfimportant fool and no better than any of the rest of these bloodletters and sawbones at curing anything w yes quite i am sure nevertheless that your physician is as competent a doctor as can be found and so i am glad that he shares my opinion of the woman vosill that may well prove useful if eventually we have to convince the king of her unsuitability i can tell you that guard commander adlain feels that she is a threat too though he agrees with me that it is not yet possible to move against her that is why i wanted to talk to you may i rely on your discretion i wish to speak of something that would have to be done without the kings knowledge even though it would be done solely to protect him q hmm yes of course good duke go on nothing will go beyond these walls well balustrades w i have your word q of course of course w adlain and i had an agreement with nolieti that should it prove necessary the woman could be taken and put to the question without reference to the king q ah i see w this plan was ready to be put into effect while we travelled from haspide to here but now we are here and nolieti is dead i would ask you to be willing and ready to put a similar plan into effect if your fellow ralinge is as efficient as you say then he ought to have no difficulty extracting the truth from the woman q certainly to date i can think of no woman who has been able to resist his advances in that respect w well then will you let some part of the palace guard arrange for her apprehension or at least allow it to take place without their interference q i see and what would be my interest in doing so w your interest why the safety of the king sir q which is of course my first concern as it is so clearly and creditably yours dear duke yet without some obviously deleterious action by the woman it might rather look as though one was acting on no more than your own dislike of her however well informed w my likes and dislikes are predicated entirely on what is good for the royal house and i would hope that my service over the past many years indeed decades has proved that you care less than nothing for the woman are you saying you would object q you have to see this from my standpoint dear walen while you are all here the responsibility for your safety is formally mine on this occasion only a few days after the arrival of the court at yvenir one of its officers was killed unlawfully and his murderer escaped the questioning and punishment that should rightfully have been his that displeased me greatly sir and it was only because the matter was concluded almost as soon as it began and appeared to be entirely internal to the royal court that i felt no more insulted even so i think polchiek does not realise how close he came to being brought down a rung or two and i might add that my guard commander still worries that something is being hidden that the apprentices death was somehow arranged by somebody who might have benefited from his silence but in any event if after such a murder and suicide a favourite of the king were to disappear then it would mean that i would have no choice but to discipline polchiek with the utmost severity my honour could be preserved by nothing less and arguably would still suffer i would need the most decidedly persuasive proof that the woman meant the king some harm before i could possibly countenance any such action w hmm i fancy the only proof you would accept would be the kings corpse and that alone might prove satisfactory to you q duke walen i would hope that your wit might devise a way to discover the womans fraudulent nature long before that could possibly occur w indeed and i have just such a commission in hand q there you see and what is your plan w close to fruition i hope q you will not tell me w it is unfortunate that it seems neither of us can indulge the other quettil q yes isnt it w i have no more to say i think q very well oh duke w sir q i take it i can rely on the woman not still somehow disappearing while the court rests at yvenir can i if she did i might have to think most carefully about whether to reveal to the king what you have revealed to me w you gave me your word q why that i did dear walen but im sure you would agree that my first loyalty is to the king not to you if i judged that the king was being deceived for no persuasive reason it would be my duty to inform him w i am sorry i have troubled you sir it would appear that we have both wasted our time this morning q good day walen this too i found later not in the doctors journal but in some other papers and have edited it slightly to present a more continuous narrative the common participant of these two passages is walen but especially given all that happened later i simply do not know what to make of it i record i do not judge i do not even offer speculation the bodyguard the royal park of croughen hills had been a private game reserve of the royal house of tassasen for several centuries urleyn had parcelled large parts of it out to various of the nobles who had supported his cause in the war of succession but reserved the right of the protector and his court to go hunting in the forests the four mounts and their riders circled the tall clump of brush and tangled creeper bush where they reckoned their prey had gone to ground ruleuin took out his sword and leaned down from the saddle poking at the mass of vegetation are you sure he went in here brother quite certain urleyn said dipping his face towards his mounts neck and squinting at an opening into the bushes he lowered himself still further letting go of the reins with one hand to peer into the undergrowth dewar riding at his side reached out to hold the reins of urleyns mount ruleuin on the far side of the bushes also leant down upon the neck of his mount how is the boy today urleyn yetamidous said voice booming his big face was red and bright with sweat oh hes well urleyn said levering himself upright again better with every day still not strong though he glanced round looking back up the slope beneath the trees we need some beaters here get your dark man to beat for us yetamidous said to urleyn referring to dewar youll get down and beat for us wont you dewar dewar smiled thinly i only beat out human prey general yetamidous human prey eh yetamidous said with a hearty laugh those were the days what he slapped his saddle dewars thin smile lasted a little longer in the last years of the old kingdom when king beddun had been at his most carelessly cruel prisoners or poachers unlucky enough to be caught plying their trade in the forest had provided most of the prey for hunts that tradition of savagery had been outlawed but there was one memento of the time present dewar thought in the shape of the old king bedduns antique hunting crossbow which urleyn carried slung over his back urleyn dewar yetamidous and ruleuin had become separated from the main part of the hunt which could be heard on the far side of the hill sound your horn will you yet urleyn said lets get some of the others here right you are yetamidous brought his horn to his lips and let a great blare of sound escape it almost coincided dewar noticed with the sound of horns coming from the other side of the hill so probably was not heard he chose not to say anything yetamidous shook some spit from the horns mouthpiece and looked pleased with himself is ralboute joining us protector he asked i thought he was supposed to a message came this morning urleyn said standing up in the saddle to stare into the clump of bushes he shielded his eyes as a beam of sunlight fell across his face he has been detained at he looked at dewar i believe it is the city of vynde sir vynde the city of vynde is proving more resilient than expected ruleuin stood in the saddle too and directed his gaze at the same place as his brother there was talk that we lost a couple of the siege mortars he said it is only a rumour as yet urleyn said simalg has rushed ahead as usual and outdistanced his supporting forces communication has been erratic with simalg you never know he may have advanced too fast for his guns or otherwise misplaced them lets not assume the worst i have heard other grumbles still protector yetamidous said undoing the top of a wineskin and taking a quick gulp perhaps we should go to ladenscion ourselves and take matters in hand yetamidous brows compressed i tell you protector i miss making war and id warrant you for one would not misplace siege guns yes ruleuin said you ought to take charge of the war yourself brother i have thought about it urleyn said he unsheathed his own sword and whacked at the tops of some bushes i have been concerned to appear less of a warlord and more of a statesman and anyway did not reckon the rebellion in ladenscion merited the full weight of our forces but i may change my mind if i think the situation demands it i shall wait for ralboutes return or for a message from him yet blow that horn again would you i dont think they heard the first time urleyn put away his sword and took off his green hunting cap he wiped his brow ha yetamidous said he lifted the hunting horn took a gargantuan breath that raised his formidable body off the saddle of his mount and turned his expression into a deep frown then put the instrument to his lips and blew with all his might his face going scarlet with the effort the note was fit to split ears almost immediately there was a rustle and a commotion on the downslope side of the clump of bushes dewar was closest he caught a glimpse of a big thickset greybrown shape dart away at a furious pace towards another conglomeration of vegetation ha yetamidous bellowed flushed the fucker dewar urleyn shouted did you see him there sir ru yet this way urleyn wheeled his mount and charged off in the same direction dewar preferred to ride right at urleyns side whenever he could but in the dense thickets of the park woods it was often impossible and he would have to follow the protectors mount through the undergrowth over fallen tree trunks and under hanging boughs as best he could ducking and leaning and sometimes hanging half out of the saddle to avoid the snagging branches taking the direction that dewar had indicated urleyn set off at a gallop down a shallow slope his mount thundering along the hint of path amongst the crowding bushes dewar followed trying to keep in view the bobbing green shape that was urleyns cap the incline was covered by undergrowth and overhung by the crisscrossed trunks of trees which had started to fall but been caught by their healthier fellows a confusion of lushly green limbs and twisted branches made the going difficult the footing for the mounts was treacherous the deep litter of rotting leaves twigs fruits and seed cases could hide a multitude of holes burrow entrances rocks and partially decayed logs any one of which could break a mounts leg or trip it and bring it tumbling to the ground urleyn was going too fast dewar was never so fearful far his own life or for his masters than when he tried to keep up with him on some mad dash during a hunt he did his best all the same attempting to steer his mount down the trail of broken branches and trampled litter that urleyn had taken behind him he could hear the mounts of yetamidous and ruleuin also crashing in pursuit the animal they were hunting was an ort a powerful thickset scavenger a third the size of a mount they were usually regarded as belligerent and stupid but dewar thought the reputation undeserved orts ran until they were cornered and only then did they fight using their small sharp horns and their even sharper teeth and they tried to avoid the clear areas under the high canopies where galloping was easy and the ground relatively free of brush and other obstructions instead they made for places like this where a jumble of living and dead trees and their associated debris made both observation and chase difficult the trail led down a steepening slope towards a stream urleyn whooped and shouted and disappeared further ahead dewar cursed and urged his mount to go faster it shook its head and snorted refusing dewar tried to stop himself watching where his mount was putting its feet best to leave that to the animal he would be better occupied ducking to avoid the overhanging boughs and branches that threatened to knock him senseless or gouge out his eyes from far away he heard the sound of the rest of the hunt men shouting horns blaring hounds yapping prey screaming from the noise the others must have cornered a large group the single beast urleyn was chasing had succeeded in escaping without any hounds in pursuit it was a big animal and hunting it without hounds was a brave or foolish thing to do dewar took one hand briefly off the reins and wiped his face with one sleeve the day was hot and the air under the great trees still and sticky sweat still trickled down his face stinging in his eyes and producing a salty taste in his mouth behind him a sharp report was the noise of a gun going off probably an ort being dispatched or a musketeer losing half his face guns small enough to be carried by a man or even on the back of a mount were unreliable inaccurate and often more dangerous for the firer than the firedat gentlemen did not use them and crossbows were superior in most respects still the smiths and armourers laboured to produce better examples of muskets with each passing season and urleyn had used the weapons to good effect against cavalry charges during the war of succession dewar worried that one day within his lifetime guns would become reliable enough and more importantly sufficiently accurate to provide a bodyguard with his worst nightmares but for now that day still seemed a fair way off a scream came from somewhere off to the left down the small valley of the stream it might have been human or ort it sent a shiver through dewar despite the heat he had lost sight of urleyn branches and leaves swayed and thrashed ahead to his left with a cold feeling in his guts dewar wondered if the scream he had heard had been from the protector he swallowed hard wiping his face again and attempting to wave away insects buzzing angrily round his head a branch caught him on the face stinging his right cheek what if urleyn had fallen from his mount he might have been gored or had his throat bitten out last year near here one of the younger nobles had somersaulted off his falling mount and been impaled through the back and belly on a jagged remnant of tree trunk his screams had sounded like that scream hadnt they he tried to urge his mount to go faster a branch snagged on the crossbow slung over his back almost yanking him out of his saddle dewar hauled on the reins and the animal below him shrieked as the metal bit cut into its mouth he twisted in the saddle and tried unsuccessfully to untangle himself up slope he could see ruleuin and yetamidous approaching he swore pulled his dagger and hacked at the offending branch it parted from the tree remaining lodged in the crossbow but letting him go he kicked his spurs into the mounts side and it started off down the slope again he burst out of the undergrowth down a suddenly steep earth bank and into a clearing by the streamside urleyns mount stood riderless by a tree panting dewar looked wildly around for the protector then saw him standing a little way off near where the stream appeared from a jumble of fallen rocks his crossbow at his shoulder aiming at the big ort which was whining and squealing as it tried to jump up the slippy mosscovered rocks barring its way up and out of the clearing the ort leapt halfway up the boulder slope seemed to be about to find further purchase on the rocks and complete its escape then with a grunt it lost its footing and fell bouncing off a lower rock and landing heavily on its back by the side of the stream it struggled to its feet shaking itself urleyn advanced a couple of steps closer to the animal crossbow aimed dewar unslung his own bow as he dismounted he wanted to shout to urleyn to tell him to get back on his mount and leave the animal to him but he was afraid of distracting the other man while the ort was so close the ort turned its attention away from the rocks it growled at urleyn who was now five or six strides away its only way out now was past the man now thought dewar shoot loose fire now he was another ten or so strides behind urleyn he took a few slow steps to the right along the bottom edge of the earth bank widening the angle he could see between urleyn and the ort he tried to ready his own crossbow for firing without looking at it frightened to take his eyes off the protector and the prey he had cornered something was stuck in the crossbow he could feel it the branch it had snagged on earlier his hand closed around leaves and twigs trying to pull them free failing snarling the ort backed away from the slowly advancing urleyn the animals rump bumped into one of the mossy boulders it had tried to scale it angled its head downwards fractionally its slightly curved horns were only just longer than a mans hand but each came to a point sharp enough to disembowel a mount urleyn was wearing a light hide jerkin and trousers dewar had suggested heavier clothing or some chain mail in addition that morning before they had set off but the protector was having none of it the day was going to be too hot as it was the ort lowered its rear quarters with a clarity which seemed almost unnatural dewar could see the muscles in the orts quarters bunching tensing he pulled at the foliage stuck in his crossbow waggling it the dagger he might have to forget about the crossbow and try throwing the dagger it did not throw well but it was the only other choice he had the branch started to tear free from the crossbow brother a voice boomed out above him dewar whirled to see ruleuin high above him his mounts front hooves near the edge of the earth bank urleyns brother his face caught in a stray beam of sunlight was shading his eyes with one hand and looking across the clearing at the far bank then his gaze dropped to the clearing and urleyn oh he said quietly dewar looked quickly back the ort had not moved it was still growling softly still tensed saliva dripped from one edge of its mouth dewar heard his mount give a single small whimper urleyn made a tiny movement there was a barely heard click then the man seemed to freeze shit he said softly crossbows could kill from hundreds of strides away a quarrel from one could pierce a metal breastplate at close range there was rarely time to stop tension and load a bow during the heat of a hunt one rode with the bow wound up and ready to fire and many kept it loaded too crossbows hanging from saddles had shot more than one hunter in the foot or worse and those over a mans back could be even more deadly if they snagged on a branch in a thicket and so a hunting crossbow had a safety latch one had to remember to undo it before the weapon would fire in the excitement of the chase it was not unusual for a hunter to forget to do so and urleyns crossbow which had been king bedduns was an old one the latch release had been added later not designed in and was positioned badly towards the rear of the weapon and so not easy to slip urleyn would have to move one hand from its position to make the adjustment the king urleyn had executed might have his revenge from beyond the grave dewar held his breath the branch which had tangled in his own bow fell to the ground still not taking his eyes off the ort dewar watched urleyn slowly move one hand to the safety latch on his crossbow the weapon its weight supported by one hand shook the ort growled louder and shifted its position slightly sidestepping closer to the stream narrowing dewars angle of fire so much that one side of its head was now hidden by urleyns body above him dewar could hear ruleuins mount breathing dewar felt for his bows safety latch as he brought it up to his shoulder and took another step to the right to open the angle again what whats this where another voice said from above to the accompaniment of swishing leaves and stamping hooves yetamidous urleyn gently unclipped the safety on the crossbow and started to move his hand back towards the trigger again the ort charged urleyns crossbow started to drop hinging down as the protector tried to track the animal racing towards him he began to leap at the same time moving to the right obscuring the clear shot dewar had had of the ort dewar released the trigger on the bow just in time an instant before the bolt would have flown towards the protector suddenly urleyns hunting cap leaped from his head and went tumbling away towards the stream dewar registered this without thinking what had caused it he started to run towards urleyn leaning forward pushing off with one foot then the other holding the bow in front of his belly pointing to one side urleyn was slipping the foot he had put his weight on beginning to flick out from underneath him two steps three something whirred past dewars head and left a curl of wind to stroke his cheek an instant later there was a splash in the stream the water kicking high into the air four steps still picking up speed each stride more like a leap the protectors crossbow made a cracking twanging noise the bow pushed back in urleyns hands the bolt appeared in the left haunch of the charging ort making the animal scream leap into the air and twist its hips but when it landed again two strides from the stumbling falling urleyn it lowered its horned head and charged straight at him five six steps urleyn hit the ground the orts snout thudded into his left hip it reared back and darted forward again head lower this time aiming for the fallen mans midriff as he started to raise one hand in an attempt to fend the animal off seven dewar brought the crossbow round as he ran still at waist height he took a halfstride to steady it as best he could then pulled the trigger the quarrel hit the ort just above the left eye the animal quivered and stopped in its tracks the feathered bolt protruded from its skull like a third horn dewar was four then three steps away throwing the crossbow aside as his left hand crossed to his right hip and the handle of the long dagger urleyn kicked pivoting his lower body away from the ort which was looking down at the ground less than a pace away from him snorting and shaking its head while its front legs buckled and it settled to the ground dewar drew the dagger and leapt over urleyn as the older man rolled away from the ort landing between the two the ort snorted and puffed and shook its head and looked up with what dewar would always swear was a surprised expression as he plunged the dagger into its neck near its left ear and in one swift movement opened its throat to the air the animal made a whooshing noise and collapsed to the ground head tucked in to its chest its dark blood spreading around it dewar kept the dagger pointing towards it as he knelt there feeling behind him with his free hand to make sure where urleyn was are you all right sir he asked without looking round the ort jerked seemed to be trying to get to its feet then rolled over on its side legs trembling the blood continued to gush from its neck then the animal stopped shaking the blood began to seep rather than pulse and slowly the beasts legs folded in to its body as finally it died urleyn pulled himself up on to his knees by dewar he put one hand on the other mans shoulder the protectors grip felt shaky i am chastened i think would be the right word dewar thank you providence big bugger isnt he big enough sir dewar said deciding the motionless animal was little enough of a threat to let him risk glancing behind to where yetamidous and ruleuin were making their way down a shallowsloped part of the earth bank their mounts stood on the bank looking down at urleyn and his own mount the two men approached at a run yetamidous still held his discharged crossbow dewar looked back at the ort then stood sheathed the long dagger and helped urleyn to his feet the protectors arm trembled and he did not let go of dewars arm once he had stood up oh sir yetamidous cried clutching his crossbow to his chest his broad round face looked grey are you unharmed i thought i providence i thought id ruleuin came dashing up nearly tripping on dewars crossbow where it lay on the ground brother he threw his arms wide and almost knocked his brother over as he hugged him pulling urleyns hand away from dewar on the slope above the sounds of the main part of the hunt were coming closer dewar glanced back at the ort it looked very dead and who fired first perrund asked quietly and without moving her head was tipped lowered over the secret keep board studying her next move they were sitting in the visiting chamber of the harem towards ninth bell there had been a particularly noisy afterhunt feast that evening though urleyn had retired early it was yetamidous dewar said no more loudly his was the shot that lifted the protectors cap off his head the cap was found downstream the bolt was embedded inside a log by the stream a fingerbreadth lower indeed and so it was ruleuins that just missed you and just missed urleyn too though i think it was his waist it missed by a hands breadth or so not his head by a fingers could each bolt plausibly have been meant for the ort yes neither man is regarded as a marksman if yetamidous really was aiming for urleyns head then i imagine that most of the people in the court who consider themselves authorities on this sort of matter would judge it as a surprisingly accurate shot given the circumstances and yetamidous did seem genuinely shocked that hed missed the protector by so small a margin and ruleuin is his brother for all providence dewar sighed heavily then yawned and rubbed his eyes and yetamidous as well as being a poor shot is just not the type to be an assassin hmm perrund said in a particular tone what only as he said this did dewar realise how well he felt he had come to know the woman just the way she had made that single sound had meant much to him i have a friend who spends quite a lot of time in yetamidous company perrund said softly she has said that he delights in card games played for money he takes even greater delight in making it seem that he is ignorant of the subtleties of the games and pretending that he is a poor player he appears to forget the rules has to ask what to do at certain points inquires as to the meaning of terms the other players use and so on often he will deliberately lose a series of small bets in fact he is only waiting until an especially large wager is at stake whereupon he almost invariably wins much to his own apparent surprise she has seen this happen time after time his friends are wise to him now and are amused as well as wary but many a young and smirking nobleman who thought himself in the presence of a bumbling fool ripe for the picking has been lucky to leave yetamidous house with a coin to call his own dewar realised that he was biting his lip as he stared at the game board so the man is a skilled dissembler not a buffoon that is worrying he looked up at perrund though she did not meet his gaze he found himself inspecting the blonde mass of her gatheredup hair marvelling at its sheen and perfect fairness your friend would not have any further observations or opinions on the gentleman would she still not looking up perrund took a long deep breath he watched her shoulders in the red gown glanced down to the swell of material over her breasts once perhaps twice she said when yetamidous has been very drunk she has thought he revealed a certain jealous contempt for the protector and i think he has little regard for you she looked up suddenly dewar felt himself rock back slightly as though afflicted by the force of the gaze from those blueflecked gold eyes though none of this is to say that he is not still a good and loyal follower of the protector perrund said if one is determined to find fault then looking hard enough will produce reason to distrust everybody she looked down again of course dewar said and felt his face grow warm still i would rather know such things than not perrund moved one piece then another there she said dewar continued with his analysis of the game the doctor master the masked ball took place six days later the king still had a slight cold but the doctor had given hire a preparation made from flowers and mountain herbs which dried up his membranes by which i think she meant his nose for the duration of the dance she advised him to avoid alcohol and to drink copious amounts of water or better still fruit juice however i believe that during the ball he was quickly persuaded principally by himself that the definition of fruit juice might include wine and so drank a deal of that during the ball the grand ballroom of yvenage is a dramatic circular space half of whose circumference is taken up with floor to ceiling windows in the year since the court had last visited yvenir the windows had been refashioned throughout their lower quarter the great pastelgreen plaster panels had been replaced with a grid of wood holding smaller panes of thin colourless glass the glass was almost crystal in its perfection affording a barely distorted view of the moonlit landscape of forested hills across the valley the effect was extraordinarily eyecatching and it seemed from the expressions of wonder i heard uttered and the extravagance of the estimates made within my earshot concerning the cost of such a project that people could hardly have been more impressed had the new windows been made of diamond the orchestra sat on a low circular stage set in the centre of the room each player facing inwards to watch their conductor who swivelled towards each section of the musicians in turn the dancers swirled round this focus like fallen leaves caught within a spiralling wind the intricate sets and patterns of the dances providing an order within that apparent chaos the doctor was one of the more striking women present partly the effect was achieved through her height there were taller women there yet still she seemed to shine out amongst them she possessed a bearing that was in all senses naturally elevated she wore a gown that was plain by comparison with most it was a dark and lustrous green to set off the wide netted fan of her carefully arrayed red hair her gown was unfashionably narrow master i confess i felt excited and honoured to be there the doctor having no other escort it fell to me to accompany her to the ball and so i was able to think with some pleasure of my fellow apprentices and assistants most of whom were banished downstairs only the senior pages were permitted to attend and the few of those not expected to act purely as servants were all too aware of their inability to shine in a company containing so many junior noblemen the doctor in contrast treated me as her equal and made not one demand on me as an apprentice the whole ball long the mask i had chosen was a plain one of fleshcoloured paper painted so that one half looked happy with a big smile at the lips and a raised brow while the other side looked sad with downcast mouth and a small tear at the eye the doctors was a halfface made of light highly polished silver treated with some sort of lacquer it was i thought the best and perhaps the most disconcerting mask that i saw all that night for it reflected the observers gaze right back at them and so disguised the wearer for whatever that was worth given the doctors unmistakable form better than the most cunning creation of feathers filigreed gold or sparkling gems beneath the mirrorlike mask the doctors lips looked full and tender she had coloured them with the red oilcream that many of the ladies at court use for such occasions i had never seen her adorn herself so before how moist and succulent that mouth looked we sat at a great table in one of the ballrooms anterooms surrounded by fine ladies of the court and their escorts and looked down upon by huge paintings of nobles their animals and estates servants with drinks trays circulated everywhere i couldnt recall having seen a ball so well staffed before though it did seem to me that some of the servants looked a bit rough and ready handling their trays with a degree of awkwardness the doctor did not choose to stay in the ballroom itself between dances and seemed reluctant to take part at all i formed the impression she was only there because the king expected her to be and while she might have enjoyed the dances she was afraid of making some error of etiquette i myself also felt nervous as well as excited such grand balls are opportunities for much pomp and ceremony attracting from all around scores of great families dukes and duchesses rulers of allied principalities and their entourages and generally producing a kind of concentration of people of power and circumstance one sees seldom enough even in the capital little wonder that these are occasions when allegiances plans alliances and enmities are formed both on the political and national scale of things and at the personal level it was impossible not to feel affected by the urgency and momentousness of the atmosphere and my poor emotions felt tattered and frazzled before the ball was properly begun at least we ought to remain safely on the periphery with so many princes dukes barons ambassadors and the like demanding his time many of whom he would not see from one year to the next save for this single event the king was unlikely to concern himself with the doctor and myself who were at his beck and call during every day of the year i sat there immersed in the hum of conversation and listening to the distant sound of a dance tune and i wondered what plots and schemes were being hatched what promises and enemies were being made what desires stoked what hopes squashed a group of people were passing us heading for the ballroom the small figure of a man at their head turned towards us his mask was an old one made of blueblack feathers ah the lady doctor unless i am grievously mistaken came the harsh cracked voice of duke walen he stopped his wife his second much younger than he and small and voluptuous hung on his arm her golden mask dripping with gems various junior members of the walen family and their retainers arranged themselves in a halfcircle around us i stood as did the doctor duke walen i assume she said bowing carefully how are you very well i would ask you how you are however i assume that physicians look after themselves better than anybody else so i shall ask how you think the king is how is he the duke seemed to be slurring his words the king is generally well his ankle still needs treatment and he has the remains of a slight good good walen looked round at the doors leading into the ballroom and how do you like our ball it is most impressive tell me do they have balls in this place drezen where you come from they do sir and are they as fine as this or are they better and more glorious and put our sad and feeble efforts into the shade does drezen entirely outdo us in every matter as it does by your claims in medicine i think the dances we hold in drezen are rather less splendid than this sir are they but how can this be i had become quite convinced through your many comments and observations that your homeland was in advance of ours in every respect why you talked of it in such glowing terms that sometimes i thought you were describing a fairytale land i think the duke will find that drezen is quite as real as haspidus faith i am almost disappointed well there we are he turned to go then stopped again we shall see you dancing later shant we i imagine so sir and will you perhaps undertake to demonstrate for us a dance from drezen and teach it to us a dance sir yes i cannot imagine that drezeners share all our dances and possess none that we would not recognise that is not feasible surely the dukes small slightly hunched figure turned jerkily from one side to the other seeking endorsement oh yes his wife purred from behind her gold and gemstone mask i should think that in drezen they have the most advanced and interesting dances i regret that i am no dance instructor the doctor said i wish now that i had been more assiduous in learning how to comport myself at a ball sadly my youth was spent in more academic circles it is only since i have had the good fortune to arrive in haspidus that i but no the duke cried my dear woman you cannot be claiming that there is some aspect of civilised behaviour in which you have nothing to teach us why this is unheard of oh my dear lady my faith is shaken i beg you to reconsider search your doctorly memories at least attempt to drag up for us some recollection of a physicians cotillion a surgeons ballet at the very least a nurses hornpipe or a patients jig the doctor appeared unruffled if she was sweating behind her mask as i was behind mine she gave no sign of it in a calm and even voice she said the duke flatters me in his estimation of the breadth of my knowledge i shall of course obey his instruction but i im sure you can im sure the duke said and pray what part of drezen was it you said that you are from the doctor drew herself up a little more from pressel on the island of napthilia sir ah yes yes napthilia napthilia indeed you must miss it terribly i imagine a little sir having no one of your own kind to talk to in your native language unable to catch up on the latest news lacking compatriots to reminisce with a sad business being an exile it has its compensations sir yes good very well think on about those dances we shall see you later perhaps highkicking whirling and whooping eh perhaps the doctor said i for one was glad i could not see her expression behind the mask of course being a halfface mask her lips were visible i began to worry how much aspersion a pair of full red lips could convey just so walen said until then madam he nodded the doctor bowed subtly duke walen turned and led his party towards the ballroom we sat down i took off my mask and wiped my face i think the duke was a little the worse for wine mistress i said the mirrormask faced me my own visage looked back distorted and flushed those two red lips gave a small smile her eyes remained unreadable behind the mask yes do you think he will mind that i cannot provide him with a drezeni dance i really am unable to recall any i think the duke was being rather rude to you mistress the wine was doing most of the talking he sought only to well i am sure as a gentleman he would not seek to humiliate you but he was perhaps having a little sport with you the detail of the matter was not important he will probably forget most of what has passed here i hope so do you think i am a poor dancer oelph oh no mistress i have not seen you put a step wrong so far that is my only goal shall we a young man in a hide and gemstone mask and wearing the dress uniform of a captain in the kings own frontier guards appeared at our side he bowed deeply master oelph madam doctor vosill he asked there was a pause the doctor looked at me yes i blurted the king commands me to invite you to dance with the royal party during the next figure it starts directly oh shit i heard myself say we are delighted to accept the kings kind invitation the doctor said rising smoothly and nodding to the officer she held her arm out towards me i took it in mine please follow me the captain said we found ourselves arranged in a figure of sixteen with king quience a small buxom young princess from one of the sequestered kingdoms in the mountains beyond the land of tassasen a tall brotherandsister prince and princess from outer trosile duke quettil and his sister lady ghehere the duke and duchess of keitz uncle and aunt to guard commander adlain their startlingly proportioned daughter and her fiance prince hills of faross the guard commander adlain himself and lady ulier and lastly a young lady i was introduced to and had seen about court but whose name escaped me then and now and her escort the brother of lady ulier the young duke ulresile we had first encountered at the kings table in the hidden gardens i noticed that the youthful duke wade sure that he positioned himself in our half of the figure so ensuring that he would have two opportunities to dance with the doctor rather than one the introductions were made and the dance was named by a very impressively dressed wiester wearing a plain black mask we took our places in two lines male facing female the king took a last drink from a goblet replaced it on a tray waved away the servant carrying it and nodded to wiester who in turn nodded to the conductor of the orchestra the music began my heart was beating hard and fast i was reasonably familiar with the figure we were engaged upon but still concerned that i might make a mistake i was just as concerned that the doctor might commit a serious misstep i did not think she had danced so formally complicated a figure before you are enjoying the ball madam duke quettil asked as he and the doctor advanced upon each other bowed held hands circled and stepped i was similarly engaged with the lady ghehere who gave every impression through her carriage and bearing that she had no interest whatsoever in conversing with the assistant to a woman who claimed the honourable but unnoble title of doctor and so i was at least able both to dance without treading on her toes and to attend to what passed between my mistress and the duke very much duke quettil i was surprised when the king insisted that you be invited to join us but then he is most most merry this evening dont you think he does appear to be enjoying himself not too much in your opinion it is not my place to judge the king in any aspect sir save that of his health quite i was granted the privilege of choosing the figure is it to your taste entirely so duke it is perhaps a little complex perhaps so much to remember that is not entirely natural so many opportunities to make a mistake dear duke the doctor said with some concern i hope this is not some subtly disguised warning i happened to be circling my immediate partner with my hands clasped behind my back and was facingthe duke quettil at this point i got the impression that he was momentarily taken aback unsure quite what to say for the moment before the doctor went on you are not preparing to step on my toes are you the duke gave a small high laugh and with that the timeous demands of the dance took both the doctor and myself away from the centre of the figure while our other fourset took the centre we stood alongside each other our hands clasped or on hips as appropriate marking time with one foot then the other all right so far oelph the doctor said i thought she sounded slightly breathless and even as though she was enjoying herself aye so far mistress the duke seemed were you teaching quettil extra steps there doctor adlain asked from her other side im sure that there is nothing i could teach the duke guard commander im equally sure he feels just the same way madam and yet he appeared to lose his way for a moment in that last turn it is a complicated figure as he himself pointed out to me yet one he chose indeed he did does count walen dance it as well do you think adlain was silent for a moment i fancy he might or at least fancy that he fancies he might i saw him glance at the doctor his halfmask allowed him to show a smile however i myself find it takes all my concentration just minding my own steps without attempting to scrutinise somebody elses ah excuse me another set good doctor young duke ulresile said meeting her in the centre his companion the young lady whose name i forget seemed no more inclined to talk to nee than lady ghehere duke the doctor replied you look most striking thank you that mask is it brotechian no sir it is silver ah indeed but does it originate in brotechen no in haspide i had a jeweller fashion it ah it is your own design how fascinating my toe sir what oh oh im sorry and your mask duke what oh ah some old family thing do you like it does it please you there is a companion one for a lady i would be honoured if you would accept it with my compliments i could not possibly sir im sure your family would object thank you nevertheless but it is nothing that is it is very it is i should say regarded as most elegant and graceful the one for a lady i mean but it is entirely mine to gift it would be an honour the doctor paused as though considering this offer then she said and an even greater one for me sir however i already possess the mask which you see and have admired and i find i can only wear one at a time but however with that it was time for the two to separate and the doctor returned to my side are you getting all this oelph she asked as we caught our breath and executed the markingtime steps mistress your partners appear to become mute in your presence and yet you had the look of somebody concentrating on a conversation i did mistress i asked feeling my face redden under my mask you did oelph i beg your pardon mistress oh its quite all right oelph i dont mind listen away with my blessing the music changed again and it was time for the two rows of dancers to form a circle and then reconstitute themselves in an alternate order in the circle the doctor held my hand firmly but gently her hand which id swear squeezed mine just before she let go felt warm and dry and the skin smooth before too long i was dancing in the middle of the great ballroom of our kingdoms second palace and arguably its first in opulence with a smiling giggling porcelainskinned princess from the halfhidden kingdoms in the high snowbesieged mountains that climb mostway into the sky beyond the savage anarchy of tassasen her cloudwhite skin was tattooed on eyelid and temple and pierced with jewelled studs at her nostrils and the septum between nose and upper lip she was short but curvaceous dressed in a highly ornamented and colourful version of the booted straightskirted fashion of her people she spoke little imperial and no haspidian and her knowledge of the dance steps was somewhat fragmentary still she contrived to be an enchanting dancing partner and i confess that i caught little of what passed between the doctor and the king noting only that the doctor looked very tall and graceful and correct while the king seemed most animated and merry even if his steps were not as fluent as they would normally have been the doctor had strapped his ankle up especially tightly that afternoon knowing that he would be certain to take part in the dancing both wore smiles beneath their halfmasks the music swelled and rolled over us the grand people and beautiful masks and costumes surged and eddied about us and we resplendent in our finery were the bright focus of it all the doctor moved and swayed at my side and occasionally i caught a hint of her perfume which was one that i was never able to identify and cannot ever recall seeing her apply it was an astonishing scent it reminded me at once of burned leaves and sea spray of newly turned earth and of seasonal flowers in bloom there was too something tenebrous and intense and sensual about the scent something sweet and sharp at the same tune at once lithe and fullbodied and utterly enigmatic in later years when the doctor was long gone from us and even her most manifest features were becoming difficult to recall with perfect clarity i would in diverse moments of private intimacy catch a hint of that same odour but the encounter would always prove fleeting i freely confess that on such occasions the recollection of that longago night the magnificent ballroom the splendid profusion of the dancers and the breatharresting presence of the doctor seemed like a capstan of ache and longing attached by the ropes of memory to my heart squeezing and tightening and compressing it until it seemed inevitable that it must be burst asunder engulfed in that riotous storm of the senses by eye and ear and nose beset i was at once terrified and exhilarated and experienced that strange halfelatory halffatalistic alloy of emotions that leads one to feel that if one died at that precise moment suddenly and painlessly indeed ceased to be rather than went through the process of dying at all then it would somehow be a blessed and culminatory thing the king seems happy mistress i observed as we stood side by side again yes but he is starting to limp the doctor said and sent the briefest of frowns in duke quettils direction this was an unwise choice of dance for a man with an ankle which is still recovering i watched the king but of course he was not dancing at that point however i could not help but notice that rather than make the fillin steps he was standing still weight on his good leg clapping his hands in time instead how is your princess the doctor asked me with a smile her name is skoon i think i said frowning or that may be the name of her homeland or her father im not sure she was introduced as princess of wadderan i believe the doctor told me i doubt that skuin is her name that is the name of the type of dress she is wearing a skuintrel i imagine she thought you were pointing at that when asking for a name however given that she is a female of the wadderani royal family her name is probably gul something or other oh you know of her people this confused me for the sequestered or halfhidden kingdoms are some of the most remote and thoroughly landlocked places in the known world i have read about them the doctor said urbanely before being pulled into the centre to dance with the tall trosilian prince i was paired with his sister a lanky generally ungainly and rather plain woman she nevertheless danced well enough and seemed quite as merry as the king she was happy to engage me in conversation though she did seem under the impression that i was a nobleman of some distinction an illusion which i was probably rather too slow to dispel vosill you look wonderful i heard the king tell the doctor i saw her head dip a little and she murmured something back to him which i could not hear i experienced a pang of jealousy that turned for an instant to wild fear when i realised who it was i was feeling jealous of providence our own dear king the dance went on we met with the duke and duchess of keitz then formed a circle once more the doctors hand was as firm and warm and dry as before and then took up again with our earlier eightsome i was breathing hard by this time and did not wonder that people the age of duke walen usually sat out this sort of dance especially when one was masked it was a long hot and tiring business duke quettil danced with the doctor in frosty silence young ulresile fairly ran into the middle of our group to meet the doctor and continued in his attempt to press some portion of his familys equity upon her while she parried each suggestion as neatly as it was made awkwardly finally and thankfully for my feet were becoming quite sore in my new dress shoes and i was in some need of relieving myself we shared a set with lady ulier and guard commander adlain tell me doctor adlain said as they danced together what is a gahan im not sure do you mean a gaan of course you pronounce it so much better than i yes a gaan it is the title of an officer in the drezeni civil command in haspidus or in imperial terms it would roughly correspond to a town master or burghead though without the military authority and with an additional expectation that the man or woman would be capable of representing drezen at junior consular level when abroad most illuminating why do you ask sir oh i read a report recently from one of our ambassadors from cuskery i think which mentioned the word as though it was some sort of rank but without including any explanation i intended to ask one of our diplomatic people but it must have slipped my mind seeing you and thinking of drezen obviously secured it again i see the doctor said there was more passed between them but then lady ulier duke ulresiles sister spoke to me my brother seemed most fixed upon your lady physician she said lady ulier was a few years older than either myself or her brother with the same narrowpinched and sallow look as he though her dark eyes were bright and her brown hair lustrous her voice was somewhat strident and abrasive even when pitched low however yes i said i could think of little else yes i imagine he seeks a physician for our family which is of course of the finest quality our own midwife grows old perhaps the lady physician will provide a suitable replacement when the king grows tired of her should we think her suitable and sufficiently trustworthy with the greatest respect maam i think that would demean her talents the lady looked down her long nose at me do you indeed well i think not and you perjure yourself sir for the greatest respect you could have accorded me would have been to have said nothing to contradict what i had just said i beg your pardon maam it was simply that i could not bear to see so noble and fair a lady so deceived regarding the abilities of doctor vosill yes and you are oelph my lady it is my honour to have been the doctors assistant throughout the time she has treated our good king and your family is no more my lady my parents were of the koetic persuasion and perished when the imperial regiment of our late king sacked the city of derla i was a baby in swaddling at the time an officer took pity on me when he might as well have thrown me on to a fire and brought me back to haspidus i was raised amongst the orphans of officers a loyal and faithful servant of the crown the lady looked at me with some horror in a strangled voice she said and you wish to teach me the proprieties of who should serve our family she laughed in such a way that the shriek produced surely convinced most of those surrounding us that i had just stamped upon her toe then for the rest of the set she kept her nose angled as though trying to balance a marblefruit upon its tip the music had stopped we all bowed to each other and the king hobbling a little was surrounded by dukes and princes all of whom seemed desperately anxious to talk to him the little wadderan princess whose name i had established was gulaplit gave me a polite wave as a forbiddinglooking chaperone appeared at her side and escorted her away are you all right oelph the doctor asked i am very well mistress i told her a little warm lets get something to drink and then step outside what do you say id say that was a very good idea mistress if not two we collected two tall goblets of some form of aromatic punch which we were assured by the servants was weak in alcohol and then with our masks off at last and following a brief period to obey the call of nature we made our way out on to the balcony which ran round the outside of the ballroom joining a good hundred or so others taking the fragrant night air it was a dark night and would be long seigen had almost joined xamis at sundown that evening and for a good quarter of the wholeday there would be only the moons to light the sky foy and iparine were our lanterns that evening their blueygrey luminescence filled out along the balconys tiles and the terraces of garden fountain and hedge by glowing paper lamps cressets of oilwood and scented poletorches duke and duchess ormin and their party approached us on the balcony their way lit for them by dwarves carrying short poles on the tip of which were large spheres of clear glass containing what looked like millions of soft and tiny sparks as these curious apparitions came closer we saw that the globes contained hundreds and hundreds of glowflies all milling and darting about in their strange confinement they spread little light but much amazement and delight the duke exchanged nods with the doctor though the duchess did not deign to acknowledge us did i hear you telling the very young but very grand lady ulier your life history oelph the doctor asked sipping at her goblet as we strolled i mentioned something about my upbringing mistress it may have been a mistake she cannot think better of either of us for it from the impression not to mention the looks i got i do not think she could think much less of me but im sorry if she finds your orphanhood in some way reprehensible that and the fact that my parents were koetics well one must allow for the prejudices of nobles your forebears professed themselves not only republican but so godfearing they had neither dread nor respect left for any worldly authority theirs was a sadly mistaken creed mistress and i am not proud to be associated with it though i honour my parents memory as any child must the doctor looked at me you do not resent what happened to them to the extent that i resent their suppression as a people who preached forgiveness rather than violence i condemn the empire for the fact that i was recognised as an innocent and rescued i thank providence that i was discovered by a haspidian officer who acted under the more humane orders of our good kings father but i never knew my parents mistress and i have never met anybody who knew them and their faith is meaningless to me and the empire whose very existence might have fuelled an urge for vengeance on my part is gone brought down by the fire which fell from the sky one unchallengeably mighty force brought down by an even greater one i looked at her then and felt from the expression in her eyes that we were talking and not just behaving as equals resentment mistress what is the point of feeling that she took my hand in hers for a moment then and squeezed it rather as she had during the dance and after that she put her arm through mine an action that had fallen into disuse and even disrepute within polite society and which occasioned not a few looks to my own surprise i felt honoured rather than embarrassed it was a gesture of friendliness rather than anything else but it was a gesture of closeness and comfort and i felt just then that i was the most favoured man in all the palace regardless of birth title rank or circumstance ah i am murdered murdered help me help me murdered the voice rang out across the balcony everybody stopped as though frozen into statues then looked round at a tall door leading from one of the smaller rooms next to the ballroom as it opened further and a halfclothed figure fell slowly out of it into the light gripping the pale gold curtains that fluted back inside where thin girlish screams began to sound the man dressed only in a white shirt gradually rolled over so that his face pointed towards the moons the pure white shirt seemed to glow in the moonlight high on his chest near one shoulder there was a bright vividly red mark like a freshly picked blossom the mans collapse to the stones of the balcony was accomplished with a sort of idle grace until his violent grip on the curtains and his weight overcame their supports and they gave way with that he slumped quickly to the ground and the curtains came billowing folding down upon him like syrup on to the body of a struggling insect entirely covering his round shape so that while the screams from the room still sounded and everybody still stood where they were staring it was almost as though there was no body there at all the doctor moved first dropping her goblet on to the balcony with a crash and running towards the tall slowly swinging door it was a moment or two longer before i could break the spell that had descended upon me but eventually i was able to follow the doctor through a crowd of servants most of whom suddenly and to my confusion seemed to be carrying swords to where the doctor was already kneeling throwing back the folds of curtain burrowing down to where the twitching bleeding form of duke walen lay dying the bodyguard loose the small catapult bucked the arm indeed not much bigger than a mans outstretched arm flicked forward and thudded against the hide cushion on the weapons tall crossbeam the stone burred away through the air arcing over the lower terrace and down towards the garden below the projectile hit alongside one of dewars cities embedding itself in the carefully raked soil and kicking up a big puff of redbrown dust that hung for a while in the air slowly drifting off to the one side and settling gradually back to the ground oh bad luck very close next time very nearly general lattens dewar said he had been sitting on the balustrade arms crossed one leg dangling he jumped off on to the black and white tiles of the balcony and squatted by his own miniature catapult he pulled quickly and powerfully on the round wheel which ratcheted the creaking groaning wooden arm back until it settled about threequarters of the way towards the horizontal rear crossmember the arm bowed fractionally with the strain of the twisted hide at its base trying to force it forward again lattens meanwhile got up on to the same stone rail dewar had been sitting on his nurse held on tightly to the back of his jacket to prevent him from falling lattens raised his toy telescope to his eye to survey the damage done in the garden below a little to the left next time my lad urleyn told his son the protector his brother ruleuin doctor bredelle bileth commander zespiole and the concubine perrund sat attended by various servants on an awninged platform raised to about the same height as the balustrade and overlooking the scene lattens stamped his foot on the stonework his nurse held him tighter perrund veiled in gauzy red turned to the protector sir im sure the nurse holds him well enough but it makes my bones ache seeing him up there would you humour one of your older ladies timid foolishness by calling for a stepladder it would let him see over the rail without having to climb on to it foreign minister bileth frowned and made a tssking noise urleyn pursed his lips hmm good idea he said he beckoned a servant the entire terrace of the garden two storeys below had been divided into two and modelled to resemble a landscape in miniature with hills mountains forests a large walled capital city a dozen or so smaller cities twice as many towns many roads and bridges and three or four rivers flowing into a couple of small about bathsized lakes on each side and then on into a large body of water which represented an inland sea the sea was in the shape of two rough circles which just met in the middle so that there was a short narrow channel connecting the two great lakes various of each territorys towns and cities lay on the shores of the two smaller lakes with even more on the coasts of the two lobes of the sea though in each case one territory had many more settlements round one part of the sea than the other dewars territory having the most round the lobe of water nearer to the balcony and the two catapults dewar secured the triggering post on his catapult and carefully unhitched the winding mechanism then selected a stone from the pile between the two model weapons and once lattens had climbed down from the balustrade loaded the stone into the cup at the end of the machines arm he repositioned the catapult according to chalk marks on the black tiles stood eyes narrowed to survey his target area squatted to adjust the catapults position once more then took the stone out of the cup and reconnected the winding mechanism to let out a little of the strain before relatching the triggering post oh come on dewar lattens said jumping up and down and shaking his telescope he was dressed as a noble general and the servant who was tensioning and repositioning his catapult was in the uniform of a ducal bombardier dewar closed one eye and made a fearful grimace as he turned to the boy har he said in a voice a rather unsubtle actor might employ when asked to impersonate a worthy rustic beggin the young massurs pardin to be sure sor but i has got to be doin me adjussmints dont ye know har providence the fellows a fool indeed bileth muttered however urleyn laughed and bileth found it in him to affect a smile lattens squealed with delight at this nonsense and put his hands to his mouth nearly sticking his telescope into his eye dewar made a few final adjustments to his catapult then with a look round to make sure lattens was well out of the way said fire me boys and flicked the triggering latch away the rock whistled into the blue sky lattens howled with excitement and ran to the balustrade dewars rock landed almost in the centre of one of the smaller lakes in lattens territory the boy shrieked oh no dewar had already landed a hefty projectile in the other small lake on lattens side swamping all the towns and the single city on its shores lattens had hit one of dewars lakes too but not the other the rock sent up a great tall fountain of water the waves from the impact rippled quickly out heading for the shore aargh lattens cried the waves made landfall causing the water first to retreat from the miniature beaches and ports and then rear up and wash against the flimsily made buildings of the lakeside towns washing them all away oh unlucky young sir unlucky doctor bredelle said then in a low voice to urleyn added sir i think the boy grows overexcited fine shot dewar urleyn called clapping oh let him be excited doctor he said to bredelle in a lower voice he has spent long enough swaddled in his bed its good to see a bit of colour in his cheeks again as you wish sir but he is still not fully recovered mr dewar would make a fine bombardier commander zespiole said urleyn laughed we could use him in ladenscion we could dispatch him forthwith agreed bileth things go better there dont they brother ruleuin said letting a servant refill his glass he glanced at bileth who assumed a grave expression urleyn snorted better than when they were going badly he agreed but still not well enough he looked to his brother then back at his son who was anxiously supervising the loading of his own catapult the boy grows better if that keeps up i may take it as my signal to assume command of the war myself at last ruleuin said oh im sure that would be the best thing brother you are our best general still the war in ladenscion needs you i hope i may accompany you there may i i have a fine company of cavalry now you must come and see them train some day thank you brother urleyn said smoothing a hand over his short grey beard however i am undecided i may ask you to stay on here in crough and be my regent in equal partnership with yetamidous and zespiole would you rather that oh sir ruleuin reached out and touched the protectors arm that would be a singular honour no it would be a treble honour brother urleyn told him with a tired smile zespiole what do you say i heard what you said sir but i can scarcely believe it would you honour me so i would if i depart for the borderlands it is still not certain yet bileth you will advise my trio of proxies as well as you have me on matters foreign bileth whose face had taken on a frozen expression when he had heard what the protector was proposing let his features relax somewhat of course sir and general yetamidous is agreeable ruleuin asked he will stay if i ask him to or like you he will gladly come to ladenscion with me i could use each of you in both places but that cannot be sir excuse my interruption the lady perrund said the ladder a wooden library stepladder was carried forward by two servants and deposited on the balconys tiled surface near the viewing platform what ah yes lattens urleyn called to his son who was still fussing over the degree of tension in the catapult and the size of rock to throw here this might be a better observation point for you position it as you see fit lattens looked uncertain for a moment then appeared to take to the idea ahha a siege engine he wagged the telescope at dewar who scowled at the ladder as the servants brought it forward closer to the edge of the terrace i have the measure of you now bad baron lattens cried dewar growled and retreated with comedic fearfulness from the steps as they approached lattens climbed up the steps to the top so that his feet were about level with the head of his nurse who had remained on the balcony but followed him round as hed ascended watching anxiously dewar sidled up to the steps as well glowering up at the boy that will do nicely bombardier lattens yelled fire when ready the rock hurtled up and out and for a moment seemed to hang above the coastline of the part of the inland sea which held most of dewars remaining cities oh no lattens cried the rules were that each player could drop only one stone into the inland sea lattens and dewar each had accordingly one very large stone apiece to be used for this very purpose in the hope of swamping a handful of his enemys cities with one strike the stone lattens had caused to be lobbed on this occasion was a mediumsized projectile if it landed in the sea especially in one of the shallower areas near the coast it might do very little damage on its own while at the same time preventing the boy from landing his one big rock where it might cause the most destruction the rock whacked into a coastal city causing a small splash from the harbour but sending up a greater cloud of dust and scattering splintered wood and bits of delicate clay buildings across the landscape and splashing out across the water yes boy urleyn said jumping to his feet ruleuin rose too well done fine shot called bredelle bileth clapped decorously zespiole thumped his seatarm magnificent dewar clenched his fists and let out a roar of anguish hurrah lattens yelled and whirled his arms about he overbalanced and began to fall off the steps perrund watched dewar dart forward then check himself as the nurse caught the boy lattens frowned down at his nurse then struggled in her arms until she put him back where he had been standing mind yourself boy urleyn called laughing im sorry sir perrund said her hand was at her throat just beneath the red veil where her heart seemed to have lodged i thought hed be safer oh hes fine urleyn told her with a sort of jovial exasperation never you fear he turned back damn fine shot lad he shouted more of those if you please then the greatgranddad rock in the centre of his sea ladenscion is finished lattens cried shaking his fist at dewar and holding on to the projecting spire of the steps with his other hand providence protects us oh its ladenscion now not the empire urleyn laughed brother ruleuin said i cannot think which would be the greater honour to be at your side or to help rule in your place be assured i shall do whatever you ask of me to the best of my abilities im sure you will urleyn said as your brother says sir commander zespiole said leaning forward to catch the protectors eye well it may not come to that urleyn said we may have news by the next rider that the barons are desperate to sue for peace but i am glad you both accept my proposal gladly brother humbly sir good so we are all agreed dewars next shot thudded into farmland causing him to caper arid make cursing sounds lattens laughed and followed that with a shot which destroyed a town dewars next demolished a bridge lattens replied with a couple of offtarget rocks but then hit a city while dewars matching shots hit nothing but earth lattens decided to use his biggest rock and attempt to obliterate most of dewars remaining cities in one go thats the boy his father called strike now with much groaning and creaking from the coiled twists of stretched hide and a few groans and whimpers from dewar standing watching the arm of lattens catapult was tightened to its maximum extension and sat arched with stored power are you sure thats not too much urleyn shouted youll hit your own sea no sir ill put other rocks on as well as the big one very well then the protector told his son mind you dont break the weapon though father the boy called may i load it myself oh please the servant dressed like a bombardier was about to pick up the heaviest rock from lattens pile of ammunition he hesitated dewar lost his comical expression perrund took a deep breath sir she said but was interrupted i cannot allow the boy to lift such a large rock sir doctor bredelle said leaning close to the protector it will put too great a strain on his system his frame is weakened by the long time spent in bed urleyn looked at zespiole im more worried about the catapult loosing while hes loading it sir the guard commander said generals do not load their own weapons sir urleyn told the boy sternly i know that father but please this is not a real war it is only pretend well shall i give you a hand then urleyn called no lattens yelled stamping his foot and tossing his redblond curls no thank you sir urleyn sat back with a gesture of resignation and a small smile the lad knows his own mind he is mine all right he waved to his son very well general lattens load as you will and may providence guide the projectiles lattens chose a couple of smaller rocks and loaded them one at a time into the waiting cup of the catapult panting as he lifted them up then he squatted took a firm grip of the biggest stone and with a grunt lifted it to his chest he turned and staggered towards his catapult dewar took a halfstep closer to the machine lattens did not seem to notice he grunted again as he hoisted the rock up to his neck level and shuffled closer to the tensed arm of the waiting machine dewar seemed to slide rather than step another stride closer to the catapult almost to within grabbing distance of the boy while his gaze concentrated both on the firing latch and on lattens feet and legs as they edged nearer to it the boy teetered as he leant over the catapults cup he was breathing hard the sweat running down his brow steady lad perrund heard the protector whisper his hands clutched at the arms of his chair the knuckles pale with their own loaded tension dewar was closer now within reach of the boy lattens grunted and rolled the rock into the cup it crunched on top of the two already occupying the scoop the whole catapult seemed to quiver and dewar tensed as though about to pounce on the child and tear him away but then the boy took a step back wiped his sweating face and turned to smile at his father who nodded and sat back in his seat sighing with relief he looked at ruleuin and the others there now he said and swallowed mr bombardier lattens said with a flourish towards the catapult the servant nodded and took up his position by the machine dewar had drifted back towards his own catapult wait lattens called and ran up the library stepladder again his nurse resumed her place beneath lattens took out his sword raised it and then dropped it now the catapult made a terrific snapping noise the one large rock and the two smaller ones sailed into the air in significantly different directions and everybody sat or leant forward to see where they would land the big rock missed its target splashing into the shallows near one of dewars coastal cities and showering it with mud but otherwise doing little damage one of the smaller stones hit some of dewars farmland and the other demolished one of lattens own towns oh oh dear bad luck young master for shame lattens said nothing he stood looking utterly crestfallen at the top of the ladder his little wooden sword hanging loosely in his hand he looked back at his father with sad dejected eyes his father frowned then winked at him the boys expression did not change silence hung under the platforms awning dewar jumped up on the balustrade and crouched there knuckles dragging on the stonework ha he said then jumped down missed he had already tensioned his own catapult the arm bowed back to about the twothirds position victory is mine heeheel he chose the biggest stone from his own supply wound some more tension into the machine and put the rock in the scoop he looked up at lattens with a fierce mischievous grin which faltered only momentarily when he saw the look on the childs face he rubbed his hands and wagged one finger at the boy now we see whos boss my young pretendergeneral he adjusted the catapult slightly and then pulled the lanyard the catapult juddered and the great rock whooshed up into the sky dewar leapt back on to the stone railing again the giant stone was a sailing black shape against the sky and clouds for a long moment then it rushed back to earth and dropped with a titanic splash into the sea the water threw itself up into the air in a great explosive tower of white foam then slumped back down and rushed out in all directions in a mighty circular wave what dewar screeched from the balustrade putting his hands to the sides of his head and grabbing two handfuls of hair no no nooooo ha ha lattens yelled pulled his generals hat off his head and threw it in the air ha ha ha the rock had fallen not into the lobe of the sea which was rimmed mostly by lattens towns and cities but that which held almost all dewars intact settlements the great wave rushed out from where it had landed a good couple of strides or so from the straits separating the two lobes of the sea one by one it swamped the cities and towns by the water flooding one or two of lattens but destroying a great deal more of dewars hurrah ruleuin yelled and threw his own hat into the air perrund smiled broadly at dewar from behind the veil urleyn nodded and grinned and clapped lattens gave a deep bow and made a rude tonguewagging gesture at dewar who had rolled off the stone railing and was curled up on the tiles by the side of the balustrade thumping one clenched fist weakly off the tiled surface no more he moaned i give in hes too good for me providence defends the protector and all his generals i am an unworthy wretch ever to have set myself against them take pity on me and let me surrender like the abject cur that i am i win lattens said and with a grin at his nurse he twirled on the platform and let himself fall backwards into the womans arms she grunted with the impact but caught the boy and held him here lad here his father stood and went to the front of the platform holding out his arms bring that brave young warrior to me the nurse duly delivered lattens into his fathers embrace while the others gathered round applauding and laughing and clapping backs and offering congratulations a fine campaign young man quite splendid providence in your pocket well well done and then we could play the game at night father when its a dark night and make flameballs and light them and set the cities on fire couldnt we dewar stood and brushed himself down perrund looked at him over her veil and he grinned and even blushed a little the doctor well the king asked the doctor leaned closer and peered at the wound duke walens body lay on a long table in the withdrawing room where he had been murdered the small feast that had occupied the table when we had brought the body in had been set on the floor to one side the table cloth had been wrapped over the dukes body so that his legs and belly and his head had been covered leaving only his chest exposed he had been pronounced dead by the doctor though not until after she had done the most extraordinary thing the doctor had seemed to kiss the old man while he lay bleeding and shaking on the balcony she had knelt by his side and blown her own breath into him puffing out first her cheeks and then his so that his chest rose and fell she was at the same time attempting to staunch the flow of blood that had issued from the wound in his chest using a piece of material torn from her own dress this then became my duty using a clean kerchief while she concentrated on blowing into duke walens mouth after a while when she had been unable to feel any pulse for some long time she had shaken her head and sat back exhausted on the floor a ring of servants all with swords or long knives had been established round the scene when the doctor and i looked up it was to see duke quettil the two guard commanders adlain and polchiek and the king looking down at us behind us in the darkened room a girl was weeping quietly bring him inside light all the candles duke quettil told the armed servants he looked at the king who nodded well doctor the king said again a dagger wound i think the doctor said a very thin sharp blade steeply angled it must have penetrated the heart much of the bleeding was internal which is why its still seeping out if im to be sure of all this i will need to open the corpse i think we know the main thing which is that he is dead adlain said from beyond a line of servants by the windows a womans screams could be heard i imagined it was the dukes wife who was in the room quettil asked his guard commander these two polchiek said nodding at a young man and woman both hardly any older than myself both quite handsome and with their dress in some disarray each was held from behind by two of the armed servants it was only now starting to occur to me that there had been a particular explanation for the great numbers of servants at the ball and for the fact that many of them looked somewhat coarser than one expected of servants they were really guards that was why they had all suddenly produced weapons at the first hint of mischief the young womans face was red and swollen with crying and held a look of blank terror a wail from beyond the windows drew her attention and she stared in that direction the face of the young man at her side looked almost as bloodless as the body of duke walen and who are you adlain asked the young couple uououoljeval sir the young man said swallowing heavily a squire in the ememploy of duke walen sir adlain looked at the young woman who was staring straight ahead and you madam the young woman shivered and looked not at adlain but at the doctor still she did not say anything eventually the young man said droythir sir her name is droythir of mizui a chambermaid to lady gilseon my betrothed sir cant we let the duchess in now the doctor asked the king he shook his head and held up one hand guard commander adlain jerked his head back as though pointing at the girl with his chin and demanded and what were you doing in here madam the young woman stared at him as though hed spoken in some utterly unknown language it crossed my mind that she was indeed a foreigner then the young man started to weep and said it was only for his pleasure sirs please through his tears he looked in turn at each of the faces watching him sirs he said he liked such sport and would reward us we knew nothing nothing until we heard him cry out he was there there behind there watching us from behind the screen there he knocked it over when he when he the young man looked round as best he could at a screen lying on the floor near one corner of the room by a door and started to breathe very quickly calm down adlain snapped the young man closed his eyes and slumped in the grip of the two guards they looked at each other then at adlain and polchiek who was also i thought distinctly pale and haggard and there was a dark bird the young woman said suddenly in a strange hollow voice her eyes stared straight ahead out of her pale sweatsheened face what polchiek said a dark bird she said looking straight at the doctor it was very dark because the gentleman wished only for one candle to light us but i saw it a dark bird or a nightwing the doctor looked puzzled a dark bird she said frowning i think we have learned all we can from you madam quettil said to the doctor you may go no the king said to her stay doctor quettils jaw worked were you doing what i think you were doing the king asked the young woman he glanced at the doctor the orchestra faltered in the ballroom the young woman turned her emptylooking face slowly towards the king sir she said and i knew she did not realise who she was talking to yes sir on the couch there she pointed to a couch in the centre of the room a candelabrum holding one extinguished candle lay knocked over nearby and duke walen was watching from behind the screen adlain said it was his pleasure sir the young woman looked down at the man kneeling weeping by her side we saw no harm in it well there was harm madam quettil said quietly his voice hardly more than a breath wed been doing it a while sirs the young woman said her empty staring eyes directed towards the doctor there was a noise i thought it was somebody trying the window doors again sir but then the old gentleman cried out and the screen came tumbling down and i saw the nightwing you saw the duke polchiek asked her she swivelled her head towards him yes sir you saw nobody else just the gentleman sir she said looking back to the doctor in his shirt he had his hand up here she shrugged on one side only and looked down to her left at the top of her chest near her shoulder he was crying out that hed been murdered the door behind him adlain said there behind where the screen was was the door open no sir you are sure yes sir quettil leaned towards the king my man ralinge will make sure this is the truth he murmured the doctor heard this and glared at the duke the king only frowned is the door locked adlain asked polchiek polchiek frowned it should be he said and the key should be in the lock he crossed the room to the door found that there was no key looked to the floor for a few moments then pulled and pushed at the door he felt inside a fat pouch at his waist pulled out a ring bristling with long keys and eventually found one which he tried in the doors lock the lock clicked the door opened inwards and a couple of armed guards dressed as servants looked quizzically in straightening when they saw their commander who spoke briefly to them and closed and locked the door again he returned to the group round the table the guards have been there since a little after the alarm was raised he told adlain his big clumsylooking fingers fumbled with the ring of keys trying to fit it back into the pouch at his waist how many keys to that door are there adlain asked this one one for the palace seneschal and the one which ought to be in the door on this side polchiek told him droythir where was this dark bird you saw the doctor asked where the gentleman was maam suddenly her face seemed to collapse and a look of uncertainty and sadness wrote itself across her features perhaps it was just a shadow maam the candle and the screen falling she looked down a shadow she murmured to herself let the duchess in the king said as one of the guards dressed as a servant approached quettil and muttered into his ear the duchess has fainted and been taken to her room sir quettil told the king however i am told there is a young page who may have something to tell us well then bring him in the king said sounding annoyed droythir and uoljeval were pulled back towards the centre of the room by those holding them the young man staggered to his feet still weeping quietly the girl stared ahead silent feulecharo approached from the doors looking smaller than i had ever seen him look his face almost translucent his eyes bulging feulecharo adlain said he looked round the others page to the late duke he said by way of explanation to those who needed it feulecharo cleared his throat he looked nervously round us all then saw the doctor and gave me a small smile your majesty he said bowing to the king duke quettil sirs madam i know something very little but something of what happened here you do quettil said his eyes narrowing the king shifted from one leg to the other winced then nodded in appreciation as the doctor brought up a chair for him to sit in feulecharo nodded towards the far corner of the room i was in the corridor behind that door sirs earlier doing what might one ask quettil said feulecharo swallowed he glanced at droythir and uoljeval who had been brought forward again to the side of the table their arms still held behind them i had been asked by the duchess to feulecharo licked his lips to follow the duke and see what he was doing and you followed him here adlain said he knew feulecharo a little and sounded purposeful but not unkind yes sir with the two young people feulecharo glanced at droythir and uoljeval neither of whom responded the duchess thought perhaps there was some arrangement between the young lady and the duke i watched them enter this withdrawing room and found my way to the corridor outside i thought i might hear something or see something through the keyhole but it was blocked by a key adlain asked i think not sir rather by the little shutter on the far side however feulecharo said i had with me a small metal mirror and thought to see something under the bottom of the door and did you quettil asked only a single light like a candle flame duke quettil i could hear the young man and woman making the sounds of love and sense some movement but that was all and when the duke was stabbed polchiek asked feulecharo took a deep breath just before that sir i think i was hit on the back of the head and rendered unconscious i imagine for just a few minutes he turned and held his hair up at the back exposing a scab of glistening halfdried blood and a large lump the king looked at the doctor who went forward and looked at the wound oelph she said some water please and a napkin or something similar is that a bottle of spirit wine there on the floor that too feulecharo sat in a seat while his wound was cleaned and inspected adlain looked closely at the injury that certainly looks to me like it might knock a fellow out for a moment or two he said you would agree doctor yes she said and when you woke up what was there to be seen then polchiek asked feulecharo sir i could hear the commotion in the room and people crying out there was nobody else in the corridor where i was i was very dizzy and went to the privy to be sick then i went to find the duchess and that was when i heard that the duke had been murdered adlain and polchiek exchanged looks you did not sense anybody behind you when you were hit adlain asked no sir feulecharo said wincing as the doctor dabbed some spirit wine on his wound i was concentrating too sorely on the mirror this mirror polchiek began it is here sir i had the presence of mind to retrieve it before i made my way to the privy feulecharo dug into a pocket and pulled out a coinsized piece of highly polished metal he handed it to polchiek who passed it round the other men is the duchess walen a particularly jealous woman would you say feulecharo adlain asked turning the small mirror over in his fingers not especially so sir feulecharo said he sounded awkward though that may just have been because the doctor was holding his head forward while she completed the cleaning of his wound you have told us everything of the truth have you not feulecharo the king asked gravely feulecharo looked at him as best he could with his head still bent forward by the doctor oh yes your majesty when you were hit feulecharo the doctor said letting go of his head did you fall against the door or to the floor quettil made a tutting noise feulecharo thought for a moment i woke up resting against the door maam he said then looked at adlain and the others so if somebody had opened the door into the room the doctor said you would have fallen in too i suppose i would have maam i would have required being put back into the same position after it had been closed again you are hiding nothing from us young man quettil asked feulecharo seemed to be about to speak but then hesitated i had thought him more intelligent than that but perhaps the blow to his head had addled his brains what the king said sternly your majesty sirs feulecharo said in a dry strainedsounding voice the duchess thought the duke might be seeing the young lady here that was what exercised her jealousy she would not have minded so much perhaps not have minded at all if she had known it was only to to watch others feulecharo looked round the men in the room avoiding my eyes and the doctors why she would have laughed to have known what was going on in here sirs no more and there is nobody she would trust more than me i know her sirs she would not cause such a thing to be done he licked his lips and swallowed hard again then looked despondently at the mound of table cloth covering the body of the duke quettil opened his mouth to say something but the king watching adlain and polchiek said thank you feulecharo i think feulecharo should stay here sir adlain said to the king guard commander polchiek might send men to his quarters to search for a weapon or the missing key for the door the king nodded and polchiek spoke to some of the servantguards perhaps adlain added the guard commander would open the door again and well see if young feulecharo left any blood there the guards went off to search feulecharos room polchiek and adlain returned to the door the king looked at the doctor and smiled thank you for all your help vosill he said with a nod that will be all sir the doctor said i heard later that they looked all through the duchess apartment as well as feulecharos nothing was found some blood was discovered on the outer surface of the door into the corridor and on the floor beneath a good part of the rest of the palace was searched soon afterwards for the murder weapon but it was never discovered the missing key turned up innocently enough as far as could be told in the key cabinet of the palace seneschal master i knew feulecharo and did not think him capable of the killing of the duke the king may have been overly lenient in not allowing the two lovers droythir and uoljeval to be put to the question by ralinge though i believe both were shown the chamber and had the instruments of excruciation explained to them but i do not believe any further truthful information would or could have been extracted from them polchiek might have preferred that a scapegoat was found and quettil fumed and raged in private for moons afterwards they say but apart from taking one of polchieks two small estates away from him he could do no more polchiek had filled the ball with extra guards and by all accounts done all he could to ensure that nothing untoward occurred feulecharo was lucky i think that he was the third son of one of walens more wealthy barons had he been of more lowly birth instead of just two sickly brothers away from a not inconsiderable title he might have found himself enjoying the hospitality of master ralinge himself as it was it was generally accepted that his good family name made it almost unthinkable that he could have had anything more to do with the murder of the duke than he had claimed the bodyguard i wish i could go too mr dewar cant you ask my father he thinks youre clever dewar looked embarrassed perrund smiled indulgently at him from his pulpit the chief eunuch stike looked down fat and frowning dewar wore riding boots he carried a hat and a heavy black cape lay folded over the couch at his side next to a pair of saddle bags the protector had decided it was time to take personal command of the faltering war in ladenscion youre better off here lattens dewar told the boy and reached out to ruffle his redblond hair you have to get well being ill is like being attacked you see your body is like a great fortress that has been besieged by invaders youve repelled them youve seen them off but you have to be good and marshal your forces and rebuild the walls refurbish your catapults clean your cannons restock your armouries do you see only if your father feels that great fortress is going to be all right can he leave it to go and fight the war so that is your duty to keep getting better to get well of course your father would rather stay here with you if he could but hes like a father to all his men too you see they need his help and guidance so he has to go to them you must stay and help your father win the war by getting better by repairing the great fortress it is your duty as a soldier do you think you can do that lattens looked down at the cushions he sat upon perrund patted his curls back into place again he played with a loose thread of gold at the corner of a cushion yes he said in a small voice not looking up but i really would like to go with you and father really i would he looked up at dewar are you sure i cant come im afraid so dewar said quietly the boy sighed heavily and looked down again dewar smiled at perrund who was looking at lattens oh perrund said come sir is this the general lattens who won so well at catapults you must do your duty general your father will be back before too long and mr dewar she smiled at dewar for all we know dewar said the war may be ended by the time we get there that is sometimes the way with wars he fiddled with his big waxed hat then set it aside on his dark cape he cleared his throat did i tell you about when sechroom and hiliti parted when sechroom went off to become a missionary lattens seemed not to hear for a moment but then he rolled over on his side and stopped humming and said no i dont think so well one day the two friends had to part sechroom had made up her mind that she would become a soldiermissionary taking the message of lavishia to faroff lands and teaching the peoples there the error of their ways hiliti had tried to talk his friend out of this still believing that it was the wrong thing to do but sechroom was adamant what determined oh one day dewar continued not long before sechroom was due to leave they went to one of their special places which was on an island this island was a very wild place where people went to get away from all the riches of lavishia there were no streams of wine and sugar water no readycooked game birds hanging in the housetrees no perfume fountains no piles of sweetrocks no people wanted to get away from sweetrocks lattens asked incredulously yes and from being able to fly and from having hot water gush from wash basins and from having servants pander to their every whim too people are strange like that lattens give them every comfort and they start to pine for the rougher life lattens frowned mightily at this but did not protest further it was obvious he thought that the people of lavishia or perhaps just all adults must be quite mad sechroom and hiliti dewar said went to the island as a sort of holiday from all the luxuries they were used to they left all their servants behind and they even left behind the magic amulets and jewels that protected them from harm and which let them call on the local gods and the two of them were left to fend for themselves in the wilderness they could still find fruit to eat and water to drink and they were able to make a shelter from the giant leaves of trees they had with them bows and arrows and a pair of blowpipes which fired poisoned darts too they had made these before they had come on the holiday and were quite proud of them they used the bows and blowpipes to go hunting for some of the animals on the island though the animals were not the cooperative sort of animals they were used to and they didnt want to be killed and cooked and eaten so they were quite good at keeping out of the way of two people who were really very inexperienced hunters one day when sechroom and hiliti had been out trying to find some animals to shoot their poison darts at but without success they were returning to their leafshelter arguing and becoming annoyed with each other they were both bored and hungry and that was probably one of the reasons that they were each so upset with the other and blaming the other for spoiling the hunt sechroom thought that hiliti was too aggressive and wanted to kill the animals just for the sake of it for hiliti was proud of his skills as a bowman and a blowpiper and at handtohand fighting while hiliti secretly thought that sechroom who didnt like to kill things had deliberately made noises so that the animals they were stalking would realise they were there and run away their route took them back over a steepsided stream where there was a natural bridge made by a fallen tree it had been raining quite a lot that day that was another reason they were miserable and arguing so much and the stream below the treebridge was in spate whats that it means the stream was swollen full of water so they started to cross the tree bridge now hiliti thought about saying that they should cross one at a time but by then they had started out across the tree with him going first and he thought if he turned round and told sechroom to go back and wait sechroom would just get even angrier than she was already so he didnt say anything well the treebridge gave way it had been lying there rotting away for many years no doubt and the banks on either side had been partially washed away by all the rain so when the two of them put their weight on it it obviously decided that it was time to give up the struggle and just succumb ah that means give in to gravity and fall into the stream so down it tumbled breaking in the middle and bringing down other bits of branches and a few rocks and a load of earth and so on from either side just for good measure oh no lattens said hand to his mouth what happened to sechroom and hiliti they fell down along with the tree hiliti was the luckier because the bit of the tree he was on took its time collapsing and he was able to hang on to it as it went down and throw himself on to the bank before the trunk hit the water he still ended up tumbling into the stream but he was all right but what about sechroom sechroom wasnt so lucky the part of the tree trunk she was on must have rolled as it fell or she did because she ended up underneath it trapped beneath the water did she drown lattens looked very concerned now both his hands at his mouth he started to suck one thumb perrund put her arm round him and brought his hands away from his mouth now come dont forget this is just before sechroom goes off to become a soldiermissionary yes but what happened lattens asked anxiously yes perrund said and why didnt the tree trunk float most of its length was still on the steep bank dewar told her the bit sticking into the water trapping sechroom wasnt enough to float anyway hiliti could see one of his cousins boots sticking up out of the water on the far side of the tree and waving around hiliti swam and pulled himself through the water and over the rocks and the broken branches to get to sechroom who he realised was trapped under the water he dived down there was just enough light for him to see sechroom struggling desperately trying to push the tree trunk off her leg but making no impression on it because it was very big and heavy even as hiliti watched he saw a last few bubbles of air float out of sechrooms mouth and be swept away in the strong current hiliti came back up to the surface took a deep lungful of air and then went back down again and put his mouth over his cousins and blew the air into sechrooms mouth so that she could live a little longer hiliti tried to push the tree trunk off sechroom too but it was too heavy he thought that perhaps if he could find a strong enough and a long enough lever then perhaps he could take the weight off sechrooms leg but that would take a while meantime sechroom must be almost out of breath again hiliti took another gulp of air and dived back down again the bubbles came out of sechrooms mouth and again hiliti gave his friend his own air by now hiliti could see that this could not go on much longer the water was cold enough to be sapping his warmth and strength away arid he was becoming exhausted and starting to gasp for air himself then he thought of the blowpipe his own had been washed away by the stream when hed fallen in but he had seen sechrooms when hed first dived down still slung over her back and partly trapped under her hiliti dived down blew more air into sechrooms mouth then took hold of sechrooms blowpipe and pulled and twisted with all his might until it slithered out from underneath her he had to return to the surface to gasp for air but then he went back down and pointed to the pipe and sechroom took it into her mouth but the situation was not yet saved sechroom had to spit the pipe out again because there was too much water still inside it hiliti took the pipe to the surface let the water out held his hand over the end this time and went back down finally sechroom could breathe hiliti waited a few breaths to make sure sechroom was going to be all right for the moment then he got out of the stream and looked for a lever eventually he found a branch straight and stout enough to do the job he hoped and he waded back into the river and went under setting the branch under the fallen tree trunk and over the top of a rock well at last it worked the lever almost snapped and when the tree trunk moved it hurt sechrooms broken leg but she was freed and she floated to the surface and hiliti was able to lift her out of the stream and get her to the shore the blowpipe floated away downstream it was just as big a struggle for hiliti to get sechroom to the top of the bank because of course sechroom was almost helpless with her badly broken leg did a surgeon have to cut her leg off lattens asked squirming on the couch his eyes wide what oh no no anyway eventually hiliti got sechroom to the top of the bank he was so exhausted he had to leave his friend there and return to their camp by himself but there was a a signal fire near the camp which he was able to light and that drew the attention of people who came and rescued them so sechroom was all right lattens asked dewar nodded she was indeed hiliti was regarded as a hero by all and after sechrooms leg was mended but before she left to become a missionary she went back to the island where it had happened and searched the length of the stream down from the collapsed treebridge until she found the two blowpipes lodged amongst rocks in different parts of the stream she cut a piece off the end of the one that had been hers and which had saved her life and she presented it on a little ribbon to hiliti at a party which their friends held to wish sechroom well on the evening of her leaving to become a missionary it was the sign that what had happened by the other river when hiliti had let sechroom fall into the water by the side of the waterfall remember it was a sign they both knew that that didnt matter any more that sechroom had forgiven hiliti the little wooden ring was a bit too big to be worn as a ring which was unfortunate but hiliti told sechroom he would treasure it for ever and he did and he does and as far as anybody knows it is with him to this day whereabouts did sechroom go lattens asked who knows dewar said spreading his hands perhaps she came here she and hiliti knew of of the empire and haspidus they talked about it argued over it she may have been here for all anyone knows did sechroom ever return to see her friend perrund asked taking lattens on to her lap he wriggled out again dewar shook his head no he said a few years after sechroom left so did hiliti and he lost touch completely with lavishia and all the people he knew there sechroom could have returned there by now but hiliti will never know he exiled himself from the luxuries of lavishia for ever sechroom and hiliti will never meet again how sad perrund said her voice was low and her expression sombre never to see ones friends and family again well dewar began but then looked up to see one of the protectors aides signalling him from the doorway he ruffled lattens hair and stood slowly up lifting his hat bags and cloak im afraid i dont have any more time young general you must say goodbye to your father now look urleyn dressed in a very fine riding outfit strode into the room wheres that boy of mine he shouted father lattens ran to him and threw himself up into his arms oof my what a weight youre getting urleyn looked over to dewar and perrund and winked he sat down with the boy on a couch near the doors and they huddled together perrund stood up by dewars side well sir you must promise me faithfully youll take good care of both the protector and yourself she told him raising her face to him her eyes looked bright i shall be most cross should any harm befall either of you and brave though you may be you are not so brave i hope as to risk my ire i shall do all i can to make sure we both return safely dewar told her he rearranged his cloak hat and bags putting one on one arm the other two on the other before putting the saddle bags over his shoulder and the hat over his head to hang down against his back on its cord perrund watched this shuffle of impedimenta with a sort of sad amusement she put her good hand on his stilling him take care she said softly then she turned and went to sit where she could see urleyn and he could see her dewar looked at her for a moment as she sat there straightbacked in her long red gown her face calm and beautiful then he turned away too and walked to the doors the doctor master a killer for duke walen was of course eventually procured it could not be otherwise the murder of one so prominent cannot simply be left unavenged as surely as the heir to a vacant title of note must be found such an event leaves a hole in the fabric of society which has to be repaired with the life of another it is a vacuum into which some soul must be sucked and the soul in this case was a poor mad fellow from the city of mizui who with every appearance of happiness and even fulfilment willingly threw himself into that void his name was berridge a onetime tinderbox maker of some age who was well known as a mad fellow in the city he lived under the citys bridge with a handful of other desperates begging for money in the streets and scavenging the market for discarded or rotten food when the death of duke walen was made public knowledge in mizui on the day following the masked ball berridge presented himself at the sheriffs office and made a full confession this was not a cause for any great surprise on the sheriffs part as berridge routinely claimed responsibility for any murder in or near the city for which there was no obvious culprit and indeed for some where the murderer could not have been more obvious his protestations of guilt in court despite the fact that a husband of known viciousness had been discovered comatose with drink in the same locked room as the body of his butchered wife with the knife still clutched in his bloody hand were the cause of much hilarity amongst that part of the populace which treats the kings courts as a form of free theatre normally berridge would have been thrown out of the door and into the dust of the street without the sheriff giving the matter a second thought on this occasion however due to the gravity of the offence and the fact that duke quettil had only that morning impressed upon the sheriff the extremity of his annoyance at a second unsanctioned murder taking place within his jurisdiction within so short a time the sheriff thought the better of treating the madmans claims to such automatic dismissal to his immense surprise and satisfaction berridge was incarcerated in the town jail the sheriff had a note sent to duke quettil informing him of this swift action though he did think to include mention of such confessions being a habitual feature of berridges behaviour and that it was correspondingly unlikely that berridge was really the culprit guard commander polchiek sent word to the sheriff to keep berridge in jail for the time being when a halfmoon had passed and no progress had been made discovering the murderer the duke instructed the sheriff to make further investigations into berridges claim sufficient time had passed for neither berridge nor any of his underbridgedwelling companions to have any recollection whatsoever of the movements of any of them on the day and evening of the masked ball save that berridge insisted he had left the city climbed the hill to the palace entered the private chambers of the duke and murdered him in his bed this quickly changed the better to fit the facts when berridge heard that the duke had been killed in a room just off the ballroom while awake in the continuing absence of any more likely suspect berridge was sent to the palace where master ralinge put him to the question what good this was supposed to do other than to prove that duke quettil was serious about the matter and his appointees thorough in their investigations is debatable berridge presented no satisfying challenge at all to the dukes chief torturer and from what i heard suffered relatively little though still enough to unhinge his feeble brain still further by the time he appeared before the duke himself to be tried for the dukes murder berridge was a thin bald shaking wreck whose eyes roved about with seemingly complete independence from each other he mumbled constantly yet spoke almost no intelligible words and had confessed not only to the murder of duke walen but also to that of king beddun of tassasen emperor puiside and king quiences father king drasine as well as claiming to be responsible for the fiery sky rocks which had killed whole nations of people and ushered in the present postimperial age berridge was burned at the stake in the citys square the dukes heir his brother set the fire himself though not before having the sad wretch strangled first to spare him the pain of the fire the rest of our stay in the yvenage hills passed relatively uneventfully there was an air of unsettled concern and even suspicion about the palace for some time but that gradually dissipated there were no more unexplained deaths or shocking murders the kings ankle healed he went hunting and fell off his mount again though without incurring any injuries beyond scratches his health seemed to improve generally perhaps under the influence of the clear mountain air the doctor found she had little to do she walked and rode in the hills sometimes with me at her side sometimes at her own insistence alone she spent some considerable time in mizui city treating orphans and other unfortunates at the paupers hospital comparing notes with the local midwives and discussing remedies and potions with the local apothecaries as our time at yvenir went on a number of casualties from the war in ladenscion arrived in the city and the doctor treated a few of those as best she could she had little success at first in trying to meet with the doctors of the town until with the kings permission she invited them to his counsel chamber and had him briefly meet with them before he went off to hunt she accomplished less than shed hoped to i think in terms of changing some of their ways which she found even more old fashioned and indeed potentially dangerous to their patients than those of their colleagues in haspide despite the kings obvious health he and the doctor still seemed to find excuses to meet the king worried that he might run to fat as his father had done in later years and so consulted the doctor on his diet this seemed bizarre to those of us for whom growing fat was a sure sign that one was well fed lightly worked and had achieved a maturity beyond the average but then perhaps this showed that there was a degree of truth to the rumours that the doctor had put some strange ideas into the kings head tongues also wagged concerning the fact the doctor and the king spent so much time together as far as i know nothing of an intimate nature took place between them during all this time i had been present at the doctors side on every occasion she had attended the king save for a couple of instances when i was too ill to leave my bed when i diligently undertook to discover through my fellow assistants as well as through certain servants what had transpired between the doctor and the king i am satisfied that i missed nothing and have reported everything that could possibly be of note to my master thus far the king commanded the doctors presence most evenings and if he had no obvious ailments he would make a show of flexing his shoulders and would claim with a small frown that there might be a stiffness in one or other of them the doctor seemed perfectly willing to act the masseuse and would happily work her various oils into the goldenbrown skin of the kings back kneading and working her palms and knuckles down his spine across the shoulders and over the nape of his neck sometimes at such times they would talk quietly more often they would be silent save for the kings sporadic grunts as the doctor loosened particularly tense knots of muscles i too kept silent of course unwilling to break the spell that seemed to prevail on such candlelit occasions and afflicted with an odd sweet melancholy while i watched in envy as those strong slender fingers glistening with perfumed oils worked on the kings yielding flesh you look tired this evening doctor the king said as she massaged his upper back he lay stripped to the waist on his wide canopied bed do i sir yes what have you been up to the king looked round at her you havent taken a lover have you vosill the doctor blushed which was not something she did often i think that every time i witnessed such an event we were in the presence of the king i have not sir she said the king settled his chin back on his hands perhaps you should doctor youre a handsome woman i cant think that you would have other than a fair choice if you so wished your majesty flatters me no im simply speaking the truth as im sure you know i bow to your opinion sir the king looked round straight at me isnt she ah oelph i said gulping sir well oelph the king said raising his eyebrows dont you think so isnt the good doctor a pleasing prospect dont you think she would gladden the eye of any normal man i swallowed i looked at the doctor who glanced at me with a look that might have been forbidding or even pleading im sure sir i began that my mistress is most personable your majesty sir i mumbled feeling myself blush now personable is that all the king laughed still looking at me but dont you think she is attractive oelph attractive comely handsome beautiful im sure she is all those things sir i said looking down at my feet there you are doctor the king said settling his chin on his hands once more even your young assistant agrees with me he thinks youre attractive so doctor are you going to take a lover or not i think not sir a lover would take up time i might need to devote to your good self oh im so well and fit these days im sure i could spare you for the time it takes for a quick tumble or two each evening your majestys generosity overwhelms me the doctor said dryly there you go again you see vosill that damned sarcasm my father always said that when a woman started being sarcastic to her betters it was a sure sign she wasnt being serviced properly what a fount of priceless wisdom he was to be sure sir he certainly was the king agreed i think hed have said you needed a good tumbling for your own good ouch he said as the doctor leant heavily on his spine with the heel of one hand steady doctor yes you might even call it medicinal or at least ah whats that other word irrelevant nosy impertinent therapeutic thats the word therapeutic ah that word i know the king said what if i commanded you to take a lover vosill for your own good your majestys concern for my health is most cheering would you obey your king vosill would you take a lover if i told you to i would be concerned what proof of my obeying such an instruction would be required to satisfy my king sir oh id take your word on it vosill and besides im sure any man who did bed you would be bound to brag about it really sir yes unless he possessed a particularly jealous and unforgiving wife but would you do as i told you the doctor looked thoughtful i take it i would be able to make the choice myself sir oh of course doctor i am not determined to pimp for you then yes sir of course with alacrity good now then i wonder if i should so command you i had by this time raised my gaze from my feet although my face still felt flushed the doctor looked over at me and i smiled uncertainly she grinned what if you did sir she asked and i refused refused to obey a direct order from your king the king asked with what sounded like genuine horror well while i am entirely in your service and remain devoted to your every good sir i am not i believe in a technical sense one of your subjects i am a foreign national indeed i am not a subject at all i am a citizen of the archipelagic republic of drezen and while i am content and indeed honoured to serve you under and within the jurisdiction of your laws i do not believe that i am bound to obey your every whim as might somebody born within the borders of haspidus or who was born to parents who were subjects of your realm the king thought about this for a good few moments did you once tell me you considered learning the law rather than medicine doctor i believe i did sir i thought so well if you were one of my subjects and you disobeyed me in such a matter i would have you locked up until you changed your mind and if you did not change your mind that would be unfortunate for you because trivial though the issue itself might be the kings will must always be obeyed and that is a matter of the utmost gravity and importance however i am not a subject of yours sir how then would you deal with my mooted intransigence i suppose i would have to order you to leave my kingdom doctor you would have to return to drezen or go elsewhere that would sadden me greatly sir as it would me but you can see that i would have no choice of course sir so i had better hope that you do not so instruct me otherwise i had better prepare either to surrender myself to a man or for exile indeed a hard choice for one who is as you have observed with such penetrating accuracy sir so opinionated and stubborn as l i am glad you are finally treating the subject with the gravity it merits doctor indeed and what of yourself sir if i may enquire what the king said his head coming up off his hands your majestys intentions in the matter of a wife are of as enormous consequence as my choice of a lover would be trifling i only wondered how much thought you had given to the matter as we are on the subject i think we are swiftly leaving the subject i thought we were on i beg your majestys pardon but do you intend to marry soon sir i think that is none of your business doctor that is the business of the court my advisors the fathers of eligible princesses or other ladies of rank to whom it would be sensible and advantageous for me to be attached to and myself yet as you yourself pointed out sir ones health and demeanour can be profoundly affected by a lack of sensual release what might make sense for the political fortune of a state might be catastrophic for the individual wellbeing of a king if say he married an ugly princess the king looked round at the doctor with an expression of amusement doctor he said i shall marry whomever i feel i ought to marry for the good of my country and my heirs if that requires marrying an ugly woman then so be it his eyes seemed to twinkle i am the king vosill the position carries with it certain privileges you may have heard about within quite generous limits i may have the pleasure of whom i please and i will not suffer that to change just because i take a wife i may marry the least prepossessing princess in all the world yet ill warrant that ill notice no difference whatsoever in the frequency and quality of my sensual release he smiled broadly at her the doctor looked awkward but if you are to have heirs sir she began then i shall get sufficiently but not incapably drunk make sure the curtains are tightly closed and that the candles have been snuffed out and then i shall think of somebody else until the proceedings reach a satisfactory conclusion my dear doctor the king said a look of satisfaction on his face as he returned his chin to his hands again as long as the wench is fertile i ought not to have to suffer that too often wouldnt you say im sure that i could not say sir then take my word on it and that of the girls who have borne me children and mostly boys too i might add very well sir anyway i do not order you to take a lover i am very grateful sir oh its not for your benefit vosill its just that i have too much sympathy for any fellow you might take to your bed i dont doubt the principal part of the occasion would be pleasurable enough but then providence protect the unfortunate wretch hed have to suffer your confounded conversation afterwards ouch i think then that there is only one more incident of note to relate concerning our time in yvenir palace it was one i only learned of later some time after our return to haspide when news of it was considerably overshadowed by events master the doctor as i said often went for rides and walks in the hills by herself sometimes departing at xamis dawn and staying away until its dusk this seemed just as eccentric behaviour to me as it did to anybody else and even when the doctor had the good sense to ask for my company i remained perplexed at her motives walks were the most strange she would walk for hour after hour like some peasant she took with her small and not so small books which she had purchased at great expense in haspide and which were filled with drawings paintings and descriptions of the flora and fauna native to the area and would watch intently as birds and small animals crossed our path observing them with an intensity which seemed unnatural given that she was not interested in hunting them rides were less enervating though i think she only resorted to a mount when the journey she proposed to make was too long to consider undertaking on foot she would never stay out overnight for all my mystifiication at these excursions and my annoyance at being forced to walk all day i carne to enjoy them i was expected to be at the doctors side both by her and by my master and so felt no guilt that i was doing other than my duty we tramped or rode in silence or spoke of inconsequential things or about medicine or philosophy or history or a hundred other matters we stopped to eat or observe an animal or a fine view we consulted books and tried to decide whether the animals we were looking at were those described or if the books author had been overly fanciful we attempted to decipher the rough maps that the doctor had copied from those in the library we stopped woodsmen and bondagers to ask the way we collected feathers flowers small stones and shells and eggshells and returned eventually to the palace precincts having done nothing of any real consequence yet with my heart full of joy and my head swimming with a sort of wild delight i soon came to wish that she would take me on all her excursions and only when we returned to haspide did i wish bitterly that i had done something i had thought about doing often when we were at yvenir and the doctor was making her solo expeditions what i wished i had done was follow her i wish that i had trailed her tracked her secretly kept watch on her what i heard moons later in haspide was that two of my fellow palace juniors did chance upon the doctor while she was alone they were auomst and puomiel pages to baron sermil and prince khres respectively and fellows i knew only distantly and in truth without liking at all they had reputations as bullies cheats and rakes and certainly both boasted of the heads they had broken the servants they had swindled at cards and the successes they had had with town girls puomiel was rumoured to have left one junior page at the brink of death the year before after the young fellow had protested to his master that the elder page was extorting money from him it had not even been a fair fight the lad had been jumped from behind and coshed senseless brazenly puomiel did not even deny this not to us anyway thinking it would make us fear him more auomst was marginally the less unpleasant of the two but by general agreement only because he lacked the imagination their story was that they had been out in the woods some good distance from the palace near dusk one particularly warm evening they were making their way back towards yvenir with some game in their bags happy at their poaching and looking forward to their evening meal they chanced upon a royal xule a rare enough animal in any event but this one they swore was pure white it moved through the forest like a swift pale ghost and they dropping their bags and readying their bows followed it as quietly as they were able neither could really have thought what they were going to do if they did find themselves in a position to bring the beast down they could not have told anybody they had killed the animal for the hunting of the xule is a royal prerogative and the size of the thing would have prevented them carrying it to a dishonest butcher supposing one brave enough to risk the royal wrath could have been found but they moved off after it nevertheless carried along by some instinct to hunt that is perhaps bred into us they did not catch the xule it startled suddenly as it neared a small treesurrounded lake high in the hills and took off at a run putting itself beyond even the most hopeful of bow shots within a few heartbeats the two pages just achieving the summit of a small ridge in time to see this happen through a screen of small bushes were disheartened at losing the animal that dissatisfaction was almost instantly relieved by what they saw next a startlingly beautiful and perfectly naked woman waded out of the lake and stared in the direction the white xule had taken when it fled here then was the cause of the animal taking off at such a rate and here too perhaps was something even more fit to be hunted down and enjoyed the woman was tall and dark haired her legs were long her belly was a little too flat to be truly beautiful but her breasts while not especially large looked firm and high neither auomst or puomiel recognised her at first but it was the doctor she turned away from where the xule had dashed away through the trees and reentered the water swimming with the ease of a fish straight towards the two young men she came ashore just beneath where they lay it was here they realised that she had left her clothes she stepped out of the water and began to dry herself with her hands facing out towards the water her back to them they each looked at the other they did not need to speak here was a woman by herself she had no escort no companion and she was as far as they both knew without a husband or a champion at the court again neither stopped to think that in fact she did have a champion at the court and he was without equal or better this pale body exposed before them excited them even more than the one they had just lost sight of and an instinct even deeper than that of hunting flooded their hearts taking them over and extinguishing all rational thought it was dark beneath the circling trees and the birds were calling all around alerted by the flight of the xule and so providing sufficient noise to mask even a clumsy approach they might knock her out or surprise her and blindfold her she might never even see them in other words and they might be able to ravish her without risk of discovery and punishment that they had been led here by the xule seemed like a sign from the forest gods of old they had been delivered here by a creature close to myth the opportunity was too good to ignore puomiel took out a pouch of coin he had in the past used as a cosh auomst nodded they slipped out of the bushes and made their way stealthily down through the shadows between a few small intervening trees the woman was singing softly to herself she completed drying herself with a small kerchief which she then wrung out she stooped to pick up her shirt her buttocks like two pale moons still facing away from the two men who were now only a few steps behind her she held the shift over her head and then let it fall down over her for a few moments she was and would be blind pulling the garment down over herself auomst and puomiel both knew this was the moment they sprang forward they sensed the woman stiffen as perhaps she heard them at last her head might have started to turn still caught inside the folds of the shirt they woke with aching heads in the darkness of a night full save for foy and jairly shining down like two grey reproachful eyes upon the calm still waters of the hidden lake the doctor was gone they each had bumps the size of eggs on the backs of their heads their bows had been taken and most oddly of all the blades of their knives had been twisted bent right round and made a knot of none of us could understand that at all ferice the armourers assistant swore that treating metal like that was next to impossible he tried to bend knives similar to auomst and puomiels in a like manner and found that they broke almost immediately the only way to make them behave in such a fashion was to heat them to a yellowwhite heat and then manipulate them and that was hard enough he added that he had received a boxing about the ears from the armourer for such assiduous experimentation to teach him not to waste valuable weapons i was suspected though i did not know it at the time auomst and puomiel assumed that i had been with the doctor either guarding her with her knowledge or spying on her without it only the testimony of feulecharo whom jollisce and i had been helping to sort through some of duke walens possessions at the time saved me from a coshing when eventually i did discover what had happened i did not know what to think save that i wished that i had been there either to guard or to spy i would have fought both of those miserable ruffians to the death to protect the doctors honour but at the same time i would have gladly surrendered my own for a single furtive glimpse of her such as they had been afforded the bodyguard the city of niarje is conventionally supposed to lie six days ride from crough the capital of tassasen the protector and his company of fresh troops arrived there in four and were appropriately tired after their long days in the saddle it was decided they would rest in the city while they waited for the heavy artillery pieces and siege engines to catch up with them and for fresh word from the war in ladenscion to arrive that word soon appeared in the form of coded messages from duke ralboute and was not good the barons forces were proving far better trained more comprehensively equipped and reliably supplied than had been anticipated cities would not quickly be starved into submission fresh defences encircled almost all of them the troops manning those defences were not the usual rabble but rather gave every indication of having been drilled to the highest standard partisan forces harried the protectorates supply lines sacking camps ambushing wagon trains taking weapons meant to be directed at them for their own use and forcing troops needed at the front to attach themselves to each of the supply caravans general ralboute had himself nearly been killed or captured in a daring night raid which had issued from the besieged city of zhirt only luck and some desperate handtohand fighting had prevented disaster the general himself had had to draw sword and was within one defending aide of having to join the fray we are told that one of the situations a soldier craves to engineer for his enemy and dreads being caught in himself is that of the pincer movement so it can only be imagined what urleyn felt when he was caught in just such a plight in niarje not by the attack of enemy troops but by information the intelligence that the war in ladenscion was going so ill arrived just half a day before news came from the opposite direction that was if anything even worse and also concerned illness urleyn seemed to shrink in on himself his hand holding the letter fell and theletter itself fluttered to the ground he sat down heavily in his seat at the head of the dining table in the old ducal mansion in the centre of niarje dewar standing just behind urleyns seat stooped and picked up the letter he set it folded closed by urleyns plate sir asked doctor bredelle the protectors other companions all army officers looked on concerned the boy urleyn said quietly to the doctor i knew i should not have left him or should have had you stay with him doctor bredelle stared at him for a moment how poorly is he at deaths door urleyn said looking down at the letter he handed the letter to the doctor who read it another seizure he said bredelle dabbed at his mouth with his napkin shall i return to crough sir i can start at first light the protector stared down the table at nothing for a moment then he seemed to rouse himself yes doctor and i shall come too the protector looked apologetically at the other officers gentlemen he said raising his voice and straightening his back i must ask you to continue on to ladenscion without me for the moment my son is unwell i hoped that i would contribute to our eventual victory as soon as you will but i fear that even if i were to continue my heart and my attention would still be drawn back to crough i regret that the glory will be yours unless you contrive to extend the war i will join you as soon as i can please forgive me and indulge the fatherly weakness of a man who at my age should really be a grandfather sir of course im sure we all understand sir we will do all we can to make you proud of us sir the protestations of support and understanding went on dewar looked round the young eager earnest faces of the junior noblemen gathered round the banqueting table with a feeling of dread and foreboding perrund is that you it is young sir i thought id come and sit by you perrund i cant see it is very dark the doctor thinks you will better recover kept away from the light i know but still i cannot see hold my hand will you you must not worry illness seems so terrible when you are young but these things pass will it of course will i be able to see again of course you will have no fear but i am frightened your uncle has written to your father telling him of your condition i imagine he will be coming home soon in fact im sure of it he will give you some of his strength he will drive away all fear youll see oh no but he should be at the war i am bringing him home when he should be at the war to win it for us calm yourself calm yourself we could not keep your illness from him what would he have thought of us he will want to be sure that you are well he will want to see you i imagine he will bring doctor bredelle with him too and mr dewar and mr dewar where your father goes he follows i cant remember what happened what day is it it is the third of the old moon what happened did i start to shake as i did at the shadowplayers show yes your teacher said he thought you were trying to get out of learning mathematics when you fell off your seat he ran to get the nurse and then doctor aesimil was sent for he is doctor to your uncle ruleuin and general yetamidous and very good very nearly as good as doctor bredelle he says you will be better in good time does he he does and he seems a most honest and trustworthy soul is he better than doctor bredelle oh doctor bredelle must be better because he is your fathers doctor and your father deserves to have the best for the good of all of us do you really think he will come back i am sure of it will you tell me a story a story im not sure i know any but everybody knows stories didnt you used to be told stories when you were little perrund yes yes im sure i was yes i have a story oh good perrund yes well let me see once upon a time once upon a time there was a little girl yes yes she was rather an ugly child and her parents did not like or care for her at all what was her name her name her name was dawn dawn thats a pretty name yes unfortunately she was not very pretty as i have said she lived in a town she hated with parents she loathed they made her do all sorts of things they thought she ought to do which she hated and they kept her locked up a lot of the time they forced her to wear rags and sacking they refused to buy her shoes for her feet or ribbons for her hair and they did not let her play with the other children they never told her any stories at all poor dawn yes she was a poor thing wasnt she she would cry herself to sleep most nights and pray to the old gods or appeal to providence to deliver her from such unhappiness she wished that she could escape from her parents but because they kept her locked up she could not but then one day the fair came to town with players and stages and tents and jugglers and acrobats and firebreathers and knifethrowers and strong men and dwarves and people on stilts and all their servants and performing animals dawn was fascinated by the fair and wanted to see it and be made happy by it for she felt that she had no life at all where she was but her parents hid her away they did not want her to have fun watching all the wonderful acts and shows and they were worried that if people saw that they had such an ugly child they would make fun of them and perhaps even tempt her to leave to become an exhibit in their freaks of nature show was she really that ugly perhaps not quite that ugly but still they didnt want her to be seen so they hid her away in a secret place they had fashioned in their house poor dawn cried and cried and cried but what her parents did not know was that the people of the fair always sent some of their performers round the houses in the town to do little acts of kindness or to help out with chopping kindling or to clean up a yard so that people would feel beholden to them and go and see the fair they did this in dawns town and of course her parents being very mean could not pass up the opportunity to have some work done for free they invited the performers into their house and had them tidy it all up though of course it was quite tidy already because dawn had done most of the work while they were cleaning the house and even leaving little presents behind for these were very kind and generous performers a clown i think and a firebreather and a knifethrowerthey heard poor dawn crying in her secret prison and they released her and made her happy by their antics and were very kind to her she felt appreciated and loved for the first time and tears of joy rolled down her face her bad parents had hidden themselves in the cellar and later on they ran away embarrassed at having been so cruel to dawn the performers from the fair gave dawn her life back she even started to feel not so ugly and was able to dress better than her parents had let her dress and feel clean and good perhaps she thought she was not destined to be ugly and unhappy all her life as she had imagined perhaps she was beautiful and her life would be full of happiness somehow just being with the performers made her feel pretty and she started to realise that they had made her beautiful that she had only been ugly because people had told her she was ugly and now she was not it was like magic dawn decided that she wanted to join the fair and go with the performers but they told her sadly that they could not let her do that because if they did then people might think that they were the sort of people who took little girls away from their families and their good name would suffer they told her she ought to stay and look for her parents she saw the sense of what they were telling her and because she felt strong and capable and alive and beautiful she was able to wave goodbye to the fair when it left and all the kind performers went away to take their happiness and kindness to another town and do you know what what she did find her parents and they were nice and good to her for ever afterwards she found a handsome young fellow too and married him and had lots of babies and they lived happily ever after and as well as all that one day she did catch up with the fair and was able to join it and be part of it and try to think of a way to repay the performers for their earlier kindness and that is the story of dawn an ugly unhappy child who became beautiful and happy hmm that is quite a good story i wonder if mr dewar has any more stories about lavishia they are a bit strange but i think he means well i think i ought to sleep now i oh ah im sorry what was that water on my hand it was just a happy tear it is such a happy story it makes me cry oh what are you yes it tastes of salt oh you are a charmer young master lattens to lick a ladys tears up so let go my hand i must there thats better you sleep now your father will be here soon im sure ill send in the nurse to make sure youre tucked in properly oh do you need this is this your comforter yes thank you perrund good night good night the palace concubine yalde brought fruit and wine to the bath where yetamidous ruleuin and zespiole floated in the milky waters terim and herae also concubines of yaldes rank sat naked by the pool side terim with her long legs dangling in the water while herae brushed her long black hair yalde placed the tray with the fruit bowl and the decanter near yetamidous elbow then stepped out of the loose gown she had worn to visit the servants quarters and slipped into the water the eyes of the other two men followed her movements but she ignored them she floated at yetamidous side and poured wine for him so our little time of power may be drawing to an unexpectedly early close zespiole said he brought one hand out of the water and stroked the tawny calf of terims leg she looked down and smiled at him though he did not see both terim and herae were from ungrian and spoke only their own tongue and imperial the men talked in tassaseni that might not be so bad ruleuin said the protector told bileth to report to me while hes away and im growing tired of having to listen to that idiot pontificate on diplomatic niceties part of me hopes urleyn does come back you think he will come back yetamidous asked looking from ruleuin to zespiole he accepted the goblet of wine from yalde and slurped at it spilling some into the translucent waters around his wide chest i fear he will zespiole said fear ruleuin said but oh not because i am so attached to a temporary third of the shadow of his power zespiole said but because i think it the wrong thing for him to do for tassasen the troops will go on without him most of them wont they ruleuin said it would be better if he did bring some of them back with him yetamidous told the guard commander there may be three of us to share his authority but there are precious few troops at our command and when all fine words are finished with its soldiers and swords that make power i have barely enough men to make the city walls look lived in the protector has always said that a populace which in general assents to its ruling and to its rulers needs few sheriffs and no troops zespiole said easily said when you have several barracks full of soldiers to agree with you yetamidous said but you will observe that it is we who are allowed the privilege of testing our masters theory in this regard not he oh the people are happy enough zespiole said for the moment ruleuin glanced at him your spies are sure of that then one does not spy on ones own people zespiole informed him one has rather conduits of communication which lead to the common man my guards mix with all sorts they share their houses their streets their taverns and their views and they hear no grumblings yetamidous asked sceptically pushing his goblet towards yalde to be refilled oh they hear constant grumblings the day they stop hearing grumblings i shall be sure that revolt is imminent but people grumble about this tax or that or that the protector keeps such a large harem when many an honest working fellow can hardly find a wife or they grumble about the luxurious life led by some of the grand aediles generals zespiole said accepting a piece of fruit from terim with a broad smile ruleuin smiled too yetamidous drank greedily we are to be reassured then that we are in no immediate danger from the general populace he said but what of our other frontiers they are reduced to the minimum or less where are the reinforcements if some other place makes war on us the problem in ladenscion will not last for ever ruleuin said though he looked troubled the troops will come home with the new men and machines now in niarje simalg and ralboute should be able to bring it to a swift conclusion we were told that at the start yetamidous reminded the other man we should all have gone then all of us we should have crushed the barons with every force at our command the general made a fist and brought it down on the surface of the water with a splash yalde wiped soapy water from her eyes yetamidous drank then spat the wine out theres water in here he told yalde and tipped the wine over her head he laughed followed by the other men the wine stung her eyes a little but she bowed her head yetamidous pushed her head under the water then let her bob up once more here he pushed the goblet into her hands again she wiped it with a napkin and refilled it from the decanter that might be obvious to all of us now zespiole said but it was not then to any of us we all agreed that simalg and ralboutes men would be more than ample for the job well they havent been yetamidous said then tested the wine by sloshing it round his mouth the protector should not have entrusted so important a mission to those fops noble men indeed they are no better than us he is too impressed by their high birth they make war like children like women they spend too much time talking with these barons when they should be fighting them even when they do fight they fight as though theyre frightened of getting their swords bloody too much finesse not enough muscle all is ruse and subtlety i have no time for such nonsense these barons are best met head on your directness has always been your most engaging feature yetamidous ruleuin told him i think my brother if he ever had a concern over the style of your generalship only worried that your assaults tended to be rather expensive in men oh what expense is that yetamidous said waving his free hand too many of them are idle wretches from the gutter whod have met an early death anyway they expect to return with treasure usually all they bring back is the diseases they picked up from the whores death in battle a place in history remembering in a victory song better than most of the scum deserve theyre a crude tool and theyre best used crudely with none of this effeminate feinting and playing around better to attack straight and get it over with these sonoble dandies dishonour the whole business of war yetamidous looked at the two girls sitting at the pool side then briefly at yalde i wonder sometimes he said quietly to the two men whether there is not some other motive in the dukes inability to finish this war what ruleuin said frowning i had assumed with the protector that they were trying as hard as they could zespiole said what do you mean general i mean that perhaps we are all being treated like fools sir that duke ralboute and duke simalg are closer to the barons of ladenscion than they are to us apart from physically obviously ruleuin said smiling but looking awkward eh aye too damn close dont you see he asked levering his bulk away from the side of the bath they go off to this war they pull in more and more troops they delay and delay and stumble and lose men and machines and come whining to us to help them out taking troops from the capital and our other frontiers leaving the way open to any bastard who might want to march in from outside who knows what mischief they might have got up to if the protector had put himself in their midst the boy about to die might save his fathers life if he really is his father general ruleuin said have a care the boy may not be about to die i have no doubt that in any event i am truly his uncle through my brother and the generals ralboute and simalg have always shown themselves to be good and true officers of the protectorate they joined our cause long before it was sure to succeed and could be said to have risked more than any of us in supporting it for they started out with much power and prestige which they entirely risked by throwing their lot in with us ruleuin looked to zespiole for support zespiole had busied himself with a segment of fruit burying most of his lower face in it he looked up at the other two men and expressed surprise with his brows yetamidous waved his hand in dismissal all very fine but the fact remains they have not done as well as they were supposed to in ladenscion they said they would triumph there in a few moons urleyn thought they would too even i thought that the job ought not to be beyond them if they applied themselves and threw their troops to the front but they have done badly they have failed so far cities have not been taken siege engines and cannon have been lost their progress has been halted by every stream every hill every damn hedge and flower i am simply asking why why are they doing so badly what can be the explanation if it is not deliberate might it not be some conspiracy might there not be some collusion between the two sides of the war to drag us and our men in deeper and tempt the protector himself forward to take part and then kill him ruleuin glanced at zespiole again no he told yetamidous i think that is not the case and nothing is accomplished by talking like that give me some wine he said to herae zespiole grinned at yetamidous i must say yet he said your talent for suspicion is almost on a par with dewars dewar yetamidous snorted ive never trusted him either oh this is getting preposterous ruleuin said he drained his goblet and sank under the water resurfacing to shake his head and blow out his cheeks what can dewar be up to do you think yet zespiole asked with a smile he certainly cannot wish our protector dead for he has saved him from almost certain death on several occasions the last time being when each of us came closer to sending the protector into the arms of providence than any assassin ever has you yourself came within a knuckle of sticking a quarrel straight through urleyns head i was aiming for that ort yetamidous said scowling and i almost got the thing too he thrust his goblet out to yalde again im sure you were zespiole said my own shot was more off target but you have not said what you suspect dewar of i just dont trust him thats all yetamidous said sounding surly now i would be more concerned that he does not trust you yet old friend zespiole said staring into yetamidous eyes what yetamidous spluttered well he may have the feeling that you were trying to kill the protector that day on the hunt by the stream zespiole said in a quiet concerned voice he might be watching you you know i would worry about that if i were in your position he is a sly cunning hound that one his approach is silent and his teeth are sharp as razors i should not care to be the subject of his suspicions ill tell you that why id be sorely frightened that i might wake up dead one morning what yetamidous roared he threw down the goblet it splashed into the milky water he stood up shaking with fury zespiole looked over at ruleuin whose expression was anxious zespiole put his head back and burst out laughing oh yet you are so easy to rile im jesting with you man you could have killed urleyn a hundred times by now i know dewar he doesnt think youre an assassin you big oaf here have a fruit zespiole lifted a buncher and threw it across the bath at the other man who caught it and then after a moments confusion laughed too sinking back into the swirling water and laughing uproariously ha of course ah you tease me like a hussy zespiole yalde he said this waters freezing get the servants to bring some more hot and bring more wine wheres my goblet what have you done with it the goblet sunk in the bath in front of yetamidous had left a red stain in the milky water like blood the doctor the summer passed it was a relatively mild season throughout the land but especially so in the yvenir hills where the breezes were either pleasantly cool or tolerably warm much of the time passed with seigen joining xamis below the horizon each night trailing after it at first while we performed the first part of the circuition dancing almost in step with its senior during those eventful and perplexing early moons at yvenir then preceding it by gradually greater and greater increments for the rest of our stay which happily was devoid of significant incident when time came to pack up what needed to be packed up and store what required storing seigen was anticipating the rise of the greater sun by a good bell or so providing the hills with a long leadingdawn full of sharp extended shadows when the day seemed only half begun and birds chorused and some birds did not and the tiny points that were the wandering stars could sometimes still be seen in the violet sky if the moons were absent or low our return to haspide was accomplished with all the usual pomp and ceremony there were feasts and ceremonies and investitures and triumphal parades through newly built gates and dignified processions under specially commissioned arches and long speeches by selfimportant officials and elaborate giftgivings and formal conferments of old and new awards and titles and decorations and any manner of other business all of it wearying but all of it i was assured by the doctor somewhat to my surprise necessary in the sense that this sort of participatory ritual and use of shared symbols helped to cement our society together if anything the doctor said drezen could have done with more of this sort of thing en route back to haspide in the midst of all this ceremonial much of it id still insist mere flummery the king set up numerous city councils instituted more craft and professional guilds and granted various counties and towns the privileged status of burgh this did not meet with the universal approval of the dukes and other nobles of the provinces concerned but the king seemed more energetic in finding ways to sweeten the medicine for those who might lose out in this reshuffling of responsibilities and control than he had on the way to yvenir and no less cheerfully determined to have his way not just because he was the king but because he knew he was right and before too long people would come to see things his way anyway but there is no need for this sir ah but there will be sir can we be so sure of that we can be as sure of it as we can that the suns will rise after they have set ulresile indeed sir yet we wait until the suns do appear before we rise what you propose is to prepare for the day while it is still the middle o the night some things must be anticipated further in advance than others the king told the younger man with a look of jovial resignation young duke ulresile had opted to accompany the court back to haspide he had developed his powers of speech and opinion considerably over the summer since we had first encountered him in the hidden garden behind yvenir palace perhaps he was simply growing up particularly quickly but i think it was more likely that his newfound garrulousness was largely the effect of living in the same place as the royal court for a season we were camped on the toforbian plain about halfway between yvenir and haspide ormin ulresile and the new duke walen together with chamberlain wiester and a fuss of servants stood with the king in a fabricwalled courtyard open to the sky outside the royal pavilion while the doctor bandaged the kings hands tall flagpoles bent in a warm harvestscented breeze and the royal standards flapped at each corner of the sixsided space their shadows moving sinuously over the carpets and rugs which had been spread over the carefully levelled ground our monarch was due to indulge in a formal stavefight with the old citygod of toforbis which would be represented as an extravagantly hued multipede and played by a hundred men under a long hooped canopy the spectacle was that of watching a man fight with the awning of a tent even if the awning was animated elongated painted with scales and sported a giant head in the shape of a giant toothed bird but it was one of the rituals that had to be endured for the sake of local custom and to keep the regional dignitaries happy duke ulresile watched the doctors hands as she wound the bandages round and round the kings fingers and palms but sir he said why anticipate this quite so far in advance might it not be seen as folly to because to wait would be the greater folly the king said patiently if one plans an attack at dawn one does not wait until dawn itself before rousing ones troops one starts to get them organised in the middle of the night duke walen you feel as i do dont you ulresile said sounding exasperated i feel there is no point disputing with a king even when he makes what seems like an error to us lesser mortals the new duke walen said the new duke was by all accounts a worthy successor to his late brother who had died without issue and so ensured that his title went to a sibling the strength of whose resentment at being born by his reckoning a year too late had only ever been matched by his estimation of his own worth he seemed to be a sullen sort of fellow and gave the impression of being if anything rather older than the old duke what about you ormin the king asked do you think i anticipate matters too much perhaps a little sir ormin said with a pained expression but it is difficult to gauge these matters with any accuracy i suspect one only finds out if one has done the right thing after some considerable time has passed sometimes it is only ones children who discover what the rights and wrongs of it all were bit like planting trees really he uttered this last sentence with a look of mild surprise at his own words ulresile frowned at him trees grow duke we are having the forest cut down around us yes but with the wood you can build houses bridges ships the king said smiling and trees do grow back again unlike heads say ulresiles lips went tight i think that perhaps what the duke means ormin said is that we may be proceeding a little too quickly with these alterations we run the risk of removing or at least curtailing too much of the power of the existing noble structure before there is another framework properly in place to carry the load i confess that i for one am worried that the burghers in some of the towns in my own province have not entirely grasped the idea of taking responsibility for the transfer of land ownership for example and yet they must have been trading grains and animals or the produce of their own trade or craft for generations the king said holding up his left hand which the doctor had just completed bandaging he inspected it closely as though looking for a flaw it would seem strange that just because their seigneur has decided who farmed what or who lived where in the past they cannot grasp the idea of being able to make their own decisions in the matter indeed you might even find that they have been doing so already but in what you might call an informal way without your knowledge no they are simple people sir ulresile said one day they may be ready for such responsibility but not yet do you know the king said earnestly i dont think i was ready for the responsibility that i had to shoulder when my father died oh now sir ormin said you are too modest of course you were ready and have been entirely proved to be so by all manner of subsequent events indeed you proved so with great expedition no i dont think i was the king said certainly i didnt feel i was and id bet that if you had taken a poll of all the dukes and other nobles in the court at the time and they had been allowed to say what they really thought not what i or my father wished to hear they would have said to a man that i wasnt ready for that responsibility whats more i would have agreed with them yet my father died i was forced to the throne and although i knew i was not ready i coped i learned i became a king by having to behave as one not simply because i was my fathers son and had been told long in advance that i would become so ormin nodded at this im sure we take your majestys point ulresile said as wiester and a couple of servants helped the king on with heavy ceremonial robes the doctor stood back to let them slide the kings arms through the sleeves before completing the tying of the bandages on his right hand i think we must be brave my friends duke ormin said to walen and ulresile the king is right we live in a new age and we must have the courage to behave in new ways the laws of providence may be eternal but their application in the world must change as the times do the king is right to commend the common sense of the farmers and the craftsmen they have great practical experience in many things we ought not to underestimate their abilities simply because they are not highborn quite the king said drawing himself up and putting his head back to have his hair combed before it was gathered into a knot ulresile looked at ormin as though he was going to spit practical experience is all very well when a man makes tables or has to control a haul pulling a plough he said but we are concerning ourselves with the governance of our provinces and in that it is ourselves who have the whole part of the experience the doctor admired her handiwork on the kings bandaged hands then stood back the breeze brought a distinct smell of flowers and graindust billowing in across the bowed fabric walls of our temporary courtyard the king let wiester slide his thick stavegloves on to his hands and then lace them up another servant placed stoutlooking but richly decorated boots in front of the king and carefully guided his feet into them then my dear ulresile he said you must teach the burghers of the towns what you know or they will make mistakes and we shall all be the poorer for i hope we can all expect a better crop of taxes from such improvements the king sniffed a couple of times im sure the ducal estates share of any increase will not be unappreciated should it materialise duke ormin said with the look of one experiencing an attack of wind as indeed i am sure it will yes i am the king looked at him quickly with the heavylidded gaze of one about to sneeze then you would be prepared to put the reforms into effect first in your province ormin ormin blinked then smiled he bowed it would be an honour sir the king took a deep breath then shook his head and clapped his hands together as best he could he cast a victorious look at ulresile who was staring at ormin with a look of horror and disgust the doctor knelt at her bag i thought she was going to help me put the various bits and pieces away but instead she took out a clean square of cloth and rose to stand before the king just as he sneezed mightily jerking his hair out of the grip of the flunky combing it and sending the comb catapulting forward on to a brightly coloured rug sir if i may the doctor said the king nodded wiester looked discomfited he was only now getting out his kerchief the doctor gently held the cloth up to the kings nose letting him sniff into it she folded the cloth and then with another corner dabbed softly at his eyes which had moistened thank you doctor he said and what do you think of our reforms i sir the doctor said looking surprised it is no business of mine now vosill the king said you have an opinion about everything else i assumed you would be more in favour than anybody here come you must be happy with this its something like what you have in your precious drezen isnt it youve talked about such things at inordinate length before now he frowned duke ulresile did not look happy i saw him glance at walen who too appeared troubled duke ormin appeared not to be listening though his face bore a surprised expression the doctor folded the cloth away slowly i have talked about many things to contrast the place i chose to leave with the place i chose to come to she said with a deliberateness equal to that she gave the folding away of that cloth im sure nothing we could do would be good enough for the ladys high standards duke ulresile said with what sounded like bitterness perhaps even contempt she has made that clear enough the doctor gave a brief small smile like a wince and said to the king sir may i be excused now of course vosill the king said with a look of surprise and concern she turned to leave and he held up his gloved hands as a servant brought forward the silver and gold inlaid staff he would fight the false monster with in the distance horns sounded and a cheer went up thank you he said to her she turned back briefly to him bowed quickly and then walked away i followed my master knows already what took place when the surprise that the old duke walen had spent most of a year preparing was finally visited upon the doctor but i shall say something of the event in the hope of completing the picture he will already have the court had been back at haspide for only two days i had not yet finished unpacking all the doctors belongings there was to be a diplomatic reception in the main hall and the doctors presence had been requested neither she nor i knew who had made this request she went out early that morning saying that she was going to visit one of the hospitals she had paid regular visits to before we had left on the outer part of the circuition earlier that year i was instructed to stay behind and continue with the process of getting her apartments in order again i understand that my master had one of his people follow the doctor and discovered that she did indeed go to the womens hospital and attend some of the sick and confined there i spent the time removing racks of glassware and vials from strawpacked cases and making a list of the fresh ingredients we would need over the next halfyear for the doctors potions and remedies she returned to her apartments at about a half past the mornings third bell bathed and changed into more formal wear and then took me with her to the great hall i cannot recall there being any great air of expectation in the place but then it was a crowded scene with hundreds of courtiers foreign diplomats consular people nobles and traders and others milling about all no doubt concerned with their own business and quite convinced that it was more important than anybody elses and merited if it would help them the particular attention of the king certainly the doctor seemed to have no premonition that anything strange or untoward was about to happen if she seemed distracted it was because she wanted to get on with the matter of getting her apartments her study and workshop and her chemical machinery back together as we made our way to the hall she had me note down several ingredients and raw materials she suddenly realised she would be needing in the near future ah my dear doctor duke ormin said pressing his way through an exotically garbed knot of incomprehensibly jabbering foreigners im told theres somebody here to see you maam is there the doctor asked yes ormin said he stood straight for a change and looked out over the heads of the crowd our new duke walen and ah guard commander adlain said something he squinted into the distance didnt catch it all and they seemed ah there they are over there the duke waved then looked at the doctor were you expecting anybody expecting anybody the doctor repeated as the duke led us to one corner of the hall yes i just well i dont know we approached the guard commander i missed whatever the doctor and duke ormin said next because i was watching the guard commander talk to a couple of his guard captains two intimidatingly large sternfaced men armed with double swords as he saw us approach the guard commander nodded to the two men they stepped away to stand a few paces off doctor guard commander adlain said in an open friendly manner putting his arm to one side of the doctor as though to grasp her far shoulder so that she had to turn to one side good day how are you unpacked are you happily reensconced i am well sir we are not yet quite fully settled in and you oh im the guard commander looked behind him then a look of some surprise came upon his face ah heres ulresile and who can this be he and the doctor both turned round to face duke ulresile and a tall bronzedlooking man of middle age dressed in strange loosefitting clothes and a small tricorn hat duke ulresile was smiling with a curious eagerness behind him stood the new duke walen his head down and his dark eyes looking half closed the bronzed stranger had rather a prominent nose and perched upon it was an odd framework of metal with two coinsized pieces of glass set in it one in front of each eye he took this off with one hand as though it was a hat that was left on and made a deep bow i half expected his hat to fall off but it appeared to be held in place by three jewelheaded pins when he straightened the fellow spoke at the doctor in a language quite unlike anything i had ever heard before full of strange gutturals and odd tonal shifts she looked at him blankly his friendly expression seemed to waver duke walens eyes narrowed ulresiles smile broadened and he took in a breath then the doctor grinned and reached out and took the strangers hands in hers she laughed and shook her head and out of her mouth rattled a stream of sound that sounded very like the sort of sound the stranger had produced in amongst all this expeditious blabbering i caught the words drezen though it sounded more like drechtsen pressel vosill and several times something that sounded like koodoon the pair of them stood beaming huge smiles at each other and talking in a continuous stream of sound all the time laughing and nodding and shaking their heads i watched the smile on duke ulresiles face fade slowly withering like a cut flower the sullen hooded expression on the new duke walens face did not alter the guard commander adlain looked on with a fascinated expression his gaze flitting to ulresile now and again a tiny smile playing around his lips oelph i heard the doctor say and she turned to me oelph she said again holding one hand out to me she was still grinning broadly this is gaan kuduhn from drezen gaan kuduhn she said to the foreigner blabber blabber oelph well it sounded so to me she said to him i recalled that the doctor had told me that a gaan was some sort of parttime diplomatic rank the tall bronzed man took the wire contraption off his nose again and bowed to me i ham press to meet yore welph he said slowly in something resembling haspidian how do you do mr kuduhn i said also bowing she introduced duke ormin too the gaan had already met walen ulresile and the guard commander the gaan is from an island in the same group as my own the doctor said she looked quite flushed and excited he was invited here from cuskery by the old duke walen to discuss trade he took a quite different route to mine but it seems to have taken him just as long he has been away from drezen almost as long as i have so he has little fresh news but it is just so good to hear drezeni spoken again she turned her smile to him again as she said i think i shall see if i can persuade him to stay and found a proper embassy she started blabbering to him again ulresile and walen looked at each other guard commander adlain looked up at the ceiling of the great hall for a moment then he made a small tutting noise well gentlemen he said to the three dukes i think we are somewhat surplus to requirements here dont you duke ormin gave a distracted hmm the other two men glared on at the doctor and the gaan kuduhn with what looked like disappointment though in the new duke walens case this required no alteration to his normal expression fascinating though im sure this exchange is in its native language i have other business to attend to adlain said if youll excuse me he nodded to the dukes and walked off nodding to the two bulky guard captains who followed in his wake duke walen duke ulresile the doctor said still smiling thank you so much i am most flattered you thought to introduce me to the gaan with such dispatch the new duke walen remained silent ulresile seemed to swallow something bitter our pleasure madam is the gaan required for an audience with the king she asked no he is not required for an audience with the king ulresile said then may i take him from you for a while id so much like to talk with him ulresile tipped his head and gave a small twist of a smile please be our guest master i spent a bell and a half with the doctor and her newfound friend in an alcove off the song court gallery and learned nothing except that drezem talk like the world is due to end at any moment and sometimes take their wine with water and a little sugar the gaan kuduhn did have an audience with the king later that day and asked the doctor to interpret for him as his imperial was little better than his haspidian she agreed happily that afternoon i was sent by myself to the apothecary shavine to buy chemicals and other supplies for the doctors workshop the doctor looked quite radiant when i left dressing and preparing with great care for her meeting with the gaan kuduhn and the king when i inquired i was told that i would not be needed again until the evening it was a fine warm day i took the long way to the apothecarys walking down by the docks and recalling the stormy night half a year earlier when i had come here in search of the children who had been sent for ice i recalled the child in the cramped filthy room in the tenement in the poor quarter and the terrible fever that had killed her despite all the doctor could do the docks smelled of fish and tar and the sea clutching a hamper of glazed clay jars and glass tubes all wrapped in straw i stopped off at a tavern i tried some wine with water and sugar but it was not to my taste for some time i just sat and stared at the street through the open window i returned to the palace around the fourth bell of the evening the door to the doctors apartments hung open this was not like her i hesitated to proceed further suddenly filled with a sense of dread i entered and found a pair of short dress boots and a small formal waistcape lying on the floor of the sitting room i put my hamper of chemicals and ingredients down on the table and went through to the workshop where i could hear a voice the doctor sat with her feet up on the workshop bench her naked heels resting on a sheaf of papers her legs exposed to the knee and the neck of her gown unbuttoned over her chest her long copperred hair hung down loose behind her one of the rooms roofhung censers swung in slow loops above her head leaving a smoky herbscented trail her battered old knife lay on the bench by her elbow she held a goblet her face looked red about the eyes i got the impression she had been talking to herself she turned to me and fixed me with a watery look ah oelph she said mistress are you all right oh not really oelph she picked up a jug want a drink i looked around shall i just close the apartment door she appeared to consider this yes she said closing doors seems to be the order of the day why not then come back and have a drink its sad to drink alone i went and closed the door found a goblet and brought another chair into the workshop to sit with her she poured some liquor into my goblet i looked into the vessel the liquid did not smell what is this mistress alcohol she said very pure she sniffed at it though it still has an intriguing bouquet mistress is this the distillation you have the royal apothecary make for us the same she said drinking from her goblet i sipped at it then coughed and tried not to splutter it back out again its strong isnt it i said hoarsely it needs to be the doctor said in a morose tone what is wrong mistress she looked at me after a moment or two she said i am a very foolish woman oelph mistress you are the cleverest and most wise woman i have ever met indeed you are one of the cleverest and most wise people i have ever met you are too kind oelph she said staring into her goblet but i am still foolish nobody is smart in every way its as though we all have to have something were stupid about i have just been very stupid with the king with the king mistress i asked worried yes oelph with the king mistress i am sure the king is most considerate and understanding and will not hold whatever you have done against you indeed perhaps the offence if offence there was seems greater to you than it does to him oh it wasnt much of an offence oelph it was just stupidity i find that hard to believe mistress me too i find it hard to believe but i did it i took the merest sip from my goblet can you tell me what happened mistress she looked unsteadily at me again will you keep what i tell youshe began and i confess that my heart seemed to sink into my boots at these words but i was saved from a further extension of my perjury and betrayal or from a wantonly rash admission of my own by her next words oh no she said shaking her head and rubbing her face with her free hand no it doesnt matter people will hear if the king wants them to it doesnt matter anyway who cares i said nothing she bit her lower lip then took another drink she smiled sadly at me as she said i told the king how i feel about him oelph she said and sighed she gave a shrug as though to say well there you are i looked down at the floor and how is that mistress i asked quietly i think you might be able to guess oelph she said i found that i too was biting my lip now i took a drink for something to do im sure we both love the king mistress everybody loves the king she said bitterly or says that they do it is what one is supposed to feel what one is obliged to feel i felt something else something it was very stupid and unprofessional of me to admit to but i did after the audience with gaan kuduhn you know i do believe that old bastard walen thought he was setting me up she said as though interrupting herself i choked on my drink i was unused to hearing the doctor swear it distressed me yes she said i think he thought that i wasnt that i was well anyway it was after the audience with the gaan we were alone just him and me a stiff neck i dont know she said miserably maybe i was excited at having met somebody from home suddenly she sobbed and i looked up to see her bending forward so that her head was lowered towards her knees she put the goblet down with a thud on the workbench and held her head in her hands oh oelph she whispered i have done such terrible things i stared at her wondering what in providence she could be talking about she sniffed wiped her eyes and nose with her sleeve then put her hand out to the goblet again it hesitated by the old dagger lying nearby then grasped the goblet and brought it towards her lips i cant believe i did that oelph i cant believe that i told him and do you know what he told me she asked with a hopeless wavering smile i shook my head he told me that of course he knew did i think he was stupid and oh he was flattered but it would be even more unwise for him to respond to me than it had been for me to make the declaration in the first place besides he only liked he only felt comfortable with pretty dainty delicate women who had no brains that was what he liked not wit not intelligence certainly not learning she snorted vacuity thats what he wants a pretty face fronting an empty head ha she threw back the last of her drink then refilled the goblet spilling some of the liquor on her gown and the floor you fucking cretin vosill she muttered to herself my blood ran cold at her words i wanted to hug her to hold her to take her in my arms and at the same time i wanted to be anywhere else but there then he wants stupidity well oh do you see the irony of it oelph she said the only moronic thing ive done since i landed was to tell him i loved him it was utterly completely definitively and absolutely imbecilic and yet it still isnt enough he wants consistent dimwittedness she stared into her goblet cant say i blame him she drank she coughed and had to put the goblet down on the bench the goblets base settled on her old dagger so that the vessel overbalanced and fell with a crash to the floor breaking and splashing the alcohol across the boards she brought her feet down from the bench and put them under the chair she sat on her head in her hands again as she curled up and started to weep oh oelph she cried what have i done she rocked to and fro on the seat her face buried in her hands her long fingers like a cage around her tangle of red hair what have i done what have i done i felt terrified i did not know what to do i had been feeling so mature so grown up so capable and in control over these last couple of seasons but now i felt like a child again quite perfectly unsure what to do when confronted with the pain and distress of an adult i hesitated a terrible feeling growing in me that whatever i did next it would be the wrong thing the wrong thing entirely and i would suffer for it for ever more and worse still so might she but eventually while she rocked back and forth and moaned piteously to herself i put my goblet down at my feet and got out of my seat and went to squat by her i reached out one hand and placed it gently on her shoulder she did not react i let my hand go back and forth with her rocking then slid my arm further round her shoulders somehow touching her like that she suddenly seemed smaller than i had always thought her still she did not seem to think i had committed any terrible transgression by touching her so and finding my courage and taking it by the scruff of its neck i moved closer to her and put both my arms around her holding her slowly stopping her rocking feeling the warmth of her body and tasting the sweet air of her breath she let me hold her i was doing what i had imagined doing only moments earlier doing something i had imagined doing for the last year something i thought would never could never happen something i had dreamed about night after night after night for season upon season and something that i had hoped and still hoped somehow might lead to an even more intimate embrace no matter that that had seemed almost absurdly unlikely and indeed still did i felt her grip on her head loosen she brought her arms out and put them round me embraced by her my head seemed to swim her face hot and wet from her tears was next to mine now i shook with terror wondering if i dare turn my face towards hers bring my mouth close to her lips oh oelph she said into my shoulder it is not fair to use you so you may use me as you wish mistress i said gulping on the words i could smell some delicate perfume rising from her warm body its tender scent not swamped by the fumes of the alcohol and infinitely more heady is it i began then had to stop to swallow on a dry mouth is it so terrible to take the risk of telling somebody the feelings you have for them even if you suspect they feel nothing similar for you is it wrong mistress she pushed herself gently away from me her face tearstreaked puffyeyed and red was still calmly beautiful her eyes seemed to search mine it is never wrong oelph she said softly she reached down and took both my hands in hers but i am no more blind than the king nor any more able to offer requital i wondered stupidly what she meant for a moment before realising and feeling a terrible sadness fall slowly on my soul as though a great shroud had been dropped inside me settling with a sorrowful implacable inevitability over all my hopes and dreams obliterating them for ever she put one hand to my cheek and her fingers were still warm and dry and tender and firm at once and her skin i swear smelled sweet you are very precious to me dear oelph i heard those words and my heart sank farther and steeper am i mistress of course she drew away from me and looked down at the smashed goblet of course you are she settled back in her seat and took a deep breath pushing a hand through her hair smoothing down her gown and attempting to button its yoke her fingers would not do as she willed i longed from far away to help her or rather not to help her with that task but eventually she gave up anyway and just pulled the long collar to she looked up into my face drying her cheeks with her fingers i think i need to sleep oelph will you excuse me please i lifted my goblet from the floor and put it on the workbench of course mistress is there anything i can do no she shook her head no there is nothing you can do she looked away the bodyguard i told the boy a story of my own you did yes it was a pack of lies well all stories are lies in a way this was worse this was a true story turned into a lie you must have felt there was a reason to do that yes i did what was the reason you felt that way because i wanted to tell the story but i could not tell it truly to a child it is the only story i know worth telling the story i think most about the story that i live again and again in my dreams the story that feels as if it needs to be told and yet a child could not understand it or if they could it would be an inhuman thing to tell them it hmm it doesnt sound like a story you have ever told me shall i tell it to you now it sounds like a painful story to tell it is perhaps it is painful to hear too do you want to tell it to me i dont know the protector returned to his palace his son still lived though his grip on life seemed tenuous and frail doctor bredelle took over from doctor aesimil but he was no more able to determine what was wrong with the boy than he was able to treat him successfully lattens drifted in and out of consciousness sometimes unable to recognise his father or his nurse on other occasions sitting up in bed and pronouncing himself feeling much better and almost recovered these periods of lucidity and apparent recovery grew further and further apart however and the boy spent more and more time curled up in his bed asleep or in a halfway stage between sleep and wakefulness eyes closed limbs twitching muttering to himself turning and moving and jerking as though in a fit he ate almost nothing and would drink only water or very diluted fruit juice dewar still worried that lattens might be being poisoned in some subtle way he arranged with the protector and the superintendent of an orphans home that a set of twins be brought to the palace to act as tasters for the boy the two identical boys were a year younger than lattens they were slightly built and a poor start in life had left them with delicate constitutions which made them prone to any passing illness nevertheless they thrived while lattens weakened happily finishing off each of the meals he barely tasted so that by the proportion consumed it might have seemed to a casual observer that it was he who tasted the food for them for a few days after their even more hurried return to crough urleyn and those in his immediate party had outdistanced the news from ladenscion and there was a frustrating lack of new intelligence from the war urleyn stamped about the palace unable to settle to anything and found little solace even in the harem the younger girls in particular only made him annoyed with their simpering attempts at sympathy and he spent more time with perrund than with all of them just sitting talking on most occasions a hunt was arranged but the protector called it off just before it started worried that the chase might take him too far away from the palace and the sick bed of his son he attempted to apply himself to the many other affairs of state but could find little patience for courtiers provincial representatives or foreign dignitaries he spent longer in the palace library reading old accounts of history and the lives of ancient heroes when news did eventually arrive from ladenscion it was equivocal another city had been taken but yet more men and war machines had been lost a few of the barons had indicated that they wanted to discuss terms that would let them remain loyal to tassasen in theory and through token tribute but retain the independence they had achieved through their rebellion as generals ralboute and simalg understood that this was not a course the protector wished to pursue more troops were called for it was to be hoped that as this news had undoubtedly crossed with the fresh soldiers already on their way to the war this last request was redundant this intelligence had been delivered in a coded letter and there seemed little to debate or discuss as a result of it but urleyn convened a full war cabinet in the maphall nevertheless dewar was invited to attend but commanded not to speak perhaps the best thing would be for you to take yourself away brother take myself away what go on an improving tour visit some old aunt in the countryside what do you think you mean take myself away i mean that perhaps the best thing would be for you to be somewhere else ruleuin said frowning the best thing brother urleyn said would be for my son to make a full and swift recovery the war in ladenscion to end immediately in total victory and my advisors and family to stop suggesting idiocies dewar hoped ruleuin would hear the annoyance in his brothers voice and take the hint but he kept on well then he said the better thing i should have said rather than the best might be to go to ladenscion perhaps to take on all the responsibilities of the wars command and so to have less room in your mind for the worry the boys illness must be causing you dewar sitting just behind urleyn at the head of the map table could see some of the others looking at ruleuin with expressions of disapproval and even mild scorn urleyn shook his head angrily great providence brother what do you think i am were either of us raised to be so lacking in feeling can you simply turn off your emotions i cannot and i would treat with the gravest suspicion anybody who claimed they could they would not be a man they would be a machine an animal providence even animals have emotions urleyn glanced round the others gathered about the table as though daring any of them to assert such coldness for themselves i cant leave the boy like this i did try to as you may recall and i was called back would you have me go and then be worrying about him every day and night would you have me there in ladenscion while my heart was here taking command but unable to give it my full attention ruleuin finally seemed to see the wisdom in remaining silent he pressed his lips together and studied the table top in front of him we are here to discuss what to do about this damned war urleyn said gesturing at the map of tassasens borders spread out in the centre of the great table the condition of my son keeps me here in crough but other than that it has no bearing on our meeting ill thank you not to mention it again he glared at ruleuin who still stared tightupped at the table now has anyone anything to say which might actually prove useful what is to be said sir zespiole said we are told little in this latest news the war continues the barons wish to keep what they hold we are too far from it to be able to contribute much unless it is to agree to what the barons propose that is scarcely more helpful urleyn told the guard commander impatiently we can send more troops yetamidous said but i wouldnt advise it we have few enough left to defend the capital as it is and the other provinces have been stripped bare already it is true sir said viltere a young provincial commander called to the capital with a company of light cannon vilteres father had been an old comrade of urleyns during the war of succession and the protector had invited him to the meeting if we take too many men to punish the barons we might be seen to encourage others to emulate them by leaving our provinces devoid of policing if we punish the barons severely enough urleyn said we might be able to convince these others of the folly of such a course indeed sir the provincial commander said but first we must do so and then they must hear about it theyll hear about it urleyn said darkly i have lost all patience with this war i will accept nothing else than complete victory no further negotiations will be entered into i am sending word to simalg and ralboute that they must do all they can to capture the barons and when they do they are to send them here like common thieves though better guarded they will be dealt with most severely bileth looked stricken urleyn noticed yes bileth he snapped the foreign minister looked even more discomfited i he began i well what man urleyn shouted the tall foreign minister jumped in his seat his long thin grey hair flouncing briefly are you is the protector quite its just that sir great providence bileth urleyn roared youre not going to disagree with me are you finally found a sliver of backbone have we where in the skies of hell did that fall from bileth looked grey i do beg the protectors pardon i would simply beg to ask him reconsider treating the barons in quite such a fashion he said a desperate anguished look on his narrow face how the fuck should i treat the bastards urleyn asked his voice low but seething with derision they make war on us they make fools of us they make widows of our womenfolk urleyn slammed a fist on to the table making the map of the borderlands flap in the breeze how in the name of all the old gods am i supposed to treat the sons of bitches bileth looked as if he was about to cry even dewar felt slightly sorry for him but sir the foreign minister said in a small voice several of the barons are related to the haspidian royal family there are matters of diplomatic etiquette when dealing with nobility even if they are rebellious if we can but prise one away from the others and treat with him well then perhaps we can bring him to our side i understand you understand very little it would seem sir urleyn told him in a voice dripping with scorn bileth seemed to shrink in his seat ill have no more talk of etiquette he said spitting out the word it has become clear that these scum have been teasing us urleyn told bileth and the others they play the seductress these proud barons they act the coquette they hint that they might succumb to us if we treat them just a little better that they will be ours if only we flatter them a little more if only we can find it in our hearts and our pockets to provide them with a few more gifts a few more tokens of our esteem why then they will open their gates then they will help us with their less cooperative friends and all their resistance so far will prove to have been for show a pretty fight they have been putting up for the sake of their maidenly honour urleyn hit the table again well no we have been led along for the last time the next leading will be done by an executioner when he pulls on the chain of one of these proud barons and brings him to the public square to be tormented like a common murderer and then put up to burn well see how the rest of them respond to that yetamidous slapped the table with the flat of his hand and stood up out of his seat well said sir thats the spirit zespiole watched bileth shrink further in his seat and exchanged looks with ruleuin who looked down zespiole pursed his lips and studied the map on the table the others gathered round the table lesser generals advisors and aides busied themselves in a variety of other ways but none looked directly at the protector or said anything in contradiction urleyn gazed round at their faces with a look of mocking admonition what is there nobody else to take my foreign ministers side he asked waving one hand at the subsiding form that was bileth is he to remain alone and unseconded in his campaign nobody said anything zespiole urleyn said the guard commander looked up sir do you think i am right should i refuse to entertain any further advances from our rebellious barons zespiole took a deep breath i think we might profitably threaten the barons with what you have mentioned sir and if we take one carry it out yes zespiole studied the great fan of window on the wall opposite where glass and semiprecious stones shone with sunlight i can appreciate the prospect of seeing one of the barons so humbled sir and as you say there are enough widows in this city who would cheer his screams sufficient to drown them out you see no intemperateness in such a course sir urleyn asked reasonably no rashness no cruel impetuousness which might rebound on us that would be a possibility perhaps zespiole said with a flicker of uncertainty a possibility perhaps urleyn said in a voice that mocked the guard commanders but we must do better than that commander this is an important matter one that needs our gravest consideration we cannot make light of it can we or perhaps not perhaps you disagree do you disagree commander i agree that we must think hard about what we are going to do sir zespiole said his voice and manner serious good commander urleyn said with what appeared to be sincerity i am glad we have extracted a hint of decision from you he looked round everybody else are there any other views i should hear from any of you heads went down all around the table dewar began to be thankful that the protector had not thought to turn round and ask him his opinion indeed he still worried that he might he suspected nothing he could say would make the general happy sir said viltere all eyes turned to the young provincial commander dewar hoped he wasnt going to say something stupid urleyn glared what sir sir i was sadly too young to be a soldier during the war of succession but t have heard from many a commander whose opinion i respect and who served under you that your judgment has always proved sure and your decisions farsighted they told me that even when they doubted your decree they trusted you and that trust was vindicated they would not be where they are and we would not be here today at this the young commander looked round the others were it otherwise the other faces round the table searched urleyns for a response before they reacted urleyn nodded slowly perhaps i should take it ill he said that it is our most junior and most recently arrived recruit who holds the highest opinion of my faculties dewar thought he detected a sense of cautious relief around the table im sure we all feel the same way sir said zespiole with an indulgent smile to viltere and a cautious one to urleyn very well urleyn said we shall consider what fresh troops we might be able to send to ladenscion and we shall tell ralboute and simalg to prosecute the war against the barons without respite or negotiation gentlemen with that and a perfunctory nod urleyn rose and marched away dewar followed then let me tell you something closer to the truth only closer sometimes the truth is too much to bear i have a strong constitution yes but i meant that sometimes it is too much for the teller not the told ah well then tell me what you can oh there is not so much now i approach it and it is a common story all too common the less i tell you of it the more you could be hearing it from a hundred a thousand ten thousand mouths or more i have a feeling it is not a happy story indeed anything but it is just that of women especially young women caught up in a war ah you see a story that scarcely needs to be told the ingredients imply the finished article and the method of its making do they not it is men who fight wars wars are fought taking villages towns and cities where women tend the hearths and when the place that they live is taken so are they their honour becomes one of the spoils their bodies too invaded that territory taken so my story is no different from that of tens of thousands of women regardless of their nation or their tribe and yet for me it is everything for me it is the most important thing that ever happened to me for me it was the end of my life and what you see before you is like a ghost a spirit a mere shade unsubstantial please perrund he reached out his hands towards her in a gesture that required no response and did not seek to end in a touch it was instead a movement of sympathy even supplication if this hurts you so you dont need to continue for me ah but does it hurt you dewar she asked and there was a sharp edge of bitterness and accusation in her voice does it make you embarrassed i know you have a regard for me dewar we are friends these two sentences were uttered too quickly for him to be able to react are you upset on my behalf or your own most men would rather not hear what their fellows have done what people who may indeed be very like them are capable of do you prefer not to think about such things dewar do you think that you are so different or do you become secretly excited at the idea lady i gain no benefit or pleasure at all from the subject are you sure dewar and if you are do you really think you speak for the majority of your sex for are women not supposed to resist even those they would happily surrender to so that when they resist a more brutal violation how can the man be sure that any struggle any protestation is not merely for show you must believe that we are not all the same and even if all men might be said to have base urges we do not all give in to them or pay them any respect even in secret i cannot tell you how sorry i am to hear what happened to you but you have not heard dewar you have not heard at all i have implied that i was raped that did not kill me that alone might have killed the girl i was and replaced her with a woman with a bitter one with an angry one or one who wished to take her own life or attempt to take the life of those who violated her or one who simply became mad i think i might have become angry and bitter and i would have hated all men but i think i would have survived and might have been persuaded by the good men i knew in my own family and in my own town and perhaps by one good man in particular who must now for ever remain in my dreams that all was not lost and the world was not quite so terrible a place but i never had that opportunity to recover dewar i was pushed so far down in my despair i could not even tell in which direction the way back up lay what happened to me was the least of it dewar i watched my father and my brothers butchered after they had been forced to watch my mother and my sisters being fucked time after time by a fine and numerous company of highranking men oh you look down does my language upset you are you offended have i violated your ears with my intemperate soldiers words perrund you must believe that i am sorry for what happened to you but why should you be sorry it was not your fault you were not there you assure me that you disapprove so why should you be sorry i would be bitter in your place in my place how could that be dewar you are a man in the same place you would be if not one of the violators one of those who looked away or remonstrated with their comrades afterwards if i was the age you were then and a pretty youth ah so you can share what happened to me i see that is good i am comforted perrund say anything you want to me blame me if it will help but please believe i believe you what dewar i believe you feel sorry for me but your sympathy stings like salty tears in a wound because i am a proud ghost you see oh yes a proud ghost i am an enraged shade and a guilty one because i have come to admit to myself that i resent what was done to my family because it hurt me because i was raised to expect everything to be done for me i loved my parents and my sisters in my own way but it was not a selfless love i loved them because they loved me and made me feel special i was their baby their chosen beloved through their devotion and protection i learned none of the lessons that children usually learn about the way the world really works and the way that children are used within it until that single day that one morning when every fond illusion i held was torn from me and the brutal truth forced into me i had come to expect the best of everything i had come to believe that the world would always treat me as i had been treated in the past and that those i loved would be there to love me in return my fury at what happened to my family is partly caused by that expectation that happy assumption being defiled and obliterated that is my guilt perrund you must know that should not be a cause for guilt what you feel is what any decent child feels when they realise the selfishness they have felt when they were younger still a selfishness that is only natural to children especially those who have been loved so intensely the realisation occurs it is felt briefly and then it is rightly set aside you have not been able to set yours aside because of what those men did to you but oh stop stop do you think i do not know all this i know it but i am a ghost dewar i know but i cannot feel i cannot learn i cannot change i am stuck i am pinned to that time by that event i am condemned there is nothing i can do or say that can alter what happened to you perrund i can only listen only do what you will let me do oh do i persecute you do i make you a victim now dewar no perrund no perrund no perrund ah dewar the luxury of being able to say no he went half kneeling half on his haunches by her then putting himself very near to her but still not touching her his knee near hers his shoulder by her hip his hands within grasp of hers he was close enough to smell her perfume close enough to feel the heat from her body close enough to feel the hot breath that laboured from her nose and her halfopen mouth close enough for one hot tear to hit her clenched fist and spatter even tinier droplets on to his cheek he kept his head bowed and crossed his hands on his raised knee the bodyguard dewar and the court concubine perrund were in one of the palaces more secret places it was an old hiding hole in one of the lower levels a space the size of a cupboard which led off one of the public rooms in the original noble house which had formed the basis of the greater building retained more for sentimental than practical reasons by the first monarch of tassasen and through a kind of indifference by subsequent rulers the rooms which had seemed so grand to that first king had long since been judged too small and mean of proportion by future generations and were nowadays used only for storage the tiny room had been used to spy on people it was a listening post unlike the alcove dewar had burst from to attack the sea company assassin it was not built for a guard but for a noble so that he could sit there with only a small hole in the stonework between him and the public room that hole perhaps hidden by a tapestry or painting and listen to what his guests were saying about him perrund and dewar had come here after she had asked him to show her some of the parts of the palace he had discovered on the wanderings which she knew he took shown this tiny room it had suddenly reminded her of the secret compartment in their house in which her parents had concealed her when the town was sacked during the war of succession if i knew who those men were dewar would you be my champion would you avenge my honour she asked him he looked up into her eyes they looked extraordinarily bright in the dim light of the hidden room yes he said if you knew who they were if you could be sure would you ask me to she shook her head angrily she wiped away her tears with her hand no the ones i could identify are dead now anyway who were they kings men perrund said looking up and away from dewar as though telling the small hole where the ancient noble had thought to eavesdrop on his guests the old kings men one of his baron commanders and his friends they had been in charge of the siege and the taking of the town apparently we were favoured whoever was their spy had told them my fathers house held the towns most comely maidens they came to us first and my father tried to offer them money to leave us alone they took that badly a merchant offering a noble man money she looked down at her lap where her good hand still damp with tears lay beside her wasted hand in its sling i knew all their names eventually all the noble ones at any rate they died during the rest of the course of the war i tried to tell myself that i felt good when i heard about the first few dying but i did not i could not i felt nothing that was when i knew i was dead inside they had planted death in me dewar waited a long time before he said softly and yet you live and you saved the life of the one who ended the war and brought about a better law there is no right of ah dewar there is always the right of the strong to take the weak and the rich to take the poor and the powerful to take those who have no power urleyn may have written down our laws and changed a few of them but the laws that still bind us to the animals cut the deepest men compete for power they strut and parade and they impress their fellows with their possessions and they take the women they can none of that has changed they may use weapons other than their hands and teeth they may use other men and they may express their dominance in money not other symbols of power and glamour but and yet dewar insisted still you are alive and there are people who have the highest regard for you and feel their lives have been the better for having known you did you not say you had found a type of peace and contentment here in the palace in the harem of the chief she said though with something more like measured disdain than the fury that had been in her voice earlier as a cripple kept on out of sympathy in the collection of mates for the foremost male of the pack oh come we may act like animals men especially but we are not animals if we were there would not be the shame in acting so we act otherwise too and set a better marker where is love in what you say of where you are now do you not feel even slightly loved perrund she reached out quickly and put her hand on his cheek letting it rest there as easily and naturally as though they were brother and sister or a husband and wife long married as you say dewar our shame comes from the comparison we know we might be generous and compassionate and good and could behave so yet something else in our nature makes us otherwise she smiled a small empty smile yes i feel something i recognise as love something i remembersomething i may discuss and mull and theorise over she shook her head but it is not something i know i am like a blind woman talking about how a tree must look or a cloud love is something i have a dim memory of the way someone who went blind in their early childhood might recall the sun or the face of their mother i know affection from my fellow whorewives dewar and i sense regard from you and feel some in return i have a duty to the protector just as he feels he has a duty to me as far as that goes i am content but love that is for the living and i am dead she stood before he could say more now please take me back to the harem the doctor i do not believe the doctor thought there was anything amiss i know i did not suspect anything the gaan kuduhn seemed to have disappeared as quickly as he had arrived taking ship for far chuenruel the day after wed met him which left the doctor a little sad there had when i thought about it later been hints that the palace was preparing for a large contingent of new guests a degree more activity in certain corridors than one might have expected doors being used that were not normally open rooms being aired but none of it was particularly obvious and the web of rumour that connected all the servants assistants apprentices and pages had not yet woken up to what was going on it was the second day of the second moon my mistress was visiting the old untouchable quarter where once the lowest classes foreigners bondagers and quarantiners were forced to dwell it was still a far from salubrious area but no longer walled and patrolled it was there that the master chemicalist and metaliciser or so he styled himself chelgre had his workshop the doctor had risen very late that morning and seemed much the worse for wear for about a bell or so she sighed heavily and frequently she said little to me but rather muttered to herself she appeared a trifle unsteady on her feet and her face was pale however she shook off the effects of her hangover with astonishing rapidity and while she remained subdued for the rest of the morning and the afternoon she seemed otherwise back to normal after her late breakfast just before we set off for the untouchable quarter of what had been said the night before not a further word was spoken i think both of us were a little embarrassed at what we had admitted and implied to each other and so achieved an unspoken but fully mutual agreement to keep our own counsel on the subject master chelgre was his usual strange and singular self he was of course well known around the court both for his wildhaired and ragged appearance and his abilities with cannons and their dark powder i need say no more for the purposes of this report besides the doctor and chelgre talked of nothing that i could understand we returned by the fifth bell of the afternoon on foot but escorted by a couple of barrow boys pushing a small cart loaded with strawwrapped clays containing yet more chemicals and ingredients for what i was starting to suspect would be a long season of experiments and potions at the time i recall feeling mildly resentful of this for i did not doubt that i would be heavily involved in whatever the doctor had in mind and that my efforts would be in addition to those domestic tasks she had come to rely on me performing as a matter of course to me i strongly suspected would fall most of the weighing and measuring and grinding and combining and diluting and washing and scouring and polishing and so on which this new batch of observations would require there would be proportionately less time for me to spend with my fellows playing cards and flirting with the kitchen girls and without being shy about it that sort of thing had become relatively important to me in the past year even so i suppose it could be said that in some cellar of my soul i was secretly pleased to be so relied upon by the doctor and was looking forward to being crucially involved with her efforts these would after all mean us being together working as a team working as equals closeted in her study and workshop passing many happily intense evenings and nights together striving for a shared goal could i not hope that a greater regard might blossom in such intimate circumstances now that she knew it was in my thoughts the doctor had been decisively rejected by the one she loved or at least the one she believed she loved while the manner in which she had declined the connotation of my interest in her seemed to me to be more to do with modesty than hostility or even indifference yet i did feel a degree of petulance towards the ingredients being wheeled up the street in front of us that evening how i regretted that feeling so soon afterwards how unsure that future i had envisaged for myself and her really was a warm wind seemed to blow us up the market square towards the blister gate where long shadows advanced to meet us we entered the palace the doctor paid the barrow boys off and a handful of servants were summoned to help me carry the clays crates and boxes up to our apartments i laboured under a rotund clay i knew was full of acid chafing at the thought of having to share the same cramped set of rooms with it and its fellows the doctor was talking about having a workbenchlevel hearth and chimney constructed to allow the noxious fumes to escape better but i suspected that even so the next few moons would see me with running eyes and an aching nose not to mention hands pimpled with tiny burns and clothes perforated with pinhead holes we achieved the doctors apartments just as xamis was setting the casks clays and so on were distributed about the rooms the servants were thanked and given a few coins and the doctor and i lit the lamps and set to unpacking all the inedible and poisonous provisions we had purchased from master chelgre a knock came at the door just after seventh bell i answered it to find a servant i did not recognise he was taller and a little older than me oelph he said grinning here a note from the gc he shoved a sealed piece of paper addressed to doctor vosill into my hand the who i asked but he had already turned and was sauntering off down the corridor i shrugged the doctor read the note i am to attend the guard commander and duke ormin in the suitors wing she said sighing and pushing her fingers through her hair she looked round the halfunpacked cases would you mind doing the rest of this oelph of course not mistress i think its obvious where everything goes like with like if there is anything unfamiliar just leave it on the floor ill try not to be too long very well mistress the doctor buttoned her shirt up to the neck sniffed at one of her armpits just the sort of thing she did which i found unladylike and even distressing but which i look back on now with an ache of longing then shrugged threw on a short jacket and made for the door she opened it then came back looked round the mess of straw boxplanks twine and sacking that lay strewn across the floor picked up her old dagger which she had been using to cut or rather saw the twine around the boxes and crates and went off whistling the door closed i do not know what made me look at the note which had summoned her she had left it lying on top of an opened crate and as i pulled the straw out of another box nearby the fold of creamy paper kept attracting my eye eventually after a glance at the door i lifted the note and sat down to read it it said little more than what the doctor had told me i read it again d vosill kindly to meet d ormin and gc adlain in the suitors wing on receipt privately pgtk adlain providence guard the king indeed i looked at the last word for a few moments the name at the end of the note was adlain but it did not look like his writing which i knew of course the note had probably been dictated or composed and written by epline adlains page on his masters instructions but i thought i knew his writing too and this was not it i cannot claim that i thought any further or at any greater depth i could claim a host of reasons for what i did next but the truth is that i do not know unless instinct itself can be cited even to call it instinct may be to dignify the urge at the time it felt more like a whim or even a sort of trivial duty i cannot even claim that i felt fearful or had a premonition i simply did it i had been prepared to follow the doctor from the start of my mission i had expected to be told to shadow her one day to follow her into the city on one of the occasions she did not take me along with her yet never had my master requested such a thing i had assumed that he retained other people more experienced and adept at such behaviour and less likely to be recognisable to the doctor for such work so in putting out the lamps locking the door behind me and following her i was in a sense doing something i had long thought i would one day find myself doing i left the note lying where i had picked it up the palace seemed quiet i supposed most people were preparing for dinner i ascended to the rooffloor the servants who had their rooms up here would all be busy just now and probably nobody would see me as i flitted by also this way to the old suitors wing was shorter for somebody who was not thinking about what he was doing i was thinking remarkably clearly i descended to the dark confines of the little court by the servants stairs and skirted the corner of the old north wing now in the southern part of the palace by the light of foy iparine and jairly lamps burned in the distant windows of the main part of the palace pointing my way for a few steps before the light was eclipsed by the shuttered façade of the old north wing like the suitors wing this would not normally be used at this time of year unless there was a great state occasion the suitors wing looked shuttered and dark too save for one sliver of light showing at the edge of the main doorway i kept to the twothirds darkness at the foot of the old north wings wall as i approached and felt exposed beneath the single intrusive eye of jairly with the king in residence there were supposed to be regular guard patrols even here where there would not normally be anybody i had seen no hint of any guards so far and had no idea how often they made their rounds or indeed if they really did bother with this part of the palace but even knowing that men of the palace guard might appear made me more nervous than i felt i really ought to be what had i to hide was i not a good and faithful servant and devoted to the king yet here i was quite consciously skulking i would have to cross another courtyard in the light of the three moons if i were to use the main entrance of the suitors wing but even without thinking about it i knew i did not want to use that front entrance then i found what i recalled ought to be here a way which led beneath the north wing to a smaller galleried courtyard within there were gates at the far end just visible in the gloom of the tunnel but they were open the narrow courtyard was silent and ghostly the painted gallery posts looked like stiff white sentries watching me i took the small tunnel on the far side of the court also gated but not locked and one left turn later found myself at the rear of the suitors wing in the shadow of all three moons with the buildings woodenshuttered facade tall and blank and dark above me i stood there wondering how i was going to get in then walked along until i found a doorway the door would be locked i thought but then when i tried it it was not now why should that be i pulled the slab of wood slowly to me expecting it to creak but it did not the darkness inside was complete the door closed behind me with a soft thud i had to feel my way along the corridor inside one hand on the wall to my right my other hand out in front of my face these would be the servants quarters the floor under my feet was naked stone i passed several doors they were all locked save for one which gave access to a large empty cupboard with a faint acrid acidic smell which made me suspect it had once contained soap i banged my hand on one of its shelves and almost swore out loud back in the corridor again i came to a wooden stairway i crept upwards and came to a door from the bottom of the door there was the very faintest suggestion of light hinted at only when i did not look directly at it i twisted the handle carefully and pulled the door towards me for less than a hands width down a broad carpeted corridor lined with paintings i could see that the source of the light was a room at the far end near the main doorway i heard a cry and what might have been the sound of a scuffle and then another cry footsteps sounded in the distance and the light in the doorway changed an instant before a figure appeared there it was a man that was about all i could ever be sure of the fellow came running down the corridor straight towards me it took me a moment to realise that he might actually be heading for the door i was hiding behind in that time he covered about half the length of the corridor there was something wild and desperate about him that put a terror into me i turned and jumped down the dark stairs landing heavily and hurting my left ankle i stumbled towards where i thought the unlocked cupboard door ought to be my hands flailed around the wall for a moment until i found the door then i pulled it open and threw myself inside just as a bang and a thin wash of light announced that the man had thrown open the door at the top of the stairs heavy footsteps clattered down i leant back against the shelves i put ray hand out towards the swinging shadow of the cupboard door to pull it back but it was out of my reach the man must have run into it for there was a loud bang and a yelp of pain and anger the cupboard door slammed shut and i was left in darkness another heavier door slammed somewhere outside and a key rattled in a lock i pushed the cupboard door open a small amount of light was still falling down the stairway i heard some noise from the top of the stairs but it sounded distant it might have been a door closing i went back to the top of the steps and looked out through the halfopen door down the broad corridor the light changed again in the doorway near the main entrance at the far end i got ready to run again but nobody appeared instead there was a stifled cry a womans cry a terrible fear shook me then and i started to walk down the corridor i had gone perhaps five or six steps when the main doors at the far end of the hall were thrown open and a troop of guards rushed in swords drawn two of them stopped and looked at me while the rest made straight for the door where the light was coming from you here one of the guards shouted pointing his sword at me shouts and a womans frightened voice came from the lit room i walked on trembling legs down the hall towards the guards i was grabbed by the collar and forced into the room where the doctor was being held by two tall guardsmen her arms pinned forced back against a wall she was shouting at the men duke ormin lay motionless on his back on the floor in a huge pool of dark blood his throat had been cut a thin flattened metal shaft protruded from above his heart the flat metal shaft was the handle of a thin knife made all of metal i recognised it it was one of the doctors scalpels i think i lost the power of speech for a while i lost the power of hearing too i believe the doctor was still shouting at the men then she saw me and shouted at me but i could not make out what it was she was shouting i would have fallen to the floor had i not been supported by the scruff of the neck by the two guards holding me one of the guardsmen knelt by the body on the floor he had to kneel at the head of the duke to avoid the still spreading pool of darkness on the wooden floor he opened one of duke ormins eyes a piece of my brain still functioning told me that if he was checking for signs of life this was a foolish thing to do given the amount of blood that had flowed over the floor and the quite stationary shaft of the scalpel protruding from the dukes chest the guardsman said something i have a feeling it was dead or something similar but i cannot recall then there were more guards in the room until it became quite crowded and i could not see the doctor we were taken away i did not hear things properly again or find my own voice until we arrived at our destination back at the main palace in the torture chamber where duke quettils chief questioner master ralinge was waiting for us master i knew then that you must forsake me perhaps i was not supposed to be forsaken according to the original plan for that note purportedly from you did use the word privately which implied that the doctor was to go alone and not take me along with her so i could believe that i had been supposed to remain innocent of whatever the doctor was accused of but i had followed her and i had not thought to tell anybody else of my fears i also had not thought to stand my ground when the man who must have been the real murderer of duke ormin came thundering down the hall towards me no instead i had taken flight jumping down the stairs and hiding in a cupboard even when the fellow had banged into the cupboard door i had stayed back against the shelves of the cupboard hoping he would not look inside and discover me so i was complicit with my own downfall i realised as i was brought struggling into the chamber where last the doctor and i had been that night when we had been summoned by master nolieti the doctor for those moments was magnificent she walked erect her back straight her head raised i had to be dragged because my legs had entirely stopped working i think for myself that had i had the wit i would have shouted and screamed and struggled but i was too stunned there was a look on the doctors proud face of resignation and defeat but not of panic or fear i was not so deceived as to imagine for a moment that i appeared to be anything other than the way i felt which was shaking and quivering with abject terror my limbs reduced to jelly do i shame myself to say that i had soiled my breeches i think i do not master ralinge was an acknowledged virtuoso of pain the torture chamber it seemed very well lit i thought the walls were studded with torches and candles master ralinge must prefer being able to see what he was doing nolieti had favoured a darker and more menacing atmosphere i was already preparing myself to denounce the doctor and all her works i looked at the rack the cage the bath the brazier the bed the pokers and pincers and all the rest of the equipment and my love my devotion my honour itself turned to water and drained out through my heels whatever it was required of me to say i would say to save myself the doctor was doomed of that i was certain nothing i could do or say would save her her actions had been arranged to fit this accusation the suspicious note the odd locale the route left open for the real murderer the timely appearance of the guard so mobhanded even the fact that master ralinge looked so brighteyed and happy to see us and had arranged and lit all his candles and stoked his brazier all spoke of arrangement of collusion the doctor had been forced to this by people capable of wielding great power and therefore there was absolutely nothing i could possibly do that would save her from her fate or in any way mitigate her punishment those of you who read this and think well i would have done whatever i could to have reduced her torment i beg you think again for you have not been marched into a torture chamber to see the instruments there waiting for you when you see those you think only of a way to stop them being used against you the doctor was taken without a struggle to a floor sink where she was forced to kneel while her hair was cut off and her head shaved that seemed to upset her for she started to shout and scream master ralinge did the cutting and shaving himself in a loving careful way he bunched in his fist brought to his nose and slowly sniffed each bundle of hair he removed from the doctors head i meanwhile was strapped upright to an iron frame i cannot recall what the doctor screamed or what master ralinge said i know they exchanged words that is all the master torturers motley collection of mismatched teeth gleamed in the candle light ralinge ran his hand over the doctors head and at one place over her left ear his hands stopped and he looked more closely muttering in his soft voice something which i could not make out then he ordered her stripped and placed on an iron bed by the brazier as the doctor was manhandled by the two guards who had brought her to this awful place the torturer slowly undid and pulled off his thick leather apron and then began to unbutton his trousers in a deliberate reverential manner he watched the two guards four eventually for the doctor put up a remarkably powerful fight as they stripped my mistress naked and so i saw what i had always hoped to see and was able to view what i had envisaged during many hundreds of shameful soporific imaginings the doctor nude and it meant nothing she was struggling pulling and heaving and trying to punch and kick and bite her skin mottled with exertion her face hot with tears and reddened with fear and fury this was no soft dream of lust here was no emollient vision of loveliness here was a woman about to be violated in the most base and disgusting ways possible and then tortured and then eventually killed she knew this as well as i and as well as ralinge and his pair of assistants did and as well as the guards who attended us what was my most fervent hope at that point it was that they did not know of my devotion to her if they thought me indifferent i might only hear her screams if they thought for a moment for the merest heartbeat that i loved her then the very rules of their profession would require that my eyelids be cut out and i would be forced to watch her every torment her clothes were thrown away landing in a heap in one corner by a bench something clinked master ralinge looked at the doctor as she was secured quite naked to the iron bed frame he looked down at his manhood stroking it then he dismissed the guards they looked both disappointed and relieved one of ralinges assistants locked the chamber door behind them there was upon ralinges face a bright and shining almost luminescent smile as he moved towards her the doctors dark clothes settled where they had fallen my eyes filled with tears thinking of how she had thought to check her progress as she had left her apartments being so careful as to go back and pick up that stupid blunt and useless dagger that she carried with her whenever she remembered what good could that do her now master ralinge said the first words that i could recall in detail since the doctor had read out the note in her apartments half a bell and an entire age earlier first things first madam he said he climbed up on to the bed the doctor had been strapped to his swollen manhood held poised within one fist the doctor looked into his eyes quite calmly she made a clicking noise with her mouth and her face took on a look of disappointment ah she said matteroffactly so you are serious and she smiled smiled then she said something that sounded like an instruction in a language i did not know it was not the language she had used with the gaan kuduhn a day earlier it was a different kind of language a language from somewhere i thought even as i heard it and closed my eyes for i could not bear to see what was going to happen next beyond even far drezen a language from nowhere and well what happened next how many times i have tried to explain it how many times i have attempted to make sense of it not so much for others but for myself my eyes as i hope will seem understandable given the feelings i lave attempted to imply through this journal were closed at the time i simply did not see what happened during the next few heartbeats i heard a whirring noise a noise like a waterfall a noise like a sudden wind like an arrow as it passes nearby ones ear then a long gasp which i realised later must in reality have been two gasps but in any case a long exhalation of sound and then a thud a punchlike concussion of what in retrospect was air and flesh and bone and what more bone metal wood metal i think who knows i felt a strange dizzying sensation i may have been senseless for a while i do not know when i woke if i woke it was to something that was impossible the doctor stood over me clad in her long white shirt she was bald of course having been shaved she looked utterly different alien she was undoing my bonds her expression seemed cool and assured her face and scalp were freckled with red there was red on the ceiling above the iron bed where she had been secured more blood was scattered almost everywhere i looked some of it still dripping from the nearby bench i looked at the floor master ralinge lay there or most of him did his body up to his lower neck lay on the stones still twitching where the rest was well there were quite sufficient pieces of red pink and grey distributed around the chamber for one to recreate something like what must have happened to his upper neck and head simply it was as though a bomb had exploded inside it i could see half a dozen teeth of various sizes and colours scattered about the floor like shrapnel ralinges assistants lay nearby in a single great spreading pool of blood their heads almost severed from their bodies only a strip of skin still connected the head of one to his shoulders his face was turned towards me and his eyes were still open i swear they blinked once then they slowly closed the doctor released me something moved at the hem of her loose shirt then the movement stopped she looked so steady and so certain and yet she looked so dead so utterly overpowered she turned her head to one side and said something in a tone i swear to this day was resigned and defeated even bitter something buzzed through the air we must imprison ourselves to save ourselves oelph she told me she put her hand on my mouth if that is possible warm and dry and strong we were in a cell a cell set within the walls of the torture chamber and separated from it by a grid of iron bars why she put us in here i had no idea the doctor had dressed herself i had hurriedly undressed while she looked away cleaned myself as best i could then dressed again meanwhile she had gathered up the long red hair ralinge had shaved from her head she looked at it regretfully as she stepped over the master torturers body then threw the gleaming red bundles on to the brazier where they crackled and spat and smoked and flamed and gave off a sickening smell she had quietly unlocked the door of the chamber itself before putting us both in this small cell locking the door from outside and throwing the keys on to the nearest bench then she had sat calmly down on the dirty straw floor and put her arms round her knees and stared blankly out at the carnage in the chamber outside i squatted down beside her my knee close to where her old dagger protruded from the top of her boot the air smelled of shit and burned hair and something sharp that i decided must be blood i felt sick for a little while i tried to concentrate on something trivial and was inordinately grateful to find something the doctors old battered dagger had lost the last of its little white beads round the top rim of its pommel under the smoky stone it looked neater more symmetrical now i thought i took a deep breath through my mouth to escape the smells of the torture chamber then cleared my throat what what happened mistress i asked you must report what you feel you have to oelph her voice sounded tired and hollow i shall say that the three of them fell out over me and killed each other but it doesnt really matter she looked at me her eyes seemed to drill into me i had to look away what did you see oelph she asked my eyes were closed mistress truly i heard a few noises wind a buzz a thud i think i was out of my senses for a short while she nodded and smiled thinly well thats handy should we not have attempted to run away mistress i dont think wed get very far oelph she said there is another way but we must be patient the matter is in hand if you say so mistress i said suddenly my eyes filled with tears the doctor turned to me and smiled she looked very strange and childlike with no hair she put her arm out and hugged me to her i rested my head on her shoulder she rested her head on mine and rocked me to and fro like a mother with her child we were still like that when the chamber door burst open and the guards rushed in they stopped and stared at the three bodies lying on the floor then hurried on towards us i shrank back convinced that our torment would shortly be resumed the guards looked relieved to see us which i found surprising one sergeant picked up the keys from the bench where the doctor had thrown them and released us and told us that we were needed at once for the king was dying the bodyguard still the protectors son hung on to life the convulsions and his lack of appetite had left lattens so weak he could barely lift his head to drink for a few mornings he seemed to be getting better but then he relapsed and seemed once again at the very door of death urleyn was distraught the servants reported that he raged round his apartments tearing sheets and pulling down tapestries and smashing ornaments and furniture and slicing ancient portraits with a knife the servants started to clean up the destruction when he went to visit lattens on his sick bed but when he returned urleyn threw the servants out and from then on he would let nobody into his rooms the palace seemed a terrible bleak place to be the atmosphere contaminated by the powerless fury and despair of the man at its heart urleyn remained in his wrecked apartments during this time only leaving to visit his son every morning and afternoon and the harem each evening where he lay usually with perrund collapsed in her lap or bosom while she stroked his head until he fell asleep but such peace never lasted long and he would soon twitch in his sleep and cry out and then wake and subsequently rise and return to his own rooms old and haggardlooking and sunk in despair the bodyguard dewar slept in a cot along the corridor from the door to urleyns rooms for most of the day he would pace up and down the same corridor fretting and waiting for urleyn to make one of his rare appearances the protectors brother ruleuin tried to see urleyn he waited patiently in the corridor with dewar then when urleyn appeared from his apartments and walked quickly in the direction of his sons room ruleuin joined dewar at urleyns side and tried to talk to his brother but urleyn ignored him and told dewar not to let ruleuin or anybody else approach him until he ordered so yetamidous zespiole and even doctor bredelle were all told this by the bodyguard yetamidous did not believe what he was being told he thought dewar was trying to keep them all away from the general he too waited in the corridor one day defying dewar to force him to leave when the door to urleyns apartments opened yetamidous pushed past dewars outstretched arm and walked towards the protector saying general i must talk to you but urleyn just looked at him from the doorway then without a word closed the door from the inside before yetamidous could get there the key turned in the lock yetamidous was left to fume in the doorway then he turned and walked away ignoring dewar will you really see no one sir dewar asked him as they strode to lattens room one day he thought urleyn would not answer but then he said no they need to talk to you about the war sir do they yes sir how goes the war not well sir well not well what does it matter tell them to do whatever has to be done i do not care to concern myself with it any more with respect sir your respect for me will be expressed from now on by speaking only when you are spoken to dewar sir sir urleyn said whirling to face the younger man and forcing him to retreat until his back was hard against a wall you will remain silent until i ask you to speak or i will have you removed from this building do you understand you may answer yes or no yes sir very well you are my bodyguard you may guard my body no more come the war was indeed going badly it was common knowledge in the palace that no more cities had been taken and indeed that one had been retaken by the barons forces if the message to try to capture the barons themselves had got through it was either not being acted upon or was impossible to accomplish troops disappeared into the lands of ladenscion and only the walking wounded seemed to return with tales of confusion and horror the citizens of crough began to wonder when the men who had been sent to the conflict might return and started to complain about the extra taxes which had been levied to pay for the war the generals at the war itself called for more troops but there were scarcely any troops left to send the palace guard had been halved with one half being formed into a company of pikemen and sent off to the war even the eunuchs of the harem guard had been pressed into service the generals and others who were attempting to administer the land and run the war while urleyn closeted himself away did not know what to do it was rumoured that guard commander zespiole had suggested that the only thing to do might be to bring all the troops home to burn all that could be burned of ladenscion and leave it to the damned barons it was also rumoured that when zespiole suggested this at the table where urleyn had held his last council of war half a moon earlier general yetamidous had let out a terrible roar and leaping to his feet and drawing his sword swore he would cut out the tongue of the next man to betray urleyns wishes and suggest such cowardice dewar came to the harems outer room one morning and requested that the lady perrund attend him mr dewar she said sitting on a couch he sat down on another couch across a small table from her he gestured at a wooden box and a game board lying on the table i thought we might play a game of leaders dispute would you humour me gladly perrund said they unfolded the board and set out the pieces what is the news she asked as they commenced playing of the boy no change dewar said sighing the nurse says he slept a little better last night but he barely recognises his father and when he talks he makes no sense from the war there is news of change but all of its ill i fear the whole thing has gone wrong the latest reports were confused but it sounds as though simalg and ralboute are both retreating if it is only a retreat there may still be some hope but the nature of the reports themselves makes me think it may in reality be a rout or well on the way to becoming one perrund stared at the man wideeyed providence can it really be that bad im afraid it can is tassasen itself in danger i would hope not the barons ought not to have the military wherewithal to invade us and there should be sufficient troops intact to mount an adequate defence if they did but oh dewar it sounds hopeless she looked into his eyes does urleyn know dewar shook his head he will not be told but yetamidous and ruleuin are talking about waiting outside lattens room this afternoon and demanding that he listen to them do you think he will i think he might i also think he might run away from them or order the guards to throw them out or run them through or strike at them himself dewar picked up his protector piece and turned it round in his fingers before replacing it on the board i dont know what hell do i hope he will listen to them i hope he will begin to act normally again and start to rule as he ought he cannot go on like this much longer without those in the war cabinet starting to think that theyd be better off without him he looked into perrunds widened eyes i cannot talk to him he told her she thought he sounded like a small hurt boy i am literally forbidden to if i thought i could say something to him i would but he has threatened that if i try to speak to him without his express permission he wilt have me removed from my position and i think i believe him so if i am to continue trying to protect him i must remain silent yet he must be told what a pass things have come to if yetamidous and ruleuin do not succeed this afternoon will i tonight perrund said her voice sharp dewar looked down for a moment then he met her gaze again i am sorry to have to ask you perrund i can only ask i would not even think of doing so if the situation were anything less than desperate but desperate it is he may not choose to listen to a crippled concubine dewar at the moment perrund there is nobody else will you make the attempt of course what ought i to say what i have told you that the war is on the verge of being lost ralboute and simalg are retreating that we can only hope that they are doing so in good order but the hints we have indicate otherwise tell him that his war cabinet is at odds with itself that its members cannot decide what to do and the only thing they may eventually agree on is that a leader who will not lead is less than worthless he must regain their trust and respect before it is too late the city the country itself is starting to turn against him there is discontent and wild talk of harbingers of catastrophe and the beginning of a dangerous nostalgia for what people call the old days tell him as much as he can bear of that my lady or as much as you dare but be careful he has raised his hand to his servants before now and i will not be there to protect you or him from himself perrund gazed levelly at him this is a heavy duty dewar it is and i am sorry to have to offer it to you but the moment has become critical if there is anything at all i can do to help you in this you have only to ask and it will be done if i can possibly do it perrund took a deep breath she looked at the game board with a faltering smile she waved her hand at the pieces between them and said well you could move his small sad smile matched hers the doctor the doctor and i stood on the quayside about us was all the usual tumult of the docks and in addition the local confusion which normally attends upon a great ship preparing to depart on a long voyage the galleon plough of the seas was due to sail with the next doubled tide in less than half a bell and the last supplies were being hoisted and carried aboard while everywhere about us amongst the coils of rope the barrels of tar the piled rolls of wicker fenders and flatly emptied carts were played out tearful scenes of farewell ours of course was one mistress can you not stay please i begged her the tears rolled miserably down my cheeks for all to see the doctors face was tired resigned and calm her eyes had a fractured faraway look about them like ice or broken glass glimpsed in the dark recesses of a distant room her hat was pulled tight over her brindled scalp i thought she had never looked so beautiful the day was blustery the wind was warm and the two suns shone down from either side of the sky opposing and unequal points of view i was seigen to her xamis the desperate light of my desire to have her stay entirely washed out by the bounteous blaze of her will to leave she took my hands in hers the brokenlooking eyes gazed tenderly upon me for the last time i tried to blink my tears out of the way resolved that if i would never see her again at least my last sight of her would be vivid and sharp i cant oelph im sorry cant i come with you then mistress i said even more miserably this was my last and most dismal play it had been the one thing i had been determined not to say because it was so obvious and so pathetic and so doomed i had known she would be leaving for a halfmoon or so and in those few handfuls of days i had tried everything i could think of to make her want to stay even while knowing that her going was inevitable and that none of my arguments could carry any weight with her not measured against what she saw as her failure during all that time i wanted to say then if you must go please take me but it was too sad a thing to say too predictable of course that is what i would say and of course she would turn me down i was a youth still and she a woman of maturity and wisdom what would i do if i went with her but remind her of what she had lost of how she had failed she would look at me and see the king and never forgive me for not being him for reminding her that she had lost his love even if she had saved his life i knew she would reject me if i said it so i had made an absolutely firm decision not to ask her it would be the one piece of my selfrespect i would retain but some inflamed part of my mind said she might say yes she might have been waiting for you to ask perhaps this seductive insane deluded sweet voice within me said she really does love you and would want nothing more than to take you with her back to drezen perhaps she feels that it is not for her to ask you because it would be taking you away from everything and everyone you have ever known perhaps for ever perhaps never to return and so like a fool i did ask her and she only squeezed my hands and shook her head i would let you if it was possible oelph she said quietly it is so sweet of you to want to accompany me i shall cherish always the memory of that kindness but i cannot ask you to come with me i would go anywhere with you mistress i cried my eyes now full of tears i would have thrown myself at her feet and hugged her legs if i had been able to see properly instead i hung my head and blubbered like a child please mistress please mistress i wept no longer even able to say what it was i wanted her to stay or me to go oh oelph i was trying so hard not to cry she said then gathered me in her arms and folded me to her at last to be held in her arms pressed against her and be allowed to put my arms round her feeling her warmth and her strength encompassing her firm softness drawing in that fresh perfume from her skin she put her chin on my shoulder just as mine rested on hers between my sobs i could feel her shake crying too now i had last been this close to her side by side my head on her shoulder her head on mine in the torture chamber of the palace half a moon earlier when the guards had tumbled in with the news that we were needed because the king was dying the king was indeed dying a terrible sickness had fallen upon him from nowhere causing him to collapse during a dinner being held for the suddenly and secretly arrived duke quettil king quience had been in the middle of a sentence when he stopped speaking stared straight ahead and started to shake his eyes had revolved back into his head and he had slumped down in his seat unconscious the wine goblet dropping froze his hand skelim quettils doctor was there he had had to remove the kings tongue from his throat or he would have choked to death immediately instead he lay there on the floor senseless and shaking spasmodically while everybody rushed around duke quettil attempted to take charge apparently ordering that guards be posted everywhere duke ulresile contented himself with staring while the new duke walen sat in his seat whimpering guard commander adlain posted a guard at the kings table to make sure nobody touched the kings plate or the decanter hed been drinking from in case somebody had poisoned him during all this commotion a servant arrived with the news that duke ormin had been murdered my thoughts oddly have turned to that footman whenever i have tried to envisage the scene a servant rarely gets to deliver genuinely shocking news to those of exalted rank and to be entrusted with something as momentous as the intelligence that one of the kings favourites has taken the life of a duke must seem like something of a privilege to discover that it is of relatively little consequence compared to the events unfolding before you must be galling i was subsequently more than usually diligent in quizzing as subtly as i could the servants who were in the dining chamber that evening and they reported that even at the time they noticed that certain of the dining guests did not react as one might have expected to the news presumably just because of the distraction of the kings sudden predicament it was almost they hazarded as though the guard commander and the dukes ulresile and quettil had been expecting the news doctor skelim ordered that the king be taken directly to his bed once there he was undressed skelim inspected the kings body for any marks that might indicate he had been shot with a poisoned dart or infected with something through a cut there were none the kings blood pulse was slow and becoming slower only increasing briefly when small fits passed through him doctor skelim reported that unless something could be done the kings heart was sure to stop within the bell he confessed himself at a loss to determine what had befallen the king the doctors bag was delivered from his room by a breathless servant but the few tonics and stimulants he was able to administer little better than smelling salts by the sound of them especially given that quience could not be induced to swallow anything had no effect whatsoever the doctor considered bleeding the king in effect the only thing he could think of which he had not tried but bleeding somebody with a weakening heartbeat had proved worse than useless in the past and on this occasion thankfully the urge not to make matters worse overcame the need to be seen to be doing something the doctor ordered some exotic infusions to be prepared but held out little hope that they would be any more effective than the compounds he had already administered it was you master who said that doctor vosill would have to be summoned i am told that duke ulresile and duke quettil took you aside and that there was a furious argument duke ulresile flew from the room in a blinding rage and later took a sword to one of his servants such that the poor fellow lost one eye and a pair of fingers i find it admirable that you stood your ground a contingent of the palace guards was sent to the questioning chamber with orders to take the doctor from there by force if necessary i am told that my mistress walked calmly in to the terrified confusion that was the kings chamber where nobles servants and it seemed half the palace were assembled crying and wailing she had sent me with a pair of guards to her chamber for her medicine bag we surprised one of duke quettils servants and another palace guard there both looked anxious and guilty at being caught in the doctors rooms duke quettils man held a piece of paper i recognised i have never i think been so proud of myself for anything i have done in my life as for what i did next for i was still half terrified that my ordeal had merely been postponed rather than cancelled i was shaking and sweating with the shock of what i had witnessed i was mortified at the callow and cowardly way i had felt in the torture chamber ashamed of how my body had betrayed me and my mind was still spinning what i did was take the note from quettils servant that is the property of my mistress i hissed and stepped forward a look of fury on my face i grabbed the note from the fellows fingers he looked blankly at me then at the note which i stuffed quickly into my shirt he opened his mouth to speak i turned still quivering with rage to the two guards who had been sent with me escort this person from these apartments immediately i said this was of course a gamble on my part in all the excitement it had been quite unclear whether the doctor and i were still technically prisoners or not and therefore the two guards might rightly have concluded that they were my jailers not my bodyguards which was the way i was treating them i would modestly claim that they were able to recognise something transparently honest and true about my righteous indignation and so decided to do as i commanded the dukes man looked terrified but did as he was told i buttoned up my jacket to further secure the note found the doctors bag and hurried to the kings chamber with my escorts the doctor had turned the king on to his side she knelt by his bed stroking his head in a distracted way fending off questions from doctor skelim a reaction to something in his food probably she told him extreme but not poison you stood master arms crossed near the doctor duke quettil lurked in a corner glaring at her she took a small stoppered glass vial from the bag holding it up to the light and shaking it oelph this is the salts solution number twentyone herbed do you know it i thought yes mistress well need more dried within the next two bells can you remember how to prepare it yes i think so mistress i may need to refer to our notes just so im sure your two guards will help you off you go then i turned to go then stopped and handed her the note which i had taken from the dukes man here is that paper mistress i said then quickly turned and left before she had time to ask me what it was i missed the uproar when the doctor pinched the kings nose and clamped a hand over his mouth until he turned nearly blue you master held back the protestations of the others but then grew concerned yourself and were about to order her away at sword point when she let the kings nose go and thrust the powder which the vial had contained under his nostrils the ruddy powder looked like dried blood but was not it whistled into the king as he took a huge deep indrawing breath most of the people in the room took their own first breath for some time for a while nothing happened then i am told the kings eyes flickered and opened he saw the doctor and smiled then coughed and wheezed and had to be helped to sit up he cleared his throat fixed the doctor with an outraged stare and said vosill what in the skies of hell have you done to your hair i think the doctor knew she would not need any more of salts solution number twentyone herbed it was her way of trying to make sure that she and i were not brought to the king made to cure him of whatever had befallen him and then promptly led away again back to the torture chamber she wanted people to think that the course of treatment required would be longer than what amounted to little more than a quick pinch of snuff nevertheless i returned to the doctors apartments with my two guards in escort and set up the equipment necessary to produce the powder even with the help of the two guards and it was a refreshing experience to be able to do the ordering around rather than to be subject to it myself it would be a closerun thing to produce a small amount of the substance in less than two bells at least it would give me something to do i only heard later and at second hand about the outburst of duke quettil in the kings chamber the sergeant of the guards who had released us from the cell in the torture chamber spoke quietly with you master shortly after the king was brought back to the land of the living i am told you looked a little shaken for a moment but then went grimfaced to inform duke quettil of the fate of his chief questioner and his two assistants dead dead by fuck adlain can you arrange nothing right were the dukes precise words by all accounts the king glared the doctor looked unperturbed everybody else stared the duke attempted to strike you and had to be restrained by two of your men who acted perhaps before they thought the king inquired what was going on the doctor meanwhile was looking at the piece of paper i had given her it was the note that purported to be from you and which had lured her to the trap that had killed duke ormin and was supposed to dispose of her the king had already heard from the doctor that ormin was dead and that she had been meant to appear to be the killer he was still sitting up in bed staring ahead and trying to digest this news the doctor had not yet given him the details of what had supposedly happened in the questioning chamber but merely said that she had been released before being put to the question she showed him the note he called you over and you confirmed that it was not your writing though it might be said to be a decent attempt at it duke quettil took the opportunity to demand that somebody be brought to justice for the murder of his men which may have been a little hasty as it raised the question concerning what they had been doing there in the first place the kings expression darkened as he gradually took in all that was revealed and several times he had to tell people trying to interrupt others to stop so that he could get clear in his still slightly befuddled head what had actually happened duke quettil reportedly breathing heavily and with staring eyes and spittle on his lips at one point attempted to grab the doctors wrist and pull her away from the king who put his arm round her shoulders and ordered you to keep the duke distant i was absent for all that passed over the next half bell what i know was passed to me by others and so must surrender the toll which information tends to pay when it passes through the minds and memories of others even so without having been there i believe there was some quick thinking done in that chamber principally by yourself though duke quettil must at the least have calmed down sufficiently to consider things in a more rational manner again and accept the path you were mapping out even if he could contribute little of the cartography himself the brief of it was that duke ulresile was to be blamed the writing on the note was his the palace guards swore that ulresile had commanded them on your authority later that night one of ulresiles men was brought before the king sobbing to confess that he had stolen the scalpel from the doctors apartments earlier that day and that he had killed duke ormin then run away and out of a back door of the suitors wing shortly before the doctor entered by the front door i was able to play my part averring that the fellow could well have been the man who had rushed towards me in the dim corridor in the suitors wing the fellow lied about the scalpel of course only one of the instruments had ever gone missing and that was the one i had stolen two seasons earlier the day we had visited the poor hospital of course i delivered it into your hands master though not in the literal sense in which it was later delivered into the body of duke ormin duke ulresile in the meantime had been prevailed upon to remove himself from the palace i think a more mature mind might have thought this through and realised that to fly so was to appear to confirm any accusations that might be levelled at him but perhaps he did not think to compare his predicament or possible actions with one so base as poor dead unoure in any event he was funnelfed some story about the kings displeasure being great but brief and largely a matter of a misunderstanding which quettil and yourself master would need a short period to sort out but a short period which absolutely required the young dukes absence the king made it very clear that he would take any further attempt to traduce the doctors good name very ill indeed you promised that everything would be done to clear up the remaining points of confusion in the matter two of the kings own guards were stationed outside our apartments that night i slept soundly in my cell until woken by a nightmare i think the doctor slept well in the morning she looked well enough she completed shaving her head making a neater job of it than master ralinge i assisted her in this in her bedroom while she sat on a chair with a towel round her shoulders and a basin on her knees in which warm suds and a sponge floated we were due to attend another meeting in the kings chamber that morning the better to give our side of the events of the previous night what did happen mistress i asked her where and when oelph she asked moistening her scalp with the sponge and then scraping at it with a scalpel of all things before passing it to me to complete the job in the questioning chamber mistress what happened to ralinge and the other two they fought over who would have me first oelph dont you remember i do not mistress i whispered with a look round at the door through to her workshop it was locked like the one beyond and the one beyond that but still i felt frightened as well as a sort of anguished guilt i saw master ralinge about to about to rape me oelph please oelph steady with that scalpel she said and put her hand on my wrist she lifted my hand away a little from her naked scalp and looked round with a smile it would be too ironic to survive a false charge of murder and be delivered from the very brink of torture only to suffer injury by your hand but mistress i said and i am not ashamed to say that i wailed for i was still convinced that we could not be surrounded by such fatally cataclysmic events and such powerfully antagonistic personages without attracting extreme harm there was no time for a dispute he was about to take you providence i saw him i closed my eyes a heartbeat before there was no time dear oelph the doctor said keeping her hand on my wrist you must have forgotten you were unconscious for some time your head rolled to one side your body went limp you fairly drooled im afraid the three men had a fine old argument while you were out of your senses and then just as the pair who had killed ralinge slashed at each other you woke up again dont you remember i looked into her eyes her expression was one i found impossible to read i was reminded suddenly of the mirror mask she had worn at the ball in yvenir palace is that what i ought to remember mistress yes oelph it is i looked down at the scalpel and the gleaming mirrorsurface of its blade but how did you come to be released from your bonds mistress why in his haste master ralinge simply did not secure one of them properly the doctor said releasing her grip of my wrist and lowering her head again a woeful lapse of professional standards but perhaps in a way a flattering one i sighed i picked up the soapy sponge and squeezed some more of the suds on to the back of her head i see mistress i said unhappily and scraped away the very last of the hair on her head i decided as i did this that perhaps my memory had been playing tricks on me after all because looking down at the doctors legs i could see her old dagger sticking out from the top of her boot as usual and there quite plainly was the little pale stone on the top rim of the pommel i had been so convinced had been absent yesterday in the torture chamber i think i knew already then there was no going back to the way things had been before even so it was a shock when the doctor paid a visit to the king by herself two days later and came back to tell me that she had asked to be released from the post of his personal physician i stood and stared at her still standing in the midst of unpacked crates and boxes of supplies and ingredients which she had continued to collect from the apothecaries and chemicalists of the city released mistress i asked stupidly she nodded i thought her eyes looked as if she had been crying yes oelph i think it is for the best i have been too long away from drezen and the king seems generally well but he was at deaths door not two nights ago i shouted unwilling to believe what i was hearing and what it meant she gave me one of her small smiles i think that will not occur again but you said it was caused by some what did you call it some allotropic galvanic of salt dammit all woman that could oelph i think it was the only time either of us spoke to each other in quite such tones i shrank from my fury like a punctured bladder i looked down at the floor sorry mistress i am quite sure she told me firmly that will not occur again yes mistress i mumbled you might as well pack this lot back up again a bell later i was in the depths of my misery repacking boxes crates and sacks on the doctors orders when you came to call master i would speak to you in private madam you said to the doctor she looked at me i stood there hot and sweating dotted with little lengths of straw from the packing cases she said i think oelph can stay dont you guard commander you looked at her for a few moments i recall then your stern expression melted like snow yes you said and sat down with a sigh in a chair which temporarily had no cases or their contents balanced upon it yes i dare say he can you smiled at the doctor she was just in the act of tying a towel round her head having finished one of her baths she always tied a towel round her hair after her bath and i remember thinking stupidly why is she doing that she has no hair to dry she wore a thick and voluminous shift which made her denuded head look very small until she tied the towel round it she picked a couple of boxes off a couch and sat you took a moment to seat yourself just as you wanted moving your sword so that it was comfortable placing your booted feet just so then you said i am told you have asked the king to release you from your post that is correct guard commander you nodded for a moment that is probably for the best oh im sure it is guard commander oelph dont just stand there she said turning to look at me continue with your work please yes mistress i mumbled i would dearly love to know quite what happened in the chamber that evening i am sure you already do guard commander and i am equally sure i do not madam you said with a resigned sigh in your voice a more superstitious man would think it must have been sorcery but you are not so deceived indeed not ignorant but not deceived i think i can say that if i had no other explanation i would be sorrier the longer the matter went unexplained and you were still here but as you say you are going yes back to drezen i have already inquired about a ship oelph i had let drop a flask of distilled water it had not broken but the noise had been loud sorry mistress i said trying not to burst out crying a ship do you feel your tithe here has been a success doctor i think so the king is in better health than when i arrived for that alone if i can take any of the credit i hope i may feel fulfilled still it will be good to get back amongst your own kind i imagine yes im sure you can imagine well i must be going you said standing then you said it was strange all those deaths at yvenir then good duke ormin and those three men strange sir so many knives or blades at any rate and yet so few found the murder weapons i mean yes strange you turned at the door that was a bad business the other night in the questioning chamber the doctor said nothing im glad you were delivered unscathed i would give a great deal to know how it was accomplished but i would not trade the knowledge for the result you smiled i dare say i will see you again doctor but if i do not let me wish you a safe journey back to your home and so a halfmoon later i stood on the quayside with the doctor hugging her and being hugged and knowing that i would do anything to make her stay or be allowed to follow her and also that i would never see her again she pushed me gently away oelph she said sniffing back her tears you will not forget that doctor hilbier is more formal in his approach than i i have respect for him but he mistress i will not forget anything you have told me good good here she reached into her jacket she presented me with a sealed envelope i have arranged with the mifeli clan that you have an account with them this is the authority you may use the earnings on what pleases you though i hope you will do a little experimentation of the type i taught you mistress but the capital i have instructed the mifelis the capital only becomes yours when you achieve the title of doctor i would advise you to buy a house and premises but mistress an account what but what where i said genuinely astonished she had already left me what she thought might come in useful to me and what i might be able to store in a single room in the house of my new mentor doctor hilbier from her supplies of medicines and raw materials it is the money the king gave me she said i dont need it it is yours also there is in the envelope the key to my journal it contains all the notes and the descriptions of my experiments please use it as you see fit oh mistress she took my hand in hers and squeezed be a good doctor oelph be a good man now quickly she said with a desperately sad and unconvincing laugh to save our tears before we both become hopelessly dehydrated eh let us and if i became a doctor mistress i asked in a far more collected and cold manner than i would have imagined i was capable of at such a moment if i became a doctor and used some of the money to mirror your trip and come to drezen she had started to turn away she turned halfway back and looked at the wooden decking of the quay no oelph no i i dont think ill be there she looked up and smiled a brave smile goodbye oelph fare well goodbye mistress thank you i will love you for ever i thought the words and could have said them might have said them perhaps nearly said them but in the end did not say them it may be that that was the unsaid thing even i did not know i had thought of saying that let me retain a shred of selfrespect she walked slowly up the first half of the steepset gangplank then lifted her head lengthened her stride straightened her back and strode up and on to the great galleon her dark hat disappearing somewhere beyond the black webbing of the ropes all without a backward glance i walked slowly back up the city my head down my tears dripping down my nose and my heart in my boots several times i thought to look up and round but each time i told myself the ship would not have sailed yet all the time i kept hoping hoping hoping that i would hear the slap of running booted feet or the doubled thud of a pursuing sedan chair or the rattle of a hire carriage and the snort of its team and then her voice the cannon went for the bell echoing round the city and causing birds to flap and fly all over in wheeling dark flocks crying and calling and still i did not look round because i judged that i was in the wrong part of the city to see the harbour and the docks and then when i finally did look up and back i realised i had walked too far up into the city and i was almost in market square i could not possibly see the galleon from here not even its topmost sails i ran back down the way i had come i thought i might be too late but it was not too late and by the time i could see the docks again there was the great vessel all bulbous and stately and moving towards the harbour entrance under the tow of two long cutters full of men heaving on stout oars there were still many people on the dockside waving at the passengers and crew gathered near the stern of the departing galleon i could not see the doctor on the ship i could not see her on the ship i ran around the dockside like a mad man looking for her i searched each face studied every expression tried to analyse each stance and gait as though in my lovelorn lunacy i really believed that she had indeed decided to quit the ship and stay here stay with me this whole apparent departure just a maddeningly extended joke and yet on relinquishing the ship for a jest had decided to disguise herself just to taunt me further the galleon slipped out to sea almost without me noticing letting the cutters come creasing back across the waves while she beyond the harbour wall let drop her creamy fields of sail and took the wind about her after that the people drifted away from the quay until there were just a couple of sobbing women left one standing clutched in about herself her face quite covered by her hands the other squatting face raised to stare emptily at the skies while the tears coursed down her cheeks in silence and i staring out at the gap between the harbour lighttowers towards the distant line that was the jagged far circumference of crater lake and there i stood and wandered stunned and unsteady shaking my head and muttering to myself and started to leave several times but could not and so drifted back towards the quayside assailed by the treacherous sparkle of the water that had let her slip away from me buffeted by the wind that was blowing her further on her journey with each beat of my heart and hers and attended by the caustic cries of wheeling sea birds and the quiet and hopeless sobs of women the bodyguard the bodyguard dewar woke from a dream of flying he lay there a moment in the darkness for the few moments it took him to come fully awake remembering where he was who he was what he was and what had been happening the weight of the knowledge of all that had gone so wrong so recently settled on him like a dozen coats of chain mail thrown one by one upon his bed he even gave a little groan as he rolled over in the narrow cot and lay with one arm under the back of his head staring up into the blackness the war in ladenscion had been lost it was as simple as that the barons had got all they had ever asked for and more by taking it the dukes simalg and ralboute were on their way home with the tattered and dispirited remains of their armies lattens had edged a little closer to death whatever was wrong with him proof against every remedy the physicians could devise urleyn had sat in on one war council just yesterday once the full extent of the catastrophe in ladenscion had revealed itself through the jumble of reports and coded messages but he had stared down at the table surface throughout uttering only monosyllables mostly he showed a little more animation and a spark of his old self when he had roundly condemned simalg and ralboute for the whole debacle but even that tirade towards the end had seemed lacklustre and forced as though he could not maintain even his anger it had been decided that there was little that could be done the armies would return and the wounded would have to be cared for a new hospital would be set up to this purpose the army would be reduced to the minimum necessary for the defence of tassasen there had already been disturbances in the streets in a handful of cities when people who had in the past only grumbled over the increased taxes required for the war had rioted when they heard it had all been for nothing taxes would have to come down to keep the populace at peace and so a number of projects would have to be suspended or abandoned at some point negotiations with the victorious barons would have to be entered into to regularise matters once the situation had stabilised urleyn nodded all this through seemingly uninterested in it all the others could take care of it he had left the council of war to return to his sons bedside urleyn still would not let the servants into his apartments where he passed almost all his time he spent a bell or two at lattens side each day and visited the harem only erratically often just talking with the older concubines and especially with the lady perrund dewar felt a damp patch on his pillow where his cheek had lain during the night he turned over on his side absently touching the fold in the head bolster which he must have dribbled on to during the night how undignified we become in our sleep he thought rubbing the damp triangle of material between his fingers perhaps he had been sucking it while he slept he thought did one do that did people do such a thing perhaps children he leaped out of bed pulled on his hose teetering onelegged and cursing fastened his sword belt across his waist and grabbed his shirt as he kicked the door open and raced through the early morning shadows of his small living room and out into the corridor where startled servants had been snuffing the candles he ran quickly bare feet thudding on the wooden boards he pulled his shirt on as best he could he was looking for a guard to tell him to follow him but there were none to be seen rounding a corner that would take him towards lattens sick room he crashed into a servant carrying a breakfast tray sending the girl and the tray tumbling across the floor he shouted back an apology there was a guard at lattens door slumped asleep on a chair dewar kicked the seat and shouted at the man as he burst through the door the nurse looked up from the window where she had been sitting reading she looked with widened eyes at dewars bare chest revealed by the halftucked shirt lattens lay still in his bed a basin and a cloth lay on the table by his head the nurse seemed to shrink back a little as dewar strode across the room to the boys bed dewar heard the guard come in behind him he turned his head briefly and said hold her and nodded at the nurse who flinched the guard moved towards the woman uncertain dewar went to lattens side he touched his neck and felt a weak pulse clutched in the boys fist was the pale yellow scrap of material that was his comforter dewar prised it from his hand as gently as he could turning to watch the nurse as he did so the guard stood at her side one hand clamped over her wrist the nurses eyes went wide her free arm flailed at the guard who kept a hold of her and eventually succeeded in grabbing it and bringing it under control she tried to kick him but he twirled her round and forced her arm up her back until she doubled over and screamed her face level with her knees dewar inspected the sucked end of the comforter while the guard looked on mystified and the woman gasped and wept dewar sucked tentatively at the piece of material there was a taste it was slightly sweet and a little acrid at the same time he spat on the floor then knelt down on one knee so that he could look into the nurses reddened face he held the comforter in front of the woman is this how the boys been poisoned madam he asked softly the woman stared crosseyed at the scrap of material tears and snot dribbled down her nose her jaw was clenching and unclenching after a few moments she nodded where is the solution uh under the window seat the nurse said her voice shaking hold her there dewar told the guard quietly he went to the window and threw off the cushion in the seat set into the thickness of the wall pulled open a wooden flap and reached inside he threw aside toys and a few clothes until he found a small opaque jar he brought it over to the nurse is this it she nodded where does it come from she shook her head he took out his long knife she screamed then shook and struggled in the guards grip until he tightened it and she hung gasping again dewar put the knife very close to her nose the lady perrund she screamed the lady perrund dewar froze what the lady perrund she gives me the jars i swear i am not convinced dewar said he nodded to the guard who forced the womans arm further up her back she shrieked in pain its true the truth its the truth she screamed dewar sat back on his heel he looked at the guard holding the woman and shook his head once the man relaxed his hold on the nurse again the woman sobbed her whole doubledup body shaking with the effort dewar put the knife away and frowned another couple of uniformed men came thundering into the room swords readied sir said one taking in the scene dewar stood guard the boy he told the pair who had just entered take her to guard commander zespiole he instructed the man holding the nurse tell him lattens has been poisoned and she is the poisoner dewar tucked his shirt in as he strode quickly towards urleyns apartments another guard also alerted to the commotion came running up to him dewar sent him off with the man taking the nurse to zespiole there was one guard at urleyns door dewar drew himself up starting to wish he had taken the time to put on all his clothes he had to see urleyn no matter what orders he might have left and this guards help might be needed to effect entry he assumed what he hoped was his most commanding tone straighten up there he barked the guard jerked upright is the protector inside dewar demanded scowling and nodding at the door no sir the guard shouted where is he sir he went to the harem i think sir he said you need not be informed sir dewar looked at the closed door for a moment he began to turn and move away then stopped when did he go there about a halfbell ago sir dewar nodded then moved away at the corner he started running two more guards joined him when he called them they headed for the harem the double doors to the threedomed receiving room slammed back against the walls on either side there were a couple of concubines in the softly lit hall talking to members of their families and sharing a light breakfast with them all fell silent when the doors crashed open the chief eunuch stike sat like a sleepy white mountain in his pulpit raised near the middle of the room his face cleared of sleep and his brows met and creased as the doors swung slowly back from their twinned impact dewar sprinted across the room towards the doors leading to the harem proper the two guards trailing in his wake no bellowed the chief eunuch he rose and started to wobble down the steps dewar reached the harem doors wrenching at them they were locked stike came lurching over the floor towards him wagging his finger no mr dewar he cried you do not go in there not ever in any event but especially not when the protector himself is in there dewar looked at the two guards who had followed him hold him he told them stike screamed as they tried to take hold of him the eunuch was surprisingly strong and each of his legthick arms knocked over the guards once each before they could secure him he cried out for help as dewar tore at his white robes looking for and finding the set of keys he knew was there he cut the keys from the struggling giants belt tried one then another before the third key slipped in and turned and the doors opened no wailed stike almost pulling himself free from the two guards dewar looked around quickly but there was nobody else who could help he pulled the key out and took the full set with him as he entered the inner harem behind him the two guards struggled to contain the mighty rage of the chief eunuch dewar had never been here before he had however looked at the layout of the place on drawings so knew where he was even if he did not know where urleyn was he ran down a short corridor to another set of doors stikes anguished cries and entreaties still ringing in his ears there was a round internal courtyard beyond gently lit by a single translucent dome of plaster high above the glowing space rose on three colonnaded levels a small fountain played in the centre and couches and seats were scattered about its floor girls in various states of dress and undress stood or doubled up where they lounged yelping and screaming when they saw dewar a eunuch leaving a room off to one side of the lowest colonnaded level saw him and shouted he waved his arms and came running up to dewar slowing and stopping only when he saw that dewar held a sword the lady perrund dewar said quickly the protector the eunuch stared as though hypnotised at the tip of the sword for all that it was a couple of strides away from him he raised one shaking hand towards the pale dome above they are in he said in a quiet shaking whisper the topmost level sir in the small court dewar looked around and saw the stairs he ran for them then in a spiral up them to the top there were ten or so doors arranged all around the highest level but across the well of the courtyard he could see a wider entrance which formed a truncated corridor with double doors at its end he ran breathing hard now round the gallery to the short hallway and the twinned doors they were locked the second key he tried opened them he found himself in another domed internal courtyard this one had but a single level and the columns supporting the roof and the translucent plaster dome were of a more delicate turn than those in the main court there was a fountain and a pool in the centre of this yard too which at first sight appeared to be deserted the fountain was in the shape of three intertwined maidens delicately sculpted from pure white marble dewar sensed movement behind the pale carvings of the fountain behind this on the far side of the court beyond the columns one door lay ajar the fountain splashed tinkling it was the only sound in the wide circular space shadows moved on the polished marble of the floor near the fountain dewar glanced behind him then walked forward and round the lady perrund knelt before the fountains raised pool washing her hands slowly and methodically her good hand massaged and wiped at the wasted hand which lay floating just under the surface of the water like the limb of a drowned child she was dressed in a thin gown of red it was semitransparent and the light from the glowing plaster dome above fell down across her dishevelled blonde hair and picked out her shoulders breasts and hips within the gauzy material she did not look up when dewar appeared round the side of the fountain instead she concentrated on washing her hands until she was satisfied she lifted the wasted limb out of the water and placed it gently by her side where it hung limp and thin and pale she rolled the flimsy red sleeve down over it then she looked slowly round and up at dewar who had approached to within a few steps his face pale and terrible and full of fear still she did not say a word but looked slowly round at the door which lay open behind her opposite the double doors through which dewar had entered dewar moved quickly he pushed the door open with the pommel of his sword and looked into the room he stood there for some time he backed away until his shoulder hit one of the columns supporting the roof of the room the sword hung loose in his hand his head lowered until his chin rested on the white shirt over his chest perrund watched him for a moment then turned away still kneeling she dried her hands as best she could on her thin gown looking at the rim of the fountains bowl a hand or so in front of her eyes suddenly dewar was at her side standing by her wasted arm his bare feet by her calf the sword came slowly down to rest on the marble rim of the fountains bowl then slid with a grating noise near to her nose it dipped and the blade went under her chin the metal was cold on her skin a gentle pressure lifted her face until she was looking up at him the sword remained pressed against her throat cold and thin and sharp why he asked her there were she saw tears in his eyes revenge dewar she said quietly she had thought that if she could speak at all her voice would quiver and shake and quickly break and leave her sobbing but her voice was steady and unstrained for what for killing me and my family and for raping my mother and my sisters she thought her own voice sounded much less affected than dewars she sounded reasonable almost unconcerned she thought he stood looking down at her his face wet with tears his chest was coming and going inside the loosely tucked and still unbuttoned shirt the sword at her throat she noticed did not move the kings men he said his voice catching the tears continued to stream she wanted to shake her head though she was worried that the slightest movement would cut her skin but then he would be doing that soon enough anyway if she was lucky she thought and so tentatively she did shake her head the pressure of the sword blade across her throat did not waver but she avoided cutting herself no dewar not the kings men his men him his people he and his cronies those closest to him dewar stared down at her the tears were fewer now they had made a damp patch on the white shirt below his chin it was all as i have told you dewar except that it was the protector and his friends not one of the old nobles still loyal to the king urleyn killed me dewar i thought i would return the compliment she opened her eyes wide and let her gaze fall to the blade of the sword in front of her may i beg you to be quick for the friends we once were but you saved him dewar shouted still the sword barely moved those were my orders dewar orders he sounded incredulous when what had happened to my town and my family and to me had happened i wandered away i found a camp one night and offered myself to some soldiers for food they all took me too and i did not care because i knew then that i had become dead but one was cruel and wanted me in a way i did not want to be taken and i found that once one was dead it was very easy indeed to kill i think they would have killed me in return for his death and that would have been that and perhaps the better for all of us but instead their officer took me away i was brought to a fortress over the border in outer haspidus mostly manned by quiences men but commanded by forces loyal to the old king i was treated kindly and there i was introduced to the art of being a spy and an assassin perrund smiled if she had been alive she thought her knees on the cold white marble tiles would be hurting a little by now but she was dead and so they troubled somebody else dewars face was still streaked with tears his eyes stared seeming to bulge in their sockets but i was ordered to bide my time by king quience himself she told him urleyn was to die but not at the height of his fame and power i was commanded that i must do everything i could to keep him alive until his utter ruin had been contrived she gave a small shy smile and moved her head fractionally to look at her wasted arm i did and in the process i became above suspicion there was a look of utter horror on dewars face it was she thought like looking at the face of somebody who had died in agony and despair she had not seen or wanted to see urleyns face she had waited until having been given the news she claimed to have been called away to receive he had fallen into a fit of sobbing and buried his face in the pillow then she had risen lifted a heavy jet vase in her one good hand and brought it crashing down on the back of his skull the sobbing had stopped he had not moved again or made a further sound shed slit his throat for good measure but she had done that while straddling his back and still she had not seen his face quience was behind it all dewar said his voice sounded strangled as though he had a sword at his throat not she at hers the war the poisoning i do not know dewar but i imagine so she looked deliberately down at the sword blade dewar she looked up into his eyes with a hurt pleading expression there is no more i can tell you the poison was delivered by innocents to the paupers hospital where i received it nobody i know knew what it was or what it was for if you have the nurse as well you have the totality of our conspiracy there is no more to tell she paused i am already dead dewar please if you would finish the job i am suddenly so weary she let the muscles supporting her head relax so that her chin rested on the blade it and through it dewar was now taking all the weight of her head and its memories the metal warm now dropped slowly away from beneath her so that she had to stop herself falling forwards and striking the rim of the fountain pool she looked up dewar his own head hanging down was sliding the sword back into its scabbard i told him the boy was dead dewar she said angrily i lied to him before i crushed his filthy skull and slit his scrawny oldmans throat she struggled to her feet her joints protesting she went to dewar and took his arm with her good hand would you leave me to the guard and the questioner is that your judgment she shook him but he did not respond she looked down then grabbed at the nearest weapon his long knife she pulled it from its sheath he looked alarmed and took two rapid steps backwards away from her but he could have stopped her taking it and he had not then ill do it myself she said and brought the knife quickly up to her throat his arm was a blur she saw sparks in front of her face her hand began to sting almost before her eyes and mind had registered what had happened the knife he had knocked from her hand smacked into a wall and fell with a metallic clatter to the marble floor the sword hung in his hand again no he said moving towards her epilogue it strikes me having written this how little we can ever know the future is by its very nature unfathomable we can predict a very little way into it indeed with any reliability and the further we attempt to see into what has not yet happened the more foolish we later realise we have been with the benefit of hindsight even the most obviously predictable events which seem the most likely to occur can prove fickle when the rocks fell from the sky back when i was a child did millions of people the previous evening not believe that the suns would rise as usual on schedule the following morning and then the rocks and the fire fell from the sky and for whole countries the suns did not rise that day and indeed for many millions of people they would never rise again the present is in some ways no more sure for what do we really know about what is happening now only what is happening immediately around us the horizon is the usual maximum extent of our ability to appreciate the moment and the horizon is far away so events there must be very large for us to be able to see them besides in our modern world the horizon is in reality not the edge of the land or the sea but the nearest hedge or the inside of a city wall or the wall of the room we inhabit the greater events in particular tend to happen somewhere else the very instant that the rocks and the fire fell from the sky when over half the world woke up to chaos on the far side of the globe all was well and it took a moon or more before the sky darkened with unusual clouds when a king dies the news might take a moon to travel to the furthest corners of his kingdom it might take years to travel to countries on the far side of the ocean and in some places who knows it might slowly stop being news at all as it travels becoming instead recent history and so barely worth the mentioning when travellers exchange the latest developments so that the death that shook a country and unseated a dynasty only arrives centuries later as a short passage in a history book so the present i repeat is in some ways no more knowable than the future for it takes the passage of time for us to know what is happening at any given moment the past then surely there we can find certainty because once something has happened it cannot unhappen it cannot be said to change there may be further discoveries which throw a new light on what has happened but the thing itself cannot alter it must stay fixed and sure and definite and therefore introduce some certainty into our lives and yet how little historians agree read the account of a war from one side and then from the other read the biography of a great man written by one who has come to despise him then read his own account providence talk to two servants about the same event that same morning in the kitchen and you may well be told two quite different tales in which the wronged becomes the wrongdoer and what seemed obvious from one telling seems suddenly quite impossible given the other a friend will tell a story which involves the two of you in such a way that you know it did not happen so at all but the way he tells it is more amusing than the reality or reflects better on the two of you and so you say nothing and soon others will tell the story altered again and before long you may find yourself telling it the way you know for a certainty it simply did not happen those of us who keep journals occasionally find we have with no malice or thought of tale or reputation enhancement whatsoever remembered something quite erroneously we may for a goodly part of our lives have been giving a perfectly plain account of some past occurrence one that we are quite sure of and seem to remember very well indeed only to come across our own written account of it recorded at the time and find that it did not happen the way we remembered it at all so we can never be sure of anything perhaps and yet we must live we must apply ourselves to the world to do so we have to recall the past attempt to foresee the future and cope with the demands of the present and we struggle through somehow even if in the process perhaps just to retain what we can of our sanity we convince ourselves that the past present and future are much more knowable than they really are or can ever be so what happened i have spent the rest of a long life returning to the same few instants without reward i think there is not a day when i do not think back to those few moments in the torture chamber of the palace of efernze in the city of haspide i was not unconscious i am sure of that the doctor only convinced me that i was for a short while once she had gone and i had recovered from my grief i became more and more certain that precisely the amount of time which i thought had passed then had passed ralinge was on the iron bed poised to take her his assistants were a few steps away i cannot recall exactly where i closed my eyes to spare myself the awful moment and then the air filled with strange noises a few moments just a handful of heartbeats at the most on that i would stake my life and there they all were the three of them violently dead and the doctor already released from her bonds how what could possibly move with such speed to do such things or what trick of will or mind could be employed to make them do such things to themselves and how was she able to appear so serene in the moments immediately thereafter the more i think back to that interlude between the deaths of the torturers and the arrival of the guards when we sat side by side in the small barred cell the more sure i become that she somehow knew that we would be saved that the king would suddenly find himself at deaths door and she would be summoned to save him but how could she have been so calmly certain perhaps adlain was right and there was sorcery at work perhaps the doctor had an invisible bodyguard who could leave eggsized bumps on the heads of knaves and slip unnoticed behind us into the dungeon to butcher the butchers and release the doctor from her manacles it almost seems like the only rational answer yet it is the most fanciful of all or perhaps i did sleep swoon or become unconscious or whatever you like to call it perhaps my certainty is misplaced what more is there to tell let me see duke ulresile died in hiding in brotechen province a few months after the doctor left us it was a simple cut from a broken plate they say which led to blood poisoning duke quettil died soon afterwards too from a wasting disease which affected all the extremities and turned them necrotic doctor skelim was unable to do anything i became a doctor king quience ruled another forty years in exceptionally good health until the very end he left only daughters so now we have a queen i find this less troubling than i would have thought lately they have taken to calling the queens late father quience the good or sometimes quience the great i dare say one or other will have been settled on by the time anybody comes to read this i was his personal physician for the last fifteen years and the doctors training and my own discoveries made me by all accounts the best in the land perhaps indeed one of the best in the world for when partly due to the ambassadorship of gaan kuduhn more frequent and reliable links with the archipelagic republic of drezen were established we discovered that while our antipodean cousins rivalled and indeed even exceeded us in many ways they were not quite so advanced in medicine or indeed anything else as the doctor had implied gaan kuduhn came to live amongst us and became something of a father to me later he became a good friend and spent a decade as ambassador to haspidus a generous resourceful and determined man he confessed to me once that there was only one thing he had ever set his wits to that he had failed to accomplish and that was trying to track down the doctor or indeed hunt down exactly where she had come from we could not ask her for she disappeared one night in the sea of osk the plough of the seas was running before the wind past a line of small uninhabited islands bound for cuskery then the glowing green apparition that mariners call chainfire began to play about the rigging of the ship all were at first amazed but then they became in fear of their lives for not only was the chainfire brighter and more intense than anything the sailors could recall seeing in the past but the wind increased suddenly and threatened to tear the sails bring down the masts or even turn the great galleon over entirely the chainfire disappeared as suddenly as it had arrived and the wind fell back to the strong and steady force it had been before by and by all but those on watch returned to their cabins one of the other passengers remarked they had not been able to wake the doctor to come to see the display in the first place though nobody thought much of this the doctor had been invited to dine with the vessels captain that evening but had sent a note declining the invitation citing an indisposition due to special circumstances by the next morning it was realised she was gone her door was locked from the inside and had to be forced the scuttles were screwed open for ventilation but were too small for her to have squeezed through apparently all her belongings or at any rate the great majority of them were still there in the cabin they were packed up and were supposed to be sent on to drezen but unsurprisingly they disappeared during the passage gaan kuduhn hearing all this like i nearly a year later became fixed upon letting her family know what had happened to her and what good she had done in haspidus but for all his enquiries on the island of napthilia and in the city of pressel including some which he made himself on a visit there and despite the numerous occasions when he seemed on the very brink of discovering her nearest ones he was always frustrated and never did find anybody who had actually met or known the woman we knew as doctor vosill still i think that was one of the few things that irked him on his death bed and there was in balance an extraordinarily influential and productive life to look back on the old guard commander adlain suffered badly towards the end of his allotment of seasons i think what consumed him was something like the growing disease that had taken the slaver tunch all those years earlier i was able to alleviate the pain but in the end it became too much for him my old master told me he swore truly that indeed as i had always suspected he had been the officer who had rescued me from the wreck of my home and the dead arms of my parents in the smoking ruins of the city of derla but that he had taken me to the orphanage in a fit of guilt for it had been he who had killed my mother and father and burned their house now he said from the clawing depths of his agony i would want to kill him i chose not to believe him but i did what i could to hasten his end which came peacefully less than a bell later his mind must have been going of course for if i had believed for a moment what he had told me i think i would have been tempted to have left him to suffer also before he died adlain begged me knowing he was on his death bed to tell him what had really happened in the torture chamber that evening he tried to joke that if quience had not turned the questioning chamber into a wine cellar shortly after the doctor left us he might have been tempted to have me interrogated there just to discover the truth i think he was joking it saddened me to have to tell him that i had already in my reports to him told him everything that had occurred to the limit of my recollection and descriptive ability i have no idea whether he believed me or not and so i am old now and will lie on my own death bed before a few more years are out the kingdom is at peace we prosper and there is even what the doctor would i think have called progress to me fell the immense privilege of being the first principal of the medical university of haspide i also shouldered the happy duty of being the third president of the royal college of physicians and later served as a city counsellor when i was in charge of the committee overseeing the construction of the kings charitable hospital and the infirmary for the freed i am proud that one of such lowly birth was able to serve his king and his people in so many different ways during a time of such improvement there are still wars naturally though not recently in the vicinity of haspidus even yet the three socalled empires dispute though with little result save to leave the rest of the world free from imperial tyranny and so able to thrive in its own various ways our navy seems to fight sea battles every now and again but as they are usually far away and we are as a rule victorious it is as if they do not really count as warfare going further back the barons of ladenscion had to be taught that who helps them resist one ruler might take it ill when they attempt to forgo all rule there was civil war in tassasen of course following the death of the regicide urleyn and king yetamidous proved a poor leader though young king lattens well he is not so young any more i admit but he still seems young to me made good most of the ill and rules well if quietly to this day i am told he is something of a scholar which is no bad thing in a king providing it is not taken to excess but that was a long time ago all of this was the tale of the concubine perrund which forms the counterpoint to my own and which i have included here with almost no amendment save where her taste foundered occasionally on the skerries of overly ornate prose i searched out myself after reading a version in the form of a play which i discovered in another bibliophiles library here in haspide i chose to end her tale where i did because it is after that point that the two versions diverge most violently the first version i read in the guise of a drama in three acts had the bodyguard dewar running the lady through with his sword to revenge his dead master and then returning to his home in the halfhidden kingdoms where he was revealed in his true identity as a prince who had been spurned by his father due to an unfortunate but honourable misunderstanding a deathbed reconciliation decorated with pretty speeches was effected with the expiring king and dewar reigned well thereafter i admit i find this the more morally satisfying ending the version which purported to be by the ladys own hand and which she claimed she only committed to paper to counter the sensationalised untruths of the dramatic edition could hardly have been more different in it the bodyguard whose trust she had just violated and whose master she had most cruelly done to death took her by the hand from which she had barely finished washing their masters blood and led her out o the harem they told those waiting nervously outside that urleyn was well but sleeping deeply at last as though he already knew the cause of the boys illness had been discovered dewar said he would take the concubine perrund to guard commander zespioles offices to confront the nurse who had accused her falsely he suspected dewar apologised to chief eunuch stike and handed him back his keys he told some of the assembled guards to remain where they were and the rest to go back to their normal posts and tasks he led the lady perrund away politely but firmly they were seen leaving the palace by the groom who supplied them with mounts and observed leaving the city by a variety of honest citizens it was about the time they were galloping through the citys northern gate that stike tried to open the doors into the small court on the topmost level of the harem the key would not fit properly into the lock in which something appeared to be lodged the doors were broken down the foreign body which had been inserted into the lock after the doors had been secured proved to be a piece of marble in the shape of a little finger broken from one of the maidens in the fountain in the centre of the raised pool in the little court urleyns body was discovered in the bedroom off the court his blood saturated the sheets his body was quite cold dewar and perrund were never caught they made their way after unrecounted adventures to mottelocci in the halfhidden kingdoms where dewar surprisingly was not known at all but which he knew a great deal about and where he rapidly established a good name for himself the two became merchants and later founded a bank perrund wrote the account from which i have taken half my story they married and their sons and allegedly their daughters too continue to this day to run a trading enterprise that supposedly rivals that of our own mifeli clan the companys symbol reportedly is a simple torus a ring such as might be cut from one end of a hollow pipe this symbol is one half of what i suspect is not the only set of correspondences within and between these two tales but considering the implications of these far too bamboozling for this old head to encompass i have left it to the reader to discover their own points of similarity draw their own conclusions and blaze their own trails of speculation at any rate dewar and perrund we are told both died in the mountains in an avalanche in a mountain pass five years ago the snow and ice of the unforgiving peaks is their only tomb but as they died after what appears to have been a long and happy life together i beg to repeat that i prefer the former version of their fates even if it is not supported by any facts whatsoever and now i think my divided tale is finished i am sure there is much i have not said much that could justifiably have been added had we had i only known a little extra discovered a trifle more but as i have indicated above sometimes indeed probably always one simply has to make do with what there is my wife is due to return soon from the market yes i married and i love her now as i always have for her own sake not for that of my lost love even if as i will admit she does look just a little like the good doctor she took two of our grandchildren with her to look for presents and they will expect me to play with them when they come back i do little real work now i am so old but still there is a life to be lived
