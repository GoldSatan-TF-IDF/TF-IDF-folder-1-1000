a hidden place by robert charles wilson prelude bone in california bone was the only one awake on the flatcar as the train labored out of the mountains and into the fogchoked valley and it was bone who saw the railroad cop he was only dimly aware of the danger it was deep night morning not far off late in spring the air was bitingly cold and damp bone was lucky he had stolen a thick navy pea coat the week before he wore it now pulled tight in one hand because he could not button it across his wide and bony rib cage he had a hat too a thick woolen watch cap pulled down over his stubble hair so that it warmed his ears bone was lucky but in that shivering predawn hour he was aware only of his acute discomfort the convulsions that seemed to travel seismically from his feet up to the crown of his head it was more than the cold cold had never bothered him much it was something elsea sickness he did not think about it in any detail thinking was difficult and unrewarding for him bone was notorious in the hobo jungles because he spoke so seldom and because of his oversized joints and fleshless body even his name was not his own it had been given to him on a similar train a long but in bones mind indefinite time ago most of the hoboes who rode the boxcars were emaciated but bone had gone beyond that his huge ribs seemed to be fighting their way out of his parchment flesh his elbows were sharp as flint axes and when he bent you could watch the articulation of his knees the patella sliding like some oiled mechanism in a hay baler or a forklift they called him bone and he gave bone as his name when he was asked fatigue lay on him now like a drug though he could not sleep fatigue and this new shuddering weakness electricity seemed to crawl over the surface of his skin it reminded him of the time he had accepted from another tramp the offer of a swallow of muscatel the liquor had burned like fire and a little while later he had spasmed it all up again since then he had been careful to take only water the train slowed he guessed they were approaching a railway yard but a ground fog had risen up from the farm fields all around and had hidden the stars and the horizon he sat up straighter at the thought of a railyard in bones mind a railyard was a bright nexus of danger it was then abruptly that he saw the cop the beam of his flashlight flicking out of the mist to touch on bone and the other figures asleep on the flatcar the mans blue scissorbill cap cocked toward them avidly the cop yelled something but the train was still moving pretty fast bone was alarmed but figured there would be time to get away he woke up the other men one by one in the difficult journey through the mountains he had learned some of their names benny and joe deacon and archibald campbell and crawford some were singles some moved in pairs or in temporary alliances of threes they were uniformly dirty and they wore sack pants and rope belts just like bone did bone woke the other hoboes by jostling them with his big knobby hands some waking and seeing his angular halloween face above them involuntarily flinched away but when he told them about the scissorbill they sat up frowning furtively crouched deacon kenny and bill archibald came and squatted next to him these two were a pair and deacon a middleaged man who said he was a meatpacker from chicago was the leader deacon was short and dense and tattooed and had an immense collection of snipes unsmoked cigarette butts which he hoarded and rationed as if they were a private treasure archibald his buddy was a lanky man who spoke in laconic brief southern drawls and carried deacons frying pan for him and would hold up a fragment of mirror so that deacon could shave his face with a sliver of broken glass each morning deacon was an obsessive shaver archibald had a wispy tramps beard that he would not cut off though deacon tugged on it and ragged him for it bone had never shaved but didnt have a beard he guessed it wasnt in him to grow one trainll go on through deacon said nodding to himself the cop cant get on and we cant get off its safe is it archie said look there bone stared where archie was pointing it was the cops flashlight bobbing up and down the cop chasing after them still yelling and now the train was slowing too was grinding to a stop deacon said oh shit at the sound of the brakes all the tramps leaped off the flatcar at once it made bone think of a man burning lice off his clothes with a lit cigarette the way they jumped then bone jumped too he landed crouched in the cindery gravel beside the track the scissorbill was very close and he was shouting and nowbone could see them emerging from the fog the yard bulls were running to join him suety hostile men in dingy gray overalls bone deacon was yelling this way bone run dammit the tramps were all scattering down the grade of the railway through a scummy slough of water and into the foggy lettuce fields and the night bone moved to follow but the seizure came then and he was down on the cold ground shaking it was like a shiver that consumed his whole body his awareness narrowed down to something like a speck a black dot in a red emptiness he was only distantly conscious when the railway cop pulled him up by the armpits when the yard bullsafter a moment of disgusted commentary on his misshapen bodybegan to punch and kick him the blows came down like hard rain bone stared incuriously at his assailants he had distanced himself from the pain cheated of a reaction they hit and kicked him harder thenmade queasy perhaps by the excesses he had inspired in them they drifted away one by one and the scissorbill his cap askew now muttered something bone did not understand and pushed him with his foot down the stony grade and into the cold and stagnant water bone lay in water up to his waist his head cradled among the cinders and small stones the steam of his breath rising up into the sky he listened for a while to the metallic shrieks as the railcars were coupled and uncoupled in the morning darkness he blinked his eyes and closed them and time ceased he might have died a dozen times before a dozen different places he had come as close but then as now some kernel of intent had hardened within him waking he felt it like a song inside him it was diffuse and not specific he could not tack it down with words but he knew what it meant it meant he would survive would heal himself would move on he had been moving on it seemed to him all his life there were fingers softly at his neck his chest his feet he opened his eyes gritty sunlight seared him his body ached he focused on the faces of deacon and archie above him deacon was stroking the stiff lapel of bones good blue pea coat deacon grinned bone is awake see archie bones gonna be okay bone sat up archie who was angular and tall said we would have taken the coat if you were dead you know and these shoes we thought you might be dead but hes not dead deacon said peevishly his voice a throaty flat midwestern rasp bones not dead are you bone bone listen there is a little jungle up the tracks you want to comebone can you walk walk with old deacon and archie bone knew they had been trying to steal his clothes and that this was deacons way of apologizing for it he felt no animosity toward them but he wasnt sure he could stand up the yard bulls had kicked him pretty hard he had to try though he pulled himself erect it was like a gantry standing up he was six feet five inches talla hobo had measured him once just to get the exact figure of itand when he stood up he swayed like a tree the small of his back hurt terribly and he put his hand back there kidneys deacon said knowingly yard bulls go for the kidneys they always do youll be pissing blood for a day or two bone bone thought he was probably right they moved on down the tracks in daylight he was able to see that this was a tiny agricultural depot locked in by oceans of lettuce and far off arbored grapes the sun had burned off the mist and the day was hot and getting hotter the heat came up off the cracked dry bed of the railroad rightofway like a growing thing he saw the jungle in the distance now as deacon had said a small concatenation of box huts and hovels where a river cut through the broad flat valley and a stand of dusty dogwoods had grown up bone had never been here before though he had been many places like it he knew he was not smart but something in him some instinct prevented him from riding the same way twice he wondered sometimes what he would do if he ran out of railroads but that had never happened maybe he thought it was impossible maybe there were always more railroads always more places like this there certainly seemed no end to it he wondered too what it was he was looking for what it was that pulled him with such a dire if dimly sensed imperative it was more than habit or hunger it was something he did not share with these other men something for which he had not been able to discover a name i saw a man once deacon was saying his thinsoled shoes slapping against the packed earth take a drink of muscatel and walk out the door of a moving boxcar i swear it i saw him do that did he live i dont know i guess its possible the things people live through would surprise you like bone here beating like that would kill a normal man yard bulls leave him in the ditch till somebody finds him city buries him or they pitch him into the river so he floats out to sea there are more dead tramps floating in the ocean than live ones riding the rails thats a fact you go out some places the water would be just thick with tramps like fish the tide brings them all together thats what they say thats a crock of shit archie said you dont know anything deacon said calmly bone had seen oceans mountains deserts so dry they drew the moisture out of you and left you like a cooked crab all hard dry chitin and no meat and cold and hot he had seen river valleys lush as rain forests industrial towns black with coal smoke and battered by noise and poverty it was all the same to him there was a thing he wanted and he had not found it something sweet he thought like music privately he believed deacons story about the dead hoboes and wondered if he would end that way himself bone floating anonymously with the others bone merged into a vast human seawrack deacon led him to a circle of charred stones under a tree a blackened frying pan we have a little i food deacon said youd like that yeah a little food bone nodded he had not eaten for some days food deacon said gratified archibald sighed unhappily and began heating up a few chary slices of salt pork there was a can also of concentrated soup deacon sat down and bone grimacing in pain crouched beside him deacon dug deep into the folds of his faded cotton shirt and brought forth one of his snipesa sunday church snipe deacon called it he had explained back on the flatcar that the best and longest snipes were the ones the churchgoers butted out just before services sunday mornings bone didnt smoke he shook his head smiling to demonstrate his gratitude he thought deacon must be really sorry for trying to steal his coat deacon carefully repocketed the snipe and said youre the most ugly man i have ever seen but i like you bone deacon likes you bone nodded smiling industriously tonight deacon said we leave this pissant town no work here no use even looking ride away is about the best we can do bad place to camp archie put in bad cops deacon said thats the story here you understand me bone tonight yes deacon bone said out loud but he perceived that the sun was already on its way down and the two men showed no signs of packing up move on he thought yes that would be good inside him strange feelings stirred that night for the first time the feeling grew so strong in him that he thought it might drive him mad he woke up after deacon and archie and the rest of the hoboes in the meager encampment had fallen asleep the fires were out and frying pans hung in the dogwood trees like christmas decorations it was dark and the cold had come down again bone sat up shivering he wasnt sure what had brought him awake he gazed up at the nameless and unfamiliar constellations this feeling he thought but maybe it was only hunger bone was big and the food he had begged from deacon and archie had only aroused his huge appetite he stood up tiptoeing over deacon where he was curled up in a motheaten hudsons bay blanket and began to move silently and swiftly back along the train tracks there was a crescent moon and bones night vision was very good the rows of head lettuce stretched away to converge at the vanishing point a horizon full of food he boosted himself up a barbedwire fence ravaging the skin on his palms and fell on the other side the lettuce was all new growth but it didnt matter to bone he filled his mouth with green matter swallowed filled it again again until at last his hunger had abated some he sat back on his haunches drooling he wasnt hungry anymore and yet this other feeling persisted it was like his travelon feeling but more intense as if his shuddering sickness had become a part of it and his hunger and his pain it would not be still inside him his eyes twisted under his thick brow ridge what is it what he itched with an unfocused sense of urgency that was when he heard the dogs their baying broke the stillness like a knife bone crouched down instinctively not breathing but he was not in immediate danger the sound was corning from the south where the hobo jungle was a raid he had seen raids before he knew how it was when the people came into a hobo camp with their pipes and shotguns once he had almost died in such a raid his instinct was to run to find a road or a train and get as far away from the violence as he could but then he thought of deacon and archie sleeping and helpless back there and suddenly he was on his feet running his pulse beat in his ears the air was cruel on his bloody hands and he thought he might vomit up everything he had eaten but he had to get back the southern end of the encampment had suffered first the raiders were big men farmers probably in redchecked shirts and hunting jackets a fire had started up in one of the cardboard hovels embers flying up the light of it making the violence seem slow and cinematic the dogs had gone wild with the smoke and the stink of the jungle they dove like ferrets into hovels to drag out screaming men the farmers used their iron pipes on anyone who was slow or who resisted it had happened so suddenly that those on the fringe of the encampment like deacon and archie were only just beginning to come awake bone pulled on their arms trying desperately to communicate some sense of urgency through the barrier of their fatigue he remembered deacon bragging that a real tramp could sleep anywhere through anythingbut the problem now was waking up in the excitement bone had forgotten all his words archie sized up the situation quickly and managed to run a few paces ahead deacon stood up at lastthe farmers were terribly close nowand his face contorted unhappily as if he believed he might still be dreaming bone tugged him forward but that was a mistake deacon cried out and fell over his feet tangled in his own hudsons bay blanket bone pulled him up but it was too late a farmer in an orange hunting jacket swung his pipe and caught deacon hard on the arm deacon shrieked and fell back the farmer raised his pipe again and bone perceived that the man would kill deacon if the blow were allowed to fall to prevent it bone grasped the farmers right arm at its fullest extension and twisted until it snappeda thing he had not realized he could do the farmer gazed at bone very briefly his face gone white with shock and confusion then he stumbled back screaming deacon was weeping with pain but managed to scuttle forward with his rucksack in his good hand archie helped him up gapjawed deacon he said deacon you see what that big man did jesus go deacon sobbed just for christs sakes go two more of the farmers came up on the heels of the first and before bone could decently run he had to swing out his long arms with their fists like weights so that these two men fell down also one of them unconscious and one almost certainly dead a sort of collective moan rose up from the raiders this time bone did not need to be goaded he ran keeping abreast of his friends the fires roared behind him boxcar deacon shouted see a long ponderous freight was just pulling out of the yards the yard bulls and the railway cops had all congregated down by the hobo jungle the open door of the boxcar gaped like a broken tooth the three of them ran to catch it deacon favoring his injured shoulder before they reached it though a scissorbill stepped up from the shadows in the gully and he was carrying a shotgun deacon and archie fell to their knees bone didnt think about it at all reflexively he let his momentum carry him forward as the railroad cop leveled the gun he was faster than the mans reaction time and was able to duck under the line of fire before the big muzzles of the gun erupted into the night then his broad bony hand was on the cops face twisting it back snapping vertebrae the scissorbill fell backward into the scummy slough dead before the idea of death could enter his mind deacon helped bone up into the boxcar there were scraps of straw in the corners and the smell of cattle they would be cold again tonight bone thought bleakly but that hardly mattered now deacon gazed back at the body of the scissorbill as the train picked up speed hes meat deacon marveled christ god archie you were right archie looked at bone from his recessed eyes and said nothing they slid the doors closed as the train accelerated into the night deacon still favoring his left arm slapped bone on the back stick with us kid he said stick with old deacon and archie the next day there were mountains again and snow in the night bone huddled in his pea coatit was torn nowand listened to deacon and archie swap tales about how it had been in bakersfield and terre haute and klamath falls and how it felt to be crossing the hump again deacon brought out a bottle of muscatel and the two of them drank until their conversation blurred and bone could no longer understand them they gave him little quizzical sidelong glances called him buddy and good friend bone and were careful to offer him what they had more profusely when they were reassured that he would not accept eventually they fell asleep bone sat in the open door of the boxcar the cold wind tearing at him there was a pulsing in him much stronger than it had been before he could feel it for the first time it made words inside himthe ghosts of words here i am find me find me here i am the train roared down the eastern spine of the continental divide and bone felt the same unfamiliar strength rising up in him the strength that had allowed him to kill all those men back at the railyard he was focused now aimed for the first time in bones memory he knew where he was going here i am find me the clear high song of it was unmistakable at last he understood bone was coming chapter one the municipality of haute montagne stood at the junction of the fresnel river and the railway its water tower and its huge granaries erupting from the prairie like blocks of basalt from an eroded sea floor once not long ago the town had aspired to be a city it still had a little of city in it there was the main street lawson spur or simply the spur which was blacktopped and lined with concrete sidewalks dazzlingly white in the noonday sun which boasted the big binghams hardware store and j c penneys and times square lunch all fronted in dusty yellow brick and there was the trolley that ran on embedded rails from the switching yard down the spur to the granaries farther south everyone agreed that those were bigcity conveniences once they had been accepted as harbingers of greater things but haute montagne remained a small town in its artful cultivation of box elders and bur oaks in its side streets on which the pavement gave way quickly to cobbles or pressed dirt in its gabled clapboard houses with high dormers and big front stoops that looked so invitingly shady when high summer lay on the town like liquid metal it was a small town by virtue of its silences at noon and midnight and the distances the big trains traveled before they arrived hissing at the depot the prairie vastnesses had made of the town an island isolated proud in its isolation set apart from the chaos that had so lately descended on the country at large but the town was not in any real way safe no safer than new york or los angeles or chicago and perhaps that unacknowledged wisdom made its decline the more galling haute montagne where the railroad meets the wheatfield might once have wanted to be a city but that ambition had diedor at least had been set aside like the hope chest of a young woman destined for spinsterhoodin the depression that had come like a bad cold and stayed to become something worse some lingering if not fatal disease the granaries had laid off much of the towns male population the trains stopped less often dust and drought had withered too much fertile land the noon silences became profounder midnights were interminable there was a sense never explicit of some even darker eventuality hovering like an army of locusts beyond the indefinite horizonbiding its time travis fisher had some feeling of that when he stepped off the eastbound train and onto the whitewashed boards of the haute montagne depot with july like a haze in the air he had been tempted to stay on the train all the way to wherever it went new york maine just sit and watch the miles pass away like unremembered dreams his ticket was paid up only this far though and he had change of a dollar in his pocket for money and no real choice he climbed off the pullman car into an immense summer silence and withdrew from his shirt pocket the handdrawn map his aunt liza had sent him in the mail south down the spur to lambeth west on lambeth to deville number in truth he was a little afraid of this new place but he was nineteen years old and had carried a grown mans responsibilities since the year he had turned twelve and so he straightened his shoulders and picked up his bag and began walking the canvas bag contained a change of clothes and a photograph of his mother it was not heavy there were old men and young men sidebyside on the public benches in front of the train station and they all looked at travis with an eloquent incuriosity his footsteps on the pavement were loud in his ears at the corner of lambeth and spur he should have turned west but he saw the times square lunch with its wide glass windows and realized at once how hungry he was he bought a dime western at a newsstand and let himself gratefully into the cool shade of the diner there were three men at a side table but nobody at the long formicatopped lunch bar he ordered himself a hamburger and a coke the hamburger was a slab of broiled beef and the coke came in a big sodafountain glass with condensation on it like dew the waitress was young darkhaired smallbreasted under her uniform and she gave him a series of covert glances when she brought over the side of french fries she said you must be travis fisher tray he said automatically only then realizing how odd it was that she should know his name how did you relax she said she put her elbows on the counter im nancy nancy wilcox my mom knows your aunt liza through the baptist women she rolled her eyes to demonstrate her attitude toward the baptist women i guess just about everybody knew you were coming in today he was not sure he was pleased to hear that but she was pretty so he thanked nancy wilcox anyway and said he hoped hed see her around probably you will she said mom and liza burack arent exactly close but they move in all the same circles highminded you know church committees temperance league translation busybodies she winked and turned away flipping her long dark hair out of her eyes travis gazed at her a moment before directing his attention to the dime western and the hamburger the hamburger was satisfying the magazine less so he was an attentive reader but today the heroes seemed too operatic the violence perversely too affecting sixguns blazed blood poured justice except in the continued serial triumphed but he could not help thinking of his mother and of the ugliness of her death and his impotent rage at it so after a while he put down his thirty cents on the shiny formica and left haute montagne was french for high mountain his mother had told him but whatever frenchman named the place must have been drunk or blind his aunts house deville stood on the highest plot of land in town where the prairie rose in a kind of swell for thirty or forty feet before sloping away to the bank of the fresnel river and the railway bed the house itself was old but had once been fine two stories plus a small garret with oculus windows overlooking the town but the wooden siding was textured with paint curls and the weather had got into the dormers yellow curtains were drawn against the sunlight travis had not been there since he was six years old he knocked three times on the rim of the screen door and then aunt liza answered liza was his mothers older sister in her middle fifties now respectable in a print sack dress and she opened the door and looked at travis with a mixture of pity and suspicion that he recognized instantly over the gulf of years she had aged some there were lines in her high pale forehead she wore a pair of silverrimmed glasses with a bifocal half her figure was undefined rounded but she was unmistakably liza burack well travis she said well come on in his own reluctance to cross that threshold was surprisingly strong but he shouldered his bag through the door and into the ticking silence persian rugs mantle clocks in the whitewashed kitchen an electric fan purred creath liza said travis is here creath burack was the man liza had married a steady man she always told traviss mother he operated the haute montagne ice plant immobile in an armchair overalls riding up his big belly hair thin he stood up just long enough to shake traviss hand his grip was huge painful you start work tomorrow creath burack said travis nodded liza said well you probably want to see your room she led him up a flight of carpeted stairs to a room with naked floorboards and whitewashed walls empty but for a narrow brass bed and a pine dresser travis raised a yellowing sash and was able to see an arc of the river the railway trestle the horizon like a line drawn against the sky something moved lightly in the attic room above him he looked at liza she avoided his eyes we have another roomer up there she said but you wouldnt know about that youll meet her at supper i suppose yes maam travis said she stood in the doorway and her eyes hardened travis i want you to know there was never any question of whether you should come here or not no maam oh creath might have raised a word or two but he just likes his privacy no blood is thicker i told him soon as i heard about your mamas tragedy i said well well take in trav and maybe you can get him a place down at the iceworks i dont guess it was your fault what happened to maryjane her own fault if any if any this last because of the look travis had given her but i want you to know this is not the kind of household you might be accustomed to we have standards of conduct and creath he doesnt like a lot of noise best you keep quiet around him travis you understand and not ask too many questions her face was shaded with old pain yes maam travis said she closed the door and he gazed at the creamcolored walls dusk came and he had not switched on the single overhead light when liza burack called him down for supper the diningroom table was heaped high with food he remembered this too about his aunt liza the way she went all out cooking for people not so much generosity as compensation as if the sheer weight of food could disguise some hidden inadequacy creath was already seated at the table a massive blank weight as liza delivered a white china bowlful of mashed potatoes a brimming gravy boat looks fine travis said mama always admired your cooking very much aunt liza just you sit down liza said nervously the proofs in the eating travis it was as if he was still six years old lot of work went into setting this table creath said and travis thought yes her work but it was obvious he meant the ice plant lot of time lot of work hope you appreciate that yessir nothing comes cheap creaths eyes were unfocused and travis guessed he had said these things many times you work for what you get in this life you understand that travis sir that may have been the problem with your mother expect too much without wanting to work for it well we all know where that path inclines i guess i am a guest in his home travis thought teeth clenched i cannot say what i think but he looked at creath burack with a barely restrained loathing creath liza said gently warning its only what the boy has to hear better he should know it now than come to it hard later on liza silent delivered a steaming pot roast to the table the heat and humidity of it filled the dining room travis felt a drop of sweat travel down his chest his stomach felt shriveled because creath went on and i say this honestly i wont accept secondbest from you down at the plant some might say it was favoritism my hiring you on at all now i dont believe that i dont mink it is unchristian to help a family member in need the opposite but charity does not extend to indulgence thats all im trying to put across work is what is required maybe things have been easy for you before but the sad truth is that they will not be easy now travis said quietly when mama was sick i hired the men to harvest i drove a tractor and a team of horses when we sold the tractor and when we couldnt hire hands i took what i could of the harvest myself well creath said we know what the upshot of that was dont we creath liza said quickly will you give us the blessing creath muttered a maygodbethanked and was reaching for the boiled peas when the buracks other roomer came down the stairs she had been silent on the carpeted steps and travis was startled at the shadow he had forgotten about the attic room he stood up from the table a gesture his mother had taught him was polite when a woman enters there was a brief tense silence travis fisher liza said distantly this is anna blaise he stared at her a long moment before he remembered to take her hand meet you he said clumsily and she made a movement like a curtsy he knew he was being impolite but she was shockingly beautiful she was young travis thought maybe his own age but the longer he looked at her the less certain he was she was radiant and smoothskinned but her eyes contained depths he did not associate with youth her face was round her hair was blond and roughcut and tied back behind her with an alluring carelessness she gazed at the floor as if uncertain what she ought to do or say but beneath this shyness there was an inference of great poise an economy of motion travis felt clumsy next to her why dont we all sit down liza said flatly yes anna said and her voice was a match for the rest of her calm and modulated like the playing of a distant flute she sat down opposite liza burack and made the table a symmetry for a time no one spoke the rattle of their cutlery was loud in the silence covertly travis watched the girl eat she kept her eyes downcast took small portions used her knife and fork daintily it occurred to him to marvel that the buracks had taken in another boarder he remembered his aunt and uncle being intensely private people family people times were bad he thought they must need the money but where had she come from im from oklahoma he ventured to say near beaumont her eyes were on him very briefly yes she said the buracks told me you were coming you from around here not too far she said working in town i work here she said in the house i do sewing i for christs sake creath said leave her alone travis was mortified im sorry he said anna blaise smiled and shrugged something wrong here travis thought odd and wrong but he went about his eating didnt make but a dent in that pot roast liza said with a sigh when they were finished she rose moaning a little and picked up the big china platter anna stood up unbidden and took her own plate traviss creaths there was the sound of clattering in the kitchen a gush of running water creath withdrew a big virginia cigar and made a ceremony of lighting it he looked at travis for a time over the glowing tip dont think i dont know whats happening the older man said sir keep your voice down he sighed out a plume of smoke you think i dont know but i do the heat the summerand you look at heryou have feelings but there will be none of that in this house dont answer me this is not a conversation this is the rules she is way out of your class travis fisher travis groped for an answer astonished but before he could speak liza had come back from the kitchen with syrupy wedges of blackberry pie laid out on china plates my creath said expansively this is a treat it was round about midnight when nancy wilcox walked past the burack house on deville she was coming from the open field where the railway trestle crossed the fresnel river where greg morrow had left her when she refused to let him put his hand up her skirt greg was a pretty rough character oldest son of a granary worker he owned a decadeold tin lizzie with a blown cylinder in which he squired around whichever female he could talk into a ride he chewed tobacco and he used what the baptist women called gutter language precisely the kind of date her mother would disapprove of which was maybe why nancy had agreed to go with him in the first place his crudity was kind of fascinating ultimately however greg was not the person nancy wanted to do it with if she had had any doubts the events at the trestle had settled them she was not a prude she had read about free love in a book by h g wells before her mother caught her with it and had the small volume deleted from the town library she had even done it a couple of times before with a boy named marcus whose family had since moved west but not with greg greg seemed to think it was owed him something that was his by right and nancy did not feel obliged to encourage him in this delusion so he had kicked her out of the lizzie down by the trestle which made her a little nervous because lately there had been hoboes gathering there she had seen their fires flickering in the angular darkness under the railway bridge but she just walked steady and kept her head about her and pretty soon she was back among the streetlights and the box elders she would catch righteous hell for getting home so late of course but in a way she was glad she liked this time of night liked to listen to the town ticking and cooling after a blastfurnace july day like this one had been the midnight breeze on her face was soothing the trees chattered to themselves in what she liked to imagine was a secret language she gazed up at the gray outline of the burack house against the stars in the darkness it appeared to be just what that mrs burack obviously imagined it was a sturdy keystone in haute montagnes social structure you couldnt see the peeling paint the rain gutters clotted with mulch nancy smiled to herself thinking of what her mother always said about the buracks something odd there something definitely odd and that girl in the atticabout as talkative as a deafmute and a lot less wholesome nancy peered up at the attic room and saw a faint light flicker there like fox fire behind the sunyellowed blinds strange she said to herself and there was that fisher boy now too the one who had stopped by the diner this afternoon there had been rumblings about his situation a fatherless family mother a runabout hints of some darker truth but that could have been just the baptist womens rumor mill at work nancy thought grinding a very modest kernel of truth he had seemed nice if distracted he had left his magazine at the diner nancy had gazed a long time at the cover of it horses guns a range of purple mountains he is from far away she let the night air carry back her hair she felt like a shadow sometimes blowing through these night streets time carried her on like a cork on a waveshe was already eighteenand she had lately become desperate with wondering where was she bound she sometimes dreamed of mountains like the mountains on travis fishers pulp magazine of cities of oceans she shivered gazing up at the old burack house she wondered what sort of person travis fisher was and what he dreamed about in the attic room the light flared brighter travis lay in bed exhausted but helplessly awake an uneasy excitement running in him like a river he felt the unfamiliar pressure of the mattress under him he had covered his nakedness with a single sheet because it was summer and all the heat in the house traveled up to these high narrow rooms and was retained there the attic he thought must be sizzling she doesnt make much noise anna blaise he thought tasting the name anna blaise anna blaise he had heard during the long evening the restless treadle of her sewing machine her radio playing briefly then silence later on the quick compression of bedsprings the house made its own sounds sighs and moans travis had propped open the window with a hardwarestore expansion screen and every once in a while a breeze picked up the corner of the sheet sleep he thought and it was a prayer now sleep oh sleep shortly after midnight he heard footsteps on the stairway beyond his door slow heavy footsteps coming up from below aunt liza didnt carry that much bulkit could only be creath this time of night travis thought the footsteps paused outside his door and then proceeded upward strange travis thought and now they were over his head creath for sure a brief low burr of conversation annas voice like faraway music creaths like the grumble of some rusted old machine the repetitive complaint of the bedsprings jesus god almighty travis thought that poor little girland he covered his ears with his pillow chapter two the evenings were essentially the same for the next week and a half an elaborate ritual dinner annas opacity and silences creaths clenchedfist approach to conversation later there might be radio creath lighting up a cigar and occupying the parlor easy chair for the duration of amos andy or ed wynn or sundays father coughlins golden hour of the little flower then everybody eased upstairs to hot and insulated beds and travis if he stayed awake might hear creath tiptoeing into the attic room not always but too often it forced travis to look at his aunt lizas nervous flutters with a greater degree of sympathy she knows he thought she must know weekdays creath drove him down to the ice plant before dawn the thought of all that ice had made travis imagine the plant might be a nice place in which to endure this long summer butalthough he did sometimes enter the cool length of the storeroom where block ice lay stacked like uncut fragments from some fairytale diamond minemost of his work was in the tin shed where the refrigerating machinery roared and thumped perversely twenty degrees hotter than the outside air the work he did was mostly lifting and cleaning and he quickly learned that the other men who worked here mechanics and loaders and drivers considered him a liability contemptible the bosss nephew he ate bagged lunches alone in a weedy field beyond the loading dock staring into the brown fresnel river the ice industry was doomed creath had said victim of the goddamned kelvinator it might survive a while longer here in haute montagne but orders were already way down for this time of year travis found the knowledge perversely consoling the work itself was tedious and frustrating and when the frustration threatened to overwhelm him he decided to ask nancy wilcox for a date that friday evening after work he told creath to let him off at the corner of lambeth and the spur creath accelerated his model a pickup through a yellow light and said your aunt will have dinner ready you not hungry ill get something down here he avoided the older mans eyes maybe see a movie waste of money creath said but he downshifted the truck and slowed long enough to allow travis to leap out there were still a couple of hours of daylight left the sky was a powdery blue the shadows stark and angular he went directly to the diner nancy wilcox had not been on his mind nearly as much as anna blaise but anna blaise was a mystery at once violated and aloof as unapproachable as a cat nancy was someone he might talk to she was there in the murky interior of the diner an overhead fan stirred the air the tables were all busy and there was a second waitress on duty he sat at the counter smiled ordered the chuck steak and a coleslaw side and wondered how to approach her he was not shy with women not in the ordinary sense but he had had only a pittance of real experience back home only millie gardner the neighbor girl had spoken much with him and by the time travis left millie was just turning twelve and had already begun to grow aloof other than that he had talked to his mother his schoolteachers a couple of girls doing what they obviously perceived as a kind of distasteful social work when he was left conspicuously alone at school functions it was humiliating but there were others who were in a way worse off who were ostracized for some mental or physical deformity and not solely on account of their family situation and although he had often enough prayed that it was otherwise travis knew at least that he was not despised altogether for himself but that was back home this was a new place here it was still possible that travis could expect some of what he had so far been pointedly denied nobody knew him here and that simple fact was as tantalizing as a promise he lingered over the steaming plate of food which he did not much want killing time there was no good opportunity to talk nancy moved deftly between the tall aluminum coffee urn and the soda fountain balanced plates on her arms pinned table orders on the silver carousel for the kitchen to pick up he watched her pluck a strand of steamed black hair out of her eyes and thought well this is impossible nevertheless he lingered over his coffee and asked for refills the hot black coffee made his heart beat faster his eyes were on her constantly and he thought she at least notices me here in time the tables began to empty the humidity eased she filled his cup for the third time and said eight oclock he looked at her stupefied she put her elbows on the counter thats when i get off eight oclock thats what you want to know isnt it i guess it is ive seen the cagney film at the rialto but theres a new one at the fox jewel robbery william powell and kay francis you like william powell hes pretty good travis had seen three moving pictures in his life she smiled well i guess im going over there after work i guess so am i he said she surprised him by stopping off at the haute montagne public library and slipping three fat volumes into the night depository a hemingway novel a book on astronomy and something by a german named carl gustav jung travis said you read all that uhhuh she gave him that smile again it was harder now defiant and he guessed she must have been ribbed about her reading dont you read magazines mostly in fact he had had a fair amount of time for reading in the long winters back home she would already have seen the dime western and he was not prepared to admit to the stacks of stolen borrowed or dearly bought science fiction and adventure pulps he had ploughed through not when she was dumping carl gustav jung into the night slot they moved along the darkened sidewalks back toward lawson spur and the fox theater there was a short line at the ticket box and travis saw other girls there highschool girls or just older and observed how they looked at nancy wilcox the crabbed sidelong glances and covert stares it was a phenomenon he recognized and he thought what is there about her he paid for two tickets and they sat together in the mezzanine gazing down silently for a time at the plush velvet curtains over the screen while a fat woman played overtures on the wurlitzer travis felt the girls warm pressure next to him she smelled good he thought some perfume and just a lingering indication that she had put in a long day in a hot restaurant it was a wholesome smell it aroused him and it made him nervous he wondered what was expected of him whether he should hold her hand or keep to himself he did not want to insult her then the lights flickered down the organ hissed into silence the movie started it was one of those cocktailandeveninggown movies everybody pronouncing calculated bon mots in rooms that seemed to travis too impossibly large and lushly furnished he watched in a sort of dazed incomprehension and when nancy pressed her body toward him he intertwined his arm with hers and they were at least that close after the movie they went for cokes the wilcox girls hair had strayed down in front of her eyes again she probed at the ice with her straw and said you dont go out much do you is it so obvious no travis nothing wrong just you seemed a bit uncomfortable is all travis was carefully silent she said i guess you were kind of a misfit back where you came from your mother told you that said as much i guess but thats not what i mean i mean the way you move the way you talk very i dont know wary like somethings going to jump out at you a misfit he said i guess thats about it im a misfit did you know that she sipped her coke again those books partly nobody reads in this town miss thayer who works at the library she doesnt even read but thats not all of it she said as if offering a vital confidence i dont get along with people i know what thats like travis said partly its my mother she makes a profession out of being righteous she believes the world is going straight to hell so i guess the pressures on me to live up to all that im supposed to be perfecta saintly little female imitation of christ i guess i just ah cracked she laughed shes so afraid of everything you know travis afraid and suspicious and im the opposite he smiled distantly never afraid not of what shes afraid of whats she afraid of nancy gazed out the big window of the diner it was way past dark now all the cars had their lights on love sex politics dirty words she waved her hand all that oh travis said taken aback are you afraid of those things she was staring at him now hell no he said hoping it was not a lie but she laughed and seemed to loosen up no she said no i dont guess you are and she drained her coke walk me home at the corner of the street where she lived nancy turned and touched his arm i dont want my mother to see us shell be on to us soon enough anyway you can kiss me if you want travis the offer surprised him he was clumsy but earnest she nodded thoughtfully then as if she had entered some particularly revealing notation in a private notebook his hands lingered on her one day she said you have to tell me the truth about it about what you know where you came from what happened there she hesitated your mother she was a very fine woman travis said is that the truth he stepped away from her yes chapter three three sundays after travis arrived in haute montagne liza burack made up her special millefeuilles for the baptist womens bake sale the day was dusty and hot as all the days had been that parched summer and the baked goods were set up on the lawn of the first baptist in the shadow of the high quatrefoil stainedglass windows which were the buildings only adornment reverend shaffer had brought out the big sprucewood tables and mrs clawson had provided drop cloths the edibles were displayed thereonquite artistically liza thought the candies and pastries in attractive circles like tiny works of art shirley crofts almond cake had been given as usual pride of place shirley herself stood guard against the circling flies flailing with an elder branch and wearing the sort of vigilant expression her late husband might have displayed to the germans at the battle of the somme faye wilcox was at one end of the table liza at the other like the two polarities of an electrical cell i will just drift down liza thought after all appearances and what with the way things were going well she moved lightly past the creamhoms and butter cookies she liked these times best she thought all the people around her the aimless chatter it was like being pulled in many directions at once if she closed her eyes she could almost imagine herself floating the baked goods like scattered islands in an ocean of afternoon the heat on her like a benediction everything condensed in this minute point of experience but such ideas worried her her thoughts strayed too easily these days and she forced herself to stay on course faye wilcox she instructed herself talk to faye the wilcox woman was heavy and hostile her arms were laced under her bosom it looked for all the world as if her body were some unpleasant excresence that had leaked unavoidably into public sight well liza thought its that outfit hardly better than a sack but who am i to talk she glanced with momentary embarrassment at herself her cornflower dress was streaked with white from the mornings baking she had neglected to change and had she combed her hair lord lord where was her mind lovely afternoon liza it was reverend shaffer cruising across the broad green church lawn he was a young man and there was liza thought something almost feminine about him such a contrast with the reverend kinney who had died just two autumns ago reverend shaffer used the pulpit to deliver obscure parables to pose questions reverend kinney had been more concerned with answers it was liza thought too symptomatic of the changes that had overtaken the nation the town her life but she mustnt dwell on that it is nice she said the flies were intense the heat debilitating there were no customers everybody loves your napoleons the reverend said millefeuilles liza said automatically pardon me mother always called them millefeuilles maryjanethats my sistermy how she loved those pastries she was always pestering mother make up your millfills mama make up your millfills she ate and ate and never got fat not like me and how is your sister the reverend asked puzzled dead liza said dead and i presume in hell reverend shaffer frowned the judgments not ours to make mrs burack you didnt know maryjane reverend pleasetake a millefeuille but the reverend only gazed at her coolly and drifted away how different it had been when she was a girl in those days there had been virtue and vice distilled and pure essences between which one might choose not this muddying not this terrible confusion liza straightened her spine and gazed at the wilcox womannancys mother love your butter tarts she said faye wilcox looked at her as if from a great distance you havent even tried one liza dear oh i couldnt but theyre so beautiful just so perfect thank you faye said did you see my millefeuilles lovely as always she is so hard liza thought sadly hard as granite at one time of course they had been friends allies at least wary but with the same goals before them in those days it would have been three years ago she remembered the annual picnic summer printed on the invitation cards liza had been the leading light of the baptist women it was liza who had organized the letter campaign to the public school board concerning their thoughtless promotion of the darwin theory in the highschool textbooks it was liza who had chaired the temperance committee everyone agreed that without liza burack the baptist women would have been a vastly less effectual organization but then things had begun to happen things over which she had no control that blaise girl had moved in creath began to act strangely maryjane had come down sick off in oklahoma and there was no way liza could visit not merely on account of the distance but because of the sort of woman maryjane had allowed herself to become the upshot of it all was liza faded she had heard other people use that expression faded it was an odd word it made her think of flowers left too long in a vase she thought with some astonishment i have faded and of course faye wilcox had stepped into the vacuum liza had left and now it was faye who organized the letter campaigns the library boycotts now it was faye everyone looked to for guidance but faye had her own achilles heel liza thought suppressing a certain vindictive pleasure she had that daughter of hers who was quite notorious faye herself complained sometimes though she was shrewd enough to blame it on the schools and now liza thought nancy wilcox and travis fisher were going together i suppose liza said youve heard about nancy and my sisters boy faye adopted a stern equanimity her eyes were steely buried in small effusions of flesh i know theyve been seen together my goodness hasnt nancy talked it over with you nancy is not inclined to do that faye that girl doesnt appreciate what you do for her faye relaxed a little indeed she does not im sometimes grateful martin isnt alive to hear the back talk she gives me it would break his heart you deserve better its in the lords hands faye wilcox said primly and travis have you had any trouble creath says he is unhappy at work but no real trouble no thank god the times faye wilcox said oh yes of course the boys mother tragic liza added i mean her death one wonders if tendencies are inherited he is a hard worker in spite of what creath says he seems quite stable here the influence of the home counts for so much dont you think faye nodded grudgingly and brushed the air above her butter tarts flies buzzed still it could be worse liza said the two of them faye wilcox gazed across the lawn the baking asphalt street her eyes unfocused it could be she admitted there liza thought it had been decided in that strained admission a truce nancy and travis would be allowed to continue seeing each other it was for both liza and faye the best of the meager alternatives faye had accepted it grudgingly no doubt for it returned to liza a measure of control now liza thought now what does this mean what does this portend for the future those tarts just look so good liza said faye held one out to her by the paper wrapper an offering please thank you liza said biting deeply into the pastry the ripe sweetness of it exploded in her mouth trav and nancy made friday night a regular thing twice as the month crawled toward september he met her on saturday as well when there was nothing at the fox or the rialto they walked up the spur toward the railway depot or out to the wide grassy fields where the fresnel ran beyond the town nancy knew where the wild strawberry patches were though the dry season had yielded very few berries and slowly travis had come to know nancy he liked her he harbored an admiration for her frankness her outrageous willingness to defy convention she had quite consciously put herself in a position travis had long occupied against his will outsider lonermisfit was the word she liked to use and that fascinated him but it disturbed him too the lightheartedness of it as if she were playing a game with something really quite dangerous something she did not altogether understand compromising her femininity with this reckless curiosity he liked her but in a strange way he was also afraid of her they had come to the strawberry fields again the sun was going down now the days heat beginning to abate darkness rising from the eastern horizon beyond the ruin of a shack where nancy said an eccentric railway switchman had once lived the town was not far awaythe train depot was hardly more than a quarter mile distant obscured by a stand of treesbut their isolation seemed complete they found a few berries and then nancy put out a blanket over a bare patch of ground by the tumbledown hut and they sat there watching the river run with their backs against the sunwarmed wood a breeze had come up the twilight breeze nancy called it she held his hand and her skin was warm and dry she said after a time you like that place the burack place travis shrugged its all right you dont sound too enthusiastic i dont have much choice its a place to live you make money down at the plant some she smiled knowingly i bet that creath burack siphons off most of it for rent am i right he takes a share i save a little she was leading up to something travis thought how about that girl upstairs anna he shrugged uncomfortably i dont see much of her shes a big mystery you know everybody talked about her for a while still do sometimes really shes so quiet travis thats a major crime in itself but theres more to it there must be sure shes quiet nobody knows where she comes from or how she happened to end up in haute montagne one day she was living at the buracks thats all anybody knows but there are rumors man named grant bevis used to live next door to your aunt and uncle married manhe left town real quick not too long after anna blaise moved in anna takes in sewing but she never shows her face in town answers the door sometimes probably gets all her work that way people take her sewing just so they can get a glance at her nancy gazed up at a solitary cloud they say shes beautiful havent you seen her maybe i have maybe i havent do you think shes beautiful yes travis said you talk to her much she comes down to dinner creath does most of the talking he stretched out on the blanket i went up one time and offered to help her with the sewing she said no she was fine in fact he had stayed a little longer trying to make small talk anna blaise had sat on the bed smiling encouragingly but answering in monosyllables in a modest blouse and skirt she had looked more than attractive she had been almost devastatingly beautiful lithe and pale and still like a piece of china statuary and travis had made himself leave the room because if he did not he would have been beside her on the bed kissing her he felt sure she would not have objected he could have done anything he wanted she did not after all object to creaths attentions and he could not help thinking why why how could she have compromised herself that way and why did she seem in spite of it so pure a mystery nancy had said yes but he could tell her none of this you like her nancy said he pressed her hand i like you she said airily i dont believe in monogamous love does that shock you travis i believe its possible to love more than one person even sexually i believe he touched her cheek and kissed her she moved her body closer to his they kissed until the sun was gone and the darkness had closed down around them he was stroking her then memorizing the feel of her body beneath the cotton dress and it might have gone farther might have reached a consummation travis had only dared dream about but she sat up suddenly her wide eyes luminous in the last of the daylight and said travis theres somebody here you want a ride nancy it was greg morrow nancy was able to make out his silhouette against the sky he was big his arms were prickled with black hairs his angular face was a shadow he hunched forward threateningly and there was another shape looming behind him one of gregs buddies an illiterate millworker named kluger next to her travis climbed very slowly to his feet nancys stomach was leaden with fear for him nevertheless she said no thank you greg i would not like a ride you shouldnt have followed me greg came closer his hips thrust forward his hands loose at his sides just curious he said just wanted to know what miss toogoodforme is up to miss royal twat he spat at traviss feet rolling in the dirt with a shitheel farmboy well well she stood up a moment ago she thought dazedly everything had been so nice go away greg no he said it was a hostile insinuating whisper i want you to ride with me travis started forward but greg was quick greg was terribly quick and she saw his fist fly out like a piston and heard it connect with traviss face travis reeled back she looked up at him and saw a ring of blood around his mouth he was sagging against the timbers of the shack his eyes were closed son of a bitch she said greg laughed you dirtymouthed cunt he said triumphantly come on cunt and his friend moved closer too greg reached out for her she drew back against the wall of the shack next to travis her heart was beating wildly she could hardly see for the tears that had started in her eyes but i will fight she thought he will not have me without a fight greg came forward again his hand suddenly clenched on her wrist and then so quickly that she did not understand at first what had happened traviss fist clubbed down on the side of gregs head his foot came up between the legs of gregs greasy denims it was clumsy nancy thought but terribly effective greg stumbled back and then fell to the ground clutching himself shouting fuck fuck fuck so loudly that nancy thought the whole town might hear travis turned to face kluger but kluger his mouth an astonished only stumbled back and pulled greg to his feet she looked at travis and thought how often has he had to do this his eyes were dilated vacant he stared at greg and kluger greg crimsonfaced drew himself up as if he might be willing to stay and fight it out but kluger whispered something in his ear and greg nodded and backed off it was over as quickly as that greg shouted once from the darkness an insult or a threatnancy could not make out the wordsand then there was the sound of gregs model t ratcheting down a side road toward the spur theyre gone she breathed she felt travis relax next to her youre hurt she said let me help travis she took his hand please she led him across the dark field down the shallow bank of the fresnel to a quiet place she knew where pussy willows had grown up the river had retreated in the dry season but she took his hand and guided him across a pair of broad flat rocks until they stood surrounded by running water kneel down she said he went down on his haunches at the edge of the rock she cupped fresh water from the fresnel and washed his mouth with it there seemed to be no loose teeth that was good his blood ran into her hand and she dried him with the hem of her skirt she did what she could then sat crosslegged on the rock with his head in her lap he was breathing more easily now the first stars were coming out this is what it means he said thickly she looked at him frowning travis he said you let him screw you it was a vulgar question but she answered seriously no he wanted to i wouldnt thats why hes mad at me travis nodded seemed to mull over the information this is what it means he said finally being a misfit oh she said its not fun she said theyre gone now travis sometimes you win mostly they win theres more of them she rocked him she put her hand on his forehead dear god this isnt new to you is it no he said what were you she stroked his hair what could you possibly have done he said nothing she said was it something about your mother she thought at first he wouldnt answer but then softly he said everyone knew he drew a breath i guess i was the last to know isnt that strange that i should be so close to her and not knownot even suspect he sat up and faced the darkness she had to strain against the noise of the river to hear him we had no money i knew that we had loans out on the property every year a little deeper in debt i knew that too but the other thing he took nancys hand and his grip was frighteningly tight i thought they were friends her men friends she called them and sure they stayed sometimes stayed the night evenbut i didnt knowi was only a kidi didnt know they paid and then she was holding him because he could not contain his weeping and a chill had crept up from the river chapter four travis thought often of nancy wilcox but his thoughts returned almost as often to anna blaise to what nancy called the mystery creath let him borrow the model a for an evening after hed promised to bring it back with the tank fullit was threequarters empty when hed climbed in and he picked up nancy at the times square they drove far beyond the town driving for the sake of putting miles in back of them nancy watching with a kind of rapt eagerness as the road unfolded like flying she said i wish we could just keep going forever september was already a week old the wind that carried back her hair was cool and fragrant when they were thirty or forty miles out of haute montagne travis pulled over and parked them under a stand of bur oaks there was no other traffic on the road and the stars seemed immensely bright they had escaped the aura of the town it was easier to breathe here travis thought see much of anna nancy asked he had expected the question she had taken an interest almost as intense as traviss own shes one of us nancy had said the week before whether she knows it or not an outcast its like the three of us are connected somehow the usual travis said she nodded id like to meet her sometime i dont know if i can arrange that you dont think shed come or dont you want to ask i dont think creath would let her how do you mean he hesitated but then he thought well why not tell her he had come to trust nancy a damn sight more than he trusted creath or his aunt liza if he owed his loyalty to anyone he thought it was to her its creath he uses her and i think hes scared somebody might find out he explained about the latenight visits up the stairs nancy was wideeyed then thoughtful she put her hands behind her head and gazed up at the canopy of oaks the princess in the tower she said faintly shes a prisoner she doesnt give him any argument doesnt matter maybe hes blackmailing her maybe he threatens her she shook her head jesus i never did like the man but this we still dont know why shes there where she came from find out nancy said her features were suffused with new purpose her eyes seemed to shine in the dark shes a prisoner we know that much andyou know what else travis maybe we can rescue her he came home late parked the car carefully went upstairs and fell at once into a dazed halfsleep the footsteps brought him awake again it was a friday nightsaturday morning he guesseddeep in the hinterland between midnight and dawn travis came awake groggily he felt the house sighing and shifting the wind talking in the chimney flues it was a few days into september the days were as hot and dry as ever but now the nights brought some small measure of relief mooncooled winds blowing in across the grasslands he pulled the sheet more tightly around his shoulders and drew a deep shuddering breath sleep was only a heartbeat away but the footsteps came again and they were just beyond his door creath he thought miserably and was overcome for a moment with an unbearable sense of oppression it was late and dark and he felt sapped powerless but wait he thought the footsteps continued they were light delicate almost inaudible he would not have heard if they had not hesitated in their rhythm directly outside his door not creaths footsteps annas then and they were headed down the stairs he sat up slowly the sheet fell away long moments passed then he heard the front door latch rasp open the screen door yawn and subside his room was dark naked he went to the window and raised the sash an inch anna blaise appeared on the front walk she was dressed in a summer blouse and skirt his first thought was she must be cold the wind tousled her hair her eyes shadowed seemed to give back the obscurity of the night sky she hesitated a moment at the sidewalk her head turning back and forth with dreamlike fluidity like a hunting dog travis thought fixing on a scent briefly she looked up at the window her gaze held there a moment though it was not possible that she could have seen him travis did not breathe then slowly slowly she began to move westward along deville into the black shadows of the box elders he hesitated only a moment he threw on his pants laced his shoes buttoned a rough cotton workshirt he was as gentle as he could be moving down the stairs but he was heavier and clumsier than anna and in his haste some noise was unavoidable on the dark landing he jammed his knee into a newel post and suppressed a curse travis his aunt lizas voice whipcracked into the silence travis is that you he froze he hadnt made it past her bedroom she took him down into the front parlor it was dark but she ignored the light switches in her nightgown and robe travis thought his aunt resembled something amphibian crudely draped caught in the midst of some unspeakable transformation her double chin spilled over a lacy collar her teeth were in a glass upstairs her expression was vacant christ god travis thought i have to leave this place anna but his aunt said she is not for you you know travis with a calm equanimity that made him wonder if she could read his thoughts no she went on before he could answer there is no need to explain i know what goes on in a mans mind where that woman is concerned she sighed she had settled into creaths easy chair her head cocked in an attitude of icy bottomless cynicism the mantle clock ticked out seconds as she regarded him youre not the only one did you know that oh yes there was that grant bevis a married man a respectable man owned the hardware store over on beaumont he used to come sneaking around heresneaking after anna wife left him took the kids still he came she smiled humorlessly left town when i threatened to expose him before the church his letters to her still come in the mail though all different postmarks all the same his undying love love as if love entered into it her smile faded and of course there is creath i guess you know dont shake your head this is a small household we cannot truly keep secrets one from another maybe creath believes so maybe he has deluded himself into believing so but it is impossible im not a heavy sleeper travis i know when he goes to her i know if you know travis whispered then why why stay with him why stay here in this house she laughed suddenly a shrill bray travis worried that it might wake up creath and bring him down here stand on my entitlements like that bevis woman it got her nowhere you know it got her alone and with children to raise in a world that does not welcome hungry mouths love says the vow and honor and obey maybe love goes maybe honor goes even but there is that last i can have that much of a marriage i can obey shell be gone now travis thought gone wherever she is going she can see into him liza was saying she thinks to conceal it from me but i know i know there is something in creath that is drawn to her something left over from his childhood something stupid and foolish in him she added a whisper i know that part of him there was a time when he would look at me that way the way he looks at her but that was a long time ago years gone travis years gone she has no right who is she aunt liza i dont know she sighed again remembering as if she were not fully awake her voice took on a distant quality it was creaths doing an odd thing he doesnt ever stop for hitchhikers or tramps we were driving back from your mothers place that last time we visited when it became obvious we could not visit ever again it was late it was after midnight and we were on the road coming into haute montagnethere was no trafficand creath was tired of driving and suddenly there was this woman she stood on the sandy margin of the road just stood there not thumbing not doing anything standing andtravis she had no clothes on can you credit that a naked woman on the verge of the highway white as a statue in the moonlight she clucked i thought there must have been an accident i would have urged creath to stop but he had already slowed down he was pulling over before the words were out of my mouth get a blanket he says theres one in the trunk i did so i covered her up creath was just staring at her like a man struck blind and she was staring at him i covered her up with that old woolen blanket and i led her into the car wetook her home she let her breath in and out a papery sound travis had forgottenalmostabout following anna he stared at liza now her face round and pale in the faint light that filtered through the lace curtains from the street i dont know what it is she whispered i truly dont the way she looks maybe something in her eyes something in the raw smell of her she does something to men makes them helpless they go to her and sheshe aunt liza travis said placatingly no her voice was shrill again dont comfort me travis fisher dont place yourself above meor creath she groped her glasses into place her eyes were suddenly magnified dont pretend you werent down here following her following her wherever she goes these moonlight nights some nasty place you and the wilcox girl getting along just fine yes but here you are sniffing after that dirty creature the accusation was unfair travis thought but he felt an involuntary rush of guilt nevertheless his cheeks burned travis his aunt said listen to me i grew up with your mother to me she was always maryjanemy little sister i lived with her and i watched her go bad not as bad as she ended up but bad inside her bad to the bone mama used to say bad like a rotten tooth she would not do what she was told took a pleasure in contrariness in her own wicked shamelessness we warned her about that man who became your father oh yes he is rootless and insincere mama told her maryjane we said you must not squander your life on him but she did she ran off west and he left her left her gaptoothed from all the times he got drunk left her with you to feed she could have come home anytime could have but would she no not maryjane anything but admit defeat travis squirmed on the sofa you have that heritage aunt liza said her eyes blazing you must be aware of it travis know it or itll hurt you you have your fathers blind anger and your mothers stupid passions leave that woman alone she is nothing you know or understand you dont need her whatever your body might tell you he said faintly aunt liza i go up now she sank back into the easy chair as if some sustaining energy had been consumed go up and sleep and dont let on to creath that we talked the trail was cold anna was gone he went upstairs dazed he slept almost instantly and was still asleep in that hour before dawn when anna blaise crept silently back into the house cold blue fire playing like sheet lightning about her body friday next he drove nancy back to the stand of oaks on the highway out of haute montagne the prairie spread out around them grain fields whispering toward a meager harvest with the motor of the old ford off and the shrilling of the locusts all around they might have been a thousand miles from home tonight was special travis thought he felt a special wildness in nancy she would glance at him glance away and then her eyes would find him again her eyes when the contact held were very blue and very wide travis himself felt victim to a kind of unfocused randiness nancys warmth next to him on the lumpy seat of the ford stimulated a painful and persistent erection he wanted her so badly that his knuckles had gone white on the steering wheel he guessed it was understandable he had fallen into the rhythm of his work at the ice plant and the days passed easily enoughmore easily than the nights often though he would stop what he was doing shake his head like a man coming out of a dream and a deep panic would flood him he imagined himself growing old in haute montagne growing fat and sedately cruel growing into the shape of creath burack like rubber poured into a steel mold he felt at such times that he must push back at the barriers that confined himpush or go mad he guessed nancy felt the same way she had been pushing a long time there was that bond between them he stopped the car and they climbed into the truck bed and made pillows of empty burlap sacks travis touched her lightly shes anxious too he thought she wants to touch push down the walls but she lit a cigarette her hand shaking and waved the match at the darkness her lips trembled as she exhaled tell me about anna he told what there was to tell for a time even travis was distracted by it the memory of liza and of annas night walk welling up in him like a cold seacurrent strange nancy whispered passing strange travis said obviously nancy said she needs our help more than ever she hasnt asked for it she looked at him from behind the glowing tip of her cigarette you think im butting in no you do admit it no rushing in too fast maybe remember nance we still dont know anything about this girl she was out on a highway naked creath picked her up maybe she wanted it that way maybe she likes things the way they are nancy scrunched down in the shadowy pickup bed drawing herself inward musing before i got this diner job she said i would go over with sewing mama would send me over ive seen the girl travis seen her up close ive looked her in the eye he nodded so have i have you and you can sit there and suggest maybe she likes what shes doing well no he couldntnot honestly there was that desperation in anna blaise like an underground fire it was impossible to miss but he said theres more to it than we know bound to be thats why we have to find out how talk to her follow her she exhaled a cloud of smoke tossed the butt out into the roadway a small cometary arc see where she goes she could not have missed the attraction travis felt toward anna travis was a poor liar and yet he thought she is capable of suggesting this maybe it was her way of testing him or he thought of testing herself he thought of what she had said in the strawberry fields last month i believe its possible to love more than one person its chilly these nights she said suddenly far off the westbound train wailed travis pressed up close to her put his arm around her protectively her cotton dress was like silk under his big hand she turned toward him and they kissed and there was something in the urgency of it that made travis aware that she had decided to go all the way with him tonight he touched her small perfect breasts after a time his hand worked up under her dress he was almost feverish with the wanting and when she laid herself back against the burlap sacks and he entered her it was like an electric shock of pleasure he climaxed rapidly nancy shuddered under him and he realized distantly amazed that she must be experiencing some equivalent fulfillment gasping he told her he loved her maybe he did it was not a lie she would have recognized a lie but he was far less certain than he made himself sound doubt had crept into him even as he performed the act he loved her at the very least for what they had done together but even that was compromised it had been too easy he thought she gave herself too easily women ought not to do that he looked away as she straightened her skirt what disturbed him and what he found hard to admit even to himself was that the face that had flashed in his mind in that moment of climax had been not nancys but annas her pale china skin the eyes huge and dark violated but aloof her strangely unassailable purity burning in him like fire chapter five september crawled on the cries of the trains acquiring that special autumn melancholy and at first liza burack believed she might have contributed toward the salvation of her sisters son if not the salvation of his soul he refused to go to church with her claimed his mother would not have approved then at least his worldly salvation she had savored the thought troweling in her backyard garden those long lastofsummer afternoons i have helped save him she would think down on her knees among the gladioli and the fragrant black earth it was a good thought and in those moments she could almost believe it made everything worthwhile her fall from grace with the baptist women her sisters deathinsin even creaths terrible and unacknowledged private weakness even that i have helped save him but she lay awake now in the postmidnight silence of the bedroom her eyes like beacon lights moonlight shining on her oaken dresser and creath beside her like a dead weight and when she heard annas small footsteps on the landing and then a few moments after travissthen she knew she had in fact lost she started up after him by god she thought he doesnt understand if he understood he would not be chasing after her if he understood but no she had told him once and she had known by his eyes that he did understand this was no normal woman and his feelings for her were not normal feelings and yet he had chosen to follow her strange words flashed in her mind witch demon succubus she went to the door of the bedroom opened it a crack there went travis a black shadow past the stairwell and there hear it now the click and whine of the front door liza burack sank back into the bed defeated travis is lost she thought the sound of her own thought grown singsong as sleep too long denied crept up from the overheated crevice of the blankets travis is lost is lost is lost she dozed dreamlessly and the nightwind came in her window like a tide talk to her nancy had said follow her it had sounded so simple travis paced down the moonbathed street making good on the promise at last and it seemed much less so anna blaise moved ahead of him like a shadow a lithe and graceful dancer in a shadow ballet for long moments travis would walk blindly certain that he had lost her then she would appear again half a block away gliding through the umbra of a tossing willow travis wore a thick cotton workshirt and a jacket over that and a jet of autumn air set him shivering anna wore only a blouse a skirt navy blue gotochurch clothes though that was something she did not ever do shadowcolored he followed her a sick excitement rising in him there was at this hour simply no reasonable destination for a woman like anna the town was asleep travis had overheard talk at the ice plant about a roadhouse called conklins out beyond the granaries that a man could get a discreet drink there after midnight but it was late now even for that and in any case anna was headed the wrong way toward the nearer margin of town toward the railway tracks far out deville street the blacktop faded to dirt there were no houses here no trees but scrub oak nothing beyond but farmland and prairie grass travis slowed when anna slowed she had come to the place where the railway crossed the road moonlight glinting off the hard arc of the tracks she stood suddenly stilland travis dove down feeling foolish and ashamed into the high grass in the gully by the road when he peered ahead through a thicket of buckbrush he was able to see anna blaise outlined against the morning stars like a sentinel her bare arms shining her head moving left and right in that oddly sensual huntingdog motion christ god travis thought if she sees me but her attention was focused elsewhere her arms were stiff at her sides her head erect listening travis thought he was suddenly aware of the small hairs prickling at the back of his neck his breath caught in his throat far off in the depths of the night a smallhours freight express sounded its whistle westbound he thought tracking over the curvature of the earthit sounded that distant anna blaise was marble and ice listening travis felt the days warmth seeping into him from the dry earth under his belly crickets chirruped in the gully all around him he gazed at anna and thought why she reminds me of somebody she reminded him of of he closed his eyes fumbling for the memory of his mother deep currents stirred in the prairie grass the night obscures her features he thought it was that profile that did it the head held high a gesture both defiant and somehow hopeless it made travis think of his mother in a way he had not thought of her for years he rememberedso vividly now he could taste ita night like this that first chill of autumn cutting through the air when he was no more than six years old he had been in bed awake when he should not have been the farmhouse was quiet the effect however was not of peace but of foreboding of imminent danger because daddy was out late which meant daddy was drinking which meant he could come home any minute full of a sour and implacable hostility travis could not sleep with this turmoil of emotions in him the relief of his fathers absence the threat of his return he lay in bed listening to the trees talk outside his window and attempted to recreate in his mind the plot of treasure island which mama had been reading to him that night he had almost achieved sleep when he heard the front door slam that other quiet sound might have been mamas indrawn breath in the bedroom across the hall he covered his ears when the shouting began at the first thump and stifled cry he buried his head under the pillow mama he thought oh mama and when it was over she came to him she did it always it was her way of saying its okay mamas okay not needing the words or the ugly admissions they might contain she sat in the wooden chair by the window with the paper blinds pulled up and out of her way how that wind does torment that old tree she said not even checking to see if he was asleep knowing maybe that he was not her voice was choked with recent weeping but beneath it there was still that quality travis associated indelibly with mama silk and sighing a good sound then just when her voice had begun to comfort him back to sleep oh trav look he sat up squinteyed and went to the window she held him on the lap of her old print dress her bony knees under him the sky beyond the window was vast clear wild with stars the limbs of the willow moved as if in semaphore see travis mama said shooting stars he thought at first they were fireflies but they moved too quickly and too purposefully and they did not flicker shooting stars he thought sleepy now falling stars pieces out of the autumn night he had fallen asleep thinking of mama of the starlight playing on the bruise that lay like a veined map on her cheek thinking of how when he grew up he would protect her would not let any harm come to her and thinking of those two shooting stars how they had moved across the dark sky east and west as if twinned from a common source he felt as if her eyes were on him now anna travis thought he shook his head to clear it and crawled forward a yard or so she was gazing directly toward the patch of prairie grass where he lay her eyes were unnaturally bright the westbound freight streamed by behind her a clangorous black banner weariness came over him again suddenly he felt a stirring of alarm but it was muted theres something about her travis thought something had changed in her he could see it in the arch of her back in the way her fists were clenched she had shaken off some of that passive helplessness in her eyes travis thought there was something he had not seen there before an expectation possibly a hope but the weight of his body was immense the night air seemed to press him down anna he thought sleepily anna her gaze bore into him he closed his eyes when he woke the sun was standing over the eastern horizon there were dust motes in the raking light and his bones ached with chill and he was alone chapter six he brushed off his shirt and pants and walked back toward town until he could hail a ride he knew he was late for work by the position of the sun he was at least an hour overdue but that didnt matter something important had happened the night before it was mysterious not altogether clear even in his own mind he was sure however of one thing that anna blaise did in fact need help and that in some way she had chosen travis to help her the feel of it burned inside him he hitched with a jutboned farmer as far as the south end of town and then walked the remaining quarter mile to the ice plant his reflection in the dusty windshield of the truck had been wild his hair askew and blazened with hayseeds his beard grown out in stubble his fingernails ringed with black crescents at the plant he clocked in threw a little water on his face at the chipped porcelain basin out back and ran his fingers through his hair then he took up his broom and began sweeping the raucous machine shed she must not stay at the buracks he thought that much was clear for whatever reason she had been tolerating creaths abuses of her but that would stop he could not say he knew these things but he knew that something had changed in her last night maybe creath would see it too he worked steadily and alone when the noon whistle blew he realized he didnt have a lunch with him that he had missed breakfast too and that the heat of the day was pouring down like molten glass he wandered through the gravel lot back of the loading dock to the grassy bank of the fresnel and sat with his arms wrapped around his knees watching the brown water flow and curl so he thought what about nancy did he love her or didnt he and what did that imply in this skewed and mysterious new world he had entered love was unfathomable he did not understand it nancy was a concentration of good and bad things wild impulses and dangerous urges he had loved her he thought had loved her at least in that reasonless moment when he slaked himself in her body if you could call that love he knew only that there was this different thing he felt with anna blaise an undifferentiated longing that seemed to rise up in him like summer heat not passion so much as a kind of ache as if her perfect body were that garden from which the first man had been cast out and to which all men longed to return it was as powerful as that love was inadequate a merely human word he stood up and turned back when the whistle blew again when he reached the plant his uncle was waiting for him creath wore an undershirt that stretched taut over the skin of his belly and he was sweating the sweat glinting in the long hairs of his arms his chest his face was ruddy and there was slow anger in his eyes he pulled a checked handkerchief out of his back pocket and mopped his face with it you were late he said travis nodded you were out creath said ponderously all last night your aunt liza was worried sick this morning you appreciate what youve done it was a mistake travis said come on in here creath said hooking a thumb at his office a wooden cubicle behind the machine shed you come in here well talk about mistakes the room inside possessed a single crude window propped open with a yellowhandled gimlet the heat was intense enough to smell a stink like the hotmetal stink of a misaligned gear in the refrigeration machinery creath had decorated the walls with calendars bank calendars hardware store calendars feed store calendars none of them current the ice plant keys hung on a big ring hooked over a nail next to the door under them was the trucks ignition key creath sank into the wooden officechair behind the cheap desk easing back against its protesting springs fixing a long stare on travis travis felt a wave of dizzy claustrophobia sweep through him because he hadnt eaten he supposed but he felt like hed walked into a hot sealed box we brought you to this town creath said travis nodded squinting we paid your way it that not correct answer me yessir we took you in yessir fed you yessir i employ you at this ice plant is that not right travis sir and now what have you done travis closed his eyes come in late come in late more than that i believe sir the older man sighed travis dont bullshit me i will not be bullshitted we took you in and we fed you and i employed you and you were out last night correct me if im wrong chasing after our other roomer travis said nothing how do you think that makes me feel travis that you would do a thing like that act filthy like that while youre living under my roof hypocrite travis thought you goddamned hypocrite creath waved his hands placatingly now i understand how it must have been for you you did not have a normal home your mother my mother doesnt come into this it was a mistake he realized immediately but he could not make himself be quiet not in this box creath performed a patient smile dont take that tone with me i knew your mother you little peckerwood keep still travis thought desperately he focused his eyes on a calendar picture of a little girl gingham dress field of daisies the sky in the picture was a deep and impossible kodak blue almost turquoise travis creath grinned broadly she was a whore travis so many daisies you understand what im saying she fucked for money travis you could get lost in that blue she fucked strangers for money travis and i know about it and liza knows about it and the baptist women know about it and i guess by this time just about every dumb shit in town knows about it you hear me travis she shut your mouth he couldnt help it his head was spinning creath stood up and his grin widened into something truly awful a jackolantern smirk of triumph no you poor ignorant whoreson you shut your mouth how about that travis raised his foot and kicked the old pineboard desk so that it racked backward across the floor creath fell forward flailing into a stack of yellow invoices travis watched a moment as his uncle struggled up cursing then he turned restraining a rage that ran in him like blood he yanked open the door his hand rested momentarily on the lower of the two keyrings the one on which creath carried the key to the truck well why not he had lost his job had probably lost his room at the burackshad lost all there was to lose in this town his fist curled around the keyring he left his uncle grunting in the heat nancy wilcox knew as soon as travis came through the door that something was terribly wrong it was the afternoon for one thing that lull between lunch and dinner when the grill was allowed to cool and at least a little breath of wind stirred the tepid air of the diner travis should have been at work he should not have been driving his uncles black ford pickup parked now on a crazy diagonal outside and if that were not enough she could tell thered been trouble just from the look of him his hair ratty and tangled his eyes squeezed shut as if against some unbearable vision she surprised herself by thinking now it begins she had sensed in travis even that first day in july a tremor of wild energy pent up volatile as a blasting cap and maybe that was what had drawn her to him that wildness he was like a freight train carrying her down some dangerous track and away from her childhood now it begins she untied her apronher fingers trembled and said travis come and talk he said i need to talk to somebody she nodded and put the apron on a stool the only customer an unemployed bank clerk spooning mechanically at a bowl of campbells soup gazed at her in mute incomprehension back by dinner mr oneill she called out and moved to leave before oneill the owner could stir himself from the kitchen maybe she would lose her job probably she would but that was part of it she would shed all that job town her mother respectability become some new thing the bell tinkled behind her as she eased the door closed they drove down the spur toward the railway tracks i followed her last night travis said far out this old dirt road he pulled over the tracks lay baking in the indiansummer heat oily and bright his voice was hoarse followed her up here nancy nodded what happened i dont know he frowned and shook his head as if there were some dream there he could not dislodge she watched a train go by i fell asleep i guess thats all that really happened but it seemed like he looked pleadingly at her like she talked to me said that something big was on the way and she was at the center of it and she needed my help and in a way it was like i said yes gave her my promise ah jesus i dont know how to say it i understand hadnt she had the same feeling herself sensed it perhaps the first time she saw anna blaise standing hugeeyed in the doorway of the buracks shuttered house nothing specific nothing as intense as what travis had experienced but that feeling of the womans helplessness unmistakably of coiled mysteries waiting to be unsprung i said so all along i lost my job at the plant had a fight with creath likely be kicked out of the house too he looked at her i should go to her while i still can she could not mistake the implication in that you love her nancy i cant say you love me he gazed at the bright slash of the railway tracks cutting the horizon even this was not as painful as she might have expected she believed in free love yes love given freely and perhaps as freely taken away but it was not that the thing was curiously she did understand it understood at least that what had drawn travis to anna blaise was not sex or love in any ordinary sense was not something she could hope to compete with she loved travis she had admitted that to herself weeks ago but he was more than that he was her freight train she thought grimly the vehicle of her destiny there was little enough in him of pleasure or of happiness she had learned that but for better or worse she was bound to him she had to hang on so how do we help her he looked giddy with gratitude talk to her he said we talk to her now nancy thought now it begins he started the engine travis aunt liza exclaimed thank god youre safe she stood in the dim light of the parlor dusting wearing an old housecoat her hair pinned up travis regarded her with a mixture of wariness and compassion were going up to see anna aunt liza he felt nancy clutch his hand travis she frowned why arent you at work are you ill we can talk later aunt liza her expression hardened its that thing upstairs isnt it that female thing she blinked you stay away from her later aunt liza they moved past her and up the stairs and travis wondered briefly whether he might not be insanewhether he had allowed an hallucination to drive him to this extremity he squeezed nancys hand and pushed through the door to the attic room he thought at first it was empty the single brass bed was carefully madeup the rosepatterned bedspread folded at the foot of it the window shades were down the yellow light swam with dust motes anna he saw then was sitting primly in one corner in a straightbacked cane chair her hands folded in her lap she looked up at travis and then at nancy her face was expressionless when she spoke the words were precise and clipped close the door mute travis obeyed anna drew in a deep breath sighed help me she said i need your help gazing at nancy both of you nancy stepped forwardbravely travis thought though surely there was nothing here to be frightened of youre sick nancy said is that it thats one way of thinking of it though not exactly correct anna tilted her head i cant explain everything at once im sorry travis nodded he was transfixed once more by the perfection of her her skin was terribly pale but seemed almost luminoussmooth as jade alabasterwhite even her smallest motions were fluid and deliberate she stood in wild contrast to the barren room the black singer sewing machine hunched over the floorboards like an insect he hated himself for the thought but next to her nancy was gross plain thickly ordinary all i need anna blaise went on is time im not certain how much a few weeks a month maybe i need time and i need privacy its not precisely an illness but ill be helpless and ill change i apologize for not being more exact she stood up if i stay here i could be in danger you understand thats why i need your help the buracks i know travis said he told her about his fight with creath about losing his job then we have very little time anna said is there somewhere i can go the shack nancy said the old switchmans shack out by the railroad travis we could fix it up for her if its only for a couple of weeks i mean while the weathers warm its private anna asked its that yes then it will do travis can you take me there now now would be best while im still in control the implications of that disturbed him but she seemed very sure of herself so he said yes the truck was just outside but then the front door slammed an echo that resounded through the old house creath was home chapter seven they squared off in the secondstory hallway creath obstructing the stairs wore a deeply aggrieved scowl he looked at travis steadily appraising him you have a lot to answer for he said slowly you sorry son of a bitch travis told nancy to wait for him outside she shied past creath who allowed her to go all his attention fixed on travis anna was still upstairs hidden im taking her out of here travis said you have more gall than i expected creath pronounced you what would you do with her pissant farmboy like you youre using her travis said shut up shut your dirty mouth your aunts down these stairs travis felt his own outrage well up you think she doesnt know doesnt know you sneak up here to rape the girl these nights rape creath laughed his eyes rolling rape you call it what are you her white knight he advanced his fists clenched his thick arms showing swarms of muscle under the layered fat sweat showered off him she wants it boyo dont kid yourself she wants it or else why would you be chasing her all over town these nights sure ive been up there and maybe liza knows as much about me as that wilcox girl knows about you you think perhaps oh we are that much the same the difference boyo is that i own this house and this house is where she lives and i decide whos putting it to heryou understand i decide im taking her out of here you poor dumb shit creath said and struck him travis fell back through the door of the secondstory bathroom his hand caught on the medicine cabinet and a shelf of aunt lizas specifics came tumbling out cuticura bromo quinine winter pep cough syrup in an opaque blue bottle he steadied himself on the edge of the sink blind with pain the mirror was broken he will beat her travis thought if i fail at this he will beat her maybe kill her the instinct that had drawn creath to her had turned terribly ugly there was nothing protective in it now only a huge injured pride and the formless desire to hurt he forced himself back into the hallway creath had already started up the steps travis leaped forward and drove his fist into the small of the mans back creath whirled enraged you cheap little bastard he began but then travis hit him hard in the mouth wanting desperately to silence him hit him again when the older man dropped his guard and staggered back and then again and again until his fists seemed to acquire an energy and a rhythm of their own travis made himself stop when he realized that creath was not even trying to defend himself he was prostrate on the stairway his eyes gone wide with pain and disbelief suddenly ashamed travis stood up straight dont take her creath said it came out a whisper from his bloodied mouth goddamn you dont take her she is myi stop aunt liza said travis turned she had been watching from behind there was a terrible sullen calm in her voice youve hurt him enough get the girl and get out travis looked down at his own bruised and bloodied fists aunt liza do it do it quickly dazed he moved up the stairs i hope you rot aunt liza said placidly i hope she eats you alive they broke the rusted lock on the door of the switchmans shack and helped anna inside she seemed already weak unsteady on her feet she is ill travis thought the shack was barely erect weathered sideboards flecked with old redbarnpaint a sagging tarpaper roof inside there was a crude wooden shelf and mouldering mattress a porcelain bowl and mug in one corner a pyramid of rustrimmed tin cans the unaccustomed sunlight through the open door raised up ancient slumbers of dust anna slid down to the mattress her eyes were distant and she was panting travis went outside with nancy we cant keep the truck nancy said he nodded well be lucky if he doesnt have us arrested this is just the beginning we bought ourselves a lot of trouble just now you know that travis i guess i do she shrugged at the switchmans shack i suppose i dont look like muchnext to her you look fine it was a consolation and she nodded accepting it well we need to get that truck back before somebody sees it here travis i can drive it back to the house creath doesnt have anything against me youre sure yeah and then come back he added we need to talk make plans sure she drove away travis went back to the hovel it would take some cleaning up the corners were black with spider webs carpenter ants moved in the wallboards it was for certain not a good place to bring a sick person but anna was not sick exactly or so she said and anyway they had no choice a month she had said and then what what consummation was she waiting for but he could not force his thoughts that far ahead the needs of the moment had assumed a dire priority he looked at her on the mattress her eyes were closed she might have been asleep he thought again how delicate she was without conscious volition he moved to the side of her put his hands gently on her shoulders it was the first time he had touched her even this trivial intimacy was shockingly intense her skin was cool it was as if he could feel her fragility under his fingers she stirred but did not open her eyes it was strong he thought this thing that was special about herstronger the closer he got to her touching her it seemed as if she had come somehow to embody everything connected with the female sex was not so much a single woman as an aggregation of femininity mother and lover womb and vagina an exploration and a welcoming homehe blushed at his own thoughts but it was so not merely carnal as his contact with nancy had been there was nothing base in this the possibility of defilement was not in her he thought of what creath had said and maybe liza knows as much about me as that wilcox girl knows about you you think perhaps oh we are that much the same travis could not deny the truth of it but here for now it had ceased to matter he stroked her perfect cheek and she trembled anna her eyes were still closed the tremor in her grew stronger she twitched in his arms then convulsed abruptly he was frightened anna anna she was shaking now rivers of mysterious energy pouring through her her eyes came open suddenly and travis gazed into them it was a mistake in that moment she was not anna blaise she was not even a woman not human her skin felt dusty mothwing skin her eyes were huge undifferentiated pupils dilated beyond credibility he squeezed his eyelids together to shut out the vision but that only made it worse on some inner movie screen she was even more acutely visible he saw her still somehow anna stripped of fat until her bones shone like porcelain through parchment skin those huge eyes radiating blue fire rib cage palpitating fibrous veined wings like rice paper unfolding wetly behind her and she was watching him watching he thought of the carpenter ants at work in the rotting wood he thought of termites beetles night moths banging against window panes he stumbled back from the mattress revulsion searing through him she sat up suddenlynow human again at least superficiallyand stared at him travis travis im sorryi couldnt help it he could not speak he thought of biting into a ripe fruit and finding some foul decay inside he thought of stepping into a rotten log he thought could not restrain himself from thinkingof his mother vomiting blood into the stained farmhouse toilet bowl the wages he had thought then of sin of her riding to the doctor when she was almost too weak to survive the journey of the word cancer and of his fear of it as she declined toward death in her stinking bedroom and it seemed to him in that twisted and infinite moment that he had penetrated to the heart of things under female softness this burrowing nightmare under the veneer of life death and he threw open the door and ran gasping for the air and the clean river water knowing despite the way she pleaded from the doorway that he could not go back there could not go back in there no not ever again interlude bone finds work stick with us deacon had said and he repeated it in the days and nights that followed until it became a litany a kind of prayer bone listened bone nodded deacon and archie had fed him they had refrained from stealing his coat when they might have in thesekindnesses they had earned his loyalty the mountains were behind them the land now was flat often arid summerbaked the sky was as huge and tangibly present as the earth blue or arched with cloud here earth and sky met on equal terms the sound of the wind and of the trains seemed embedded always in an immensity of silence in each town they were differently received in one small grain town they were chased a good quarter mile by the yard bulls in another a brakeman attempted to shake them down for money they refused to pay and had spent the night hidden in a reefer car bone woke up one morning and found that the redball they were riding had drawn to a stop miles from any habitation because archie told him a band of indigent farmers had blocked a trestle to protest grain prices fearful of violence the three of them crept away from the freight and followed a dirt road at cross angles to the tracks they were in bad financial straits deacon had been bringing in oddments of food or coffee or bootleg liquor with his small cache of money but he had exhausted the bulk of that and gambled away the rest in a game of railyard craps two nights before thats all right deacon said jovially im to money like a sieve is to water its okay you rule money or money rules you im a free man by god yes i am we all are deacon archie and bone free men archie said that was fine but where would they get the withal to eat money comes deacon said even in bad times i remember in but bone just smiled vacantly and looked at the sky deacon remembered often and seldom to any purpose his talk faded in bones mind to a drowsy hum as pleasant and as significant as the droning of the insects the sky in this checkered land was powderblue cloudless and fathoms deep bone walked his thoughts extinguished the time passed now they were far down this road night was only a few hours away and bone was terribly hungry bone felt the calling in him a deep persistent summoning but he had discovered that he could ignore it for a time all these commonplace physical demands hunger and pain and the callingcould be suppressed for a time deacon pointed out the grain elevator on the horizon town ahead maybe there we get something to eat huh archie said despondently deacon shook his head doubt he said doubt and negativism what do you think archie said theyre gonna throw food at us multiply it maybelike the loaves and fishes youre not so fucking smart deacon said just shut up and follow me the command was too imperious to disobey archie followed deacon and bone followed them both it was a meager town there was a crossroads a feed wholesaler a post office next to a coalyard two side streets of clapboard houses and a scabrous grain elevator silent in the cascading sunlight the main street was virtually empty bone was thankful for that he disliked drawing attention to himself the consequences were so often dire and he had learned to avoid places like this had learned to avoid too places like the one deacon seemed to be leading them to which was the sheriffs officethe jail archie hung back im hungry he said but i dont know if im that hungry you cant tell deacon said some places like this they run you out of town some places put you up a night maybe even feed you ive been fed in jails as often as ive been beat in em quiet town like this not likely to want us on a vag charge not if we promise to move out in the morning bone only shrugged it made him nervous when deacon and archie argued the conflicts were difficult to grasp and the anger hung in the still air like a poison bone had been beaten in jails too jails frightened him but like archie he acquiesced when deacon set his mind to a thing he was as implacable as a force of nature inside the wooden building deacon spoke to the cop in charge a small man in a sad brown uniform we only want to spend the night deacon said he said it twice his voice strangely obsequious and cringing the small man considered them for a time and then nodded wearily and took them to a cell the cell was tiny empty two stacked beds and a wooden bench a postagestamp window looked out on the darkening sky bone stepped inside reluctantly fearing the confinement this was worse than a boxcar bone thought this was like riding the empty ice compartment on a refrigerator car sleeping on the wiremesh bottom and praying the hatchcover wouldnt fall shut the cop closed the cell door and turned to go bones head swam with claustrophobic fear deacon inquired in his cringing voice about food but the cop only looked at him shrugged turned away well deacon said its at least a place to sleep bone spent the night on the floor shivering the deep waters of sleep eluded him he floundered for what seemed an endless time in the shallows drawn back to awareness by his hunger or by the less specific imperatives of the calling he dozed until the rattle of the cell door brought him fully awake he opened his eyes then twisting his head out of a pillar of morning sunlight the cop stood there and a tall tanned man beside him the cop was frowning and impatient as deacon and archie stirred on their mattresses the other man betrayed no emotion bone sat with his eyes lidded wary waiting for deacon to say something but it was the cop who spoke first this is paul darcy the cop said owns a farm near here you want to work for him you get meals and a place to sleep if not you can clear out now deacon blinked down from the top bunk well that sounds fine he showed his yellowed teeth doesnt it archie bone archie said he guessed so bone nodded fractionally paul darcy nodded in return but did not smile darcy drove them in his rattling pickup truck to the farm a house and barn and silo a garden and a collection of outbuildings besieged by wheatfields they climbed down and darcy led them to a long low structure of twobyfours and barnboards with bunks and mattresses enough for ten men thisll be where you stay the farmer said and his voice bone thought was dry like an amplification of the rustling of the wheat as long as it suits you we cant pay you but we can feed you thats fine deacon said ill bring something out then bone sensed that the darcy man was taciturn but not actively hostile pleased if anything that they had come deacon and archie tested the mattresses and said they preferred them to the jail cell this was a fine place deacon said a damn fine place darcy and his wife brought the food steaming bowls of beef stew warm bread to sop up the gravy bone ate hastily from his lap watching mrs darcy she was of a piece with her husband silently benevolent her body not large but hardened by work she gazed at the three men thoughtfully the food was good and even bones hunger was satisfied for a time mrs darcy took the bowls and promised them a decent breakfast in the morning before work bone basked in the glow of his satiation deacon and archie were right of course this was a good place nevertheless he thought i cannot stay here here i am find me bone raised the objection that night their first night on the darcy farm deacon and archie were playing cards by the light of an oil lamp the two men sat on hay bales with a wooden crate between them bone lay on a cot with his knees against his chest i cant stay here he said finally the words hoarse and awkward in his mouth deacon played out his hand and lost cursing then he turned to bone whats this shit deacon i cant it comes back the sickness what sickness bone shrugged unhappily sick in the head deacon told him sick if you leave this place this is the best berth weve had he was silent a moment bugs dived about the lamp comfortable he said it has possibilities archie shuffled the cards shuffled them again just forget about leaving here deacon said we dont leave for a while yet bone retreated into the bunk he was not sure how long he could stay here a little longer maybe if deacon wanted it he closed his eyes against the glare of the lamp and listened to the mothflutter of the playing cards inside him the voice was more intense it was july and the wheat needed taking in bone had never been so close to wheat it was a new thing to him strange in its immensity one day in that long fatiguing first week paul darcy stood with him gazing at the wheat that filled the horizon wheat he said was like a child nine months of cultivation and this terrible laboring at the birth it wears you out darcy said the wheat was as high as bones waist the stalks of it stood up strangely the scaled wheatheads dangling at the top like insect husks the wheat was a golden color as if it had absorbed some quality of the sunlight and it spoke to itself in hushed whispers bone like deacon and archie had fallen quickly into the routine of the harvest they were up before dawn to eat mrs darcy serving up huge meals of griddle cakes and eggs then the work began in earnest the darcy farm had been in past years prosperous and darcy owned two gasolinepowered binders spidery machines striped blue and ivory beneath their skin of oil and dust the binders cut the harvest wheat at the ground and compressed the stalks into sheaves the sheaves were carried up a ramp to a canvas cradle and bound there into bundles on dry days both machines worked flawlessly but when the fields were wet the damp straw eeled into the gears until the gasoline engines screamed in protest several of darcys neighbors had joined in the harvest and bone pausing among these other men liked to watch the binders dance their slow gracile dance between the barn and the fallow ground the finished bundles were stacked as high as the barn roof next to the thresher which darcy called the groundhog a long and hideously noisy machine much less pleasant than the binders the purpose of the thresher was to separate the wheat from the straw and somewhere in its grinding mechanism of belts and pulleys this task was accomplished bone did not know how the thing was the groundhog had to be fed the straw bales needed to be pitched into the thresher this was a gargantuan task and could not be postponed and this year there were not the usual hired men because the darcys could not afford them bone and deacon and archie and the occasional neighbor did the pitching feeding the maw of the thresher each day as it roared and coughed out blue clouds of noxious smoke bone worked from breakfast until dusk pausing only for a huge noon meal of fried chicken mrs darcy would bring out wearily as depleted from her labors as the men from theirs and spread on a long pineboard trestle deacon and archie did their share but bone working at his own pace levering the big pitchfork silently until his hands were raw and his outsized wrists were trembling with exhaustion did what paul darcy said was the work of two menif not more darcy was so grateful that he took bone and archie and deacon into the farmhouse kitchen one evening and fed them at the family table there was chocolate cake that night to follow the fried chicken over coffee darcy asked each of them how they had come to be wandering the countryside deacon spoke of the work he had done in the chicago stockyards how he had been married once and had a childbut that broke up even before the crashand how riding the boxcars was not a new thing for him he had hopped his first freight when hed come back from the war he said and had ridden them periodically since now of course everybodys doing it he spoke cheerfully and at length but bone saw the way his eyes wandered about the darcys farmstead kitchen lingering thoughtfully on the wooden shelves the black belly of the coal stove the rifle suspended on ornate jhooks against one wall then it was archies turn archie spoke haltingly of a childhood in louisiana and his familys unsuccessful migration to new york before the hard times he had worked as a delivery driver cabbie salesman anything that you know brings in a little money never been married or any of that only myself to look out for then darcy turned to bone sweating under the concerted gaze of the farmer and his wife bone said haltingly that he kept to himself had pretty much always kept to himself had been riding the trains as long as he could remember but surely mrs darcy said there was something before that i mean nobodys born a trampare they paul darcy quickly hushed his wife meg its none of our business bone helped save the harvest thats what matters but i was bone protested i was born that way i was he thought about it that night sleepless in the bunk bed that was too short to contain his outstretched legs and too narrow to support him unless he lay on his side where had he come from everything had an origin he had learned that birds from eggs leaves from trees wheat from wheat spiraling back to an unimaginable infinity the only exception to this universal law apparently was bone himself birds from eggs he thought leaves from trees bone fromwhat drifting out of consciousness he dreamed of a place that was not like any place he had ever seen bright colors and shapes that made only dreamsense creatures of unbearable wholeness and purity adrift in a jeweled landscape no such place existed of course but the dream of it made him inexplicably sad he wanted to weep although he could not when he woke he felt soiled ugly inadequate he thought i am less than half of what i should beand felt the calling that sweet high voice inside him as achingly compulsive as the night cry of a train whistle more insistent now but quieter too now easily buried beneath the quotidian sounds of the machinery the farm animals the hot fartraveling wind by the end of that week they had finished the last of the threshing the grain was ready to be trucked to the elevator in town and offered up for what the farmer darcy said were foreclosure prices twentyfour cents a bushel the workload had eased and deacon and archie spent more time together playing cards after dark by lanternlight the sound of deacons voice as relentless and oddly comforting as the ticking of a clock deacon talked about the darcys more often and archie often was sullen and silent theyre childless deacon said and with the harvest over theres nobody within miles of here the opportunity is perfect no archie said what you have in mind thats courting the worst sort of danger in hard times deacon said sagely taking risks is the only way to get ahead you want to be a bindlestiff forever live out your life in some pasteboard hoovertown by god how else do people get rich if not by taking money from some other person its cruelof course its cruelbut its how the world operates and you cant argue with it you might as well argue with rocks or water but if we take the money archie began without real hope and deacon interrupted they have land they own this spread were not hurting them as much by taking it as we are hurting ourselves by leaving it darcy could not have made his harvest without usyou heard him say so we did the work and we deserve payment for it in a way it is our money bone listened with a pained incomprehension he did not understand about money the money came from the wheat somehow and the wheat was darcys wasnt it he guessed deacon knew what he was talking about but there was a bad feeling in the air the steely odor of archies fear and deacons imperious needs people have seen us archie said they know what we look like well get caught do they deacon said will we the sheriff who brought us over archie said the men darcy had in for the wheat harvest look at yourself look at me think about it we could be anybody any redball freight theres fifty guys who look just like us but bone they see bone exactly who was at the farm well there was two guyshoboesand this geek if they look for anybody it wont be for us bone understood that deacon was plotting a theft that the darcys would be the victims of it the idea disturbed him but he turned on his side and closed his eyes whatever was imminent it could not be helped he had parceled out his loyalty he could not retrieve it now but the darcys archie said patiently theyll know it wasnt bone who took the money that deacon said softly is another problem archie took him aside the next evening at sunset it had been a hot blue day the wind stirring dust in the stubbled fields the denuded earth was like scar tissue the binders had done all their work bone knew darcy had cleaned them and oiled them and stored them under tarps their sleek angles hidden for a season you have to understand about deacon archie said the kind of guy he is bone liked archie he was fascinated by archies wisp of beard and by the way he held deacons mirror for him now though archie was frowning and bone smelled the fear that had in recent days begun to cling to him they leaned against a rail fence archies eyes furtive in his small face i been with him a long time archie said hes a decent man many a time i wouldnt have eaten but for him full of plans full of schemes you know that bone said nothing but hes ambitious archie said ive seen it happen before its like shooting craps the same thing get him started and he wont be able to stop archies hands trembled bone perceived the fear that was bottled inside the smaller man the fear was infectious it was like a fog bone thought oily and clinging what he wants to do archie said it scares me im not stupid it wont end here i know that if it starts christ knows where itll stop you understand but the words came too fast bone looked at archie emptily the sun had gone behind the farmhouse shadows lengthened and darkened in a way archie said i think it started back in california back during that raid when you killed those farmers when you knocked down that scissorbill like i dont know some kind of crazy man throwing those big goddamn fists around you didnt see his eyes bone how they lit up like for the first time in all his life he saw some guy with a club or a uniform get kayoed for the first time understand it wasnt him on the ground it was the other guy and i think that made him a little crazy crazy with the wanting of it archie paused swiping the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand every time he looks at you thats what he sees its not my fault bone managed its in him deep in him you draw it out look at me bone said what do you see archie gazed at him bone felt the smaller mans confusion theres no harm in you archie relented almost tearful now i never said that but bone listen we have to stop him if we dont these people the darcys they wont just get robbed they might get something worse they might get hurtkilled maybei mean ive seen the way he looks at them the way he looks at this spread and hes working hard at hating em hating em for what they got hoarding up envy like sour bile inside him but the words fled comprehension there was only the fear clinging to archie like a bad smell bone wished there was something he could do but he could not control deacon deacon looks at me bone thought and what he sees is deacon deacon killing that scissorbill deacon with his big fists clenched and archie looks at me he thought and sees archiearchie trembling archie wanting to help archie helpless he might have said something might have tried to explain but the smaller mans fear crested like a wave over him and the words became dim and elusive frightened bone turned and fled to the barn that night in his bunk he dreamed again of the jeweled world and woke before the cocks crow shivering in the darkness the calling was plaintive in him and it blended somehow into the howl of a distant train so close now so close he could not delay any longer he stood next to deacon that morning soaping himself at the wooden trough bone washed clumsily his naked body was huge and strange sinews and joints oddly linked only approximately human deacon and archie had long since ceased to remark on it but this morning he was painfully aware of his own peculiarity he longed to know what he meant what he was and knew that the only answer was in the calling tonight he told deacon i leave tonight i cant stay any longer deacon ceased toweling his face and gave bone a long thoughtful look all right he said okay tonight it is the sky was livid with dawn by midmorning an overcast had moved in the gray clouds hung from horizon to horizon all through that day thinning but never breaking and when they were darkest a hard rain came down deacon archie and bone were confined to the hired mens quarters the gloom was so intense that their lantern did little to penetrate it bone was aware of the silence between archie and deacon the way they moved around each other like nervous cats there was no poker tonight no debate only the sound of the rain drumming on the sod roof archie stood up impulsively not long before darkness set in for the night he stretched shot a glance at deacon said this fuckin place and ducked through the door in the direction of the outhouse deacon seated on his bunk watched the other man go as soon as archie was hidden by the rain he stood up ill be out for a bit he told bone you stay here you hear me stay put deacon shut up bone recoiled from the force of deacons voice shut up deacon whispered fiercely and stay put and thats all i want to hear from you bone sat still deacon moved out into the rain as archie had but in a different direction toward the farmhouse bone was still waitinggazing at the rain his knees pulled up rocking in rhythm with the calling inside himwhen archie came back staring at deacons empty bunk son of a bitch he said and turned almost tearfully to bone where is he oh christ did he go out did he go there bone pointed toward the farmhousea dark shape in the rain through the door archie staggered as if from a physical blow he looked suddenly small bone thought small and old his grief was like a dark aura oh christ bone come on come with me we gotta stop him stop him before its too late the demand was so heartfelt that bone did not question it he ran behind archie into the rain he was cold and wet instantly water slicking his stubble hair running past the collar of his pea coat into his torn checked shirt and down the knobs of his spine they reached the farmhouse and bone pressed up against a kitchen window condensation frosted the glass he could not see inside but one wet pane gave him back his own reflection sunkeneyed pale and huge the kitchen was dark archie shouted bone bone the doors locked knock it down for gods sake hes inside there bone but then a light flashed twice in the darkness the noise of it ringing painfully in bones eardrums it was darcys big shotgun bone guessed the one that had hung on the wall and in the eerie silence that followed there was only the drumming of the rain the rattle of a fallen copper kettle from the kitchen and the wail of archies weeping digging the hole bone thought about death the darkness was absolute though the rain had tapered to a drizzle he worked methodically with the darcys broadbladed shovel fighting the wet ground and the mulch that littered the wheatfield turning up the rich dark soil the night wind on his wet clothes made him tremble and bone gritted his teeth and drove the shovel savagely into the resistant earth he smelled of his work death was not such a bad thing bone thought he had wondered at times if it was not in fact death that was calling him whether that elusive sweetness might not be the sweetness of release from this misshapen body in some way it might be but he had been offered death many times and had never accepted the body resisted there was an incompleteness about it too he had seen death often enough among the railway tramps and it was not attractive there was a kind of shamefulness about a human body after death bone thought the limpness like a childs costly doll too casually discarded to bone the dead always seemed insulted subject to indignities and passively sullen bone had made the hole shallow but wide it looked less like a grave than like some kind of crater broadly dishshaped now filling with black water bone guessed it was good enough and when he stood up and turned toward the farmhouse he saw the halo of archies lantern bobbing toward him across the denuded wheatfield archie had stopped weeping but his face was set in a rictus of grief his eyes heavylidded and bruisedlooking itll do archie said he looked at bone come help me they moved back through the darkness to the darcy farmhouse a single kitchen lantern was burning and bone navigated through a gloom of shadows here archie said tonelessly he put his hands under paul darcys shoulders bone took the feet spreading the legs until he was able to grasp the body under the knees this was death all right always the same bone thought that ragdoll pout as if the farmer were holding his breath to protest the injustice of it bone looked without curiosity at the broad red stain across darcys midsection they lifted up the body and carried it into the wheatfield to the hole bone had gouged there the body looked up at them from the hole archie breathing in gasps poured a spadeful of earth over darcys face as if he could not bear that silent recrimination there was something prudish in the gesture and archie straightened hastily shaking his head one more he said this one was more difficult even for bone the darcy woman lay at the opposite end of the kitchen spreadeagled next to the iron stove the stove deacon had called a puffin belly and though her wound was similar to her husbands the expression on her face was even more reproachful maybe the indignity was worse for a woman this nasty business of lifting and burying by the time they reached the grave archie was weeping again a dry weeping that seemed to come from deep inside the cavity of his chest mrs darcy lay in the shallow hole in her yellow print dress and bone saw that the rain had made her expression quizzical as if she were surprised to be here staring so fixedly up at the night bone suppressed an urge to apologize bury em archie said he wiped his hands on his pants bury em fast as you can bone drove his shovel into the dirt pile chuff it was easier work than the digging had been now the bunkroom was full of light deacon was there filling up his kitbag and archies with oddments from the darcy household forks spoons canned food he did not look cheerful exactly bone thought but there was a feverish redness to his cheeks a wildness in his eyes a nights work he was saying all in a fucking nights work right archie all in a nights workright for christs sake archie pleaded shut up about it bone stood in the doorway waiting we move out tonight deacon said find us a train moving out bone find us a train out of here bone nodded it was all he had really wanted he gazed at deacon hefting his kitbag and wondered for the first time whether these men were really his friends whether the killing of the darcys had been as deacon insisted necessary deacon feeding him in california deacon offering him a smoke that deacon had smelled trustworthy and bone had invested his trust accordingly this deaconliterally twitching with nervous energy his eyes wild with lantern lightsmelled very different there was an air about him of cordite and revenge he had killed he had killed with calculation and without mercy he could do so again deacon motioned to bone and the two of them stepped outside for a moment this is just between us deacon said hooking his arm over bones stooped shoulder not that i dont trust archie dont get me wrong hes my buddy but hes a little wild right nowyou understand i got something i want you to hold onto for me and maybe dont let archie know you got it understand bone shrugged good deacon said hastily great and he pushed something into the deep pocket of bones blue navy pea coat archie deacon yelled time to move out we want to get down the road before sunup lingering behind them on the wet road away from the farmhouse bone waited until there was a little dawn light and then reached into his pocket and pulled out what deacon had put there it was a damp wad of bills prosaic in his huge calloused hand bone slid the money back into his pocket the calling was louder now and he listened carefully for the sound of a train chapter eight nancy located travis on the first chill day of the autumn seasons in haute montagne always followed the calendar springs were a haste of melting and blossoming summers declared themselves boldly autumns hurried toward winters and winters came down like guillotine blades she was accustomed to it the prairie incising the sky on all horizons gave up these clinical seasons but now for the first time nancy was seriously worried the adventure was not an adventure any longer she had lost travis and anna would not tell her why the cool air and the shedding of the bur oaks seemed full of portents she watched the burack house for a time for a time she waited with anna at the switchmans hut travis did not come to either place if he had not left haute montagne altogether she thought there was only one place he might be she put on a heavy cloth coat and took a hunting knife from the attic chest where the relics of her fathers life were stored she attached the knife to her belt and slipped away from the house it was an overcast saturday and her mother was off at a baptist womens meeting fallen leaves pursued her until she was beyond the town and then there was only the dry prairie grass she followed the southern bank of the fresnel toward the railway trestle she was frightened though she tried not to admit it to herself all her life she had heard stories about railway tramps that they left encoded marks on peoples doors that they stole babies that they would kill you for the money in your pocket sometimes especially these latter years she had seen such men come into town looking for work they had seemed less threatening than sad wornout eroded they wore helplessness about them like a suit of clothes the church would occasionally feed them though nancys mother disapproved it only encourages them and the smell sad but nancy did not doubt that they could be dangerous too how could such despair not breed anger she moved through the empty meadows toward the scabrous iron trestle burdocks clinging to her skirt when she saw a faint line of smoke rising up she reached inside her coat and closed her fingers on the reassuring whalebone handle of the knife it was not a big hobo jungle haute montagne was too far from the big cities too insignificant a stopover and too chary a society for that but there were men who lived here at least briefly she saw two huts made of tar paper tin and old twobyfours in the darkness under the trestle a tiny fire burned fitfully a few men lay strewn on the ground like sacks of trash asleep their limbs at random angles the sound of the river running came back in echoes from the arch of the railway bridge she moved as far into that shadowy place as she dared travis her voice too echoed back she thought he is not here but then a shadow stirred in the dark pebbly corner where the trestle met the bank and travis stepped forth she was relieved that he was not like these other men some of whom had risen up to stare blankly at her he was still better groomed better dressed he looked only down on his luck not broken it seemed inconceivable that he could have been living like this for days nancy thought almost a week since she had left him alone at the switchmans shack you shouldnt have come here he said he had lost weight he stood before her like a pillar of stone i need help his eyes avoided her and she added you left me not you anna you mean anna lets not talk here she followed him up the grade of the riverbank up to the place where the trestle leaped across the water travis sat on a concrete abutment gazing wearily off at the horizon travis she said making herself brave i know theres something wrong i asked anna about it she wouldnt explain but she says it was a mistakeyou saw something you shouldnt have seen you werent ready she licked her lips it was a mistake travis please come back he was a long time answering the wind was brisk and nancy hugged her coat around herself maybe its true he said slowly what aunt liza believes about anna shes not human for the first time he looked at her you understand that no how could she not be human she youve been with her you know well of course there was so much she didnt understand obviously what was happening was not normal normal people didnt need to be sequestered in ruined buildings for months at a time butnot human how could that be traviss fists were clenched i gave it up for her he said i had it in my hand a life an ordinary life she seduced me out of it shes lost travis i talked to her about it shes just lost is all i dont know where shes lost from or how she plans to get back but lost is lost this town wont help we have to she reached for his hand but he drew it away and the gesture was so quick and so instinctive that it shocked her dont he said my god its me its me isnt it its something i did travis shook his head no his eyes however were blank i trusted you he turned back toward the bridge travis travis fisher you son of a bitch i trusted you the wind tore at her he watched from the bridge as nancy stalked away through the prairie grass part of him wanted to follow her to apologize but he could not forget what had happened in the switchmans shack the thing anna had become the experience defied comprehension he knew only that it was real and that the annathing was not human and that she had seduced him into betraying any hope he might have had of a future here in haute montagne to the west workmen were erecting a tent for the traveling revival a clanking and the cry of muted voices came across the prairie the tent revivals always came to haute montagne in the autumn nancy had said it was a signal of impending winter as unmistakable as the racing of the dark clouds across the sky there was nothing left for him but to move on to move on the way these other men did riding the boxcars and the flatcars racing the snow looking for work travis had resigned himself to it but not yet he thought though he could not explain even to himself why he felt that way not just yet he would stay here a while off west the fluttering banners of the tent revival rose on their guy wires to the gray sky he thought there is unfinished business here chapter nine creath burack dressing for the tent revival regarded himself in the bathroom mirror and thought she is gone the mirror was cracked where travis fisher had broken it in their scuffle weeks had passed but creath had not been able to summon the energy to make repairs a sliver of glass stilettoshaped had fallen away from the backing a black fissure divided his reflection she was gone he could not erase that single terrible thought from his mind it should not matter he had told himself so if anything things had improved liza was bustling in the bedroom singing to herself and when had he last heard her sing a year ago two three and he knewit was impossible not to knowthat it was annas absence that had lifted the cloud from her that was goodwasnt it but he thought she is gone sweating he moved the shaving brush in its cup and methodically lathered his jaw well he told himself firmly it doesnt matter none of it matters not anna blaise and not his humiliation at the hands of travis fisher flesh is flesh he thought she was a woman she was gone it happened but in some strange way it was not the sex he missed pausing his eyes on his own eyes in the broken mirror he allowed himself to remember with her everything had been different there was a sweetness in her creath thought remembering the touch of her body impossibly smooth against his own it had made him cry out against his will sobbing with the sweetness of it it was a pleasure that cut deep that stirred him in secret places and made him aware of all the things he had lost not just the failing of the ice business or the disappointments of his marriage but a broader loss in her arms he felt too keenly the narrowing of life itself you start out creath thought you are a river in full flood but life meets you with its dams and deadfalls and all its interminable arid places you lose speed depth urgency desire you become a trickle in a desert he had been borrowing against the wellspring of her he realized now stealing back a facsimile of his youth reveling in those clumsy bedroom moments in all the things he might have been and wasnt now there was nothing left in him but the loss only that painful awareness he loved her he hated her hebut it was a thought he suppressed grinding his teeth together god forgive him he wanted her back liza tapped at the door dont want to be late she called out he had allowed liza to talk him into driving her to the tent revival there was not the strength in him to resist her anymore and in truth he was not strongly opposed to the idea these last few weeks memories had seemed to shake loose like autumn leaves inside him and one memory that came often was of the revivals he had ridden to as a child in his fathers horsedrawn wagon excited at first by the bustle of it and then in the hot cavern of the tent caught up in some itinerant preachers evocation of the afterlife intoxicated by the choral voices until he imagined he could see that golden city glittering in front of him until it shone in his dreams benevolent and full of solace but the solace like the dreams faded and then there had been only real life grindingly ordinary powerful and familiar the dreams were a cheat and he had taught himself to despise them now in some essential way alone he longed for that consolation in a minute creath called through the door im shaving ill wait in the truck liza said he made his mind blank shaved himself thoroughly and rinsed his face and then turned away from the fractured mirror with an unspeakable sense of relief they parked in the meadow and walked to the tent at dusk liza beaming and nodding hellos tent revivals always made her think of heaven everything was just the way she imagined heaven would be the glad greetings the tremor of excitement the sweet voices raised in song lantern light suffused the high spaces of the tent and the mingled smell of canvas and naphtha rose up like incense she arranged herself on a bench with creath beside her in his redchecked coat she was still astonished that he had agreed to come ordinarily he displayed a vulgar disdain for spiritual matters he was religious she had observed only among the rotarians and that only perfunctorily the christthebusinessman school of doctrine and even that had lapsed with the demoralization of the ice business for years liza had tried to lead him into something deeper but until now she had not succeeded but maybe his presence here was not so shocking since the fight with travis and the departure of anna blaise he had been in many ways a new man slower she thought yes as if he had lost his sense of direction but slower to anger too and more humble the anger was still there of course buried in his sullen silences but with the anger a confusion an uncertainty she was shed of anna blaise and was shed as well though this was not a christian thought of her sisters boy and now creath was with her at a tent revival now she thought why now anything is possible the song leader conducted them through the old rugged cross leaning on the beats so that the music swayed with a ponderous grace like a sailing ship moving in a gentle swell liza singing seemed to rise and spread out creath only mumbled the verses dutiful and uncertain but liza rang them out clear and high each word a tolling bell two benches ahead faye wilcox turned and cast a furtive glance backward liza pretended to ignore her stretching out an amen sonorously faye looked distracted she thought even disheveled not to mention jealous but that was logical the baptist womens executive committee was holding its elections next week and for the first time in years liza had been nominated for the post of chairwoman the nomination had been seconded she had already begun preparing a speech she was a new woman her life had begun again the other candidate was faye wilcox liza sat with her arm entwined with creaths the music faded briefly the only sound was the autumn wind whipping the canvas suspensions then the preacher entered a tall somber hawkfaced man bent aggressively at the waist he gazed at the crowd a bible poised in the crook of his left arm rimless eyeglasses glittering in the lantern light his theme the paper handouts said was what have you done for jesus latelyand when he spoke his words lashed out like lightning liza let the sermon flow over her what mattered she thought was not the sense of the words but the sound of them that diving and leaping of aimed syllables arrows of god it was the way when she was a child she had perceived her fathers gruff commands incomprehensible but so authoritative the thunder of wisdom she closed her eyes she lost track of time over the course of the sermon the larger cadences of it were like breaking waves sin and redemption heaven and hell echoed in the sighs and moans of the congregation stirring at last surfeited she glanced at creath expecting to see the animal passivity that had so marked him these recent days instead he was sweating though the tent was still autumncool his lip and forehead were covered with bright pinpricks of moisture his eyes were large liza felt a stirring of alarm was he ill the doctor had said something about blood pressure but there was an unmistakable attentiveness about him too he was listening he leaned forward on the bench intercepting the words with his body it was the call to salvation the sermon burning itself out in a fiery rush so many of you are enslaved the preacher shouted enslaved to drink enslaved to lust enslaved to every sin imaginable to man she saw creath mumble yesand then watched stunned as he stood and ambled bearlike down the crowded aisle the revival emptied out soon after the crowd streaming away into the autumn night those with cars had parked in the big meadow behind the train station liza instructed creath to meet her at the truck and hurried ahead she did not want faye wilcox to get away unbloodied faye the wilcox woman turned her face constricted and flushed in the torchlight she held her handbag in a twofisted grip her knuckles were white liza she said it was all so fine liza said dont you think yes the choir the singing yes the sermon yes it was fine creath was very moved i saw him liza well you must have but what about nancy the killing blow is she ill one hears such terrible storiesnot that i give them any credence but the wilcox woman only turned and stalked away liza felt a perverse flourish of pleasure let her go she thought it doesnt matter let her go anything is possible liza thought blissfully the switchmans shack was a good quarter mile away but if she listened closely nancy could make out the murmur of voices from the tent revival she reached for the door and the beat of her pulse drowned out the singing you came anna blaise said nancy sighed the sound of it closed up in the darkness of the shack traviss words echoed through her mind not human it made no sense though there was yes that indefinable quality about her a kind of ethereal lightness a notthereness and that quality had grown more intense over the last week she was paler than ever a strong light nancy thought might shine right through her it wasnt easy getting away your mother theres a tent revival in town you know about tent revivals ive heard her eyes nancy thought the stillness and wideness of them i dont know how much longer i can keep this up she wanted me to go with her it was important to her if i dont go it makes her look bad she begged and threatened she could hurt you not physically not anymore i guess she could kick me out of the house mightif it comes to that anna said her voice softly musical in the darkness of the shack im sorry to have brought this on you i would have gone with her tonight but you said it was important it is the silence stretched out nancy said i saw travis too im sorry about travis he asked for an explanation i couldnt give him one i know he said she licked her lips he said you werent human nancy yes im not the shack was very dark indeed only a faint beam of moonlight played through the gaps in the wallboards from far away nancy heard the sweet massed voices of the revival choir she said carefully i dont understand fear had uncoiled like a spring inside her travis saw too much too soon he didnt understand either but now you must ill need your help tonight i dont know what you mean shh the voice was soothing now motherly nancys heart beat in her chest but she stayed she did not run anna explained it was like listening to a bedtime story i am she said her voice cadenced and singing a long long way from home after dark travis worked his way along the riverbank to the switchmans shack he was not sure what had brought him a restlessness an unease a need to once more seelike the tongues need to probe an aching tooth the night was cold and the stars arched overhead in a cruelly vacant sky she is a witch a monster not human he thought of creath sneaking up the stairs seduced by her femaleness she was that debased thing his mother had become he thought tainted by her sex but worse a hundred times worse mama ill protect you said the sixyearold in him his head had become a cacophony of voices but this one does not need protection travis thought the door of the shack gaped open then and travis hid himself among the fragile ruins of the summers pussy willows two figures in the moonlight he recognized nancy at once the shape leaning against her could only be anna but an anna changed luminous with faint blue fire which was strange enough but changed in other ways too her bones more defined within that frail body her eyes very wide her arms elongated it was true then what he had seen a week ago was not an hallucination she was changing she was not human but surely nancy must be able to see that they were squatting at the riverside now nancy sponging the annathings forehead with river water and where the water touched her skin the feverish blue light seemed to fade far off there was the sound of motors revving as the tent revival ended changing travis thought though not precisely the way he had expected he squinted at the faint figure of anna at the riverbank and ancient fears rose up in him if this goes on he thought dazedly then soon soon there would be nothing left of anna blaise at all chapter ten nancy was not sure precisely when or how the fear had descended on the town she knew only that it had come the courier was full of frightening headlines doors were more often locked she was apt to be scrutinized when she was out after dark the depression had deepened in idaho the farmers had set up blockades dairy farmers had spilled their milk into the road rather than sell it for two cents a gallon in washington the bonus expeditionary force had been routed by the army a murderous contagion was abroad in the land and haute montagne was sealing its borders she had never felt more alone this is what it means travis had told her and it seemed like infinities ago this is what it means to be a misfit nancy lay on the rosette bedspread in her room her mother kept the small house meticulously neat they were not rich but her mothers job at the bakery was much envied and she earned enough to keep them until recently too there had been nancys salary from the times square but that was gone mr oneill had not forgiven her for walking out before the dinner rush nor had her mother forgiven her for losing the job it meant a degree of hardship nancy had some money saved back listless she felt under the mattress for the pastille can she kept there and when she found it she thumbed it open the last of her own cash a little over seven dollars saved for a rainy day well surely that day had come in fact it was raining a lackluster rain sliding down the fogged windows she hated to go out but she had to anna needed food this thing anna had said was going to happen nancy thoughti just wish it would now regardless of the consequences she was tired when she went downstairs her mother was in the parlor upright in a canebacked chair with her feet flat on the carpet surely to god faye wilcox said dully you cannot be going out now have to mama need i ask where or why nancy said i thought you had a meeting damn the meeting her mother said and nancy was shocked faye wilcox did not curse not ever cursing she had told nancy was of the devil it occurred to her that maybe she was now the more religious of the two of them in some strange way at least she prayed more often clipped furtive practical prayers please god let me get through this she believed in anna blaise and was that not in itself a kind of religious faith mama dont make yourself late there is nothing for me there not anymore she focused a sullen look on nancy youve seen to that mama dont dont tell me what to do do i tell you what to do i dont want to argue i try god knows but you have wandered so far is it that fisher boy they say hes living like filth at the edge of town is that where youre goingto wallow in his filth or have you gone back to greg morrow that foulmouthed trash a girl is known by the company she keeps lie down with pigs and rise up with pigs if martin were here i wish he was nancy said why so that he could see what youve made of yourself my god are you proud of it in truth she remembered her father only dimly a childs memories the smell of pipe tobacco and the rattle of newspapers but he had been good and kind and he had understood when nancy recoiled from her mothers absolutism he had been somebody to go to when she needed to be consoled she had been almost ten years old the last time she saw him i thank the lord sometimes nancys mother said that he is not alive to see this mama stop it you know hes not dead i know no such thing her mother rose up from her straightbacked chair she had lost weight these last weeks though she was still immense her skin hung in flaccid pockets he died of course he died why else why else would he why else would he leave me she meant but in fact he had not died nancy remembered too well the arguments her mothers petulant impatience with his drinking his job his language how he had broken at last on the reef of her righteousness she remembered him saying a secret goodbye to her hugging her and saying he loved her nancy girl this town is too small to contain me the trains had carried him off she had been tearstricken but proud this town yes this highcollared and corsetted town which had previously seemed so huge to her why yes of course no such town could hold him she should have known heart and soul he was too big for it the memory always brought back the tears she blinked and said all right mama hes dead all right i know you have to go out yes i shall pray for you yes mama the money was running out quickly she stopped by the bakery and calculated whether she ought to buy a loaf of bread to go with the canned goods and the paraffin anna did not seem to mind the cold fortunately since the switchmans shack afforded scant protection from it when it rained the roof leaked in three places susan farris was behind the counter at the bakery nancy stood at the door uncertain susan had been a year ahead of her in high school and it was susan who had systematically barred her from the company of the popular girls susans hatred for her had been in some way instinctive seemed to spring from nowhere though it did not help perhaps that susan had already been employed parttime at the bakery under the supervision of faye wilcox nancy did not imagine that her mother was a particularly kind or forgiving employer she turned on her heel but susan had caught sight of her and hailed her back well nancy her lilting voice concealed a knifeedge of sarcasm susans eyes were very blue her hair blond her broad scandinavian mouth scarlet with tangee lipstick you want something today loaf of bread nancy said the dayold come down to bakery bread are we i thought your mother did her own we ran short mechanically susan loaded a crusty loaf into a paper bag and rang up the sale on the thick black keys of the cash register nancy tendered a dollar bill from her pastille can and took the change from susans perfectly manicured hand she examined the clutch of coins im short a dime she said susan turned back to her squinting whats that the change you owe me a dime you gave me i gave you change from a dollar nancy dear no more no less i counted wearily nancy extended her hand count again you must have but susan knocked her hand away the change spilled out over the peeling tiles of the bakery floor a tarnished quarter ran under the display case nancy dived after it goddamn you susan farris curse me all you want susan said loftily i would be ashamed if i were you ashamed you think nobody knows what youre doing with this food you buy its no secret greg morrow told me nancy stood up slowly what did greg morrow tell you susan smiled thats for me to know and this is not a game she was shouting but she could not restrain herself she had passed some critical border into a new and strange country its important susans smile evaporated well all right dont wake up mr lawrence please you want to know what greg morrow told me only the truth nancy dear that you are still carrying on with that farmboy travis fisher that hes living like a tramp with the other tramps under the railway bridge and that you bring him food and that you and himout there in the mud and the coldthat you you nancy nodded curtly all right no need to force that obscenity past susans sensitive lips it was a lie but not a particularly invidious one the lie concealed after all a far stranger and less comprehensible truth nancy tucked her inadequate coinage back into the tin pastille box she thought of what anna blaise had told her a different place connected to here but not here we have always been among you and she suppressed a surge of hysterical laughter anyway susan went on i did not shortchange you adding in a paroxysm of petulance it was only a lousy dime nancy took her bread and went to the door the rain was coming down harder than ever she tucked the paper bag under her coat a phrase of her fathers reverberated in her mind she could not recall when he had said it perhaps he had not perhaps it was a false memory but she could hear his voice quite clearly inside her dont love anything too much theyll take it away from you but only if they know nancy thought only if they know hooded and sopping she trudged north along the spur it had occurred to her to wonder why she was doing this whether she might be mad to pursue so singlemindedly so strange a thing she passed a newspaper box and the headline in the courier leaped out at her hobo killer strikes again there were dangers involved yes tim norbloom passed her in one of the towns two police cars a block ahead he slowed and when she was abreast of the car he paced her a while nancy counted out forty steps and then stood quite still teeth clenched staring through the rainblurred window defying him norbloom gazed back at her impassivelywarm and dry inside thereand then stepped on the gas she understood a pattern was emerging the courier susan farris the police even her mother all knitted together they were the conestoga wagons circling and nancy had been elected indian abruptly the sidewalk under her feet was cold foreign the storefronts were drab beneath their awnings the rainwater sang in a minor key in the sewer gratings understanding stabbed like a knife she thought j dont live here anymore at pm helena baxter the acting chairwoman called to order the meeting of the baptist women of haute montagne this was unorthodox but faye wilcox who should have held the chair was unconscionably lateeven though it was speech day liza burack permitted herself a brief smile that lingered throughout the reading of the minutes and the tabling of the unfinished business the church meeting hall was crowded though not uncommonly so for speech day liza had been given a chair on the platform behind the podium and she was able to see the faces of the members there were twentyfive or thirty women altogether not a startling number significant she thought only when you assigned them names haute montagne was she had heard creath use the phrase a good plain town and it was ruled by good plain people the baptist church was a good plain church too and friendly with the methodists and the episcopalians though it was generally acknowledged that the baptists were a littlewell plainer it was a small elite of businessmen who controlled the town a city council that constituted also in large part the executive committee of the rotarians there was jacob bingham who owned the hardware store bob clawson the highschool principal tim norbloom of the police department a handful of lawyers it had been a clique all but closed to liza and to creath especially since the ice business had fallen on hard times and creaths surliness had presented a problem but now creath was back on track though strangely subdued she envisioned him pursuing a deaconship which would better his connections and there were the baptist women that significant congregation of wives phil mcdonnels wife bob clawsons wife tim norblooms wife every important wife in fact who had not been sequestered by the methodists or the episcopalians all here today all staring up at the podium it would be difficult liza thought but here was an important nexus of power if she and creath were to climb back to respectability they would have to begin here faye wilcox did enter at last toward the end of the business meeting head bowed she unfolded a chair at the back helena baxter offered to give over the podium but faye only shook her head no poor faye she had neglected to wear a belt liza observed her dress depended from her immense bosom like a sultans tent the business meeting ended helena baxter somewhat dauntedshe was a faye wilcox partisanannounced the candidates speeches the assembly applauded faye wilcox as incumbent was scheduled to speak first she trudged to the podium with a visible weariness and there were whispers of dismay liza herself felt a surge of sympathy dear lord this was how she must have looked those long years when her husbands indiscretions had sapped so much of her strength and attention depleted well she thought sympathy is all right but it was only the natural order of things that was being restored faye after all was the usurper here was her comeuppance her speech was brief and mechanical she read it from typed pages of hammermill bond woman helpmate in troubled times it called for a return to traditional virtues the speech was a morass of pieties without much life or enthusiasm in it liza thought and when faye climbed down from the platform the applause was scattered and contained helena baxter frowning now introduced liza liza took up the recipe cards on which she had written her speech cues and assumed the podium there was the sound of rain washing down the high mullioned windows the musty smell of leatherbound hymnals stored in the next room how long since she had done this the thought of it made her a little afraid she had chosen a stark theme haute montagne must awaken from its long sleep she cleared her throat difficult times she said are upon us she let the words simmer a moment in the dusty air of the church there is no doubt about it every woman in haute montagne must surely be aware of it a glance at the headlines is enough hard times murders rebellion immorality of an indescribable nature and we are not safe from it we must not think we are but the question is what can we as women do she was surprised at how easy it was she ignored the cards the words came fluently all this had been pent up inside her stifled in a misplaced propriety she had lived too long in her glass house now she alluded freely to the past i have seen the effects of loose morality as many of you know on my own sisters child blood of my blood acknowledging and dismissing it travis is gone away and i have seen too the power of spiritual revival thinking of creath at the altar creath born again and she alluded similarlydelicatelyto nancy wilcox our own sons our own daughters the emphasis hardly more than a caress are not immune to the spirit of the times and it was enough yes heads nodded faye sat pale and unblinking at the back of the hall how simple it all was really she finished with her last and boldest proposal that the baptist women of haute montagne should petition the city council to impose a twilight curfew for the protection of our young people it went over well she saw mary lee baxter and beth mcdonnel conferring nodding faye wilcox she saw had further embarrassed herself by skulking out of the hall she sat down once more at the rear of the podium and the applause astonishingly went on and on liza acknowledged it with a smile helena baxter approached her after the meeting i must say liza it was a very dynamic speech i think everyone was impressed thank you i want you to know you have my support when it comes down to voting really but i thoughtyouve been so close to faye the times are changing though arent they you said as much yourself hard measures for hard times ive never had such a sense that we could well influence things possibly so liza thought possibly so and a strange and disturbing thought formed in her mind they believe me because they are afraid their fear had become lizas ally anna was very sick nancy had doubled back along the railway tracks to make sure she was not being followed the rain dripped through the box elders and enshrouded her as she trudged across the muddy fields to the switchmans shack how pathetic and inadequate it looked she thought huddled against itself in the rain like a cold wet animal the packed earth floor inside was dark and wet the air was thick with the odor of mildew and rotting wood anna lay curled on a blanket her clothes were wrinkled and old her hair was tangled though nancy sometimes tried to comb it out she was asleep nancy saw shuddering in her sleep like a dog nancy touched her gently and a feeling of the womans strangeness faint but distinct flowed up her arm annas eyes opened and the irises were a profound blue the color of the sky reflected in a clear still pond i brought food nancy said hoarse with the wetness in the air the rain had found its way into the loaf of bakery bread and she laid that out on a handkerchief there were canned goods too and she had left the porcelain bowl outside to fill with rainwater thank you anna said she sat up her body was emaciated she was pale and cold she looked at nancy youve been crying no a little maybe its hard for you the commiseration was unnecessary nancy shrugged it off anna pleasehow much longer she closed her eyes a moment looking inward nancy thought a week she said two weeks i cannot guarantee it nancy sighed you need help anna said yes she gazed at the nothuman woman i need travis anna said nothing you think im crazy no hardly that anna arranged the food in front of herher fingers long and chinawhite but still with that delicacy of motion nancy thought of as aristocratic travis is simplydifficult you selected him you chose him yes he could have understood he is still capable of it and i think the best part of him wants to help but there is a darker side to him too and it is very dark and unpleasant indeed when he saw me in the change that part of him was stimulatedits fears and denials now it controls him she tore a piece of bread from the loaf old bad pain in him but if you can touch himinside should i force him to come the annathing smiled if i could maybe i would i cant you do make people help you even creath burack that time he picked you up its a kind of camouflage nothing more or less than that as significant as a chameleons ability to change its color a reflex creath burack gave me shelter because he saw in me some unclaimed part of himselfa dream he had never allowed himself to acknowledge still nancy said it was deceitful not entirely i paid for what he gave me we do nancy thought we do that she said firmly i need travis you went to him once ill go again anna shrugged nancy said it is not futile therell be a price anna said a payment he is at least as lost as i am nancy said softly i know the railway trestle offered scant protection from the rain everything here was wet the air was wet the swollen river roared against its banks birds had nested in the high iron spans of the bridge nancy found him in the humid arch of stone where the iron struts were rooted travis sat there one knee cocked and a cloth cap pulled down low over his eyes the structure of the trestle made this a kind of cave it was wet but relatively private she said youre still here nowhere to go he said watching her except away from the weather ill do that soon she nodded and wondered how to begin but he said nancywhat you want from mei cant its the town the words rushed out of her if she stopped she thought she might cry its the town travis the town is what worries me you dont know how it is theyre all so scared not just bad times but people are afraid of all the murders going on and more than that theres no trust they suspect me a police car followed me all along the spurjust todaya police car if this goes on she shrugged miserably her coat heavy on her shoulders her hair wet and matted on her back im worried about somebody finding anna or else i wont be able to help her and shell die out there in the cold travis was staring at the muddy ground a constellation of broken glass she wanted to shake him travis you understand shell die you know what she is it was not a question she said does that matter anymore matter well what do you think she is a witch a demon some tentrevival devil that was unwise he recoiled from her you touched her nance maybe shes not humanwhatever that means all right but it doesnt mean shes bad or dangerous you dont understand he was frowning lost in reminiscence she was so goddamn beautiful not just that either fragile helpless she made me want toto me nancy said breaking under the strain of it crying a little now help me travis i dont care what you think about her help me he sat that same way one leg crooked while the rain fell in sheets across the broad boiling water of the river he had not stopped frowning i guess now you know what its like its no fun after a time he said i might help nancy huddled in her coat on one condition there will be a price a payment well but wasnt there always it was too much to expect she thought that he would help her for some sentimental reason obviously he did not love her anymore all this ordeal had knocked the love right out of him and out of me she thought confessing it to herself out of me too she said bleakly what condition tell me he touched her his hand hot on her tell me what she is after a moment she nodded yes chapter eleven nancy told it the best way she could shivering in the damp she wished she could be anna could communicate these truths with that same reassuring candor but she was only herself she did not look at traviss eyes the fear and the cynicism there were too frightening her voice was quavery and small in the silence anna she said carefully was from another time and place another world very far away in one sense but in another very near a world that was very ancient but that had always had a tenuous connection with this one and she closed her eyes and the words echoed in her memory the passage between is freer for us anna had said her eyes wide and her emaciated body very still though it can work the other way too there is the ancient human tradition of the visionquest the spiritwalk the greeks at eleusis the american indians in the wilderness the stylites on their pillars they all want the same thing to seeif only for a moment a glimpse of the jeweled world and nancy listening had felt a curious kind of recognition intuitive as if she had seen that place too as if it had been vouchsafed to her in some longforgotten dream a shining antipodes she saw it in the darkness a landscape of perfect shapes faerie she said breathlessly the land under the hill in a way but a real place too substantial the laws of nature function differently there i think but they do function and as remorselessly as here a place not a land of abstractions she sighed a papery sound when we crossand we have our own visionquests our own spiritwalksweve been called by other names demon succubus changeling but youre not that it depends anna said her smile sphinxlike on who you ask nancy struggled to shape her thoughts but i mean in spite of everything it doesnt seem as if i mean you know history and you speak english and you have a name all that anna said was a kind of camouflage when shed entered this world she had put on humanity like a suit of clothes but a real humanity flesh and blood and psyche there was a physical change creath burack had found her newly minted days old lost but with a functioning human body and a store of human knowledge all the teeming voices of humanity are there to delve and borrow you read minds in a sense the minds beneath minds i cant read your thoughts if thats what you mean you invented anna blaise in a way i made her out of parts but i am anna blaise anna blaise is a translation of myself there was creath and grant bevis and travis fisher understand anna said she touched nancys forehead and again there was that quaver of strangeness in here youall of youare many things at once male and female adult and child paradoxes upon paradoxes whereas we are made more simply think of anna blaise as the pole of a magnet think of the way a magnet works on iron filingsquite without volition magnets nancy said have two poles you are anna said very astute nancy took a cigarette and gave one to travis the last of a dearly bought packet of wings she trembled lighting it the dampness of the air almost smothered the match flame she allowed herself to look at him as he inhaled a lungful of smoke held it a moment released it like steam into the cold his face was unreadable lost travis said you said shes lost and nancy felt a surge of hope two of them had journeyed here together it was not traveling in any sense nancy would recognize anna had said but she could imagine it that way if she wished an ocean voyage say there had been a storm in effect the two of them had been shipwrecked lost and separated in a huge and quite foreign land they were essential to one another separately they were powerless embedded in their disguises more human than not alone she was powerless even to attempt to leave this place together it might be possible but they had lost one another they were castaways she had needed a place to conceal herself the elementary femaleness of the anna blaise persona helped creath had secreted her in the boardinghouse like a buried treasure it had not been pleasant but it had been necessary the environment in which she found herself its seasons and its people was wildly hostile and touching her nancy found herself imagining it annamadehuman lost in the prairie darkness disoriented creath burack wrapping a blanket around her pulling her into the car into the hot miasma of his maleness the stink of his cigars liza burack gazing on with a disapproval that would mature into a kind of stony impotent hatred in all this her terrible aloneness but this other nancy said hes looking for you she nodded has beensince you moved in with the buracks yes hes like you a frown had crossed her face no a man in his human avatar yes nancy listen among us male and female mean something very different apart were very nearly two distinct species bone is not like me thats his name bone the name he was given his disguise is poorer and his nature is more elementary hes been searching yes but weve only just made contact its easier she said faintly when the need is more profound a tramp drawn by the cigarette smoke stood staring at nancy and travis she had taken to wearing the whalebone knife as a matter of course and her hand strayed to it now the tramps face was a cipher eyes lidded and expressionless his hands were buried in his pockets come on travis said the rain had tapered off though the thick gray clouds still tumbled overhead the prairie was shrouded and wetsmelling the horizon invisible they walked a distance along the railway tracks travis scuffing up the gravel between the ties she wondered what was going on in his head whether he believed her but he must she thought it was no more fanciful than his own intuition it was travis after all who had insisted that anna was not human bone he said abruptly what the hell kind of name is that hes not like her she needs him shes sick sick how sick with the separation they were never meant to be apart so long their time ran out and its hurting her we cant sustain ourselves this way she had said we cant sustain our humanity or be sustained if we lose it the changes must come this bone hes sick too she said yes but its not the same kind of sickness the need is intense in both of them bone is different he doesnt talk much he has trouble with ideas maybe doesnt even know for sure where he is or where he came from only that hes trying to find her hes like an animal following an instinct hes big hes very strong but the time is running out for him too but he knows where to find her which direction to go she thinks hell be here soon christ god he shook his head nancy you saw some of it didnt you you saw her change i dont ever want to see it again the afternoon had edged on the sun was headed down nancy felt cold tired hungry her flatsoled shoes were all scuffed up and there were burdocks clinging to her cloth coat i dont trust her travis said still gazing back at haute montagne where it stood on the prairie the towers of the granaries stark against the sky how small it looked from here nancy thought she could be anything he said you ever think of that we dont know what she is or what this bone is only what she tells us and shes lied before i believe her nancy said maybe she picked us because wed believe her not creath not aunt liza not anybody else in town because wed understand oh travis she thought ive touched her i knowbut how to explain that out at the tracks that night she saw something in you a goodness or a gullibility travis what is it why does she frighten you so he was a long time answering the answer had sprung up in him but there was no way to articulate it because of what mama was he thought because of how she died because of what he had done with nancy and what he had wanted to do with anna blaise the whole sour mess of it he felt torn inside some wound there had been opened fundamentally he distrusted the femaleness of the annathing like all femaleness it concealed too much it had to be us nancy was saying she took a chance you know telling us anything at all but she needs somebody she cant live out these two weeks without somebody to bring her food somebody to help her through the changessomebody wholl know and somebody wholl do it anyway you know anybody else whod do that anybody else back there its only a town travis said they hate us he looked at her she was skinny and draggedout looking her hair was tangled you still believe that youre too good for them she straightened defiantly and her eyes went shiny with tears this town she said this goddamn towni am too big for this town and a look of surprise washed over her thats why she picked us travis said gently were alone cut off like she is maybe he added when wolves go after a sheep the first thing they do is cut it off from the flock thats just crazy shes so weak what about this bone what if they do get together he thought of his vision of anna blaise wet wings unfolding behind her they dont care about us come tomorrow nancy said talk to her she said her voice rising i told you what you wanted to know i didnt make any promises travis the only goddamn wolves around here are the ones in haute montagne and they are circling and they have cut me offboth of usand travis maybe you can ride away from it all but goddammiti cant and theyre gonna bring me down he thought of anna blaise in her damp shack her pale skin stretched fine her eyes huge and burning he thought of this bone hardly human tracking her across the night he closed his eyes the jeweled world he trembled thinking of it of what she had been and what she might become and what he stood to lose or gain in the process tomorrow nancy said maybe he said softly maybe chapter twelve creath burack nodded not cordially at the sullenfaced boy who had come through the door of his office he felt content alone here in this pineboard room there was the reassuring rumble of the compressors the metallic smell of the dust the calendars tacked on the wall like pieces of mosaic he had spent much of his life here he sat in the wooden reclining chair with his feet on an upturned wastebasket too long in this position and the narrow bands of the backsupport bit into his spine like teeth he was getting older comfort like most things could be taken only in moderation he stirred dully sat up blinking heard you might have a job free the boy said creath burack squinted you he said youre greg morrow arent you bill morrows kid he nodded to himself he remembered bill morrow a fat granary worker who used to show up at the first baptist stinking of flax and bathtub liquor sullen little darkskinned wife who had died of rheumatic fever three years back yeah yeah i seen you before arent you working over at the mill got laid off the boy said heard about your job my christ the older man thought but he is not handsome round ugly face and his lip curled like that creath felt a swelling resentment of the boys youth plainly misspent he could think of no good reason not to show this kid the gate but play him first he thoughtlike a fish on a line what jobs that the one the shitheel farmboy lost greg said maybe sensing that he was not welcome here shitheel farmboy huh creath was secretly amused you got a strange idea how to beg for a job fuck it im not begging greg morrow said he turned to the door some instinct made creath say hang on a minute greg hesitated its not much of a job creath said pick up trash stand in on the machine sometimes deliver sometimes lift and load always he smiled it pays shit greg remained sullen but appeared confused as if he had been praised and scolded both at once that was good try it out creath said see if you can get a handle on it now the kid brightened right now that had been before lunch the kid worked straight through mopping down the loading docks with scalding water and ammonia then the work crew filtered back gazing at greg with mute curiosity at the enthusiastic way creath played foreman to him slowly they had caught on finding him scutwork of their own lolling against the limp boards of the icehouse while greg morrow manhandled the big slabs in and out with an inadequate pair of tongs the muffled laughter became audible and at one point greg looked around with a dark startled suspicion in his eyes but everyone had turned away after the five oclock bell he showed up back in creaths office steaming wet and obviously exhausted natural enough creath thought he had done the work of two men what time do i come in tomorrow sleep late creath grinned at him the jobs not available what the fuck were not hiring thanks anyway you bastard you owe me a days pay i dont remember signing anything creath said mildly and watch your dirty mouth greg did a long slow burn but he did at last turn to leave creath felt an immense perverse satisfaction damn but hadnt the kid done a job with that mop but greg hesitated and turned back to him now smiling faintly and his posture took on that easy insolence again creath said you too dumb to find the door maybe im good for something after all creath was instantly suspicious i dont get it you want her back want who back you know the insinuation was plain creath felt beads of sweat break out on his forehead guilt and doubt gusted over him both at once by god he thought i have put all that behind me demons of lust he thought demons ofof i can find her greg morrow said and he was smiling now a secret and insinuating smile i know where she is i can find her i have put all that behind me i dont want to know creath said faintly i dont want to know maybe you dont thats okay ill get lost he opened the door no creath heard himself say wait huh be in at nine creath said weakly greg morrow only nodded the kid was gone then and creath sat back swabbing his forehead with his big checked handkerchief after a moment he took out the bottle of saskatchewan corn whiskey he kept in the bottom drawer volstead act or no volstead act he drank from the neck of the bottle backsliding but there were worse demons than demon drink the memory of the tent revival came back blindingly strongthe fine high euphoria that had blossomed like a thorny wildflower behind his eyes the two ecstasies warred inside him ecstasy of sin ecstasy of faith he felt his heart falter in his chest i know where she is the boy had said i can find her was it possible that she was still here still in haute montagne hidden somewherewas that truly possible no creath thought its a ruse a trick a lie it cannot be it must not be allowed he reached a second time for the bottle god forgive me he thought i want her back his hand was trembling still smarting with humiliation greg morrow nursed the spastic model t down the south end of the spur out past the scabbed towers of the granaries to his daddys property with its sprung doors like torn hip pockets and its elephants graveyard of rustpocked farm machinery inside his old man was asleep dusk gathered complex shadows about the prostrate form on the sofa in the front room a bottle of hooch inevitably lay on the plank floor next to him greg experienced a wave of disgust he harbored no illusions about the sort of man his father was shitpoor he thought shitdrunkand shitstupid he stomped into the kitchen there were cans of charity food from the churches a few in the cupboard hoover one of his fathers five aging and incontinent cats sat smugly on the wooden countertop greg put out his arm and swiped hoover down to the peeling linoleum shitstupid he thought that was the sum of it this town had reduced his old man to a kind of ruin a living analogue of the junk machines rotting in the front yard and there was no reason for it but a blind complacent stupidity greg had not done all that well in school and had left in any case when he was old enough to work but he had discovered a simple truth that raised him above the level of his old man small actions he thought have big consequences you pull strings that was how it was done he had watched the people who ran the town and that was how they did it nothing big nothing showy a tug here a tug there and more anyone could do it today for instance maybe he had endured that humiliation at the ice plant but he had also got himself a job and all it took he thought was a word the right word there were times he wished he could communicate this truth to his father if they beat on you he wanted to say you dont have to beat back and you dont have to take it though his father had done both copiouslyyou just have to watch and know and learn the words to say the strings to pull revenge was available in his head greg had kept a running tabulation of every humiliation he had suffered every beating he had endured his own and his old mans the memories were polished with handling he thought of creath burack he thought of travis fisher and nancy wilcox strings he thought lots of strings there he opened a can of beans and chased hoover yowling out the back door night had begun to fall in the darkness under the railway trestle travis dreamed his dreams were not coherent delirious with the cold he was ravaged by visions he dreamt of the pale woman and recognized her from a lifetime of dreams she was pure virginal whiterobed her face was his mothers face except when it was annas or somehow nancys he knew from looking at her that she was untouched utterly female desirable and he was ashamed of his own arousal he wanted to touch her defile her and in the dream she was always moving away from him retreating unapproachable her purity like some fundamental principle was preserved he woke shivering in the darkness as the night freight passed by above him sparks showered down and the roaring made his ears ache dully when the train was gone there was only the sound of the prairie wind rattling in the high beams of the trestle he sat up frightened the residue of the dream lingering in the dark air if he closed his eyes he could see her the pale woman as clearly as ever she was he realized the woman his mother had not been the woman his mother had failed to be she was the woman he had looked for in nancy too and most particularly in anna blaise the woman he had not found and he thought shivering in the darkness stricken what if there is no such woman what if she doesnt exist chapter thirteen nancy spent the next day at the switchmans shack waiting for travis to arrive leaping up with a mixed gladness and terror whenever she heard a sound outside he might come anna admitted her white stickfingers laced in her lap if he does he will have taken a step away from being she hesitated the thing he might have become hell be here nancy said anna was visible in the band of daylight falling through the open door no one would mistake her for human now nancy thought the change had progressed too far it was anna had explained the natural sloughingoff of her humanity but her need the sickness of her separation from bone was also visible the exaggerated orbit of her joints the wildness of her eyes and the thinness of her lips had only emphasized her decline nancy looked at her and thought of a childs toy one of those loosejointed slat puppets connected by bits of string but made of china or porcelain rather than wood and with bright blue balls of glass for eyes he might anna said but he might not you should be prepared for that her plain prairie accent coming from that body was like a bad joke but no nancy thought not really the voice for all its plainness was high and lilted a kind of song like singing heard far off on a summer night and it was that voice the reassurance of it that helped keep nancy sane through all this physically anna was frighteningly strange she was alien now unmistakably so but that wonderful halffamiliar voice contained a calming cadence a necessary link to the known hell come nancy said and what do you meana step away from being what hes two people you must have seen that part of him is the travis who has been so often hurt and victimized and that part of him is sympathetic he wants to help but there is this other travis fisher the travis fisher who believes in a kind of female purity who believes that women ought to be pristine above nature incorruptibleall the things he thought i was or the things you chose to show him maybe i deluded him if so it was not by choice its in my nature to be a mirror like creath he looked at me and saw a hidden part of himself it was at such times nancy thought that anna seemed most wholly alien her eyes grew distant as if she were looking directly into traviss skull peering somehow into the coral growths of his unconscious mind nancy had taught herself something about modern psychology yes she thought there is some truth in all this he believed in you he thought i was that woman but he wanted you to be that woman too the woman he once believed his mother was his mother nancy thought yes my god he must feelbetrayed betrayed and angry and thats the other part of travis fisher this huge anger a part of him hates ushates both of usfor not being pure enough or good enough there were times nancy said nodding the way hed look at me he suppresses the hate of course he believes in chivalry and unlike creath he is not by nature cruel but the hate has had a good deal of trauma to feed on it could displace his better instincts but if he understood its not as simple as that all this lives in the deepest part of him phantoms nancy said scornfully ghosts anna shrugged traviss virtuous woman is a kind of ghost yes like your ghost nancy frowned the ghost anna went on of your father or the man you invented out of the memory of your father the ghost youve been trying to placate all these years i thought you couldnt read minds only the deepest parts after a moment im sorry her voice was faint i shouldnt have spoken nancy was astonished to find her eyes filling with tears she dabbed her face with the wrists of her blouse it was all crazy of course anna was not human travis was right she could hardly be expected to understand how real people thought or felt its not really like that she turned back defiantly he washe but anna held up her hand pleadingly truly im sorry i have to rest now nancy went out into the meadowthe sun was disturbingly low in the skyto wait for travis he would come he must but the meadow was empty and the wind cut through this threadbare winter coat like a darning needle she hugged herself and went back to the meager shelter of the switchmans shack inside she let her head loll against the fibrous wallboards and closed her eyes when she opened them she gasped anna was convulsing her eyes had rolled up into her head her skin always alarmingly pale was deadwhite now blooddrained the convulsions traversed her body her spine bucked and arched over the thin stained mattress anna this was not the change nancy thought dazedly this was something else something new something worse she put her arm around the alien woman to steady her the contact was electric so quickly that she could not steel herself her mind was filled with hideous images the earth lurching under her feet fear fear and the footsteps behind her a train roaring blackly in the near distance the cold wind the footsteps the gun the shockingly loud sound of it pain invading her body in huge radiant arcs and she was distantly aware of the scream that filled the confined space of the shack it might have been annas or hers or both liza burack picked up the phone on the second ring she had been answering telephones more eagerly this autumn now that she had come to believe in the possibility of good news yes liza the voice on the other end boomed out this is bob clawson she had not seen him since the rotarian picnic four years ago but liza remembered the highschool principal well the ample belly the prissy threepiece suit he had worn coat and all all through that hot july day fearful of betraying his dignity to the handful of highschool students who had shown up with their parents good to hear your voice liza said courteously can i help you actually it was creath i wanted to speak to creath is putting in an extra hour at the ice plant bull for work eh well thats good thats fine i can call again another time may i tell him what this is about liza was curious now because bob clawson was town council bob clawson was white collar bob clawson didnt phone up just anybody and at that longsince picnic he had avoided the buracks the way he might have avoided a rabid dog just a little group some of us are getting together clawson said amiably i heard about your speech at the women last week meat and potatoes americanism my wife tells me not enough of that going around these days bad times liza said automatically some of us are more than a little concerned liza imagined who some of us might be bob clawson knew every judge and lawyer and realtor in the county we wanted to get together talk about doing something to protect the town thought creath might be interested she felt a small thrill run through her of course their rehabilitation could not be complete so soon clawson must have some secondary reason for wanting creath some dirty work he wanted done but it was a stepping stone she thought we are at least on probation im sure creath will be anxious to talk to you she said well i appreciate that liza yes good talking to you ill call back then yes she thought of asking for his number but decided against it better not to appear too anxious thank you she said she hung up the phone and leaned a moment on the dust mop waiting for her heart to calm its aggravated beat everything was happening so quickly the evening was naturally anxious creath absorbed the news without visible reactiononly smoked his cigars and played the big atwaterkent radio but liza could tell by the way he held the paper creased in thirds not turning the pages that it was on his mind the phone rang at half past eight creath waited for liza to pick it up bob clawson she passed the receiver to her husband he motioned her out of the parlor and pushed shut the door with his foot liza lingered in the hallway she was not eavesdropping her posture was erect disdainful still she thought words have a way of slipping through doors tonight however creaths tone was suppressed the conversation went on a maddeningly long time but all liza heard was yes and no and if she had made it out correctly one other word by nine creath was out of the parlor he went directly to the kitchen and poured a drink of water from the tap from the way the veins stood out on his face liza guessed he would have preferred hard liquor what is it she said what nothing much creath said but it was the same falsely casual tone in which he had customarily lied to her about anna blaise a memory she quickly suppressed just bob clawson getting together some bullshitpardon mesome twobit smoker bunch of men griping about the red menace harmless i guess lie took a big swallow of water guess ill go liza nodded dutifully secretly however she retained her suspicions she did not think two bit would describe any organization bob clawson would ever bother to get involved with and as for smokerwell that was possible anything was possible but the word that had drifted through the parlor door had not sounded much like smoker or two bit the word liza had heard was vigilante later that evening liza got a phone call of her own helena baxter calling to let her know that the votes from the last meeting had been counted that the results were not official of course until the announcement the following weekend butspeaking strictly off the recordit looked like liza had won a landslide victory travis watched the switchmans hut from the reedy bank of the fresnel river dusk gathering around him like the cupped palms of two huge black hands he hadnt eaten for two dayshis money had run out and there had been nothing to scrounge at the hobo jungleand voices circled like birds inside him he was not sure how he had come to this he was dead broke his clothes were torn and stiff with dirt the only way he had of washing himself was to dip his body in the frigid river water all this was foreign to him mama had always been scrupulously clean she had kept their small house soaped and dusted and aired the thought created in him a wave of nostalgia so physical it left him weakkneed and his traitorous memory chose that moment to echo back something creath had said it seemed like a long time ago well we all know where that path inclines i guess nancy and anna had brought him to this he thought broke hungry cold and without the simple willpower necessary to hop a freight and put some miles in back of him he knew what was happening in the town he had not needed nancy to tell him that he had been down the spur twice spending the last of his pocket money on food and on both occasions he had been paced out by the police the jungle was overdue for a roustingpossibly given the mood in haute montagne a violent one he should leave there was nothing for him here but he gazed at the shack where nancy was nancy and the annathing suppose he thought we do help her posing the question aloud though there was no one to hear him here in the tall grasssuppose we do help her well what then where does that leave us alone he thought bitterly broke nowhere to go no better off haute montagne would never welcome back travis or nancy too many rules had been broken too many borders transgressed he shivered in his inadequate clothing and wondered if nancy knew the kind of future she had devised for herself maybe that was what was keeping him here this remnant of what he had felt for her this fear but was it strong enough to draw him back inside that shack he thought of anna her mothwing skin her eyes coldly blue in the darkness his love his fear he might have turned away then might have been driven back by the terrible intensity of the vision when he saw far off a figure advancing from the stand of elder trees down by the switching yards the gait was familiar but the memory eluded him who could be coming here then the name fell into placegreg morrowand with the name a tremor of fear travis emitted a sort of moan and stood up running forward without thinking about it he intercepted greg halfway to the switchmans shack greg looked at him warily but with an obvious contempt confronting him travis felt suddenly helpless foolish what could he say you dont have any business here he managed it was inadequate but greg morrow must not be allowed near the switchmans shack obviously he had suspicions that was bad enough but if he knew the truth but greg was smiling that where she is nodding toward the shack that whore anna blaise nancy too maybe the smile became a smirk you fuckin em both farmboy is that it you know you smell like shit you look like shit you smell like shit but hey maybe they like that huh i bet it drives em nutsthat stink travis balled his fists but before he could move greg had put his hand into his coat pocket and pulled out a knife it was a stupid knife travis thought woodhandled with a long serrated blade it looked like a cheap steak knife but he guessed it could cut greg waved it gleefully at him and travis felt a wave of fear wash over him fear andsomething else not this time greg said calmly i wont be screwed over this time stand still im just gonna go over and knock on the door no problem just want to see whos home he stepped forward and travishardly aware of himselfstepped in front of him greg stood still the knife was motionless in his hand travis looked at the knife and then at greg gregs eyes twinkled there was a hint of glee there and his smile was the rictus of a man strapped into a roller coaster coming to the top of the first big hump and enjoying it somehow somehow thriving on it travis realized then that greg would use the knife would use it gladly that if travis were hurt if he died it wouldnt matter travis was a hobo now found dead he would be quietly buried do it he said aloud and a part of him wondered where the words came from his voice was guttural very nearly a growl do it greg ill take the knife away from you i vow i will and ill cut your balls off with it travis waited the knife was only inches from his belly but he looked at greg and saw that some of the giddy hysteria had faded from his eyes the knife wavered an uncertainty had crept into the equation then swiftly greg smiled again he let the knife drop well i guess i know whats in there already i guess you just told me he took a step backward have fun while you can farmboy travis watched him walk almost lazily back toward the trees listened for the sound of the car cranking up his own heart was beating wildly he felt dizzy he thought of nancy in the shack of what she had so narrowly avoided of what she could not much longer avoid now that greg morrow had come back here christ god he thought shivering shes consorting with demonstheyll crucify her he turned back and there was the sound of her scream he pulled her away from anna and instantly nancy stopped trembling she looked up at travis with a mute enormous gratitude you came nance what is it whats wrong the gun she thought the fear the agony she touched her ribs her belly wanting the reassurance that those wounds she had felt were not really her wounds i cant explain she said faintly i dont understand it myself but anna had stopped shaking and she sat up now holloweyed luminous with faint blue fire nancy felt travis recoil but she gripped his hand and held it tightly needing him anna blinked her grief had filled the room it was palpable physically present a smell like roses a cloud an electricity in the skin she looked at nancy you felt it yes god yes she pressed against travis that was him wasnt it that was bone hes close anna said faintly theyre killing him interlude bone loses faith in a little railtown called buckton their luck went bad the wad of money in the righthand pocket of bones navy pea coat had grown much larger twice in the course of this hot summer in towns whose names they did not know they had committed successful robberies nothing big deacon said nothing ambitious just a little money out of the till just a kind of income tax a little relief program for archie and deacon and bone they would locate a gas station or a general store not too far from the railway or too close to town would approach it at dusk deacon brandishing a handgun he had taken from the darcy farmhouse would empty the till the proprietor or the store clerk might weep might curse might silently watch but it was never deacon or archie he looked at it was bone bone huge and blankly pale his pallid wrists projecting from the cuffs of his pea coat his eyes white and unblinking in their cavernous orbits this should have been the same they had hiked away from a hobo jungle to this place a whitewashed building with a torn screen door and the word sundries written above it they stood outside in the gathering dusk calculating the isolation of the place the chance that somebody might come by its wide open here archie said nervously anybody could see us but deacon only favored him with a contemptuous sneer cowardly talk he said and reached under his coat for the big handgun for christs sake archie beganbut deacon had already pushed through the rusthinged door bone hurried after the room inside was narrow plankfloored tidy sacks of flour squatted on pineboard shelves bone was engulfed in the heady smell of wood polish and grain in the merciless yellow light of an overhead bulb the proprietor was a barrelshaped man who had not yet noticed deacons gun his eyes were fixed on bone bone sensed the mans distrust not yet coalesced into fear the proprietor said frogthroated can i help you gentsthen paled as deacon stepped forward grinning archie watched the door that was his job and he performed it flawlessly bone stood beside deacon at the counter claustrophobic in this enclosed place deacon held the pistol all we want is whats in the till deacon said coolly hand it over slow car coming archie said from the door deacon did not turn let me know if it stops he was relaxed methodical deacon was not afraid of the man behind the counter not afraid of jail or of committing violence he had changed bone thought since the darcy house maybe he didnt want to kill the storekeeper but he would not hesitate to do so should the occasion arise some part of him might even welcome the violence the brief wild pleasure of pulling the trigger and proclaiming his potency bone perceived all this without words the immanence of death boiled around deacon like a thundercloud he stank of it the storekeeper had frozen he stared at deacon at bone at deacon again beads of sweat started out on his broad forehead the till deacon said empty the goddamn till car gone by archie said bone watched the storekeepers fat hands delve into the cash drawer he wadded the cash as he tugged it out pushed the soiled green bills across the counter its not much he said his voice cracking but its allseelook all right all right deacon used his pistol to sweep the cash toward bone bone took it without counting it and stuffed it into the pea coat archie all clear no wait christ theres another car deacon held the pistol steady on the wall a pepsicola clock ticked out seconds the breathing of the storekeeper was stertorous and aggrieved gone by deacon asked tightly its archies voice lost a beat deacon its slowing down be damned deacon said he turned fractionally bone watched as the storekeeper dived behind the counter when he came up an instant later he had a shotgun in his hands deacon turned back but his comprehension lagged bone felt the seismic shiftdeacons confusion and fear the storekeepers blossoming triumph the shotgun was inches from deacons chest the storekeeper tightened his finger on the thick steel trigger bone reached out and took the gun in one huge hand he jerked the barrel upward the storekeepers finger closed convulsively and both barrels discharged into the ceiling oh my lord the storekeeper said bone snatched the weapon away from him and threw it into a corner with the stitched cotton sacks of animal feed oh my sweet lord and deacon thrust forward his pistol deacon bone said gently deacon dont but it was too late feverish with hatred deacon fired the storekeeper lurched back gapchested and bloody into a wall of patent medicines brown bottles of iron tonic fell about him like hail he was dead it was that simple death again bone thought sadly fucker tried to kill me deacon said trembling you saw him cant deny it tried to kill me and bone looked at deacon a small man now frightened in the aftermath of his own violence and thought i dont owe him anything it was a new idea startling and absolute deacon was alive now because of bone bone had discharged his debt white smoke coiled from the barrel of deacons pistol tried to kill me you saw him car gone by archie said weakly they rode mostly empty boxcars if they entered a crowded one it would be empty at the next whistlestop bones reputation had grown among the hoboes fuck em all deacon said cheerfully they sat in a boxcaremptywith the prairie night rushing past outside it was no longer summer the wind was cutting and bone clutched his jacket around him the calling was elusive tonight deacon had acquired a bottle of muscatel he drank unstintingly and offered none to archie after a time pacified he talked in fragments about his life in chicago about the great war about the child he had abandoned then with a violent finality he passed out bone and archie sat in the rattling darkness very nearly invisible the door was open a crack and bone watched the landscape pour by a harvest moon hung on the horizon hell do it again archie said talking to himself maybe bone thought i should walk away archie said walk away and be shut of the whole thing i should bone gazed at him inquisitively ah no archie said taking up the remainder of deacons muscatel no i guess ive been with him too long maybe you dont understand that its not queer dont get that idea its just that i owe him some things bone nodded i was never good on my own too damn dumb deacons a thinker smart smart as a whip but thats where he gets into trouble figuring angles all the time can make a person crazy im not trying to stir up trouble but listen bone listen to me to deacon youre just one more angle you know what i mean there was no fear about archie now only a sadness a melancholy like the scent of the rain in the air bone said i know its been sweet for him so far christ he could do anything he was right he was right its not deacon they see its bone the geekyou deacons sitting pretty the chill air made him shiver and archie took up the bottle and swallowed convulsively you though bone youre out in the cold you know that out in the snow and ice when they hang somebody it wont be deacon and pretty soon deacons gonna want to lose you oh yes they know you now hoboes know you cops know you everybody youre getting to be a liability bad to be with youre not much good to him anymore it was true enough bone thought but he guessed it didnt really matter any longer he had paid out his debt to deacon it worked both ways deacon was bad for bone to be with as well but he worried about being alone about being recognized especially now that he was so close the calling was faint but very near in recent days his mind had seemed to race he was filled with a new lucidity he understood so much ill stick with him archie was saying i dont care what he did i know he killed those people by god didnt we bury them but he needs me archie looked at bone pleadingly he needs me doesnt he doesnt he i guess he does bone said they spent the next night outside a freightyard camped by themselves huddled over a weak fire while the wind came sluicing over the prairie give me the money deacon said drunk again bone shivering pulled the wad of bills out of his pocket deacon counted it twice it came to almost three hundred dollars deacon gripped the fluttering bills tightly as if the wind might carry them off we could go a long way on this he said a long way some warm place florida maybe what say archie we spend the winter in florida live like goddamn kings buy a piece of property maybe theres no florida property for three hundred bucks archie said morosely then well get more deacon said archie looked at bone and then back at deacon if you meanhey deacon i dont think we should one more time deacon said maybe someplace a little ritzier someplace they keep more cash in the till someplace no astonishingly archie had risen to his feet deacon its crazy theyll spot him a mile away well all be killed all of us deacon didnt answer only sat back against his rucksack and gazed at archie in a moment archies rage had faded he looked foolish outlined against the stars with the night wind picking at his tattered coat and he sat back down again just one more deacon said his voice was placid calming i know we cant carry on with it all i want is a little extra you understand a little something to keep us warm something to keep the cold away you understand archie but archie was shivering archie was hugging himself and it looked to bone as if archie might not be warm ever again he woke up that night after the fire had gone out the embers were cold the ground beneath him was cold bone sat up and hugged his pea coat around himself amber light from the freightyard washed out over the prairie behind a chain link fence an acetylene torch dropped showers of sparks the night air was full of metallic smells and the stars above him were icy and strange the calling sang to him here i am find me now before the time passes bone find me here now he could not mistake the urgency of it he sensed that some irreversible process had been set in motion that he needed to play out his part his body felt huge and strange about him in this last week the sickness had come back the convulsions that bowed him heeltocrown as if he were about to erupt from this clumsy cocoon and burst forth transfigured it was time to move on so close now he did not need words to know it he moved away from the cold campfire from the prone bodies of archie and deacon into the darkness in the shadow of a rusteaten oil canister he stood to his full height and scanned the eastern horizon she was a light there he thought it for the first time she she was a blue corona that rose and flared like a searchlight against the stars bone knew without thinking it that the light would be invisible to archie or deacon it was a sign meant exclusively for bone a kind of marker here i am he trembled with the closeness of it the light transfixed him consumed all his attention for a timeless moment and he was startled when archie tapped his shoulder the smaller man was shaking his knapsack was in his hand he gazed up at bone and there were tears leaking from his eyes we leave him here archie whispered listen to me without us he cant hurt himself hell be okay we leave him here right bone without us they cant touch him hell be okay and bone gazing at archie was overcome with another realization he was not like archie or deacon i am not human the thought was dizzying and for a moment he was afraid a convulsion might overtake him in the glare of that blue light he had glimpsed himself had bathed for a moment in the secret illumination of the jeweled world bones comprehension failed him but he understood at least that he was not like archie the gulf between them was vast vast archie no he said his voice seemed loud in the darkness i have to gohe pointed helplesslythere archie gazed beyond him not listening blind to the calling light he changed since we met you but thats not true either it was nothing you did just something he saw in you i dont know you were like the ghost of all the beatings he took but not beaten all his old anger came out there was a motion in the darkness beyond the oil tanks bone distracted looked away i guess i changed too archie said i only ever wanted to help him i guess you know what i mean but i cant do that by staying with him thats the hard part his eyes focused on bone there was anguish there but also a kind of strength bone felt a shadow of the smaller mans pain of this hardwon peace he had arrived at somehow in the deep of the night we have to leave him its the only way to help him christ it frightens me to be alone its the only thing i was ever really scared of but if we dont leave him bone hell kill himself hes drugged up on crazy vengeance and theres no sense in him that motion againa flicker of denim a sigh like drawn breath bones hackles rose he turned to the smaller man beside him archie but there was an explosion that lit up the night bone was momentarily blinded and when his vision cleared he saw archie on his knees gagging and then archie in a pool of his own dark blood limply dead deacon stepped out from behind the oil tanks with the pistol in his hand he turned on his heel and the pistol was aimed now at bone the immensity of the betrayal shocked him deacon had shot archie archie who had held his mirror when he shaved archie who had loved him hes dead bone stammered out deacon nodded his eyes were wide his pupils dilated sure hes dead i caught him son of a bitch run away on me would he run away on deacon he was afraid for you bone shook his head aghast he was afraid you might get caught dont move deacon thrust the pistol forward i heard you two talking move out he said leave deacon behind he said thats what you were doing out here in the night the pistol shot bone managed the men in the railyard theyll be here soon on the horizon the blue calling light guttered and flared he was just waiting for his chance deacon said sneak off and leave deacon in the lurch son of a bitch i guess i know better he loved you thats a dirty lie deacon pressed the gun forward there were voices now from the railyard and his expression hardened give me the money but deacon had the smell of death about him a carrion stench bone could not ignore he had seen the jeweled world the bright beauty of it and he could only recoil in horror from the ugly thing deacon had become deacon he understood meant to kill him now deacon said bone darted his big hand toward the pistol he could not grasp it but only slapped it away the gun flew through the cold air while deacon cursed and leaped after it ill kill you deacon panted ill kill you you geek bastard bone stumbled backward the sheer scope of it defied understanding deacon had killed archie here was the steaming carcass to prove itand now deacon meant to kill bone there was no one bone thought bitterly no one and nothing he could trust here only the calling only the light and the song of it nothing human he was not human and there was nothing in the human world for him only danger here deacon scrabbled for the gun and bone turned and ran the scissorbills ambushed him at the hobo jungle the came at him with flashlights and guns he was trapped encircled suddenly blinded his foot caught in a railway tie and he fell clumsily among the gravel and embers there were four flashlights bright bobbing flares that disguised the faces behind them but more men than that maybe more guns he stood up slowly and listened to the awe that crept into their voices as they made a ring around him big bastard aint he its him all right no question the one they wrote about in the papers christ look at him they pushed him up against the corrugated side of a reefer car hes not packing anything a man stepped forward and bone saw his face in the reflected light thick grizzled face save for the uniform this might have been one of the hoboes bone felt that same gulf again a revulsion a blossoming hatred such men had beaten him too often before but now now not now he was too close the scissorbill shone a light in bones eyes and the others pressed close behind him the heat and smell of them were unbearable we heard a pistol fired the man said same pistol killed all those farmfolks maybe huh you want to tell us where it is there were no words to answer bone shook his head the scissorbill grinned and brought his knee up between bones legs bone doubled over with the pain of it think the man said oh well hand you over to the cops soon enough theyll lock you up somewherea long long timeassuming they dont choose to hang you but we got you first and nobody cares if we have a little fun of our own the calling was suddenly strong in him stronger than it had ever been before not a song now but a river of need a torrent bone felt a convulsion coming on he was full of that wild energy but he did not convulse what happened next happened quickly he straightened and the pain and the betrayal and the hatred in him rose to a terrifying crest he screamed a highpitched falsetto scream and he swung out his fist it should have been a futile gesture it was not the actinic blue calling light shone now from inside him it was electric an aura and he knew from their eyes that these men could see it bone swung his arm touching them full of violent energy and where he touched them the blue light leaped from the apex of his arm and the men he touched were gone thendead he supposed but more than that quite literally vanished dispatched he could not say how he knew this to the nothingness that lay between the worlds his sense of time deserted him he supposed it only took a moment when he finished there was no one left around him in the darkness he heard deacon calling his name bone he ran for a moving freight he was weary confused intoxicated with the calling cattle cars slid by him gathering speed shuttering bars of light into the morning mist bone tripped and fell forward stumbled up again all these cars were closed and locked bone give it back you bastard the money bone thought it was still in his jacket pocket was that all deacon wantedthe money if he had it would he let bone leave bone hesitated and turned back deacon was a shadow running alongside this redball freight the gun was still in his hand deacon bone said and deacon fired the pistol the bullet took bone in the upper thigh he roared twisted fell the pain was immense it spread through him like wildfire and he could not dismiss it rage rose up like sour bile inside him a second bullet struck sparks from the pebbles near his head and bone reached up wildly his huge hand caught in the undercarriage of the accelerating freight it was as if an undertow had taken him he was dragged forward deacon shouting incoherently and the railway ties gouged cruelly at him he lifted himself desperately hooked a foot up deacon fired again and the bullet scored a bloody pathway up bones prominent rib cage two of the ribs were broken instantly white fire clutched at his heart he pulled himself up screaming this was a reefer car no good to himunless the ice compartment was empty he inched backward clinging with his long arms like an insect his good blue pea coat was wet with blood bone goddamn you but deacons voice was fading now the train picked up speed groaning bone let himself into the ice compartment his breathing was labored and he felt on the verge of a great darkness in one last lunging effort he secured the lid so it would not lock and fell back on the hard wiremesh he lost consciousness at once bone dreamed in his dreams the calling light glimmered and flashed illuminating a horizon he could not see there was a face he did not recognizea womans face her mouth moved framing a word bone so close now he saw deacons face too transformed and vulpine jaws agape slavering and bone was suffused with a contempt and a hatred so immense that his thinking mind closed against it pain and hatred merged a single great conflagration lightless but full of heat the train bent into a curve bones huge body shifted agony flared the cold had numbed him but his wounds were deep he turned on his side breathing shallowly his dreams were full of death the train slowedan endless time laterand the calling woke him he fell from the reefer car into blindness and pain the train sighed and groaned slowing it was dark here he could not say how much time had passed he blinked motionless the agony in his leg and chest beating at him dark here by all human perceptionbut the calling light was lustrous in the sky so close and cast an eerie illumination over the tall dry grass the distant railway trestle bone crept into a shallow depression where the prairie grass hid him close now bone thought so close so close he held his left hand closed across his chest wound the blood in his blue navy pea coat torn now ruined had begun to crystallize weakness flooded him ill go he thought not far he stood erect the stars watched him the wind bit and probed bone took a halting step forward another but the pain welled up again irresistible now and bone toppled forward into the wild grass the prairie swallowed him up bone closed his eyes and the stars went dark chapter fourteen they kept a vigil through the night anna was often unconscious the blue light played fitfully over her at times she seemed awake but oblivious to them her lips moving wordlessly her eyes dilated travis closed his eyes briefly and it seemed to him that the room was in some way still visible but filled with strange translucent shapes pale emeralds impossibly faceted diamonds he sat erect and closed his hand on nancys they did not speak by morning the crisis had passed a wan daylight filtered through the wallboards anna lay in a heap on her mattressdiminished travis thought ricepaper white stickthin only her eyes animate she sat up blinking nancy cleared her throat anna is heis bone dead no the alien woman said not quite hes hurt yes still coming still coming very close now is there anything we can do not for a time nancy stood up wearily there were dark bruises of sleeplessness under her eyes she stretched im going to the river to wash travis youll be okay here he nodded slowly sunlight washed inward as nancy opened the door she left it ajar and travis watched her descend the slope of the riverbank in a moment she was out of sight he looked back at anna blaise now he thought if he ever hoped to sort this out now was the time while she was weak too weak perhaps to lie its all true then what you told nancy i mean about another world andall that can you look at me and doubt it she was no longer beautiful travis thought but her voice retained its grace its seductiveness maybe its deceit nancy is sometimes credulous you were the one who told her i wasnt human there is no question of that travis said but there are other questions nancy believes you mean no harm maybe but this bone there have been stories in the papers bone is credulous too but not evil we only have your word for that im sorry what else can i offer she was motionless not even blinking travis guessed she was conserving her strength he said you didnt mean to come here not in this fashion it was a mistake nancy said you and uh bone got separated the journey between worlds is arduous even for us there are storms in the chaos between a misstep in that labyrinth can be a disaster yes we were separated how comeif thats truehow come nobody came after you she smiled faintly there are more worlds than mine and yours we were lucky to arrive within the boundaries of a single continent bone searched the time passed thats all together we can travel back even if hes hurt she frowned shrugged i dont understand travis said if its so hard so dangerouswhy do any of this why come here why would anyone travel between worlds to learn do you understand that travis to acquire knowledge wisdom the sound of nancys singing traveled up from the riverbank the sun had warmed the air a little travis looked almost fearfully into annas huge eyes but there was nothing there to betray her nothing that said this is the truth or this is a lie anna blaise doesnt exist then i am anna blaise but its false a mask she folded her hands in her lap her legs were crossed she looked travis thought like a frail buddha i am not human but i have a certain access to human minds anna blaise is in some sense a metaphor of myself the way a name might be translated into a foreign language but travis see if i give back a human appearance it can only be a sort of reflection a mirror not a mask travis had begun to sweat he was not sure why the air was still cold you werent a mirror for creath burack but i was i had to be how else to survive to claim his protection a mirror of his deepest needs unspoken unadmitted creath burack is a deep well of desires and f earsall buried hidden travis said hoarsely you used him he was suddenly frightened again the lines of her face were fluid mobile he was afraid of what he might see there she said defiantly i traded my body for his protection when i was helpless which of us used the other travis her voice had subtly changed it was hauntingly familiar he said thats dirtythats an old old bargain im not the first to have made it and i will not be blamed for it travis stood up he recognized the face now the face and the voice whos talking he demanded his own voice shrill and childish whos saying this youor my mother both of us i imagine anna said nancy returned her hair wet and pushed through the flimsy wooden door she saw travis sitting bolt upright staring anna was as inscrutable as ever travis she said something wrong no he said no and went to the door ill be back taking his own turn she guessed at the riverside nancy settled down in the shadows exhausted what happened anna pivoted her head to face her travis wanted to know some things he gave you the third degree she was quietly shockedsurely anna was too frail for that sort of treatment but the alien woman said he needed reassurance i cannot say whether he received it you told him about being a mirror yes though i think he understood it intuitively long before this nancy closed her eyes she needed sleep more than anything too much had happened weariness moved like a tide in her youre that woman she heard herself saying the one you say he dreams about the pale woman travis sees her in me yes i give back that part of himthat fear that desire nancy stifled a yawn and what about me what do i see in you anna gazed back frail emaciated cast out like a piece of flotsam nancy thought sleepily washed up on some uncaring reef only yourself anna said gently when she woke it was past nightfall again nancy had slept sitting up her back was stiff and she was cold she had to get back to town she thought her mother might have called the police anything might have happened travis was beside her we cant stay here he said greg morrow saw me last night if he wants to make trouble theres not much we can do about it where else is there to go anyway she stretched we cant move anna it would kill her theres not much left of her but her bones bones and that terrible light anna sat crosslegged on the mattress hardly breathing her eyes were rolled back into her head nancy felt a twinge of concern anna hes near here anna blaise said suddenly hes very near here indeed and she blinked and looked intently at travis chapter fifteen creath burack was careful to park his battered ford pickup two blocks beyond bob clawsons modest house on deville street he did not want to be conspicuously oddmanout among all the fine automobiles parked there there would be enough of that to come he thought he did not relish this meeting his gut burned though he had eaten sparingly at dinner he sat for a breathless moment gripping the steering wheel as the fords engine cooled there are limits he thought there are limits beyond which i will not go he wasnt stupid he knew the kind of fear that was sweeping the town it was impossible to miss the times had gone sour there were unemployed men everywhere families starving farms turned to dust murders and gangsterism and reckless talk of revolution and men like bob clawson and his croniesmen of money or failing that of staunch proprietywere the scaredest of all he thought i do not know what they want from me but there are limits he climbed out of the automobile liza had made him wear his best sunday suit creath regretted that decision now the collar nagged at him the oldfashioned vest was conspicuously tight across his belly it wore on him like an admission of inadequacy he gritted his teeth and paced out the necessary steps to the clawson house clawsons wife a gushy nervous woman addicted to the wearing of gloves met him at the door why creath she said so good to see you and led him to the parlor the men are all inside go on there were times creath wanted to say when you would have crossed the street to avoid me but he only mumbled yes evie thanks and held his hat in his hand the men as she had called them were clustered around a dining room table the shades had been pulled and the electric lights switched on the air was already blue with cigar smoke creath entered and the rumble of male voices tapered to a stillness he felt the sweat tickling down his ribs bob clawson pushed forward the highschool principal looked dowdy and small among these lawyers and realtors and store owners there was a primness in him he could not shake but his hailfellow smile and his extended right hand made creath feel stupidly grateful he took clawsons hand eagerly it moved wetly alive in his grip like some kind of hairless animal creath burack good you could make it you know most of these people i think by reputation mainly creath thought but clawsons welcome had taken him out of the spotlight and he was pleased to see the faces turn incuriously away from him the rumble of conversation resume he would have liked to be invisible sure he said breathlessly i really am pleased you could make it weve been having a lot of discussions here you might find interesting i think its important that people like ourselves get together in a time like this dont you i guess so creath said but surely youve noticed it too but then its all the more obvious from where i sit i see the young people your wife made some astute points in that regard i understand in her little speech i assume you agree with her creath had not heard the speech liza had told him about it he had listened with only half an ear it had sounded like the same old stuff to him the country was going to hell in a handbasket true enoughbut he could not arouse himself to be shocked by it i go along with her a hundred percent he said and wondered miserably if he ought to have come at all he did not like these men and he was certain they had not petitioned to have him here he was here on sufferance strictly then why had he come because of liza he thoughther stern conviction that this would better them in some way and for more pragmatic reasons there in the corner with a glass of brandy was his banker a man named crocket who held the mortgage on his house seated at the table was jeff baines the realtor to whom creath must turn when inevitably it came time to sell the ice plant and there by the potted chinese evergreen was jim st hubert the undertaker who would one day escort him into the cold weedy soil up at glen acres in pieces and fragments these men owned him he was beholden to them clawson seemed to sense his discomfort he poured creath a drink from a bottle of canadian blend its important times like this to mend fences man to man we hang together or we will hang separately you understand in truth he did not he murmured yes thats good thats fine you finish your drink all right pretty soon ill make my little speech there were chairs for everyone creath sat at the back bent almost double in his effort to remain inconspicuous the room had grown unbearably hot and his body under these layers of dark cloth was slick with sweat bob clawsons little speech once begun showed no signs of winding down the sentiments were all familiar vice and sedition were abroad in the land and the law was helpless to deal with it i dont mean that as any kind of slur on the work of tim norbloom there weve talked havent we timand he agrees that something more has to be done i want to emphasize that we are working in privacy here the nature of the work demands it many of us are public servants tim norbloom and myself are just two examples and our work might be compromised if word of this got out but we are willing to assume that risk we assume it because we know what every rightthinking citizen in haute montagne must at least suspect that hard times call for hard action creath drained the teacup of whiskey clawson had given him closed his eyes to better feel the alcohol working he found himself impatient with clawsons fine rhetoric you cant bullshit a bullshitter by god he thought i know what you are dressing up with your fine perfume and he thought quite involuntarily of greg morrow i know where she is was that possible anna blaise still in town still here in haute montagnecould that be he closed his eyes her face was there in the inner darkness we are all aware clawson said of the way unemployed men and railway transients have been gathering on the outskirts of town this has not been a pressing problem though many of us do worry about the safety of our women and i think weve all been more astute about locking our doors lately i know i havehavent you heads nodded creath forced open his eyes stared glazedly at the scuffed tips of his shoes but the problem may be of greater proportion than we have suspected im talking about the outright seduction of our daughters im talking about young girls making clandestine visits to the shantytown at the railway trestle im talking about what can only be described as a very real and terrible danger to the lives and morals of our children clawson paused and there was the embracing silence of absolute attention fortunately he said one of our young people has been courageous enough to step forward with this information the problem is not yet widespread but it could become so and that is why we must come together creath stood up he did not mean to some instinct impelled him or the liquor who do you mean who came to you heads turned he thought dear god what have i done bob clawson looked at him uneasily a former student at the high school he said quickly and ive taken the liberty of asking him to join us so you all can meet him and hear what he has to say clawson opened the parlor doors behind him come on in son greg morrow stepped inside smiling the rest of it was hazy in creaths mind a blur of perception greg described the assignations he had witnessed or claimed to have witnessed down by the railway trestle clawson added something about the obligationno the duty we feel to do something about this while we can and then the mounting burble of voices creath stood in a corner smiling falsely when he could force himself to do so drawing strength from the reassuring confluence of the two walls then an eternity later as these welldressed and authoritative men of means began to filter out one by one bob clawson approached him with his hand once more extended creath i know youre as concerned about these issues as the rest of us for your own sake and lizas and i want you to know you can be a big help to us no creath thought leave me out of it i will not be a party to this thing it was true he had wanted a reckoning with anna blaise had wished he could expunge her from his life altogether because in all truth the wanting of her was still huge within him christ god he thought i want her even now even nowbut there was no redemption in what these men wanted only some filthy act of violence born out of their fear and their boredom i am not a saint creath thought he had done many things he was not proud of he had hurt people he would gladly have killed travis fisher would yet perhaps but not this he thought she could be out there i know where she is a big help bob clawson was saying his hand on creaths shoulder a husky man like yourself and dont think it wont be noticed we are all friendsall of us who sat in this room and pledged ourselves to the betterment of the community and friends do things for friends i think you must understand that no creath thought debts forgiven considerations made it was tantalizing but insufficient no he thought not even for that i wont but he saw greg morrow gazing at him across the oaken table that insolent smile playing faintly across his lips and he understood then that greg morrow was smarter than he had thought greg morrow understood the tidal flow of wealth and power in haute montagne how to use and manipulate it greg morrow humble as his station was had invaded the byzantine social structure of the towns prime movers had done this terrible thing quite consciously greg catching his eye smiled ohsofaintly and creath understood the communication was explicit crawl the smile said crawl like you made me crawl crawl for the rich men or you can kiss your shitty business and your swivel chair and your cheap cigars goodbye because these men will break you creath tore his eyes away bob clawson frowned we can count on you cant we creath it means a lot to all of us after that wonderful speech your wife gave i wouldnt want to think youd backed out on us creath felt his lower lip trembling he was afraid he might begin to cry the textured fleurdelis wallpaper threatened to close in about him he needed to be out of this place yeah he said faintly you can count on me gregs smile broadened and creath fumbled for the door chapter sixteen that night there was frost on the brittle stalks of prairie grass anna was sleeping or comatose and travis ate a sparing meal of saltines chipped beef and tepid water she woke at dawn the last of her humanity was draining from her the flesh was taut over her skull and the skull itself had taken on new contours a kind of streamlining her soiled dress hung limply and travis did not wish to know what transformations it might conceal her aura pulsed about her the irises of her eyes had expanded she gazed at him from azure depths unfathomable he began you have to leave this place listen greg morrow knows were here hes bound to make trouble maybe when nancy gets back we can take you over to the railway trestle we but anna was shaking her head when she spoke her voice too was more nakedly alien a kind of soft keening it stood up his hackles though all she said was no you dont understand youre in danger here in danger anywhere surely but travis the time is very near i cannot leave this place listen to me bone is close by but hes wounded he needs help travis sat back on his haunches it had been the coldest night of this autumn and his jacket was inadequate the barnboard walls of the switchmans shack thin as paper anna did not shiver travis did near here very near then go to him she tilted her head look at me if i stood up the bones would break he nodded slowly it was undeniable he ventured i could carry you weve touched before travis and im less human now human by willpower mostly it would be difficult for you besides well need some shelter for the duration of the change the shack would be best she added i can describe the place where he is but there are other things you need to know travis narrowed his eyes the candlelight flickered he thought she will warn me about him all this sounded sincere and he believed much of what she had already told him but her very strangeness made her impossible to evaluate the truth as much as lies could be a manipulation he said tell me hes been wounded the wounds are severe he is not deadhe need not diebut he is very nearly delirious he has also been betrayed and in the delirium is buried his anger this is a dangerous combination approaching him cannot be anything but dangerous bone is very strong even wounded and there is more what he has much the same power of reflection as myself though he exercises it differently travis you need to understand how it is for us in the place we come from were not two separate beings we i know travis said nancy told me then hear it again and try to understand you think of us as male and female bone and me because weve assumed those avatars this is terribly misleading were one person were separate because when we came here we had not yet achieved physical union though we were already paired paired here she touched her head which is why i have been able to call him apart neither of us is whole male and female travis said i dont see how its so different but you are different anna said fervently all of you youre male and female both at once whole from birth there is no purity no perfection a human woman distilled of all her maleness would be inconceivable insupportable a kind of monster like you travis said she nodded calmly like me and bone he has assumed a masculine persona and travis he is quite capable of functioning as a mirror you look at me and i give back your own most fundamental comprehension of a woman yes but bone may be much more difficult to confront not just because hes wounded look at him travis and what he will give you back is yourself your own deepest hidden face and i cannot honestly promise that you will be strong enough to confront it he turned away from her the door of the shack had fallen open and he was able to see a long way out into the fading night the cold plains of the stars there was the sound of wind and water running he didnt want to do thisany of this he thought of all the warm lit places of the town your own face she had said your own deepest hidden face and if he saw that he wondered would he understand would he know then what had brought him here why he was huddling in this abandoned shack an outcast when he could have been warm safe loved she was veiled in the flickering darkness goddamn her travis thought she had lured him here he had broken on the reefs of her an old old bargain which of us used the other but there was only one way out of it now a transformation she had said once begun must be completed he guessed that was probably true describe the place travis said solemnly she did so the trestle the river the distant silhouette of the grain elevators do you know where that is travis he pulled his flimsy jacket around himself and stood up i know he said the morning was very cold the sun rode up high but ineffectual over the town of haute montagne home nancy had gathered up the last of her money and a change of clothes and folded them into a linen bundle she tucked an old tintype photograph of her father into her pastille box and clicked shut the lid she supposed this was a kind of leavetaking a final goodbye but she must not think about that at the foot of the stairs her mother was waiting standing between nancy and the front door her face doughy and pale where it was not touched with feverish highlights of red stay faye wilcox said youd be mad to go out again now mama please nancy began i hear things her mother said i am not in the position i once was but i hear things things are happening in this town your name is mentioned she licked her lips and seemed for a moment to lose her way as if nancy thought her rope bridge of words and phrases had collapsed beneath her its not for myself she said finally softly im worried what could happen people are talking about guns ill be careful nancy said you were right you know what you said last time hes not dead or he wasnt when he left he just left left i guess the way youre leaving she looked up from the floor is it so awful here not awful at all nancy said feeling five years old was it my fault no well she straightened her shoulders if you go you ought not to come back i dont mean that to be cruel the way the town is i know i wish i had some money to give you ill be all right nancy said i have to go and faye wilcox stood aside though the motion seemed to pain her at twenty past noon jacob bingham the owner and proprietor of binghams hardware storelocated conveniently on the busy s block of lawson spursmiled at bob clawson the highschool principal who had just sailed through the big front door like an autumn breeze clawson made a show of examining the electrical fans the steelbladed lawn mowers the fishing reels and fly rods then smiling he presented himself at the cash counter dressed to the nines as usual in the glass display case there was a selection of bowie knives fine knives clawson commented wonderful knives jacob said amiably do anything for you open a tin can gut a fish slit your throat in the market no clawson said i guess not now you have that package ready for me jacob brought it forth from the storage drawer beneath the counter the package was heavy and it was wrapped in brown paper it smelled slightly oily he smiled watch yourself now clawson extended both arms and jacob loaded him down were very much in your debt clawson said jacob bingham frowned i understood there would be payment of course clawson said hastily i was speaking metaphorically well dont fall down with that now you need help with the door ill be fine jacob watched him leave cool air swirled in the door as clawson struggled out it was shaping up to be a fine day he thought a fine autumn day outside in his carhalf past noon by the clock on the civic buildingbob clawson plucked at the brown binding twine until the knot unraveled then spread back the oily leaves of paper thus revealed the two gauge hunting rifles lay in his lap greased and slick alien things he had not personally handled a rifle before the complexity of slots and levers was daunting but surely it could not be as complicated as it looked one aims he thought one fires he saw tim norblooms police car in his rearview mirror the police car pulled abreast of him and clawson rolled down his window conscious of the weight of the guns in his lap pleasant day norbloom said his big nordic horseface framed in the darkness of the patrol car clawson suppressed the instinctive distaste he felt for the man very nice indian summer everything on for tonight oh yes bingham came through yes indeed then ill be seeing you later were gathering at eight clawson said yessir norbloom shot him a mock salute ill be there clawson smiled perfunctorily and paused to savor the excitement growing inside him liza watched with great trepidation as creath brought up his hunting rifledisused these many yearsfrom the basement and began to clean and oil it he bent to the task like a man possessed his eyes intently focused and when she spoke to him he did not respond surely there was nothing dangerous in this liza felt as if events had somehow gone beyond her but surely bob clawson would not be party to do an enterprise that was physically dangerous creath she said tentatively creath if this is something if you dont feel you should be involved but he lifted his head to gaze at her and the expression on his face was a combination of implacability and silent horror so intense that she could not bear the weight of his attention she looked down and when she looked up again he had gone back to his work polishing the rifle barrel so intently that it seemed he might grind it to dust please god preserve him liza thought and drew the curtains against the impending night chapter seventeen travis did not locate bone until the sun was nearly down the meadow beyond the railway trestle was wide and overgrown with burdocks nettles and prairie grass he had followed twice along the tracks and ranged much deeper before he saw the blue pea coat like a discarded thing in a depression where the land sloped to the river he moved close enough to get a better lookno closer this was bone and bone is dead travis thought or very close he parted the dried weeds carefully the alien man lay curled on himself his long white wrists projecting from the cuffs of the jacket his shoes so eroded as to be functionless his watchcap clinging to the bony slope of his scalp the body was immense travis thought even curled and helpless like this he was able to see the chest wound or the evidence of it a long rustcolored patch running up the pea coat angry swatches of blood and skin peeking through your own deepest hidden face but not this surely surely this was just a broken thing pathetic he thought but impersonal like the crushed body of some unfortunate animal bone he whispered bone there was no response an eyelid fluttered unless he had imagined it travis moved closer through the brittle weeds the sunshine was oblique now and did not warm him bone he said bending over wake up anna sent me anna said and bones huge fist lashed out travis felt it thump into him lift him off his feet felt the astonishing momentum carry him backward he sat up slowly the fist had struck him squarely on the chest it might have broken a rib he felt a constriction as he gasped for his breath bone he said faintly the creature stood up it loomed a yard away from him huge as a gantry tower the eyes travis thought they were like annasthe pupils swollen to fill the socketsbut different too colder somehow hostile wary bone took one gasping breath and seemed to wince with pain your own deepest hidden face the words mocked him not this he thought not this thing wounded betrayed hardly human for its wounding and betrayal carefully travis stood up they faced each other bone travis said the creature looked at him bone anna sent me ill take you to anna i and he stepped forward bone raised his hand blue fire licked from his fingertips they hurt you travis said a part of him had long since panicked he was not sure where the words came from somewhere deep inside him they hurt you i know you trusted them and they hurt you i know let me help he took a step forward and thought involuntarily of his mother his mother who had shamed him dying and looking at him with an expression he could only interpret as reproach he had hated her then her ravaged body had cried out for his pity and he had withheld it she was dying of course she was dying dying for her sins for the hideous sins she had committed behind his back an old old bargain travis thought and felt a surge of guilt like electricity in him christ god could he truly have been so cruelhating her when she was dying hating her because she was dying he looked at bone maybe anna was right maybe this was what he had been then this disfigured thing suffused with pain so entirely that there was no room for kindness trust thought bone stood shivering regarding him from the depths of his dilated eyes his fists were clenched and white trembling travis reached out toward the monster shortly before dusk liza burack answered the timid knock at the front door and found faye wilcox shivering on the veranda why faye she said and was suddenly and obscurely afraid faye had lost the baptist womens election faye was here to exact some strange kind of revenge but faye said may i come in and it was so much like a plea a prayer that liza could only nod creath was still in the parlor the lights off dusk thickening about him like a viscous fluid liza steered faye wilcox past him and into the kitchen faye sat at the small formica table haphazardly dressed her hair in loops and tangles down her broad back and it was a moment before liza remembered to say coffee no thank you liza stood uneasily with her spine against the kitchen counter she was conscious of the ticking of the clock faye if its about the election election the wilcox woman seemed not to understand electionno its much more serious than that she adjusted her smudged bifocals nancys gone did you know that nancy gone where where he is i think where travis is you know i pray they both get away safely truly i pray for that is it unchristian liza that i should want them both to leave but if they stay here they will be hurt worse she looked at liza directly its tonight you know i dont understand tonight you mean the men who are meeting together meeting together do you believe thats what theyre doing is that why creath is cleaning his rifle liza faye wilcox put her plump hands palms downward on the table her lips were pursed they are a posse a mob vigilante liza thought but you cant know that how could i not the rumor is all about town but you dont need a rumor to know but travis surely travis has left i believe he has not not while nancy is here liza said nothing only gripped the beveled edges of the kitchen counter faye stood up suddenly your own sisters child how can you be so hard travis is lost she thought dizzily she had written him out of the book of her heart but she thought of creath with his rifle of the other men with theirs faye no faye wilcox said bleakly it was stupid to come here she went to the kitchen door and opened it the hinges squealed a breeze danced inside there was the smell of woodsmoke it was what liza had always loved about autumn that melancholy perfume on the air the smell of winter stalking somewhere beyond the horizon a dry leaf windborne swirled over the kitchen floor pray for them faye said please do at least that much liza swallowed hard and nodded faye wilcox closed the door behind her when the time came for creath to leave the house the fear liza felt was for him as much as for travis it had lodged in her breast like a living thing outside two big sedans pulled up and sounded their horns creath rose from his chair with glacial slowness and went to the door his rifle was in his hand liza took his arm creath dont go he turned to stare at her and she fixed her eyes willfully on his redchecked shirt his old hunting shirt it doesnt matter what they want stay something bad might happen i dont want you to get hurt but he pulled his arm free the oily metallic smell of the gun was chokingly strong liza felt her eyes fill with tears this is bought creath said and she knew at once that he did not mean the gun in his hand but the whole of it the men waiting outside the baptist women the tent revival all this skein of things and people into which she liza had purposefully woven them and she took a step backward her breath catching in her throat bought and paid for creath said solemnly we cant take it back now no liza thought it cannot be too late she thought of faye wilcox standing like a funeral stone in the kitchen not an hour ago a posse a mob pray for them and felt fear close about her like a cloak creath had opened the door now had turned his back a cold gust of autumn air escorted him toward those two black cars idling in the shadows of the box elders and she thought he will die he wont come back again she thought dear god forgive me and held out her hand to him stupidly imploringly creath but the cars were pulling away now engines growling like animals against the night and liza faltered on the old boards of the veranda alone clutching her white knit sweater about her throat and thinking he was right this is bought bought and paid for nancy brought the porcelain bowl to annas lips she drank a little and the aura of blue fireit was constant nowreceded a little travis is bringing bone here travis is attempting to nancy sat back considering it the sun was gone on cloudless blue days like this the darkness came down quickly the sky beyond the open door of the switchmans shack was giving up the last of its glow and she used the time to light a candle she was surprised to find that her hand was trembling she turned to anna how little there was left of her she had faded almost to transparency her humanity a frail vessel for this blue light that threatened to burst out of her to disperse nancy supposed like a puff of smoke and she would be lost on the wind then vanished tell me what its like nancy said impulsively anna turned her head the jeweled world yes a place anna said im sorry i cant describe it in terms you would understand not like this place nancy said no and very beautiful often you dream of it yes i dream of it sometimes i know anna said her voice far away you must be very powerful to be able to come here perhaps too powerful she means bone nancy thought bone might be dangerous powerful enough to come here powerful enough to go back i hope so did you find what you wanted here and anna smiled faintly i dont know i think so yes a sojourn in the wilderness you might ask yourself the same question is that where i am in the wilderness but it was a silly question she gazed around herself this shack the prairie the night for a long time i think anna said we are all exiles she said i envy you i wish i had a place to go back to here anna said she held out her hand nancy looked dubiously at her its all i have to give the alien woman said not much a little nancy touched her she supposed afterward that what anna had given her was a kind of memory a glimpse into annas own past it was inexpressible evanescent all that lingered was the impression of a great light and warmth and vibrant color as if nancy thought she had penetrated into the heart of the sun and the memory inadequate as it was contained a small heat of its own it warmed and reassured her i will keep this she thought i will carry this memory like a charm and only bring it out when i need it anna gazed impassively at her your world nancy said solemnly is very strange and beautiful anna smiled so is yours is it nancy looked up surprised the candle flickered outside this shack a sea of prairie grass bent and hissed in the wind she said slowly it could be i guess it could be but then they heard the first of the gunshots far away but clear and distinct pinpricks of sound etched against the vastness of the night when they approached the railway trestle both drivers switched off their lights and the black cars rolled like tumbrils off the main road and across the stubbled meadow wheels grinding engines laboring the railway trestle was black in the moonlight stone and iron and creath fancied he could smell it a stink of wood and grease and sootblackened brick it was hateful bob clawson sat with his belly up against the steering wheel dressed for maybe the first time in his life in clothes that were less than immaculate old pants flannel shirt threadbare jacketand hell likely burn them in the morning creath thought clawson switched off the ignition and the ensuing silence was like a weight nobody spoke there were six men in the car counting himself clawson was the leader nobody spoke creath observed unless clawson spoke first as if they needed his approval but greg morrow sat in the back seat with his daddys big shotgun on his lap and his eagerness was palpable a presence in the car creath had been aware of it for the last quarter mile when the only sounds had been the rumble of the engine and the hiss of his own strained breathing everybody out clawson said and it was not much more than a whisper they stood in the moonlight with their rifles creath felt faintly ridiculous this army he thought this twobit infantry half of us scared of the dark the other car had pulled up ahead tim norbloom was in charge of that little battalion creath felt the heft of the rifle in his hand they had all loaded their weapons during the ride over and the phrase that ran through creaths head idiotically was armed and dangerous he looked at greg morrow a shadow against the deeper dark he could not be sure but he believed the boy was grinning armed and dangerous ahead tim norblooms crowd had opened the trunk of the other car norbloom drew out the torches lengths of thick pine doweling or spruce twobytwos wrapped at one end in oily cloth norbloom and clawsons group moved together made a circle to cut the wind norbloom handed out four of the torchesgreg took one creath did not clawson drew a box of safety matches from his jacket pocket the torches did not want to take the flame at first the blackened cotton seeming to resist its own incineration but then gregs torch whooshed up all at once sparking into the night and he passed on the fire to the others there was no hiding now they had to hurry they ran across the meadow toward the railway trestle creath lagging behind his breath laboring the silence at first was eerie but then greg morrow let out a long ululating war whoop that seemed to strike a primitive chord in the other men the trestle was nearer now their torches casting a red glow against the black bricks of it their own shadows huge and manic and others of them took up gregs war cry someone fired a gun into the sky echoes bounded back from the trestle arches and to the men just coming awake in there creath thought it must seem as if a part of hell itself had come to earth among them they moved sluggishly at first and then more desperately a pitifully few men to have inspired this army but that was irrelevant now now there was no returning this was bought and paid for two hoboes ran shrieking into the cold river striking out for the other side their heads disappeared beneath the black water and creath could not tell then in the flood and panic whether they survived or were carried away the vigilantes were laughing swirling their torches like kids swinging sparklers on independence day but their laughter was not childish or rather creath thought dizzily it was the shrill and hysterical laughter of a child torturing a cat there was nothing of innocence in it he stood still watching the gun was a dead thing in his hand my good christ he thought what if she is here seducer temptress succubus the source of his sin but he knew instantly that he could not raise this rifle to her and creath felt a lightness in him then a feverish buoyancy as if his feet might spontaneously lift him from this cold fallow ground and deliver him up to some thing or place he could not imagine death judgment the stars he knew that bob clawson was gazing at him had taken stern note of his immobility but there was no way to respond and in truth he no longer cared he watched greg morrow whirling his torch about his head the firelight seemed to have transformed him his grin was maniacal and his eyes feverish creath guessed that the boy was paying back some old debt avenging somehow some irretrievable humiliation the tramps had mostly fled the guns had been fired but only into the air the townsmen had begun to huddle together sheepishly now in the stinking darkness but greg was oblivious possessed he threw the stub of his torch onto the roof of one of these hovels oily pasteboard sheets that roared at once into flame creath felt his heart skip a beat the heat washed over him and he thought she could be in there tim norbloom stepped forwardplaying the policeman nowand put a restraining hand on gregs shoulder just then a figure broke from the burning hovel running for the river anna creath thought for one agonizing moment but it was not only a hobo a dark and halfnaked man possibly a negro creath had begun to relax when he saw greg raise the rifle and sight along it and pull the trigger the explosion in this confined space beneath the trestle was deafening creath winced and when he opened his eyes he saw the tramp dead or mortally wounded spreadeagled on the ground the light of the burning hovel danced on his skin he might have been bleeding in this light everything was bloody it changes things creath thought they had come here prepared to kill but in the event they had backed away from it and it was gregs fault mainly he had misled them there was no threat in this pathetic slum creath saw tim norbloom eyeing the boy with frank contempt some of the men cursed the enormity of this was too great they felt too much like murderers you too tim norbloom creath thought that guilt is palpable in this strange hour his mind was quite lucid and creath imagined he could read other mens thoughts there was a kind of skewed victory in it despite the dead man on the ground because she had not been here anna was still alive and a part of him exalted at the thought the men walked back to the cars the night had soured on them creath his ears still ringing with the proximity of the gunshots watched bob clawson remonstrating with greg morrow saw the boys impassioned response clawson went to norbloom then and the two of them spoke heatedly creath heard the sound but could not make sense of it the trestle was eerily lit by the embers of the hoovertown and a freight train came highballing out of the east oblivious clawson and norbloom were arguing norbloom turned away his fists clenched and climbed into the second of the two automobiles the two parties broke up and creath watched norblooms sedan bouncing over the rutted soil clawson sat at the wheel of his own car stonily his cheeks were flushed pink creath climbed in last thank god its at least over he said clawson looked back at greg greg stared at him were not done yet clawson said grimly norbloom is an idiot its important to finish this we have begun it and we are obliged to finish it one more place greg said evenly ill show you the way please god no creath thought and bob clawson revved the motor travis saw the trestle fire from a distance and circled to the south keeping to a line of windbreak trees white smoke curled up in the moonlight and the cold wind carried the hoarse shouting of the men across the prairie bone was frightened travis could tell he crouched in a drainage ditch and the alien crouched beside him the alien must be tremendously strong travis thought to have come even this far his jacket was a mass of blood and there was fresh blood welling up now a brighter red in the moonlight an ordinary man would have died but bone was not ordinary not a man bones eyes were fixed on the trestle and the flicker of fires there youve seen this kind of thing before travis said bone did not respond only stared travis took it for a kind of assent they crouched hidden and listened to the snap of gunshots travis glanced periodically at bone who seemed wreathed with a fire of his own a flickering aura but it cast no shadows in the darkness beneath the trees and travis guessed another man might see nothing at all when the shouting died away and the gunshots ceased travis and bone moved closer travis imbued with a sense of deep foreboding now there had been violence now some invisible border had been passed the hobo jungle was in embers there was no one left here only the body of a black man travis had known very slightly harley was his name harley was dead from a gunshot wound to the back travis knelt over the body he could not bring himself to touch it a revulsion not at death but at his own utter helplessness i knew this man he thought bone watched him kneeling and after a moment bone extended his arm and touched him visions ran like a river between them travis fell back under the assault of the projected memories this was bone he thought dazedly bone had seen too many places like this an ocean of them had seen men burned beaten trampled under foot the cavalcade of images was stunning faces and bodies like schools of fish travis gazed up in awe at that pale skull of a face he is the ultimate exile he thought king of exiles and he felt all the fists that had pummeled him all the blows and curses saw deacon and archie bent over him then deacon with a pistol in his hand and archie dead beside him he saw the railroad cops gather about bone in a ring and felt what bone had felt as he struck out and sent them whirling into the chaos that separates spacetime from spacetime christ almighty travis whispered you can do that you can really do that bone stood erect his aura deepened his eyes were squeezed shut his face disguised beneath his own cold illumination sweet jesus travis thought he could be me the lines of his face rippled like a reflection in deep water travis turned away gasping so little of humanity left in this creature your own deepest hidden face was that possible maybe so bone and the pale woman both inside him janusfaced calling over the gaps and chasms of him toward some unimaginable union but that made him think of anna and of nancy and of where the vigilantes might have gone from here he made himself stand up bone follow me he said bone stepped forward and stumbled the leg wound travis thought this tremendous energy faltering the human fraction of him too close to death no longer as frightened as he was travis put his arm around the alien and the two of them loped eastward ludicrous in the moonlight along the frozen bank of the river chapter eighteen the interior of the switchmans shack was full of radiance the human parts of anna hidden beneath this amorphous glow what remained of the alien womans human disguise was so diminished though still in its fragile way beautifulthat nancy felt frightened she thought in a way i am in the wilderness the wilderness was where you confronted the basic things nancy thought life and death and here she was approaching a strange wasteland facetoface with annas transformation there had been nothing in her life to prepare her for this she was out here all by herself out here in the wilderness travis must be near she thought travis and bone she risked a glance at annathat inhumanly white body in its nexus of glowand shivered maybe travis had been right all along there was nothing human in the motivation of these creatures maybe she had been used and used would be discarded there wasnt annas liquid voice to reassure her now only a kind of faith faith and kinship the night was very dark please travis she thought please hurry up outside in the darkness an automobile engine murmured and stopped a door slammed shut nancy gasped at the sound of it anna anna wake up somebodys here annas eyes sprang open but the pupils had eclipsed the whites blue fire seemed to coalesce into fibrous wings behind her and she showed no sign of human comprehension as they moved along the riverbank travis supported the alien mans weight which was negligible he must be hollowboned travis thought like a bird but he guessed it was only the shedding of this human skin the strange light burned brightly about him and travis touching him was strangely affected by it the night had come alive with phantom shapes and colors he sensed dizzily the truth of what anna had told him there were worlds within worlds kinds and shapes of worlds which coexisted with this one infinitely layered and infinitely complex he concentrated on following the riverbank by starlight step by step frightened that he might lose his way a misstep travis thought and we could tumble off the earth altogether bone was dying or coming to lifeas much one thing as the other so far as travis could tell certainly this physical part of him was very weak bone could not have come this distance without traviss help but the alien part of bone seemed to be growing steadily stronger as if the proximity to anna were feeding him we must be a beacon light travis thought down here along the riverbed thin shales of ice had formed in the hollows of the ground and travis saw his own reflection in them and bones luminous against the starry sky and almost too strange to bear in some way he thought bone had become very powerful indeed just a little farther travis said he was not sure the alien understood him it was a reassurance as much for himself as for bone just a little farther now the place where bone had struck him was throbbing and it pained him when he breathed bone lurched against him and travis bit his lip to keep from crying out one step at a time he thought steady in some way travis thought he is me ugly outcast betrayed that ravaged face these wounds and i am bearing him toward a healing i cannot share for me no pale woman but there was no such creature anna had said among humankind anna herself was a freak a kind of monster as bone was a monster human beings she had said carried such monsters inside themselves always estranged or buried despised and unforgiven walk he thought just walk the brittle reeds snapped beneath his feet he looked up and the stars seemed to dance about him like fireflies but then he thought some conciliation is possible must be himself finding and forgiving himself chasms mended old wounds healed just walk he thought landmarks were difficult to follow in this light he recognized the steeple of the train station and then it seemed only a moment later the stand of box elders surrounding the meadow where the switchmans shack stood up here he told bone up the riverbank i guess we made it travis scrabbled up the hardpacked mud with bone beside him so close now he thought so close but at the top of the rivers gentle slope he paused the moon had set but in the starlightand a gentler illumination that seemed to emanate from bone from the shack from the meadow itselfhe was able to see the black sedan parked in the dark of the trees and the men who climbed out of it bone he said tentatively but bone stood straight up his weakness and his humanity both blasted away in a sudden and apocalyptic burst of blue light across the meadow six figures approached the switchmans shack and bone watching them roared out his pain and indignation he had seen them before he knew what they were bone flew across the meadow on a whirlwind of strange energies his humanity fading like firefly light these were killers murderers the same cruel species he had seen so often in the railyards but now the other was close he must not let them threaten her this new part of him not human was hugely strong and bone abandoned himself to it they were his enemies they would fall he felt the lightless flames that danced at his fingertips and thought they must it was his last human thought creath climbing out of the car in the silent meadow felt his legs begin to buckle beneath him it was dark here past midnight now the possibility of murder all too imminent it was written in these men in their grim intensity maybe they were not murderers by natureif there was such a thingbut they had sundered this night all their daylight inhibitions this was their halloween their bacchanalia and clawson was no longer the focus clawson had subtly deferred to greg morrow who more precisely embodied the spirit of the adventure it was greg who had committed the boldest transgression it was greg who had murdered a man quiet now greg morrow said as the five men formed up behind him only rifles tonight no torches they are out here im sure of it fornicators and adulterers clawson said as if to reassure himself worse than that greg murmured and periodically he turned his eyes toward creath as if to say i did not plan this some wild trajectory has carried us all here but it is right and just andcreath saw this in his eyesa fitting culmination greg morrow creath saw was not wholly sane but he thought christ which of us is which of us out here in the darkness they crept through the trees creath felt his own cold sweat breaking out on his forehead he shivered with it there was frost on everything a starry glittering winter cutting close and he thought well what if she is here what then there was no answer in him he felt the heft of the rifle in his hand but all these other men had rifles too greg bulled ahead to this pathetic tumbledown shack the place where the halfcrazed railway switchman colliuto had lived until some kids found him dead of exposure back in the spring of the years and the weather had not been kind to the place slat walls tarpaper roof a hole up top where a stovepipe might once have exited plugged now with a birds nest of hard mud and prairie grass cold and filthy inside there creath thought surely it could not be occupiedbut a faint light leaked through the wallboards greg with that crazy flushed grin fixed in place kicked through the door it fell away like pasteboard before him dust billowed up the men pressed closer and then in the eerie blue light fell back creath felt his neck hairs standing erect the thing in there craned its head to gaze at him a lifetime of religious fears made him step away in deference these other men shrieked out their dismay but it is only the natural culmination creath thought wildly the reasonable consequence we are beyond the pale now now we consort with demons and angels in truth he could not say which this was clearly the creature was not human it stood up within the confines of the shack and creath was aware of its luminous wingsif they were wings spread out behind it peacock vortices of light without substance and he peered into that face he would have thought there was no capacity for shock left him but his eyes widened in stunned recognition it was her his limbs felt cold and distant as ice demon or angel he thought it was her sweet god his secret love loved and hated and stolen from him he moved his mouth anna and she came forward the other men fled back toward the automobile christ look there bob clawson was shouting another of the damned monsterson the riverbank creath saw it then too hurtling toward them across the meadow a similar creature he could feel its anger even at this distance the cars motor roared now only the two of them were left here creath and greg equally immobile staring and helpless because creath thought in some way we have always expected this we have earned it his thoughts moved with a high wild lucidity this is bought and paid for the wilcox girl nancy broke from the shack and ran for the riverbank her arms pinwheeling the angel looked at creath with annas face inscrutable the demon hurtled toward him creath turned in a kind of graceless slow motion and saw greg morrow raise his rifle bone travis said faintly but there was no calling him back travis fell to his hands and knees in the frozen meadow it was all happening too fast for him bone fled across the meadow like the ghost of his own rages and fears at last set loose he will kill them all travis thought god help us and he thought about nancy but she had broken free from the shack and was moving toward him unmindful of his own pain he stood and ran to her she came into his arms but he could not look away he saw boneall light and fire and painconverging on the townsmen who scattered before him nancy seemed to want to burrow into him but he pushed her back listen he said we have to get away bones crazy hes full of hatredeverything he learned here is hatredand we have to get away from him no nancy said anna promised she didnt promise anything this is dangerous this has always been dangerous nancy he tugged at her come on we can move down and away along the riverbank travis thought that would be good that might afford them some safety but he did not see greg morrow aiming his rifle across the empty meadow and he could only be helplessly surprised at the sound of it at the pain of the bullet as it passed through his shoulder the crack of the rifle broke his trance greg had fired and missed the demon thing but seemed unaware of it creath watched the boys supernatural steadiness as he swung the weapon toward the switchmans shack the demon was almost on them and creath was able to hear the sound it made an eerie and inhuman wailing a howl compressed of all the sorrow and indignity of the world it chilled him the thing must be able to see creath thought must know that it could not reach greg morrow before he committed the act he was so obviously contemplating the boy swung up the rifle barrel toward the thing in the shackthe annathing how beautiful she still was strange that he could admit it even to himself and there seemed plenty of time for admissions in this new lucidity of his everything moving at quarter speed it should be loathsome the way she had changed but she was not loathsome merely delicate fragile embedded in light wrapped round with amber and turquoise light winged with light the beauty in it was ethereal beyond lust heartbreaking it spokeas it had always he guessed spokento his deepest nugget of self he thought of things lost time lost opportunities lost whole lives lost in the living of a life tears sprang to his eyes i am too old to cry he thought too old and too weary and too close to death death wheeling toward him on an autumn wind shimmering it was this beauty that greg must hate he thought and saw the boy targeting his rifle on her creath sighed death so close but not close enough to save her he imagined he could see the boys finger tightening on the trigger his own gun flew up he was hardly conscious of it the recoil bucked it into his shoulder creath cried out with the pain greg morrow spun away the bullet had taken him cleanly he was dead at once his rifle firedthe reflexive closing of the fingersbut the bullet went wild creath felt his own rifle drop to the ground anna was alive yet she turned her eyes on him round inscrutable wells that was good creath thought that she would live this at least the demon fell on greg morrows body appeared to pick it up and fling itbut this made no sensein a direction that was not any perceptible direction the body simply disappeared creath looked at the demon calmly and saw a face there indistinct but full of rage and that too he thought was good and proper that death should have a face creath turned to confront the creature openhanded death came on him like a flaming sword go on travis told nancy down the riverbank hide she didnt want to leave him but she glanced at the figure of bonebone transformedand retreated sobbing from the meadow travis could not move the pain of the bullet wound had radiated through him all the fatigue of these last few days had come down on him all at once like sleep his eyelids were heavy strange he thought to be on the edge of death and only feel this weariness on his back in the icy meadow travis turned his head the automobile had gone bone moved in on the two men remaininggreg and creath he recognized their silhouettes in the moonlightand then creath raised his rifle it all happened too quickly to follow then bone was on them and they were gone tossed into that limbo between worlds discarded dead bone turned back toward him travis lay helplessly watching as the monster approached him there was nothing of bone left in this thing it was made of light but it was not without substance its footsteps pressed into the prairie grass it smelled of ozone and burning leaves and travis did not suppose it could support itself long in this world it contradicted too many of the natural laws you could tell by looking such a thing ought not to exist the rage and pain of it were still perceptible it had a purpose travis sensed and the purpose was to protect the annathing long enough for their coupling to take place it was hostile to every threat and it knew him the monster hovered over him your own deepest hidden face betrayed he thought deceived yes striking out now unbound no victims left but himself but if this was himself then he could no longer deny it he gazed without fear into those fiery eyes the self submitting to the verdict of the self christ knows he had done it to others had turned on his dying mother had turned on nancy when she needed him now himself it was only logical kill me he whispered kill me then if thats what youve come to do but the creature turned away it went to the shack the meadow was suddenly prosaically empty travis gaped up at the stars nancy ran to him weeping she staunched his wound and made a sort of pillow of prairie grass for him she took off her own cloth coat and laid it over him the night was cold and travis was grateful chapter nineteen through what remained of the night she kept him warm travis was intermittently lucid he imagined he could see the stars wheeling overhead when the dawn came he said are they in there in the shack yes he sat up though the effort was murderous nancy said you need a doctor he shook his head he wasnt bleeding anymore and he could move his arm it was a clean wound and might not infect i need to get warm i need food we could build a fire but it might draw somebodys attention build it travis said there wont be anybody coming out here today he warmed himself at the fire he still did not trust himself to walk dizziness came and went and nausea nancy brought him water from the river but she knew he needed to eat too theres some food left in the shack nancy said i wonder how long it takes dont know she never said it was unimaginable the prodigies of healing that must be going on in there she had seen bone and she knew anna and she could not conceive of a single creature emerging from that marriage of fire and water earth and air travis looked at her you know we cant go back i know theres nowhere much we can go i thought maybe west california maybe she shrugged its warmer he nodded nancy said you mean it what about traveling together yes i mean if youre willing she gazed at him as if from a distance what did you see out there with bone what did he show you travis shrugged they appeared anna and bone briefly at noon the sunlight made everything prosaic the air was still cool but the autumn sun beat down with real pressure everything was outlined in it nancy thought each stalk of grass the grain elevators black on the horizon a sparrow swooping across the meadow there were dust motes everywhere they emerged from the switchmans shack a single being now she could see none of bone or anna in this creature she was reminded instead of a sort of birdthose structureless wings of light behind it a graceful arch that suggested a body swirls of darkness for eyes it did not fly but hung suspended in the air buoyant she held her breath the creature was difficult to look at and seemed to possess too many angles as if a stainedglass church window had been folded and folded on itself the delicate rose and amber light caught up in labyrinths the eye could not trace it moved toward travis nancy thought he might struggle to his feet even injured as he was might run away but he did not the creature advanced on him and he only looked at it his eyes wide and fearless dear god nancy thought what did he learn out there the creature hovered she saw one wing come down its membrane of light moved across travis or through himlike a caress the gesture was at once so tender and so entirely alien that nancy felt a tingling at her neck then the creature moved away rose up or diminished she could not say which she went to travis with an expression of slow wonder he peeled away the bandage nancy had made for him the wound was closed there was only the hint of a scar they know us he told her hoarse with awe they know us yet and then they were alone the creature that was anna and bone moved away across the meadow in an impossible motion that made her blink and avert her eyes gone she thought vanished into the lanes and pathless alleys between the worlds and for a moment she was stricken with an inexpressible longing her memory of the jeweled world was strong in her and she thought i want to follow follow but bone and anna were gone where there was no following vanished along some invisible axis there was only the prairieprairie grass buckbrush dry foxtail and lupine running in swells to a distant shore of sky summer and winter spring and fall contained in it somehow all at onceand nancy thought why i guess it is enough it is enough she moved with trepidation into the dark hollow of the vacant shack it seemed now as if she had lived much of her life in this confined spacemade alien curiously by annas absence the door had fallen away when greg morrow kicked it fingers of sunlight probed into all the secret places the mattress was tawdry and stained annas old clothes in a heap on it and bones there too his old blue pea coat bloodstaineddiscarded in a corner she folded the dress neatly and put it aside it was a small gesture but soothing the blue pea coat was heavy with blood but deserved she thought the same act of respect but when she lifted it in her hand a bundle dropped from one of its pockets nancy curious reached for it coda the freight car they rode out of haute montagne was crowded and nancy was dismayed by the people who filled it these were not just hoboes like the men she had seen under the railway trestle but whole families men and women and children migrating westward with winter and poverty hard behind them outcasts she thought exiles and how easily we might have joined them become indistinguishable from them in truth she thought we are not much better off despite the money that had fallen from bones pea coat enough to buy food pay a little rentbut too she thought in some way we are different it was written in traviss face the granaries and the water tower fell away behind them a cold wind came through the slats in the freight car and made her press into traviss shoulder he held her with a gentleness she had not sensed in him before she looked at his face and he was frowning into the gray distance worried she guessed about where they were going and what they would do there but there was a second quality in him that was unfamiliar utterly new he sensed her attention and smiled at her and it was the smile nancy thought wonderingly of a man who has just forgiven someone or who has been himself forgiven there were no funeral services held in haute montagne in the month of november no one would say though some suspected that creath burack was dead liza lit a candle in the parlor window each night all that cold month in the hope that her husband might find his way home but he did not and come the first snow liza laid away the candlestick in a bureau drawer secure between a lavender sachet and a neatly folded linen tablecloth for him as for her there was no returning
