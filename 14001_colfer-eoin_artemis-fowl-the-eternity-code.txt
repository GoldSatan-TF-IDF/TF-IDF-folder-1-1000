eoin colfer artemis fowl the eternity code prologue excerpt from artemis fowls diary disk encrypted for the past two years my business enterprises have thrived without parental interference in this time i have sold the pyramids to a western businessman forged and auctioned off the lost diaries of leonardo da vinci and separated the fairy people from a large portion of their precious gold but my freedom to plot is almost at an end as i write my father lies in a hospital bed in helsinki where he recovers after a twoyear imprisonment by the russian mafiya he is still unconscious following his ordeal but he will awaken soon and retake control of the fowl finances with two parents resident in fowl manor it will be impossible for me to conduct my various illegal ventures undetected previously this would not have been a problem as my father was a bigger crook than me but mother is determined that the fowls are going straight however there is time for one last job something that my mother would not approve of i dont think the fairy folk would like it much either so i shall not tell them part attack chapter the cube en fin knightsbridge london artemis fowl was almost content his father would be discharged from helsinkis university hospital any day now he himself was looking forward to a delicious late lunch at en fin a london seafood restaurant and his business contact should arrive any moment all according to plan his bodyguard butler was not quite so relaxed but then again he was never truly at ease one did not become one of the worlds deadliest men by dropping ones guard the giant eurasian flitted between tables in the knightsbridge bistro positioning the usual security items and clearing exit routes are you wearing the earplugs he asked his employer artemis sighed deeply yes butler though i hardly think we are in danger here its a perfectly legal business meeting in broad daylight for heavens sake the earplugs were actually sonic filter sponges cannibalized from fairy lower elements police helmets butler had obtained the helmets along with a treasure trove of fairy technology over a year previously when one of artemiss schemes pitted him against a fairy swat team the sponges were grown in lep labs and had tiny porous membranes that sealed automatically when decibel levels surpassed safety standards maybe so artemis but the thing about assassins is that they like to catch you unawares perhaps replied artemis perusing the menus entree section but who could possibly have a motive to kill us butler shot one of the halfdozen diners a fierce glare just in case she was planning something the woman must have been at least eighty they might not be after us remember jon spiro is a powerful man he put a lot of companies out of business we could be caught in a crossfire artemis nodded as usual butler was right which explained why they were both still alive jon spiro the american he was meeting was just the kind of man to attract assassins bullets a successful it billionaire with a shady past and alleged mob connections rumour had it that his company fission chips had made it to the top on the back of stolen research of course nothing was ever proved not that chicagos district attorney hadnt tried several times a waitress wandered over giving them a dazzling smile hello there young man would you like to see the childrens menu a vein pulsed in artemiss temple no mademoiselle i would not like to see the childrens menu i have no doubt the childrens menu itself tastes better than the meals on it i would like to order a la carte or dont you serve fish to minors the waitresss smile shrank by a couple of molars artemiss vocabulary had that effect on most people butler rolled his eyes and artemis wondered who would want to kill him most of the waiters and tailors in europe for a start yes sir stammered the unfortunate waitress whatever you like what i would like is a medley of shark and swordfish panseared on a bed of vegetables and new potatoes and to drink spring water irish if you have it and no ice please as your ice is no doubt made from tap water which rather defeats the purpose of spring water the waitress scurried to the kitchen relieved to escape from the pale youth at table six shed seen a vampire movie once the undead creature had the very same hypnotic stare maybe the kid spoke like a grownup because he was actually five hundred years old artemis smiled in anticipation of his meal unaware of the consternation hed caused youre going to be a big hit at the school dances butler commented pardon that poor girl was almost in tears it wouldnt hurt you to be nice occasionally artemis was surprised butler rarely offered opinions on personal matters i dont see myself at school dances butler dancing isnt the point its all about communication communication scoffed young master fowl i doubt there is a teenager alive with a vocabulary equal to mine butler was about to point out the difference between talking and communicating when the restaurant door opened a small tanned man entered flanked by a veritable giant jon spiro and his security butler bent low to whisper in his charges ear be careful artemis i know the big one by reputation spiro wound through the tables arms outstretched he was a middleaged american thin as a javelin and barely taller than artemis himself in the eighties shipping had been his thing in the nineties he made a killing in stocks and shares now it was communications he wore his trademark white linen suit and there was enough jewellery hanging from his wrists and fingers to gold leaf the taj mahal artemis rose to greet his associate mister spiro welcome hey little artemis fowl how the hell are you artemis shook the mans hand his jewellery jangled like a rattlesnakes tail i am well glad you could come spiro took a chair artemis fowl calls with a proposition i wouldve walked across broken glass to be here the bodyguards appraised each other openly apart from their bulk the two were polar opposites butler was the epitome of understated efficiency black suit shaven head as inconspicuous as it was possible to be at almost seven feet tall the newcomer had bleached blond hair a cutoff tshirt and silver pirate rings in both ears this was not a man who wanted to be forgotten or ignored arno blunt said butler ive heard about you blunt took up his position at jon spiros shoulder butler one of the butlers he said in a new zealand drawl i hear you guys are the best thats what i hear lets hope we dont have to find out spiro laughed it sounded like a box of crickets arno please we are among friends here this is not a day for threats butler was not so sure his soldiers sense was buzzing like a nest of hornets at the base of his skull there was danger here so my friend to business said spiro fixing artemis with his closeset dark eyes ive been salivating all the way across the atlantic what have you got for me artemis frowned hed hoped business could wait until after lunch wouldnt you like to see a menu no i dont eat much any more pills and liquids mostly gut problems very well said artemis laying an aluminum briefcase on the table to business then he flipped the cases lid revealing a red cube the size of a minidisc player nestling in blue foam spiro cleaned his spectacles with the tail end of his tie what am i seeing here kid artemis placed the shining box on the table the future mister spiro ahead of schedule jon spiro leaned in taking a good look looks like a paperweight to me arno blunt sniggered his eyes taunting butler a demonstration then said artemis picking up the metal box he pressed a button and the gadget purred into life sections slid back to reveal speakers and a screen cute muttered spiro i flew three thousand miles for a microtv artemis nodded a microtv but also a verbally controlled computer a mobile phone a diagnostic aid this little box can read any information on absolutely any platform electrical or organic it can play videos laserdiscs dvds go online retrieve email hack any computer it can even scan your chest to see how fast your hearts beating its battery is good for two years and of course its completely wireless artemis paused to let it sink in spiros eyes seemed huge behind his spectacles you mean this box will render all other technology obsolete your computer plants will be worthless the american took several deep breaths but how how artemis flipped the box over an infrared sensor pulsed gently on the back this is the secret an omnisensor it can read anything you ask it to and if the source is programmed in it can piggyback any satellite you choose spiro wagged a finger but thats illegal isnt it no no said artemis smiling there are no laws against something like this and there wont be for at least two years after it comes out look how long it took to shut down napster the american rested his face in his hands it was too much i dont understand this is years no decades ahead of anything we have now youre nothing but a thirteenyearold kid how did you do it artemis thought for a second what was he going to say sixteen months ago butler took on a lower elements police retrieval squad and confiscated their fairy technology then he artemis had taken the components and built this wonderful box hardly lets just say im a very smart boy mister spiro spiros eyes narrowed maybe not as smart as youd like us to think i want a demonstration fair enough artemis nodded do you have a mobile phone naturally spiro placed his mobile phone on the table it was the latest fission chips model secure i take it spiro nodded arrogantly five hundred bit encryption best in its class youre not getting into the fission without a code we shall see artemis pointed the sensor at the handset the screen instantly displayed an image of the mobile phones workings download enquired a metallic voice from the speaker confirm in less than a second the job was done download complete said the box with a hint of smugness spiro was aghast i dont believe it that system cost twenty million dollars worthless said artemis showing him the screen would you like to call home or maybe move some funds around you really shouldnt keep your bank account numbers on a sim card the american thought for several moments its a trick he pronounced finally you mustve known about my phone somehow dont ask me how you got access to it earlier that is logical admitted artemis its what i would suspect name your test spiro cast his eyes around the restaurant fingers drumming the tabletop over there he said pointing to a video shelf above the bar play one of those tapes thats it itll do for a start arno blunt made a huge show of flicking through the tapes eventually selecting one without a label he slapped it down on the table bouncing the engraved silver cutlery into the air artemis resisted the urge to roll his eyes and placed the red box directly on to the tapes surface an image of the cassettes innards appeared on the tiny plasma screen download asked the box artemis nodded download compensate and play again the operation was completed in under a second an old episode of an english soap crackled into life dvd quality commented artemis regardless of the input the c cube will compensate the what c cube repeated artemis the name i have given my little box a tad obvious i admit but appropriate the cube that sees everything spiro snatched the video cassette check it he ordered tossing the tape to arno blunt the bleachedblond bodyguard activated the bars tv sliding the video into its slot coronation street flickered across the screen the same show nowhere near the same quality convinced asked artemis the american tinkered with one of his many bracelets almost one last test i have a feeling that the government is monitoring me could you check it out artemis thought for a moment then addressed the red box again cube do you read any surveillance beams concentrated on this building the machine whirred for a moment the strongest ion beam is eighty kilometres due west emanating from us satellite code number stp registered to the central intelligence agency estimated time of arrival eight minutes there are also several lep probes connected to artemis hit the mute button before the cube could continue obviously the computers fairy components could pick up lower elements technology too he would have to remedy that in the wrong hands that information would be devastating to fairy security whats the matter kid the box was still talking who are the lep artemis shrugged no pay no play as you americans say one example is enough the cia no less the cia breathed spiro they suspect me of selling military secrets theyve pulled one of their birds out of orbit just to track me or perhaps me noted artemis perhaps you agreed spiro youre looking more dangerous by the second arno blunt chuckled derisively butler ignored it one of them had to be professional spiro cracked his knuckles a habit artemis detested weve got eight minutes so lets get down to the nitty gritty kid how much for the box artemis was not paying attention distracted by the lep information that the cube had almost revealed in a careless moment he had nearly exposed his subterranean friends to exactly the kind of man who would exploit them im sorry what did you say i said how much for the box firstly its a cube corrected artemis and secondly its not for sale jon spiro took a deep shuddering breath not for sale you brought me across the atlantic to show me something youre not going to sell me whats going on here butler wrapped his fingers around the handle of a pistol in his waistband arno blunts hand disappeared behind his back the tension cranked up another notch artemis steepled his fingers mister spiro jon i am not a complete idiot i realize the value of my cube there is not enough money in the world to pay for this particular item whatever you could give me it would be worth a thousand per cent more in a week so whats the deal fowl asked spiro through gritted teeth what are you offering im offering you twelve months for the right price im prepared to keep my cube off the market for a year jon spiro toyed with his id bracelet a birthday present to himself youll suppress the technology for a year correct that should give you ample time to sell your stocks before they crash and to use the profits to buy into fowl industries there is no fowl industries artemis smirked there will be butler squeezed his employers shoulder it was not a good idea to bait a man like jon spiro but spiro hadnt even noticed the jibe he was too busy calculating twisting his bracelet like a string of worry beads your price he asked eventually gold one metric ton replied the heir to the fowl estate thats a lot of gold artemis shrugged i like gold it holds its value and anyway its a pittance compared to what this deal will save you spiro thought about it at his shoulder arno blunt continued staring at butler the fowl bodyguard blinked freely in the event of confrontation dry eyeballs would only lessen his advantage staring matches were for amateurs lets say i dont like your terms said jon spiro lets say i decide to take your little gadget with me right now arno blunts chest puffed out another centimetre even if you could take the cube said artemis smiling it would be of little use to you the technology is beyond anything your engineers have ever seen spiro gave a thin mirthless smile oh im sure they could figure it out even if it took a couple of years it wont matter to you not where youre going if i go anywhere then the c cubes secrets go with me its every function is coded to my voice patterns its quite a clever code butler bent his knees slightly ready to spring i bet we could break that code i got one helluva team assembled in fission chips pardon me if i am unimpressed by your one helluva team said artemis thus far you have been trailing several years behind phonetix spiro jumped to his feet he did not like the p word phonetix was the only communications company whose stock was higher than fission chipss ok kid youve had your fun now its my turn i have to go now before the satellite beam gets here but im leaving mister blunt behind he patted his bodyguard on the shoulder you know what you have to do blunt nodded he knew he was looking forward to it for the first time since the meeting began artemis forgot about his lunch and concentrated completely on the situation at hand this was not going according to plan mister spiro you cannot be serious we are in a public place surrounded by civilians your man cannot hope to compete with butler if you persist with these ludicrous threats i will be forced to withdraw my offer and will release the c cube immediately spiro placed his palms on the table listen kid he whispered i like you in a couple of years you could have been just like me but did you ever put a gun to somebodys head and pull the trigger artemis didnt reply no grunted spiro i didnt think so sometimes thats all it takes guts and you dont have them artemis was at a loss for words something that had only happened twice since his fifth birthday butler stepped in to fill the silence unveiled threats were more his area mister spiro dont try to bluff us blunt may be big but i can snap him like a twig then theres nobody between me and you and take my word for it you dont want that spiros smile spread across his nicotinestained teeth like a smear of treacle oh i wouldnt say theres nobody between us butler got that sinking feeling the one you get when there are a dozen laser sights playing across your chest they had been set up somehow spiro had outmanoeuvred artemis hey fowl said the american i wonder how come your lunch is taking so long it was at that moment artemis realized just how much trouble they were in it all happened in a heartbeat spiro clicked his fingers and every single customer in en fin drew a weapon from inside his or her coat the eightyyearold lady suddenly looked a lot more threatening with a revolver in her bony fist two armed waiters emerged from the kitchen wielding foldingstock machine guns butler never even had time to draw breath spiro tipped over the salt cellar check and mate my game kid artemis tried to concentrate there must be a way out there was always a way out but it wouldnt come he had been hoodwinked perhaps fatally no human had ever outsmarted artemis fowl then again it only had to happen once im going now continued spiro pocketing the c cube before that satellite beam shows up and those other ones the lep ive never heard of that particular agency and as soon as i get this gizmo working theyre going to wish they never heard of me its been fun doing business with you on his way to the door spiro winked at his bodyguard you got six minutes arno a dream come true eh you get to be the guy who took out the great butler he turned back to artemis unable to resist a final jibe oh and by the way artemis isnt that a girls name and he was gone into the multicultural throngs of tourists on the high street the old lady locked the door behind him the click echoed around the restaurant artemis decided to take the initiative now ladies and gentlemen he said trying to avoid staring down the blackeyed gun barrels im sure we can come to an arrangement quiet artemis it took a moment for artemiss brain to process the fact that butler had ordered him to be silent most impertinently in fact i beg your pardon butler clamped a hand over his employers mouth quiet artemis these people are professionals not to be bargained with blunt rotated his skull cracking the tendons in his neck you got that right butler were here to kill you as soon as mister spiro got the call we started sending people in i cant believe you fell for it man you must be getting old butler couldnt believe it either there was a time when he would have staked out any rendezvous site for a week before giving it the thumbsup maybe he was petting old but there was an excellent chance he wouldnt be getting any older ok blunt said butler stretching out his empty palms before him you and me one on one very noble said blunt thats your asian code of honour i suppose me i dont have a code if you think im going to risk you somehow getting out of here youre crazy this is an uncomplicated deal i shoot you you die no faceoff no duel blunt reached lazily into his waistband why hurry one move from butler and a dozen bullets would find their mark artemiss brain seemed to have shut down the usual stream of ideas had dried up im going to die he thought i dont believe it butler was saying something artemis decided he should listen richard of york gave battle in vain said the bodyguard enunciating clearly blunt was screwing a silencer on to the muzzle of his ceramic pistol what are you saying what kind of gibberish is that dont say the great butler is cracking up wait till i tell the guys but the old woman looked thoughtful richard of york i know that artemis knew it too it was virtually the entire verbal detonation code for the fairy sonix grenade magnetized to the underside of the table one of butlers little security devices all they needed was one more word and the grenade would explode sending a solid wall of sound charging through the building blowing out every window and eardrum there would be no smoke or flames but anyone within a tenmetre radius not wearing earplugs had about five seconds before severe pain set in one more word the old lady scratched her head with the revolvers barrel richard of york i remember now the nuns taught us that in school richard of york gave battle in vain its one of those memory tricks the colours of the rainbow rainbow the final word artemis remembered just in time to slacken his jaw if his teeth were clenched the sonic waves would shatter them like sugar glass the grenade detonated in a blast of compressed sound instantaneously hurling eleven people to the furthest extremities of the room until they came into contact with various walls the lucky ones hit partitions and went straight through the unlucky ones collided with cavity block walls things broke not the blocks artemis was safe in butlers bearhug the bodyguard had anchored himself against a solid door frame folding the flying boy into his arms and they had several other advantages over spiros assassins their teeth were intact they did not suffer from any compound fractures and the sonic filter sponges had sealed saving their eardrums from perforation butler surveyed the room the assassins were all down clutching their ears they wouldnt be uncrossing their eyes for several days the manservant drew his sig sauer pistol from a shoulder holster stay here he commanded im going to check the kitchen artemis settled back into his chair drawing several shaky breaths all around was a chaos of dust and moans but once again butler had saved them all was not lost it was even possible that they could catch spiro before he left the country butler had a contact in heathrow security sid commons an exgreen beret hed served with on bodyguard duty in monte carlo a large figure came into view blocking out the sunlight it was butler returned from his reconnoitre artemis breathed deeply feelingly uncharacteristically emotional butler he began we really must talk regarding your salary but it wasnt butler it was arno blunt he had something in each hand on his left palm two tiny cones of yellow foam ear plugs he spat through broken teeth i always wear em before a fire fight good thing too eh in his right hand blunt held a silenced pistol you first he said then the ape arno blunt cocked the gun took aim briefly and fired chapter lockdown haven city the lower elements though artemis did not intend it the cubes scan for surveillance beams was to have farreaching repercussions the search parameters were so vague that the cube sent probes into deep space and of course deep underground below the surface the lower elements police were stretched to their limits following the recent goblin revolution three months after the attempted goblin takeover most of the major players were in custody but there were still isolated pockets of the bwa kell triad loping around havens tunnels with illegal softnose lasers every available lep officer had been drafted in to help with operation mopup before the tourist season got started the last thing the city council wanted was tourists spending their leisure gold in atlantis because havens pedestrianized central plaza was not safe to wander through tourism after all accounted for eighteen per cent of the capitals revenue captain holly short was on loan from the reconnaissance squad generally her job was to fly to the surface on the trail of fairies who had ventured above ground without a visa if even one renegade fairy got himself captured by the mud people then haven ceased to be a haven so until every gang goblin was licking his eyeballs in howlers peak correctional facility hollys duties were the same as every other lep officer rapid response to any bwa kell alert today she was escorting four rowdy goblin hoods to police plaza for processing they had been found asleep in an insect delicatessen stomachs distended after a night of gluttony it was lucky for them that holly had arrived when she did because the delis dwarf owner was on the point of lowering the scaly foursome into the deepfat fryer hollys ridealong for operation mopup was corporal grub kelp little brother to the famous captain trouble kelp one of the leps most decorated officers grub however did not share his brothers stoic personality i got a hangnail cuffing that last goblin said the junior officer chewing on his thumb painful said holly trying to sound interested they were driving along a magnastrip to police plaza with the perpetrators manacled in the rear of their lep wagon it wasnt actually a regulation wagon the bwa kell had managed to burn out so many police vehicles during their shortlived revolution that the lep had been forced to commandeer anything with an engine and room in the back for a few prisoners in reality holly was piloting a curry van with the lep acorn symbol spraypainted on the side the motorpool gnomes had simply bolted the serving hatch and removed the ovens a pity they couldnt remove the smell grub studied his wounded thumb those cuffs have sharp edges i should lodge a complaint holly concentrated on the road though the magnastrip did the steering for her if grub did lodge a complaint it wouldnt be his first or even his twentieth troubles little brother found fault with everything except himself in this instance he was completely wrong there were no sharp edges on the perspex vacuum cuffs if there had been a goblin might think to poke a hole in the other mitt and allow oxygen to reach his hand and nobody wanted goblins hurling fireballs in the back of their vehicles i know it sounds petty to lodge a complaint over hangnails but no one could accuse me of being petty you petty perish the thought grub puffed up his chest after all i am the only member of lepretrieval one to have faced down the human butler holly groaned loudly this she fervently hoped would dissuade grub from telling his artemis fowl war story yet again it grew longer and more fantastical each time in reality butler had let him go as a fisherman would a minnow but grub was not about to take a hint i remember it well he began melodramatically it was a dark night and as though his very words carried immeasurable magic every light in the city went out not only that but the magnastrips power failed leaving them stranded in the middle lane of a frozen highway i didnt do that did i whispered grub holly didnt answer already halfway out of the wagon door overhead the sun strips that replicated surface light were fading to black in the last moments of halflight holly squinted towards the northern tunnel and sure enough the door was sliding down emergency lights revolving along its lower edge sixty metres of solid steel separating haven from the outside world similar doors were dropping at strategic arches all over the city lockdown there were only three reasons why the council would initiate a citywide lockdown flood quarantine or discovery by the humans holly looked around her nobody was drowning nobody was sick so the mud people were coming finally every fairys worst nightmare was coming true emergency lights flickered on overhead the sun strips soft white glow replaced by an eerie orange official vehicles would receive a burst of power from the magnastrip enough to get them to the nearest depot ordinary citizens were not so lucky they would have to walk hundreds stumbled from their automobiles too scared to pro test that would come later captain short holly it was grub no doubt he would be lodging a complaint with someone corporal she said turning back to the vehicle this is no time for panic we need to set an example the lecture petered out in her throat when she saw what was happening to the wagon all lep vehicles would have by now received the regulation tenminute burst of power from the magnastrip to get them and their cargo to safety this power would also keep the perspex cuffs vacuumed of course as they werent using an official lep vehicle they hadnt been cleared for emergency power something the goblins obviously realized because they were trying to burn their way out of the wagon grub stumbled from the cab his helmet blackened by soot the cuffs have popped open so now theyve started blasting the doors he panted retreating to a safe distance goblins evolutions little joke pick the dumbest creatures on the planet and give them the ability to conjure fire if the goblins didnt stop blasting the wagons reinforced interior they would soon be encased in molten metal not a nice way to go even if you were fireproof holly activated the amplifier in her lep helmet you there in the wagon cease fire the vehicle will collapse and you will be trapped for several moments smoke billowed from the vents then the vehicle settled on its axles a face appeared at the grille forked tongue slithering through the mesh you think were stupid elf were gonna burn clean through this pile of junk holly stepped closer turning up the speakers listen to me goblin you are stupid lets just accept that and move on if you continue to fireball that vehicle the roof will melt and fall on you like shells from a human gun you may be fireproof but are you bulletproof the goblin licked his lidless eyes thinking it over you lie elf we will blow a hole right through this prison you will be next the wagons panels began to lurch and buckle as the goblins renewed their attack not to worry said grub from a safe distance the fire extinguishers will get them they would corrected holly if the fire extinguishers werent connected to the main power grid which is shut down a mobile foodpreparation wagon such as this one would have to adhere to the strictest fire regulations before setting one magna wheel on the strip in this case several foampacked extinguishers which could submerge the entire interior in flameretardant foam in a matter of seconds the nice thing about the flame foam was that it hardened on contact with air but the notsonice thing about flame foam was that the trip switch was connected to the magna strip no power no foam holly drew her neutrino from its holster ill just have to trip this switch myself captain short sealed her helmet and climbed into the wagons cab she avoided touching metal wherever possible because even though microfilaments in her lep jumpsuit were designed to disperse extra heat microfilaments didnt always do what they were designed to do the goblins were on their backs pumping fireball after fireball into the roof panels knock it off she ordered pointing her lasers muzzle through the mesh three of the goblins ignored her one possibly the leader turned his scaly face to the grille holly saw that he had eyeball tattoos this act of supreme stupidity probably would have guaranteed him promotion had the bwa kell not been effectively disbanded you will not be able to get us all elf he said smoke leaking from his mouth and slitted nostrils then one of us will get you the goblin was right even if he didnt realize why holly suddenly remembered that she could not fire during a lockdown regulations stated that there were to be no unshielded power surges in case haven was being probed her hesitation was all the proof the goblin needed i knew it he crowed tossing a casual fireball at the grille the mesh glowed red and sparks cascaded against hollys visor over the goblins heads the roof sagged dangerously a few more seconds and it would collapse holly undipped a piton dart from her belt screwing it into the launcher above the neutrinos main barrel the launcher was springloaded like an oldfashioned spear gun and would not give off a heat flash nothing to alarm any sensors the goblin was highly amused as goblins often are just before incarceration which explains why so many are incarcerated a dart you going to prod us all to death little elf holly aimed at a clip protruding from the firefoam nozzle in the rear of the wagon would you please be quiet she said and launched the dart it flew over the goblins head jamming itself between the rods of the nozzle clip the piton cord stretched the length of the wagon missed me said the goblin waggling his forked tongue it was a testament to the goblins stupidity that he could be trapped in a melting vehicle during a lockdown with an lep officer firing at him and still think he had the upper hand i told you to be quiet said holly pulling sharply on the piton cord and snapping the clip eight hundred kilograms of extinguisher foam blasted from the diffuser nozzle at over two hundred miles per hour needless to say all fireballs went out the goblins were pinned down by the force of the already hardening foam the leader was pressed so forcibly against the grille that his tattooed eyes were easily legible one said mummy the other duddy a misspelling though he probably didnt know it ow he said more from disbelief than pain he didnt say anything else because his mouth was full of congealing foam dont worry said holly the foam is porous so you will be able to breathe but its also completely fireproof so good luck trying to burn your way out grub was still examining his hangnail when holly emerged from the van she removed her helmet wiping the soot from the visor with the sleeve of her jumpsuit it was supposed to be nonstick maybe she should send it in for another coating everything all right asked grub yes corporal everything is all right no thanks to you grub had the audacity to look offended i was securing the perimeter captain we cant all be action heroes that was typical grub an excuse for every occasion she could deal with him later now it was vital that she get to police plaza and find out why the council had shut down the city i think we should get back to hq grub offered the intelligence boys might want to interview me if the humans are invading i think i should get back to hq said holly you stay here and keep an eye on the suspects until the power comes back on do you think you can handle that or are you too incapacitated with that hangnail hollys auburn hair stood in sweatslicked spikes and her round hazel eyes dared grub to argue no holly captain you leave it to me everything is under control i doubt it thought holly setting off at a run towards police plaza the city was in complete chaos every citizen was on the street staring at his or her dead appliance in disbelief for some of the younger fairies the loss of their mobile phones was too much to bear they sank to the streets sobbing gently police plaza was mobbed by enquiring minds like moths drawn to a light in this case one of the only lights in town hospitals and emergency vehicles would still have juice but otherwise the lep headquarters was the only government building still functioning holly forced her way through the crowd into the lobby area the public service queues ran down the steps and out the door today everyone was asking the same question whats happened to the power the same question was on hollys lips as she burst into the situations booth but she kept it to herself the room was already packed with the forces complement of captains along with the three regional commanders and all seven council members aaah said chairman cahartez the last captain i didnt get my emergency juice explained holly nonregulation vehicle cahartez adjusted his official conical hat no time for excuses captain mister foaly has been holding off on his briefing until you got here holly took her seat at the captains table beside trouble kelp grub ok he whispered he got a hangnail trouble rolled his eyes no doubt hell make a complaint the centaur foaly trotted through the doors clutching armfuls of disks foaly was the leps technical genius and his security innovations were the main reason why humans had not yet discovered the subterranean fairy hideaway maybe that was about to change the centaur expertly loaded the disks on to the operating system opening several windows on a wallsize plasma screen various complicatedlooking algorithms and wave patterns appeared on the screen he cleared his throat noisily i advised chairman cahartez to initiate lockdown on the basis of these readings recons commander root sucked on an unlit fungus cigar i think im speaking for the whole room here foaly when i say that all i see is lines and squiggles doubtless it makes sense to a smart pony like yourself but the rest of us are going to need some plain gnommish foaly sighed simply put really simply we got pinged is that plain enough it was the room resonated with stunned silence pinged was an old naval term from back in the days when sonar was the preferred method of detection getting pinged was slang for being detected someone knew the fairy folk were down here root was the first to recover his voice pinged who pinged us foaly shrugged dont know it only lasted a few seconds there was no recognizable signature and it was untraceable what did they get quite a bit everything north european scopes sentinel all our camcams downloaded information on every one of them this was catastrophic news someone or something knew all about fairy surveillance in northern europe after only a few seconds was it human asked holly or alien foaly pointed to a digital representation of the beam i cant say for certain if it is human its something brand new this came out of nowhere no one has been developing technology like this as far as i know whatever it is it read us like an open book my security encryptions folded like they werent even there cahartez took off his official hat no longer concerned with protocol what does this mean for the people its difficult to say there are best and worst case scenarios our mysterious guest could learn all about us whenever he wishes and do with our civilization what he will and the best case scenario asked trouble foaly took a breath that was the best case scenario commander root called holly into his office the room stank of cigar smoke in spite of the purifier built into the desk foaly was already there his fingers a blur over the commanders keyboard the signal originated in london somewhere said the centaur we only know that because i happened to be looking at the monitor at the time he leaned back from the keyboard shaking his head this is incredible its some kind of hybrid technology almost like our ion systems but not quite just a hairs breadth away the how is not important now said root its the who im worried about what can i do sir asked holly root stood and walked to a map of london on the wall plasma screen i need you to sign out a surveillance pack go topside and wait if we get pinged again i want someone on site ready to go we cant record this thing but we can certainly get a visual on the signal as soon as it shows up on the screen well feed you the coordinates and you can investigate holly nodded when is the next hotshot hotshot was lepspeak for the magma flares that recon officers ride to the surface in titanium eggs pod pilots referred to this seatofthepants procedure as riding the hotshots no such luck replied foaly nothing in the pipes for the next two days youll have to take a shuttle what about the lockdown ive restored power to stonehenge and our satellite arrays well have to risk it you need to get above ground and we need to stay in contact the future of our civilization could depend on it holly felt the weight of responsibility settle on her shoulders this future of our civilization thing was happening more and more lately chapter on ice en fin knightsbridge the sonic blast from butlers grenade had crashed through the kitchen door sweeping aside stainlesssteel implements like stalks of grass the aquarium had shattered leaving the flagstones slick with water perspex and surprised lobsters they skittered through the debris claws raised the restaurant staff were on the floor bound and saturated but alive butler did not untie them he did not need hysteria right now time enough to deal with them once all threats had been neutralized an assassin stirred suspended halfway through a dividing wall the manservant checked her eyes they were crossed and unfocused no threat there butler pocketed the old ladys weapon just the same you couldnt be too careful something he was learning all over again if madame ko could have seen this afternoons display she would have had his graduation tattoo lasered for sure the room was clear but still something was bothering the bodyguard his soldiers sense grated like two broken bones once again butler flashed back to madame ko his sensei from the academy the bodyguards primary junction is to protect his principal the principal cannot be shot if you are standing in front of him madame ko always referred to employers as principals one did not become involved with principals butler wondered why this particular maxim had occurred to him out of the hundreds madame ko had drummed into his skull why this one it was obvious really he had broken the first rule of personal protection by leaving his principal unguarded the second rule do not develop an emotional attachment to the principal was pretty much in smithereens too butler had become so attached to artemis that it was obviously beginning to affect his judgement he could see madame ko before him nondescript in her khaki suit for all the world an ordinary japanese housewife but how many housewives of any nationality could strike so quickly that the air hissed you are a disgrace butler a disgrace to your name it would better suit your talents to get a job mending shoes your principal has already been neutralized butler moved as though in a dream the very air seemed to hold him back as he raced for the kitchen doors he knew what would have happened arno blunt was a professional vain perhaps a cardinal sin among bodyguards but a professional nevertheless professionals always inserted earplugs if there was any danger of gunfire the tiles were slick beneath his feet but butler compensated by leaning forward and digging his rubbersoled toes into the surface his intact eardrums picked up irregular vibrations from the restaurant conversation artemis was speaking with someone arno blunt no doubt it was already too late butler came through the service door at a speed that would have shamed an olympian his brain began calculating odds the moment pictures arrived from his retinas blunt was in the act of firing nothing could be done about that now there was only one option without hesitation butler took it in his right hand blunt held a silenced pistol you first he said then the ape arno blunt cocked the gun took aim briefly and fired butler came from nowhere he seemed to fill the entire room flinging himself in the bullets path from a greater distance the kevlar in his bulletproof vest might have held but at pointblank range the tefloncoated bullet drilled through the waistcoat like a hot poker through snow it entered butlers chest a centimetre below the heart it was a fatal wound and this time captain short was not around to save him with her fairy magic the bodyguards own momentum combined with the force of the bullet sent butler crashing into artemis pinning him to the dessert trolley nothing of the boy was visible save one armani loafer butlers breathing was shallow and his vision gone but he was not dead yet his brains electricity was rapidly running out but the bodyguard held on to a single thought protect the principal arno blunt drew a surprised breath and butler fired six shots at the sound he would have been disappointed with the spread had he been able to see it but one of the bullets found its mark clipping blunts temple unconsciousness was immediate concussion inevitable arno blunt joined the rest of his team on the floor butler ignored the pain squashing his torso like a giant fist instead he listened for movement there was nothing locally just the scratch of lobster claws on the tiles and if one of the lobsters decided to attack artemis was on his own nothing more could be done either artemis was safe or he was not if not butler was in no condition to fulfil the terms of his contract this realization brought tremendous calm no more responsibility just his own life to live for a few seconds at any rate and anyway artemis wasnt just a principal he was part of the bodyguards life his only true friend madame ko might not like this attitude but there wasnt much she could do about it now there wasnt much anybody could do artemis had never liked desserts and yet he found himself submersed in eclairs cheesecake and pavlova his suit would be absolutely destroyed of course artemiss brain was only throwing up these facts so he could avoid thinking about what had happened but a ninetykilogram deadweight is a hard thing to ignore luckily for artemis butlers impact had actually driven him through to the trolleys second shelf while the bodyguard remained on the icecream ledge above as far as artemis could tell the black forest gateau had cushioned his impact sufficiently to avoid serious internal injury still he had no doubt that a visit to the chiropractor would be called for possibly for butler too though the man had the constitution of a troll artemis struggled out from underneath his manservant with each movement malignant cream horns exploded in his direction really butler grumbled the teenager i must begin choosing my business associates more carefully hardly a day goes by when we arent the victims of some plot artemis was relieved to see arno blunt unconscious on the restaurant floor another villain dispatched good shooting butler as usual and one more thing i have decided to wear a bulletproof vest to all future meetings that should make your job somewhat easier eh it was at this point that artemis noticed butlers shirt the sight knocked the air from his chest like an invisible mallet not the hole in the material but the blood leaking from it butler youre injured shot but the kevlar the bodyguard didnt reply nor did he have to artemis knew science better than most nuclear physicists truth be told he often posted lectures on the internet under the pseudonym emmsey squire obviously the bullets momentum had been too great for the jacket to withstand it had possibly been coated with teflon for extra penetration a large part of artemis wanted to drape his arms across the bodyguards frame and cry as he would for a brother but artemis repressed that instinct now was the time for quick thinking butler interrupted his train of thought artemis is that you he said the words coming in short gasps yes its me answered artemis his voice trembling dont worry juliet will protect you youll be fine dont talk butler lie still the wound is not serious butler spluttered it was as close as he could get to a laugh very well it is serious but i will think of something just stay still with his last vestige of strength butler raised a hand goodbye artemis he said my friend artemis caught the hand the tears were streaming now unchecked goodbye butler the eurasians sightless eyes were calm artemis call me domovoi the name told artemis two things firstly his lifelong ally had been named after a slavic guardian spirit secondly graduates of the madame ko academy were instructed never to reveal first names to their principals it helped to keep things clinical butler would never have broken this rule unless it no longer mattered goodbye domovoi sobbed the boy goodbye my friend the hand dropped butler was gone no shouted artemis staggering backwards this wasnt right this was not the way things should end for some reason he had always imagined that they would die together facing insurmountable odds in some exotic location on the lip of a reactivated vesuvius perhaps or on the banks of the mighty ganges but together as friends after all they had been through butler simply could not be defeated at the hands of some grandstanding secondrate muscleman butler had almost died before the year before last he had been mauled by a troll from the deep tunnels below haven city holly short had saved him then using her fairy magic but now there were no fairies around to save the bodyguard time was the enemy here if artemis had more of it he could figure out how to contact the lep and persuade holly to use her magic once again but time was running out butler had perhaps four minutes before his brain shut down not long enough even for an intellect such as artemiss he needed to buy some more time or steal some think boy think use what the situation provides artemis shut off the wellspring of tears he was in a restaurant a fish restaurant useless worthless perhaps in a medical facility he could do something but here what was here an oven sinks utensils even if he did have the proper tools he had not yet completed his medical studies it was too late for conventional surgery at any rate unless there was a method of heart transplant that took less than four minutes the seconds were ticking by artemis was growing angry with himself time was against them time was the enemy time needed to be stopped the idea sparked in artemiss brain in a flash of neurons perhaps he couldnt stop time but he could halt butlers passage through it the process was risky certainly but it was the only chance they had artemis popped the dessert trolleys brake with his foot and began hauling the contraption towards the kitchen he had to pause several times to drag moaning assassins from the vehicles path emergency vehicles were approaching making their way down knightsbridge obviously the sonic grenades detonation would have attracted attention there were only moments left before he would have to fabricate some plausible story for the authorities better not to be there fingerprints wouldnt be a problem as the restaurant would have had dozens of customers all he had to do was get out of there before londons finest arrived the kitchen was forged from stainless steel hobs hoods and work surfaces were littered with fallout from the sonic grenade fish flapped in the sink crustaceans clicked across the tiles and beluga dripped from the ceiling there at the back a line of freezers essential in any seafood bistro artemis put his shoulder against the trolley steering it to the rear of the kitchen the largest of the freezers was of the custombuilt pullout variety often found in large restaurants artemis hauled open the drawer quickly evicting the salmon sea bass and hake that were encrusted in the ice shavings cryogenics it was their only chance the science of freezing a body until medicine had evolved sufficiently to revive it generally dismissed by the medical community it nevertheless made millions each year from the estates of rich eccentrics who needed more than one lifetime to spend their money cryogenic chambers were generally built to very exact specifications but there was no time for artemiss usual standards now this freezer would have to do as a temporary solution it was imperative that butlers head be cooled to preserve the brain cells so long as his brain functions were intact he could theoretically be revived even if there were no heartbeat artemis manoeuvred the trolley until it overhung the open freezer then with the help of a silver platter he levered butlers body into the steaming ice it was tight but the bodyguard fitted with barely a bend of the legs artemis heaped loose ice on top of his fallen comrade and then adjusted the thermostat to four below zero to avoid tissue damage butlers blank face was just visible through a layer of ice ill be back the boy said sleep well the sirens were close now artemis heard the screech of tyres hold on domovoi whispered artemis closing the freezer drawer artemis left through the back door mingling with the crowds of locals and sightseers the police would have someone photographing the crowd so he did not linger at the cordon or even glance back towards the restaurant instead he made his way to harrods and found himself a table at the gallery cafe once he had assured the waitress that he was not looking for his mummy and produced sufficient cash to pay for his pot of earl grey tea artemis pulled out his mobile selecting a number from the speeddial menu a man answered on the second ring hello make it quick whoever you are im very busy at the moment the man was detective inspector justin barre of new scotland yard barres gravelly tones were caused by a hunting knife across the gullet during a bar fight in the nineties if butler hadnt been on hand to stop the bleeding justin barre would never have risen beyond sergeant it was time to call in the debt detective inspector barre this is artemis fowl artemis how are you and hows my old partner butler artemis kneaded his forehead not well at all im afraid he needs a favour anything for the big man what can i do did you hear something about a disturbance in knightsbridge there was a pause artemis heard paper rip as a fax was torn off the roll yes it just came in a couple of windows were shattered in some restaurant nothing major some tourists are a bit shellshocked preliminary reports say it was some kind of localized earthquake if you can believe that weve got two cars there right now dont tell me butler was behind it artemis took a breath i need you to keep your men away from the freezers thats a strange request artemis whats in the freezers that i shouldnt see nothing illegal promised artemis believe me when i say this is life or death for butler barre didnt hesitate this is not exactly in my jurisdiction but consider it done do you need to get whatever im not supposed to see out of the freezers the officer had read his mind as soon as possible two minutes are all i need barre chewed it over ok lets synchronize schedules the forensics team is going to be in there for a couple of hours nothing i can do about that but at sixthirty precisely i can guarantee there wont be anyone on duty you have five minutes that will be more than sufficient good and tell the big man that were quits artemis kept his voice even yes detective inspector ill tell him if i get the opportunity he thought ice age cryogenics institute off harley street london the ice age cryogenics institute was not actually on londons harley street technically it was tucked away in dickens lane a side alley on the famous medical boulevards southern end but this did not stop the facilitys md one doctor constance lane from putting harley street on all ice age stationery you couldnt buy credibility like that when the upper classes saw those magic words on a business card they fell over themselves to have their frail frames frozen artemis fowl was not so easily impressed but then he had little choice ice age was one of three cryogenic centres in the city and the only one with free units though artemis did consider the neon sign a bit much pods to rent honestly the building itself was enough to make artemis squirm the facade was lined with brushed aluminium obviously designed to resemble a spaceship and the doors were of the whoosh star trek variety where was culture where was art how did a monstrosity like this get planning permission in historic london a nurse complete with white uniform and threepointed hat was manning the reception artemis doubted she was an actual nurse something about the cigarette between her false nails excuse me miss the nurse barely glanced up from her gossip magazine yes are you looking for someone artemis clenched his fists behind his back yes i would like to see doctor lane she is the surgeon is she not the nurse ground out her cigarette in an overflowing ashtray this is not another school project is it doctor lane says no more projects no not another school project youre not a lawyer are you asked the nurse suspiciously one of those geniuses who gets a degree while theyre still in nappies artemis sighed a genius yes a lawyer hardly i am mademoiselle a customer and suddenly the nurse was all charm oh a customer why didnt you say so ill show you right in would sir care for tea coffee or perhaps something stronger i am thirteen years old mademoiselle a juice tea would be fine earl grey if you have it no sugar obviously it might make me hyperactive the nurse was quite prepared to accept sarcasm from an actual paying customer and directed artemis to a lounge where the style was again space age plenty of shining velour and eternity mirrors artemis had half finished a cup of something that was most definitely not earl grey when doctor lanes door swung open do come in said a tall woman uncertainly shall i walk asked artemis or will you beam me up the office walls were lined with frames along one side were the doctors degrees and certificates artemis suspected that many of these certificates could be obtained over the weekend along the wall were several photographic portraits above these read the legend love lies sleeping artemis almost left then but he was desperate doctor lane sat behind her desk she was a very glamorous woman with flowing red hair and the tapered fingers of an artist her smock was dior even constance lanes smile was perfect too perfect artemis looked closer and realized that her entire face was the handiwork of a plastic surgeon obviously this womans life was all about cheating time he had come to the right place now young man tracy says you wish to become a customer the doctor tried to smile but the stretching made her face shine like a balloon not personally no replied artemis but i do wish to rent one of your units short term constance lane pulled a company pamphlet from the drawer ringing some figures in red our rates are quite steep artemis did not even glance at the numbers money is no object we can set up a wire transfer right now from my swiss bank in five minutes you can have a hundred thousand pounds sitting in your personal account all i need is a unit for a single night the figure was impressive constance thought of all the nips and tucks it would buy but she was still reluctant generally minors are not allowed to commit relatives to our chambers its the law actually artemis leaned forward doctor lane constance what im doing here is not exactly legal but no one is being hurt either one night and youre a rich woman this time tomorrow and i was never here no bodies no complaints the doctors hand fingered her jaw line one night just one you wont even know were here constance took a hand mirror from her desk drawer studying her reflection closely call your bank she said stonehehge wiltshire two lep chutes emerged in the south of england one in london itself but that was closed to the public due to the fact that chelsea football club had built their grounds five hundred metres above the shuttle port the other port was in wiltshire beside what humans referred to as stonehenge mud people had several theories as to the origins of the structure these ranged from spaceship landing port to pagan centre of worship the truth was far less glamorous stonehenge had actually been an outlet for a flatbreadbased food or in human terms a pizza parlour a gnome called bog had realized how many tourists forgot their sandwiches on aboveground jaunts and so had set up shop beside the terminal it was a smooth operation you drove up to one of the windows named your toppings and ten minutes later you were stuffing your face of course bog had to shift his operation below ground once humans began talking in full sentences and anyway all that cheese was making the ground soggy a couple of the service windows had even collapsed it was difficult for fairy civilians to get visas to visit stonehenge because of the constant activity on the surface then again hippies saw fairies every day and it never made the front page as a police officer holly didnt have a visa problem one flash of the recon badge opened a hole right through to the surface but being a recon officer didnt help if there was no magma flare scheduled and the stonehenge chute had been dormant for over three centuries not a spark in the absence of a hotshot to ride holly was forced to travel aboard a commercial shuttle the first available shuttle was heavily booked but luckily there was a late cancellation so holly wasnt forced to bump a passenger the shuttle was a fiftyseater luxury cruiser it had been commissioned especially by the brotherhood of bog to visit their patrons site these fairies mostly gnomes dedicated their lives to pizza and every year on the anniversary of bogs first day in business they chartered a shuttle and took a picnic above ground the picnic consisted of pizza tuber beer and pizzaflavoured ice cream needless to say they did not remove their rubber pizza bonnets for the entire day so for sixtyseven minutes holly sat wedged between two beerswilling gnomes singing the pizza song pizza pizza fill up your face the thicker the pastry the better the base there were a hundred and fourteen verses and it didnt get any better holly had never been happier to see the stonehenge landing lights the actual terminal was pretty comprehensive boasting a threelane visa clearance booth entertainment complex and dutyfree shopping the current souvenir craze was a mud man hippy doll that said peace man when you pressed its tummy holly badged her way through the customs queue taking a security elevator to the surface stonehenge had become easier to exit recently because the mud people had put up fencing the humans were protecting their heritage or so they thought strange that mud people seemed more concerned about the past than the present holly strapped on her wings and once the control booth had given her the goahead she cleared the airlock soaring to a height of seven thousand feet there was plenty of cloud cover but nevertheless she activated her shield nothing could spot her now she was invisible to human and mechanical eyes only rats and two species of monkey could see through a fairy shield holly switched on the onboard navigator in the wings computer and let the rig do the steering for her it was nice to be above ground again and at sunset too her favourite time of day a slow smile spread across her face in spite of the situation she was content this was what she was born to do recon with the wind against her visor and a challenge between her teeth knightsbridge london it had been almost two hours since butler had been shot generally the grace period between heart failure and brain damage is about four minutes but that period can be extended if the patients body temperature is lowered sufficiently drowning victims for example can be resuscitated for up to an hour after their apparent death artemis could only pray that his makeshift cryogenic chamber could hold butler in stasis until he could be transferred to one of ice ages pods ice age cryogenics had a mobile unit for transporting clients from the private clinics where they expired the van was equipped with its own generator and full surgery even if cryogenics was considered crackpot medicine by many physicians the vehicle itself would meet the strictest standards of equipment and hygiene these units cost almost a million pounds apiece doctor constance lane informed artemis as they sat in the stark white surgery a cylindrical cryo pod was strapped to a trolley between them the vans are custommade in munich specially armoured too this thing could drive over a landmine and come out smiling for once artemis was not interested in gathering information thats very nice doctor but can it go any faster my associates time is running out it has already been one hundred and twenty sevenminutes constance lane tried to frown but there wasnt enough slack skin across her brow two hours nobody has ever been revived after that long then again no one has ever been revived from a cryogenic chamber the knightsbridge traffic was as usual chaotic harrods was running a oneday sale and the block was crowded with droves of tired customers on their way home it took a further seventeen minutes to reach en fins delivery entrance and as promised there were no policemen present except one detective inspector justin barre himself was standing sentry at the rear door the man was huge a descendant of the zulu nation according to butler it was not difficult to imagine him at butlers side in some faraway land incredibly they found a parking space and artemis climbed down from the van cryogenics said barre noting the vehicles inscription do you think you can do anything for him you looked in the freezer then said artemis the officer nodded how could i resist curiosity is my business im sorry i checked now he was a good man is a good man insisted artemis i am not ready to give up on him yet barre stood aside to admit two uniformed ice age paramedics according to my men a group of armed bandits attempted to rob the establishment but they were interrupted by an earthquake and if thats what really happened ill eat my badge i dont suppose you can throw any light on the situation a competitor of mine disagreed with a business strategy it was a violent disagreement who pulled the trigger arno blunt a new zealander bleached hair rings in his ears tattoos on his body and neck most of his teeth are missing barre took a note ill circulate the description to the airports you never know we might catch him artemis rubbed his eyes butler saved my life the bullet was meant for me thats butler all right said barre nodding if theres anything i can do youll be the first to know said artemis did your officers find anyone on the scene barre consulted his notebook some customers and staff they all checked out so we let them go the thieves escaped before we arrived no matter better i deal with the culprits myself barre made a concerted effort to ignore the activity in the kitchen behind him artemis can you guarantee this is not going to come back to haunt me technically were looking at a homicide artemis looked barre in the eye which was quite an effort detective inspector no body no case and i guarantee that by tomorrow butler will be alive and kicking i shall instruct him to call you if that would set your mind at rest it would the paramedics rolled butler past on a trolley a frosting of ice covered his face tissue damage was already turning his fingers blue any surgeon who could fix this would have to be a real magician artemis glanced downwards thats the plan detective inspector thats the plan doctor lane administered glucose injections in the van these are to stop the cells collapsing she informed artemis massaging butlers chest to circulate the medication otherwise the water in his blood will freeze in spikes and puncture the cell walls butler was lying in an open cryo unit with its own gyroscopes he had been dressed in a special silver freezer suit and cold packs were heaped on his body like sachets of sugar in a bowl constance was unaccustomed to people actually paying attention when she explained the process but this pale youth absorbed facts faster than she could present them wont the water freeze anyway glucose cant prevent that constance was impressed why yes it will but in small pieces so it can float safely between cells artemis jotted a note in his handheld computer small pieces i understand the glucose is only a temporary measure continued the doctor the next step is surgery we need to completely wash out his veins and replace the blood with a preservative then we can lower the patients temperature to minus thirty degrees well have to do that back at the institute artemis shut down his computer no need for that i just need him held in stasis for a few hours after that it wont make any difference i dont think you understand young man said doctor lane current medical practices have not evolved to the point where this kind of injury can be healed if i dont do a complete blood substitution soon there will be severe tissue damage the van jolted as a wheel crashed into one of londons numerous potholes butlers arm jerked and for a moment artemis could pretend he was alive dont worry about that doctor but a hundred thousand pounds constance just keep repeating that figure to yourself park the mobile unit outside and forget all about us in the morning well be gone both of us doctor lane was surprised park outsideyou dont even want to come in no butler stays outside said artemis my ah surgeon has a problem with dwellings but may i enter for a moment to use your phone i need to make a rather special phone call london airspace the lights of london were spread out below holly like the stars of some turbulent galaxy englands capital was generally a nofly area for recon officers because of the four airports feeding planes into the sky five years ago captain trouble kelp had narrowly missed being impaled by a heathrowjfk airbus since then all flight plans involving airport cities had to be cleared personally by foaly holly spoke into her helmet mike foaly any flights coming in i should know about let me just bring up the radar ok lets see id drop down to five hundred feet if i were you theres a coming in from malaga in a couple of minutes it wont hit you but your helmet computer could interfere with its navigation systems holly dipped her flaps until she was at the correct altitude overhead the giant jet screamed across the sky if it hadnt been for hollys sonic filter sponges both her eardrums would have popped ok one jet full of tourists successfully avoided what now now we wait i wont call again unless its important they didnt have to wait long less than five minutes later foaly broke radio silence holly we got something another probe no something from sentinel hold on im sending the file to your helmet a sound file appeared in hollys visor its wave resembled a seismographs readout what is it a phone tap not exactly said foaly its one of a billion throwaway files that sentinel sends us every day the sentinel system was a series of monitoring units that foaly had piggybacked to obsolete us and russian satellites their function was to monitor all human telecommunications obviously it would be impossible to review every phone call made each day so the computer was programmed to pick up on certain key words if for example the words fairy haven and underground appeared in a conversation the computer would flag the call the more peoplerelated phrases that appeared the more urgent the rating this call was made in london minutes ago its loaded with keywords ive never heard anything like it play said holly clearly using voice command a vertical line cursor began scrolling across the sound wave people said a voice hazy with distortion lep magic haven shuttle ports sprites bwa kell trolls timestop recon atlantis thats it thats not enough whoever made that call could be writing our biography but its just a string of words it makes no sense hey theres no point arguing with me said the centaur i just collect information but there has to be a connection to the probe two things like this dont just happen on the same day ok do we have an exact location the call came from a cryogenics institute in london sentinel quality is not enough to run a voicerecognition scan we just know it came from inside the building who was our mystery mud man calling strange thing he was calling the times newspaper crossword hotline maybe those words were the answers to todays crossword said holly hopefully no i checked the correct solution not a fairyrelated word in sight holly set her wings to manual ok time to find out what our caller is up to send me the institutes coordinates holly suspected that it was a false alarm hundreds of these calls came in every year foaly was so paranoid that he believed the mud people were invading every time someone mentioned the word magic on a phone line and with the recent trend for human fantasy movies and video games magical phrases cropped up quite a lot thousands of police hours were wasted staking out the dwellings of residents where these phone calls originated and it usually turned out to be some kid playing on his pc more than likely this phantom phone call was the result of a crossed line or some hollywood hack pitching a screenplay or even an undercover lep operative trying to phone home but then today of all days everything had to be checked holly kicked up her legs behind her dropping into a steep dive diving was against recon regulations all approaches were supposed to be controlled and gradual but what was the point of flying if you couldnt feel the slipstream tugging at your toes ice age cryogenics institute london artemis leaned against the cryogenics mobile units rear bumper it was funny how quickly a persons priorities could change this morning he had been worried about which loafers to wear with his suit and now all he could think about was the fact that his dearest friends life hung in the balance and the balance was rapidly shifting artemis wiped a coating of frost from the spectacles hed retrieved from his bodyguards jacket these were no ordinary spectacles butler had vision these particular eye glasses had been specially tooled to accommodate filters taken from an lep helmet antishield filters butler had carried them since holly short almost got the jump on him at fowl manor you never know hed said were a threat to lep security and some day commander root could be replaced with someone who isnt quite so fond of us artemis wasnt convinced the fairies were by and large a peaceful people he couldnt believe they would harm anyone even a mud person on the basis of past crimes after all they had parted friends or at least not enemies artemis presumed the call would work there was no reason to believe it wouldnt several government security agencies monitored phone lines using the key word system recording conversations that could compromise national security and if humans were doing it it was a safe bet that foaly was two steps ahead artemis donned the glasses climbing into the vehicles cabin he had placed the call ten minutes ago presuming foaly got working on a trace straight away it could still be another two hours before the lep could get an operative on the surface that would make it almost five hours since butlers heart had stopped the record for a revival was two hours and fifty minutes for an alpine skier frozen in an avalanche there had never been a revival after three hours maybe there shouldnt be artemis glanced at the tray of food sent out by doctor lane any other day he would have complained about virtually everything on the plate but now the meal was simply sustenance to keep him awake until the cavalry arrived artemis took a long drink from a polystyrene cup of tea it sloshed audibly around his empty stomach behind him in the vans surgery butlers cryo unit hummed like a common household freezer occasionally the computer emitted electronic beeps and whirrs as the machine ran selfdiagnostics artemis was reminded of the weeks spent in helsinki waiting for his father to regain consciousness waiting to see what the fairy magic would do to him excerpt from artemis fowls diary disk encrypted today my father spoke to me for the first time in over two years i heard his voice and it is exactly as i remembered it but not everything was the same it had been over two months since holly short used her healing magic on his battered body and still he lay in his helsinki hospital bed immobile unresponsive the doctors could not understand it he should be awake they informed me his brainwaves are strong exceptionally so and his heart beats like a horse it is incredible this man should be at deaths door yet he has the muscle tone of a twentyyearold of course it is no mystery to me hollys magic has overhauled my fathers entire being with the exception of his left leg which was lost when his ship went down off the coast of murmansk he has received an infusion of life body and mind the effect of the magic on his body does not worry me but i cannot help but wonder what effect this positive energy will have on my fathers mind for my father a change like this could be traumatic he is the fowl patriarch and his life revolves around moneymaking for sixteen days we sat in my fathers hospital room waiting for some sign of life i had by then learned to read the instruments and noticed immediately the morning that my fathers brainwaves began spiking my diagnosis was that he would soon regain consciousness and so i called the nurse we were ushered from the room to admit a medical team of at least a dozen two heart specialists an anaesthetist a brain surgeon a psychologist and several nurses in fact my father had no need of medical attention he simply sat up rubbed his eyes and uttered one word angeline mother was admitted butler juliet and i were forced to wait for several more agonizing minutes until she reappeared at the door come in everyone she said he wants to see you and suddenly i was afraid my father the man whose shoes i had been trying to fill for two years was awake would he still live up to my expectations would i live up to his i entered hesitantly artemis fowl the first was propped up by several pillows the first thing that i noticed was his face not the scar traces which were already almost completely healed but the expression my fathers brow usually a thunderhead of moody contemplation was smooth and carefree after such a long time apart i didnt know what to say my father had no such doubts arty he cried stretching his arms towards me youre a man now a young man i ran into his embrace and while he held me close all plots and schemes were forgotten i had a father again ice age cryogenics institute london artemiss memories were interrupted by a sly movement on the wall above he peered out the rear window and fixed his gaze on the spot watching through filtered eyes there was a fairy crouching on a thirdstorey window sill a recon officer complete with wings and helmet after only fifteen minutes his ruse had worked foaly had intercepted the call and sent someone to investigate now all that remained was to hope this particular fairy was full to the brim with magic and willing to help this had to be handled sensitively the last thing he wanted to do was spook the recon officer one wrong move and hed wake up in six hours with absolutely no recollection of the days events and that would be fatal for butler artemis opened the van door slowly stepping down into the yard the fairy cocked its head following his movements to his dismay artemis saw the creature draw a platinum handgun dont shoot said artemis raising his hands i am unarmed and i need your help the fairy activated its wings descending slowly until its visor was level with artemiss eyes do not be alarmed continued artemis i am a friend to the people i helped to defeat the bwa kell my name is the fairy unshielded her opaque visor sliding up i know what your name is artemis said captain holly short holly said artemis grasping her by the shoulders its you holly shrugged off the humans hands i know its me whats going on here i presume you made the call yes yes no time for that now i can explain later holly opened the throttle on her wings rising to a height of four metres no artemis i want an explanation now if you needed help why didnt you call on your own phone artemis forced himself to answer the question you told me that foaly had pulled surveillance on my communications and anyway i wasnt sure youd come holly considered it ok maybe i wouldnt have then she noticed wheres butler watching our backs as usual i suppose artemis didnt answer but his expression told holly exactly why the mud boy had summoned her artemis pressed a button and a pneumatic pump opened the cryo pods lid butler lay inside encased in a centimetre of ice oh no sighed holly what happened he stopped a bullet that was meant for me replied artemis when are you going to learn mud boy snapped the fairy your little schemes have a tendency to get people hurt usually the people who care about you artemis didnt answer the truth was the truth after all holly peeled away a cold pack from the bodyguards chest how long artemis consulted the clock on his mobile phone three hours give or take a few minutes captain short wiped away the ice laying her hand flat on butlers chest three hours i dont know artemis theres nothing here not a flicker artemis faced her across the cryo pod can you do it holly can you heal him holly stepped back me i cant heal him we need a professional warlock to even attempt something like this but you healed my father that was different your father wasnt dead he wasnt even critical i hate to say it but butler is gone long gone artemis pulled a gold medallion from a leather thong around his neck the disc was perforated by a single circular hole dead centre remember this you gave it to me for ensuring your trigger finger got reattached to your hand you said it would remind me of the spark of decency inside me im trying to do something decent now captain its not a question of decency it just cant be done artemis drummed his fingers on the trolley thinking i want to talk to foaly he said finally i speak for the people fowl said holly testily we dont take orders from humans please holly said artemis i cant just let him go its butler holly couldnt help herself after all butler had saved all their hides on more than one occasion very well she said fishing a spare com set from her belt but hes not going to have any good news for you artemis hooked the speaker over one ear adjusting the mike stem so it wound across his mouth foaly are you listening are you kidding came the reply this is better than human soap operas artemis composed himself he would have to present a convincing case or butlers last chance was gone all i want is a healing i accept that it may not work but what does it cost to try its not that straightforward mud boy replied the centaur healing isnt a simple process it requires talent and concentration holly is pretty good i grant you but for something like this we need a trained team of warlocks theres no time snapped artemis butler has already been under too long this has to be done now before the glucose is absorbed into his bloodstream there is already tissue damage to the fingers maybe his brain too suggested the centaur no i got his temperature down in minutes the cranium has been frozen since the incident are you sure about that we dont want to bring butlers body back and not his mind im sure the brain is fine foaly didnt speak for several moments artemis if we agree to try this i have no idea what the results would be the effect on butlers body could be catastrophic not to mention his mind an operation of this kind has never been attempted on a human i understand do you artemis do you really are you prepared to accept the consequences of this healing there could be any number of unforeseeable problems whatever emerges from this pod is yours to care for will you accept this responsibility i will said artemis without hesitation very well then its hollys decision nobody can force her to use her magic its up to her artemis lowered his eyes he could not bring himself to look at the lep elf well holly will you do it will you try holly brushed the ice from butlers brow he had been a good friend to the people ill try she said no guarantees but ill do what i can artemiss knees almost buckled with relief then he was in control again time enough for weak knees later thank you captain i realize this could not be an easy decision to take now what can i do holly pointed to the rear doors you can get out i need a sterile environment ill come and get you when its over and whatever happens whatever you hear dont come in until i call holly unclipped her helmet camera suspending it from the cryo pods lid to give foaly a better view of the patient hows that good replied foaly i can see the whole upper body cryogenics that fowl is a genius for a human do you realize that he had less than a minute to come up with this plan thats one smart mud boy holly scrubbed her hands thoroughly in the medisink not smart enough to keep himself out of trouble i cant believe im doing this a threehour healing this has got to be a first technically its only a twominute healing if he got the brain down to below zero straight away but but what asked holly rubbing her fingers briskly with a towel but the freezing interferes with the bodys own biorhythms and magnetic fields things even the people dont understand fully theres more than skin and bone at stake here we have no idea what a trauma like this could do to butler holly stuck her head under the camera are you sure this is a good idea foaly i wish we had time for discussion holly but every second costs our old friend a couple of brain cells im going to talk you through it the first thing we need to do is to take a look at the wound holly peeled off several cold packs unzipping the foil suit the entry wound was small and black hidden in the centre of a pool of blood like a flowers bud he never had a chance right under the heart im going to zoom in holly closed her visor using the helmets filters to magnify butlers wound there are fibres trapped in there kevlar id say foaly groaned over the speakers thats all we need complications what difference do fibres make and this really is not the time for jargon i need plain gnommish ok surgery for morons it is if you poke your fingers into that wound the magic will reproduce butlers cells complete with their new strands of kevlar hell be dead but completely bulletproof holly could feel the tension creeping up her back so i need to do what you need to make a new wound and let the magic spread from there oh great thought holly a new wound just slice open an old friend but hes as hard as rock well then youre going to have to melt him down a little use your neutrino low setting but not too much if that brain wakes up before we want it to hes finished holly drew her neutrino adjusting the output to minimum where do you suggest i melt the other pectoral be ready to heal that heat is going to spread rapidly butler needs to be healed before oxygen gets to his brain holly pointed the laser at the bodyguards chest just say the word in a bit closer fifteen centimetres approximately a twosecond burst holly raised her visor taking several deep breaths a neutrino being used as a medical instrument who would have thought it holly pulled her trigger to the first click one more click would activate the laser two seconds ok go click an orange beam of concentrated heat spilled from the neutrinos snout blossoming across butlers chest had the bodyguard been awake he would have been knocked unconscious a neat circle of ice evaporated rising to condense on the surgerys ceiling now said foaly his voice highpitched with urgency narrow the beam and focus it holly manipulated the gun controls expertly with her thumb narrowing the beam would intensify its power but the laser would have to be focused at a certain range to avoid slicing right through butlers body im setting it for fifteen centimetres good but hurry that heat is spreading the colour had returned to butlers chest and the ice was melting across his body holly pulled the trigger again this time carving a crescentshaped slit in butlers flesh a single drop of blood oozed from between the wounds edges no steady flow said foaly thats good holly bolstered her weapon now what now get your hands in deep and give it every drop of magic youve got dont just let it flow push the magic out holly grimaced she never liked this bit no matter how many healings she performed she could never get used to sticking her fingers into other peoples insides she lined her thumbs up back to back and slid them into the incision heal she breathed and the magic scurried down her fingers blue sparks hovered over butlers wound then disappeared inside like shooting stars diving behind the horizon more holly urged foaly another shot holly pushed again harder the flow was thick at first a roiling mass of blue streaks then as her magic ebbed the flow grew weaker thats it she panted i have barely enough left to shield on the way home well then said foaly stand back until i tell you because all hell is about to break loose holly backed up to the wall nothing much happened for several moments then butlers back arched throwing his chest into the air holly heard a couple of vertebrae groaning thats the heart started noted foaly the easy bit butler flopped back into the pod blood flowing from his most recent wound the magical sparks knitted together forming a vibrating lattice over the bodyguards torso butler bounced on the trolley like a bead in a rattle as the magic reshaped his atoms his pores vented mist as toxins were expelled from his system the coating of ice around him dissolved instantly causing clouds of steam and then rain as the water particles condensed on the metal ceiling cold packs popped like balloons sending crystals ricocheting around the surgery it was like being in the centre of a multicoloured storm you need to get in there now said foaly in hollys ear what get in there the magic is spreading up his spinal column hold his head still for the healing or any damaged cells could be replicated and once somethings been healed we cant undo it great thought holly hold butler still no problem she battled her way through the debris coldpack crystals impacting against her visor the humans frame continued thrashing in the cryo pod shrouded by a cloud of steam holly clamped a hand on either side of butlers head the vibrations travelled the length of her arms and through her body hold him holly hold him holly leaned across the pod placing the weight of her body on the manservants head in all the confusion she couldnt tell if her efforts were having any effect whatsoever here it comes said foaly in her ear brace yourself the magical lattice spread along butlers neck and across his face blue sparks targeted the eyes travelling along the optic nerve into the brain itself butlers eyes flew open rolling in their sockets his mouth was reactivated too spewing out long strings of words in various languages none of which made any sense his brain is running tests said foaly just to check everythings working each muscle and joint was tested to its limit rolling swivelling and stretching hair follicles grew at an accelerated rate covering butlers normally shaven dome with a thick growth of hair nails shot out of his fingers like tiger claws and a raggedy beard snaked from his chin holly could only hang on she imagined that this was how it must feel to be a rodeo cowboy straddling a particularly badtempered bull eventually the sparks dissipated spiralling into the air like embers on a breeze butler calmed and settled his body sinking into fifteen centimetres of water and coolant his breathing was slow and deep we did it said holly sliding off the pod on to her knees hes alive dont start celebrating just yet said foaly theres still a long way to go he wont regain consciousness for a couple of days at least and even then who knows what shape his mind will be in and of course theres the obvious problem holly raised her visor what obvious problem see for yourself captain short was almost afraid to look at whatever lay in the pod grotesque images crowded her imagination what kind of misshapen mutant human had they created the first thing she noticed was butlers chest the bullet hole itself had completely disappeared but the skin had darkened with a red line amongst the black it looked like a capital t kevlar explained foaly some of it must have replicated not enough to kill him thankfully but enough to slow down his breathing butler wont be running any marathons with those fibres clinging to his ribs whats the red line at a guess id say dye there must have been writing on the original bulletproof jacket holly glanced around the surgery butlers vest lay discarded in a corner the letters fbi were printed in red across the chest there was a small hole in the centre of thei ah well said the centaur its a small price to pay for his life he can pretend its a tattoo theyre very popular among the mud people these days holly had been hoping the kevlarreinforced skin was the obvious problem to which foaly had been referring but there was something else the something else became immediately apparent when her gaze landed on the bodyguards face or more accurately the hair sprouting from his face oh gods she breathed artemis is not going to like this artemis paced the yard while his bodyguard underwent magical surgery now that his plan was actually in progress doubts began to chew at the edges of his mind like slugs on a leaf was this the right thing to do what if butler wasnt himself after all his father had been undeniably different on the day he had finally come back to them he would never forget that first conversation excerpt from artemis fowls diary disk encrypted the doctors in helsinki were determined that they should pump my father full of vitamin supplements he was just as determined that they shouldnt and a determined fowl usually gets his way i am perfectly fine he insisted please allow me some time to reacquaint myself with my family the doctors withdrew disarmed by his personality i was surprised by this approach charm had never been my fathers weapon of choice he had previously achieved his aims by bulldozing over anybody stupid enough to stand in his way father was sitting in the hospital rooms only armchair his shortened leg resting on a footstool my mother was perched on the armrest resplendent in white faux fur father caught me looking at his leg dont worry arty he said im being measured for a prosthetic tomorrow doctor hermann gruber is being flown in from dortmund i had heard of gruber he worked with the german paralympics squad the best im going to ask for something sporty maybe with speed stripes a joke that wasnt like my father my mother ruffled my fathers hair stop teasing darling this is difficult for arty you know he was only a baby when you left hardly a baby mother i said i was eleven after all my father smiled at me fondly perhaps now would be an appropriate time for us to talk before his good mood wore off to be replaced by the usual gruffness father things have changed since your disappearance i have changed father nodded solemnly yes you are right we need to talk about the business ah yes back to business this was the father i remembered i think you will find that the family bank accounts are healthy and i trust you will approve of the stocks portfolio it has yielded an eighteen per cent dividend in the past financial year eighteen per cent is quite exemplary in the current market i havent failed you i have failed you son said artemis senior if you think bank accounts and stocks are all thats important you must have learned that from me he pulled me close to him i havent been the perfect father arty far from it too busy with the family business i was always taught that it was my duty to manage the fowl empire a criminal empire as we both know if any good has come out of my abduction its that i have reassessed my priorities i want a new life for us all i could not believe what i was hearing one of my most persistent memories was of father repeatedly quoting the family motto aurum potestas est gold is power and now here he was turning his back on fowl principles what had the magic done to him gold isnt allimportant arty he continued neither is power we have everything we need right here the three of us i was utterly surprised but not unpleasantly so but father you have always said this isnt you youre a new man mother joined the conversation no arty not a new man an old one the one i fell in love with and married before the fowl empire took over and now i have him back were a family again i looked at my parents how happy they were together a family was it possible that the fowls could be a normal family artemis was yanked back to the present by a commotion from inside the ice ape mobile unit the vehicle began to rock on its axles blue light crackling from beneath the door artemis did not panic he had seen healings before last year when holly reattached her index finger the magical fallout had shattered half a ton of ice and that was for one little finger imagine the damage butlers system could do repairing a critical injury the pandemonium continued for several minutes popping two of the vans tyres and completely wrecking the suspension luckily the institute was locked up for the night or doctor lane would certainly be adding automobile repairs to her bill eventually the magical storm subsided and the vehicle settled like a rollercoaster car after the ride holly opened the rear door leaning heavily against the frame she was exhausted drained a sickly pallor glowed through her coffee complexion well demanded artemis is he alive holly didnt answer a strenuous healing often resulted in nausea and fatigue captain short took several deep breaths resting on the rear bumper is he alive repeated the youth holly nodded alive yes hes alive but but what holly tell me holly tugged off her helmet it slipped from her fingers rolling across the yard im sorry artemis i did the best i could it was possibly the worst thing she could have said artemis climbed into the van the floor was slick with water and coloured crystals smoke leaked from the fractured grille of the airconditioning system and the overhead neon strip flickered like lightning in a bottle the cryo pod lay offkilter in one corner its gyroscopes leaking fluid one of butlers arms flopped over the units edge throwing a monster shadow on the wall the cryo pods instruments panel was still operating artemis was relieved to see the heartbeat icon blipping gently in the display butler was alive holly had done it again but something had been worrying the fairy captain there was a problem as soon as artemis looked inside the pod it became immediately apparent what that problem was the manservants newly grown hair was heavily streaked with grey butler had gone into the cryo chamber forty years of age the man before artemis now was at least fifty possibly older in the space of just over three hours butler had grown old holly appeared at artemiss shoulder hes alive at least said the fairy artemis nodded when will he wake up a couple of days maybe how did this happen asked the boy brushing a lock of hair from butlers brow holly shrugged im not exactly sure thats foalys area artemis took the spare com set from his pocket hooking the speaker wire over his ear any theories foaly i cant be sure the centaur replied but im guessing that hollys magic wasnt enough some of butlers own life force was needed for the healing about fifteen years worth by the looks of it can anything be done afraid not a healing cant be undone if its any consolation hell probably live longer than he would have done naturally but theres no reclaiming his youth and whats more we cant be sure about the state of his mind the healing could have wiped his brain cleaner than a magnetized disk artemis sighed deeply what have i done to you old friend no time for that said holly briskly you should both get out of here im sure all the commotion will have attracted attention do you have transport no we flew over on a public flight then took a taxi from heathrow holly shrugged id like to help artemis but ive already given up enough time here im on a mission an extremely important mission and i have to get back to it artemis stepped away from the cryo unit holly about your mission captain short turned slowly artemis you were probed werent you something got past foalys defences holly pulled a large sheet of camouflage foil from her surveillance backpack we need to go somewhere to talk somewhere private the following fortyfive minutes were something of a blur for artemis holly wrapped both humans in the camouflage foil and clipped them on to her moonbelt the belt effectively reduced their weight to one fifth of the earths norm even then it was a struggle for her mechanical wings to hoist the three of them into the night sky holly had to open the throttle wide just to bring them five hundred feet above sea level im going to shield now she said into her mike try not to thrash about too much i dont want to have to cut one of you loose then she was gone and in her place hovered a slightly shimmering hollyshaped patch of stars the vibrations rattled through the belt links shaking artemiss teeth in his head he felt like a bug in a cocoon trussed up in foil with only his face exposed to the night air initially the experience was almost enjoyable riding high above the city watching the cars flicker along the motorways then holly picked up a westerly wind and threw them into the air currents over the sea suddenly artemiss universe was a maelstrom of cutting winds buffeting passengers and startled birds beside him butler hung limply in his makeshift foil truss the foil absorbed the local colours reflecting the dominant hues it was by no means a perfect recreation of the surroundings but certainly good enough for a night flight over the sea to ireland is this foil invisible to radar said artemis into the headset i dont want to be mistaken for a ufo by some eager harrier jumpjet pilot holly considered it youre right maybe i should take us down a bit just in case two seconds later artemis deeply regretted breaking radio silence holly tilted her wing rig into a steep dive sending the three of them hurtling towards the midnight waves below she pulled up at the last moment when artemis could have sworn the skin was about to peel away from his face low enough for you asked holly with the barest hint of humour in her voice they skimmed the wave tops spray sparking against the camouflage foil the ocean was rough that night and holly followed the water patterns dipping and climbing to match the swells curve a school of humpbacked whales sensed their presence and broke through the storm foam leaping fully thirty metres across a trough before disappearing beneath the black water there were no dolphins the small mammals were taking shelter from the elements in the inlets and coves along the irish coast holly skirted the hull of a passenger ferry flying close enough to feel the engines pulse on deck scores of passengers vomited over the railings narrowly missing the invisible travellers below charming muttered artemis dont worry said hollys voice out of thin air almost there they passed rosslares ferry terminal following the coastline northwards over the wicklow mountains even in his disorientated state artemis could not help but marvel at their speed those wings were a fantastic invention imagine the money that could be made for a patent like that artemis stopped himself selling fairy technology was what had got butler hurt in the first place they slowed sufficiently for artemis to make out individual landmarks dublin squatted to the east an aura of yellow light buzzing over its highway system holly skirted the city heading for the less populated north of the county in the centre of a large dark patch sat a single building painted white by external spotlights artemiss ancestral home fowl manor fowl manor dublin ireland now explain yourself said holly once they had floated butler safely to bed she sat on the great stairways bottom step generations of fowls glared down at her from oil portraits on the walls the lep captain activated her helmet mike and switched it to loudspeaker foaly record this would you i have a feeling were going to want to hear it again this entire incident began at a business meeting this afternoon began artemis go on i was meeting jon spiro an american industrialist holly heard keys being tapped in her ear undoubtedly foaly was running a background check on this spiro character jon spiro said the centaur almost immediately a shady character even by human standards mud man security agencies have been trying to put this guy away for thirty years his companies are ecodisasters and thats only the tip of the iceberg industrial espionage abduction blackmail mob connections you name it hes gotten away with it thats the chap said artemis so i set up a rendezvous with mister spiro what were you selling interrupted foaly a man like spiro doesnt cross the atlantic for tea and muffins artemis frowned i wasnt actually selling him anything but i did offer to suppress some revolutionary technology for a price of course foalys voice was cold what revolutionary technology artemis hesitated for a beat do you remember those helmets butler took from the retrieval squad holly groaned oh no i deactivated the helmets autodestruct mechanisms and constructed a cube from the sensors and chips the c cube a minicomputer it was a simple matter to install a fibreoptic blocker so that you couldnt take control of the cube if you detected it you gave fairy technology to a man like jon spiro i quite obviously didnt give it to him snapped artemis he took it holly pointed a finger at the youth dont bother playing the victim artemis it doesnt suit you what did you think that jon spiro was going to walk away from technology that could make him the richest man on the face of the planet so it was your computer that pinged us said foaly yes admitted artemis unintentionally spiro asked for a surveillance scan and the cubes fairy circuits picked up lep satellite beams cant we block any future probes asked the lep captain havens deflectors will be useless against our own technology sooner or later spiro will find out about the people and if that happens i cant see a man like him just allowing us to live in harmony holly glared pointedly at artemis remind you of anyone i am nothing like jon spiro objected the boy hes a coldblooded killer give yourself a few years said holly youll get there foaly sighed put artemis fowl and holly short together in a room and sooner or later there was bound to be a row ok holly said the centaur lets try to act like professionals step one is to call off the lockdown our next priority is to retrieve the cube before spiro can unlock its secrets we do have some time said artemis the cube is encrypted how encrypted i built an eternity code into its hard drive an eternity code said foaly im impressed it wasnt that difficult i invented an entirely new base language so spiro will have no frame of reference holly was feeling a bit left out and how long will it take to crack this eternity code artemis couldnt resist raising an eyebrow eternity he said in theory but with spiros resources quite a bit less holly ignored the tone ok then were safe no need to go hunting spiro if all he has is a box of useless circuits far from useless countered artemis the chip design alone will lead his research and development team in interesting directions but you are right about one thing holly there is no need to go hunting spiro once he realizes that i am still alive he will come looking for me after all i am the only one who can unlock the full potential of the c cube holly dropped her head into her hands so any moment now a team of hit men could come blasting in here looking for the key to your eternity code its at times like these we could do with someone like butler artemis plucked the wall phone from its cradle theres more than one butler in the family he said chapter running in the family sfax tunisia north africa for her eighteenth birthday juliet butler asked for and received a ribbed judo crash vest two weighted throwing knives and a world wrestling grudge match video items that did not generally feature on the average teenage girls wish list then again juliet butler was not the average teenage girl juliet was extraordinary in many ways for one thing she could hit a moving target with any weapon you cared to name and for another she could throw most people a lot further than she trusted them of course she didnt learn all of this watching wrestling videos juliets training began at age four after kindergarten each day domovoi butler would escort his little sister to the fowl estate dojo where he instructed her in the various forms of martial arts by the time she was eight juliet was a third dan black belt in seven disciplines by eleven years of age she was beyond belts traditionally all butler males enrolled in madame kos personal protection academy on their tenth birthday spending six months of every year learning the bodyguards craft and the other six guarding a lowrisk principal the female butlers generally went into the service of various wealthy families around the world however juliet decided she would combine both roles spending half the year with angeline fowl and the other half honing her martial arts skills in madame kos camp she was the first butler female to enrol in the academy and only the fifth female ever to make it past the physical exam the camp was never located in the same country for more than five years butler had done his training in switzerland and israel but his younger sister received her instruction in the utsukushigahara highlands in japan madame kos dormitory was a far cry from the luxurious accommodation in fowl manor in japan juliet slept on a straw mat owned nothing apart from two rough cotton robes and consumed only rice fish and protein shakes the day began at five thirty when juliet and the other acolytes ran four miles to the nearest stream catching fish with their bare hands having cooked and presented the fish to their sensei the acolytes strapped empty twentygallon barrels to their backs and climbed to the snowline when their barrel was filled with snow the acolyte would roll it back to base camp and then pound the snow with bare feet until it melted and could be used by the sensei to bathe then the days training could begin lessons included cos tapa a martial art developed by madame ko herself specially tailored for bodyguards whose primary aim was not selfdefence but defence of the principal acolytes also studied advanced weaponry information technology vehicular maintenance and hostagenegotiation techniques by her eighteenth birthday juliet could break down and reassemble ninety per cent of the worlds production weapons blindfolded operate any vehicle do her makeup in under four minutes and in spite of her stunning asian and european gene mix blend into any crowd like a native her big brother was very proud the final step in her training was a field simulation in a foreign environment if she passed this test madame ko would have juliets shoulder marked with a blue diamond tattoo the tattoo identical to the one on butlers shoulder symbolized not only the graduates toughness but also the multifaceted nature of his or her training in personal protection circles a bodyguard bearing the blue diamond needed no further reference madame ko had chosen the city of sfax in tunisia for juliets final assessment her mission was to guide the principal through the citys tumultuous market or medina generally a bodyguard would advise his principal against venturing into such a densely populated area but madame ko pointed out that principals rarely listened to advice and it was best to be prepared for every eventuality and as if juliet wasnt under enough pressure madame ko herself decided to act as surrogate principal it was exceptionally hot in north africa juliet squinted through her wraparound sunglasses concentrating on following the diminutive figure bobbing through the crowd before her hurry snapped madame ko you will lose me in your dreams madame replied juliet unperturbed madame ko was simply trying to distract her with conversation and there were already enough distractions in the local environment gold hung in shimmering ropes from a dozen stalls tunisian rugs flapped from wooden frames the perfect cover for an assassin locals pressed uncomfortably close eager for a look at this attractive female and the terrain was treacherous one false step could lead to a twisted ankle and failure juliet processed all this information automatically factoring it into every move she placed a firm hand on the chest of a teenager grinning at her skipped over an oily puddle reflecting rainbow patterns and followed madame ko down yet another alley in the medinas endless maze suddenly there was a man in her face one of the market traders i have good carpets he said in broken french you come with me i show you madame ko kept going juliet attempted to follow her but the man blocked her path no thank you i am so not interested i live outdoors very funny mademoiselle you make good joke now come and see ahmeds carpets the crowd began to take notice swirling to face her like the tendrils of a giant organism madame ko was moving further away she was losing the principal i said no now back off mister carpet man dont make me break a nail the tunisian was unaccustomed to taking orders from a female and now his friends were watching i give good bargain he persisted pointing at his stall best rugs in sfax juliet dodged to one side but the crowd moved to cut her off it was at this point that ahmed lost any sympathy that juliet might have had for him up to now he had simply been an innocent local in the wrong place at the wrong time but now lets go said the tunisian wrapping an arm around the blonde girls waist not an idea that would make it on to his top ten of good ideas oh bad move carpet man faster than the eye could blink ahmed was wrapped in the folds of a nearby carpet and juliet was gone nobody had a clue what had happened until they replayed the incident on the screen of kamal the chicken mans camcorder in slomo the traders saw the eurasian girl hoist ahmed by the throat and belt and lob him bodily into a carpet stall it was a move that one of the gold merchants recognized as a slingshot a manoeuvre made popular by the american wrestler papa hog the traders laughed so much that several of them became dehydrated it was the funniest thing to happen all year the clip even won a prize on tunisias version of the worlds funniest videos three weeks later ahmed moved to egypt back to juliet the bodyguardintraining ran like a sprinter out of the blocks dodging around stunned merchants and hanging a hard right down an alley madame ko couldnt have gone far she could still complete her assignment juliet was furious with herself this was exactly the kind of stunt her brother had warned her about watch out for madame ko butler had advised you never know what shell cook up for a field assignment i heard that she once stampeded a herd of elephants in calcutta just to distract an acolyte the trouble was that you couldnt be sure that carpet merchant might have been in madame kos employ or he might have been an innocent civilian who happened to stick his nose in where it didnt belong the alley narrowed so that the human traffic ran single file makeshift clothes lines zigzagged at head height gutras and abayas hung limp and steaming in the heat juliet ducked below the laundry dodging around dawdling shoppers startled turkeys hopped as far out of the way as their string leads would allow and suddenly she was in a clearing a dim square surrounded by threestorey houses men lounged on the upper balconies puffing on fruitflavoured water pipes underfoot was a priceless chipped mosaic depicting a roman bath scene in the centre of the square lying with her knees hugged to her chest was madame ko she was being assaulted by three men these were no local traders all three wore specialforces black and attacked with the assurance and accuracy of trained professionals this was no test these men were actually trying to kill her sensei juliet was unarmed this was one of the rules to smuggle arms into the african country would automatically mean life imprisonment luckily it seemed as though her adversaries were also without weapons though hands and feet would certainly be sufficient for the job they had in mind improvization was the key to survival here there was no point in attempting a straight assault if these three had subdued madame ko then they would be more than a match for her in regular combat time to try something a bit unorthodox juliet leaped on the run snagging a clothes line on her way past the ring resisted for a second then popped out of the dried plaster the cable played out behind her sagging with its load of rugs and headscarves juliet veered left as far as the lines other anchor would allow and then swung round towards the men hey boys she yelled not from bravado but because this would work better head on the men looked up just in time to get a faceful of sopping camel hair the heavy rugs and garments wrapped themselves around their flailing limbs and the nylon cable caught them below the chins in under a second the three were down and juliet made certain they stayed down with pinches to the nerve clusters at the base of their necks madame ko she cried searching the laundry for her sensei the old woman lay shuddering in an olive dress a plain headscarf covering her face juliet helped the woman to her feet did you see that move madame i totally decked those morons i bet they never saw anything like that before improvization butler always says its the key you know i think my eyeshadow distracted them glitter green never fails juliet stopped talking because there was a knife at her throat the knife was wielded by madame ko herself who was in fact not madame ko but some other tiny oriental lady in an olive dress a decoy you are dead said the lady yes agreed madame ko stepping from the shadows and if you are dead then the principal is dead and you have failed juliet bowed low joining her hands that was a sly trick madame she said trying to sound respectful her sensei laughed of course that is the way of life what did you expect but those assassins i completely kicked their b i defeated them comprehensively madame ko dismissed the claim with a wave luck fortunately for you these were not assassins but three graduates of the academy what was that nonsense with the wire its a wrestling trick said juliet its called the clothes line unreliable said the japanese lady you succeeded because fortune was with you fortune is not enough in our business it wasnt my fault protested juliet there was this guy in the market totally in my face i had to put him asleep for a while madame ko tapped juliet between the eyes quiet girl think for once what should you have done juliet bowed an inch lower i should have incapacitated the merchant immediately exactly his life means nothing insignificant compared to the principals safety i cant just kill innocent people protested juliet madame ko sighed i know child and that is why you are not ready you have all the skill but you lack focus and resolve perhaps next year juliets heart plummeted her brother had earned the blue diamond at eighteen years of age the youngest graduate in the academys history she had been hoping to equal that feat now she would have to try again in twelve months it was pointless to object any further madame ko never reversed a decision a young woman in acolytes robes emerged from the alley holding a small briefcase madame she said bowing there is a call for you on the satellite phone madame ko took the offered handset and listened intently for several moments a message from artemis fowl she said eventually juliet itched to straighten from her bow but it would be an unforgivable breach of protocol yes madame the message is domovoi needs you juliet frowned you mean butler needs me no said madame ko without a trace of emotion i mean domovoi needs you i am just repeating what was told to me and suddenly juliet could feel the sun pounding on her neck and she could hear the mosquitoes whining in her ears like dentist drills and all she wanted to do was straighten up and run all the way to the airport butler would never have revealed his name to artemis not unless no she couldnt believe it she couldnt even allow herself to think it madame ko tapped her chin thoughtfully you are not ready i should not let you leave you are too emotionally involved to be an effective bodyguard please madame said juliet her sensei considered it for two long minutes very well she said go juliet was gone before the word finished echoing around the square and heaven help any carpet merchant who blocked her path chapter the metal man and the monkey the spiro needle chicago illinois usa jon spiro took the concorde from heathrow to ohare international airport in chicago a stretch limousine ferried him downtown to the spiro needle a sliver of steel and glass rising eightysix storeys above the chicago skyline spiro industries was located on floors fifty through to eightyfive the eightysixth floor was spiros personal residence accessible either by private lift or helipad jon spiro hadnt slept for the entire journey too excited by the little cube sitting in his briefcase the head of his technical staff was equally excited when spiro informed him what this harmlesslooking box was capable of and immediately scurried off to unravel the c cubes secrets six hours later he scurried back to the conference room for a meeting its useless said the scientist whose name was doctor pearson spiro swirled an olive in his martini glass i dont think so pearson he said in fact i know that little gizmo is anything but useless i think that maybe youre the useless one in this equation spiro was in a terrible mood arno blunt had just called to inform him of fowls survival when spiro was in a dark mood people had been known to disappear off the face of the earth if they were lucky pearson could feel the stare of the conference rooms third occupant bouncing off his head this was not a woman you wanted angry with you pearson knew that if jon spiro decided to have him thrown out the window this particular individual would have no problem signing an affidavit swearing that he had jumped pearson chose his words carefully this device the c cube thats what its called i told you that so use the name this c cube undoubtedly has enormous potential but its encrypted spiro threw the olive at his head scientist it was a humiliating experience for a nobel prize winner so break the encryption what do i pay you guys for pearson could feel his heart rate speeding up its not that simple this code its unbreakable let me get this straight said spiro leaning back in his oxblood leather chair im putting two hundred million a year into your department and you cant break one lousy code set up by a kid pearson was trying not to think about the sound his body would make hitting the pavement his next sentence would save him or damn him the cube is voiceactivated and coded to artemis fowls voice patterns nobody can break the code its not possible spiro did not respond it was a signal to continue ive heard of something like this we scientists theorize about it an eternity code its called the code has millions of possible permutations and not only that its based on an unknown language it seems as though this boy has created a language that is spoken only by him we dont even know how it corresponds to english a code like this is not even supposed to exist if fowl is dead then im sorry to say mister spiro the c cube died with him jon spiro stuck a cigar into the corner of his mouth he did not light it his doctors had forbidden it politely and if fowl were alive pearson knew a lifeline when it was being thrown to him if fowl were alive he would be a lot easier to break than an eternity code ok doc said spiro youre dismissed you dont want to hear whats coming next pearson gathered his notes and hurried for the door he tried not to look at the face of the woman at the table if he didnt hear what came next he could kid himself that his conscience was clear and if he didnt actually see the woman at the conference table then he couldnt pick her out of a lineup it looks like we have a problem said spiro to the woman in the dark suit the woman nodded everything she wore was black black power suit black blouse black stilettos even the rado watch on her wrist was jet black yes but its my kind of problem carla frazetti was goddaughter to spatz antonelli who ran the downtown section of the antonelli crime family carla operated as liaison between spiro and antonelli possibly the two most powerful men in chicago spiro had learned early in his career that businesses allied to the mob tended to flourish carla checked her manicured nails it seems to me that you only have one option you nab the fowl kid and squeeze him for this code spiro sucked on his unlit cigar thinking about it its not that straightforward the kid runs a tight operation fowl manor is like a fortress carla smiled this is a thirteenyearold kid were talking about right hell be fourteen in six months said spiro defensively anyway there are complications such as arno is injured somehow fowl blew his teeth out ouch said carla wincing he cant even stand in a breeze never mind head up an operation thats a shame in fact the kid incapacitated all my best people theyre on a dental plan too its going to cost me a fortune no i need some outside help on this one you want to contract the job to us exactly but its got to be the right people ireland is an oldworld kind of place wise guys are going to stick out a mile i need guys who blend in and can persuade a kid to accompany them back here easy money carla winked i read you mister spiro so you got guys like that guys who can take care of business without drawing attention to themselves the way i see it you need a metal man and a monkey spiro nodded familiar with mob slang a metal man carried the gun and a monkey got into hardtoreach places we have two such men on our books i can guarantee they wont attract the wrong kind of attention in ireland but it wont be cheap are they good asked spiro carla smiled one of her incisors was inset with a tiny ruby oh theyre good she replied these guys are the best the metal man the ink blot tattoo parlour downtown chicago loafers mcguire was having a tattoo done a skulls head in the shape of the ace of spades it was his own design and he was very proud of it so proud in fact that hed wanted the tattoo on his neck inky burton the tattooist managed to change loafers mind arguing that neck tattoos were better than a name tag when the cops wanted to id a suspect loafers relented ok hed said put it on my forearm loafers had a tattoo done after every job there wasnt much skin left on his body that still retained its original colour that was how good loafers mcguire was at his job loafers real name was aloysius and he hailed from the irish town of kilkenny hed come up with the nickname loafers himself because he thought it sounded more moblike than aloysius all his life loafers had wanted to be a mobster just like in the movies when his efforts to start a celtic mafia had failed loafers came to chicago the chicago mob welcomed him with open arms actually one of their enforcers grabbed him in a bearhug loafers sent the man and six of his buddies to the mother of mercy hospital not bad for a guy five feet tall eight hours after stepping off the plane loafers was on the payroll and here he was two years and several jobs later already the organizations top metal man his specialities were robbery and debt collection not the usual line of work for fivefooters but then loafers was not the usual fivefooter loafers leaned back in the tattooists adjustable chair you like the shoes inky inky blinked sweat from his eyes you had to be careful with loafers even the most innocent question could be a trap one wrong answer and you could find yourself making your excuses to saint peter yeah i like em what are they called loafers snapped the tiny gangster loafers idiot theyre my trademark oh yeah loafers i forgot cool havin a trademark loafers checked the progress on his arm you ready with that needle yet just ready replied inky im finished painting on the guidelines i just gotta put in a fresh needle its not gonna hurt is it of course it is moron thought inky im sticking a needle in your arm but out loud he said not too much i gave your arm a swab of anaesthetic it better not hurt warned loafers or youll be hurting shortly afterwards nobody threatened inky except loafers mcguire inky did all the mobs tattoo work he was the best in the state carla frazetti pushed through the door her blacksuited elegance seemed out of place in the dingy establishment hello boys she said hello miss carla said inky blushing deeply you didnt get too many ladies in the ink blot loafers jumped to his feet even he respected the bosss goddaughter miss frazetti you could have beeped me no need for you to come down to this dump no time for that this is urgent you leave straight away im leaving where am i going ireland your uncle pat is sick loafers frowned uncle pat i dont have an uncle pat carla tapped the toe of one stiletto hes sick loafers real sick if you catch my drift loafers finally caught on oh i get it so i gotta pay him a visit thats it thats exactly how sick he is loafers used a rag to clean the ink off his arm ok im ready are we going straight to the airport carla linked the tiny gangster soon loafers but first we need to pick up your brother i dont have a brother protested loafers of course you do the one with the keys to uncle pats house hes a regular little monkey oh said loafers that brother loafers and carla took the limo out to the east side loafers was still in awe of the sheer size of american buildings in kilkenny there was nothing over five storeys and loafers himself had lived all his life in a suburban bungalow not that he would ever admit that to his mob friends for their benefit he had reinvented himself as an orphan who spent his youth in and out of various remand homes whos the monkey he asked carla frazetti was fixing her jetblack hair in a compact mirror it was short and slicked back a new guy mo digence hes irish like you it makes things very convenient no visas no papers no elaborate cover story just two short guys home for the holidays loafers bristled what do you mean two short guys carla snapped the compact shut who are you talking to mcguire because you couldnt be talking to me not in that tone loafers paled his life flashing before him im sorry miss frazetti its just the short thing ive been listening to it my whole life what do you want people to call you lofty youre short loafers get over it thats what gives you your edge my godfather always says theres nothing more dangerous than a short guy with something to prove thats why youve got a job i suppose carla patted him on the shoulder cheer up loafers compared to this guy youre a regular giant loafers perked up considerably really just how short is mo digence hes short said carla i dont know the exact centimetres but any shorter and id be changing his diaper and stuffing him in a stroller loafers grinned he was going to enjoy this job the monkey mo digence had seen better days less than four months ago he had been living it up in a los angeles penthouse with over a million dollars in the bank but now his funds had been frozen by the criminal assets bureau and he was working for the chicago mob on a commission basis spatz antonelli was not known for the generosity of his commissions of course mo could always leave chicago and go back to la but there was a police task force there with his name on it just waiting for him to return to the scene of the crime in fact there was no safe haven for mo above ground or below it because mo digence was actually mulch diggums kleptomaniac dwarf and fugitive from the lep mulch was a tunnel dwarf who decided that a life in the mines was not for him and put his mining talents to another use namely relieving mud people of their valuables and selling them on the fairy black market of course entering anothers dwelling without permission meant forfeiting your magic but mulch didnt care dwarfs didnt have much power anyway and casting spells had always made him nauseous dwarfs have several physical features that make them ideal burglars they can dislocate their jaws ingesting several kilos of soil a second it is stripped of any beneficial minerals then ejected at the other end they have also developed the ability to drink through their pores an attribute that can be very handy during caveins it also transforms the pores into living suction cups a convenient tool in any burglars arsenal finally dwarf hair is actually a network of living antennae similar to feline whiskers which can do everything from trap beetles to bounce sonar waves off a tunnel wall mulch had been a rising star in the fairy underworld until commander julius root got hold of his file since then he had spent over three hundred years in and out of prison he was currently on the run for stealing several gold bars from the holly short ransom fund there was no safe haven below ground any more even among his own kind so mulch was forced to pass himself off as human and take whatever work he could get from the chicago mob there were hazards associated with impersonating a human of course his size drew attention from everyone who happened to glance downwards but mulch quickly discovered that mud people could find a reason to distrust almost anyone height weight skin colour religion it was almost safer to be different in some way the sun was a bigger problem dwarfs are extremely photosensitive with a burn time of less than three minutes luckily mulchs job generally involved night work but when he was forced to venture abroad in daylight hours the dwarf made certain that every centimetre of exposed skin was covered with longlasting sun block mulch had rented a basement apartment in an early twentiethcentury brownstone it was a bit of a fixerupper but this suited the dwarf just fine he stripped out the floorboards in the bedroom dumping two tons of topsoil and fertilizer on to the rotten foundations mould and damp already clung to the walls so no need to remodel anything there in a matter of hours insect life was thriving in the room mulch would lie back in his pit and snag cockroaches with his beard hair home sweet home not only was the apartment beginning to resemble a tunnel cave but if the lep came a callin he could be fifty metres below ground in the blink of an eye in the coming days mulch would come to regret not taking that route as soon as he heard the knock at the door there was a knock at the door mulch crawled out of his tunnel bed and checked the video buzzer carla frazetti was checking her hair in the brass knocker the bosss goddaughter in person this must be a big job perhaps the commission would be enough to set him up in another state hed been in chicago for nearly three months now and it was only a matter of time before the lep picked up his trail he would never leave the us though if you had to live above ground it might as well be somewhere with cable tv and a lot of rich people to steal from mulch pressed the intercom panel just a minute miss frazetti im getting dressed hurry it up mo snapped carla her voice crackly through the cheap speakers im getting old here mulch threw on a robe he had fashioned from old potato sacks he found the texture of the cloth reminiscent of haven penitentiary pyjamas to be weirdly comforting he gave his beard a quick comb to dislodge any straggling beetles and answered the door carla frazetti swept past him into the lounge settling into the rooms only armchair there was another person on the doorstep hidden beneath the cameras field mulch made a mental note redirect the cctv lens a fairy could sneak right in under it even if he or she wasnt shielded the man gave mulch a dangerous squint typical mob behaviour just because these people were murdering gangsters didnt mean they had to be rude dont you have another chair asked the small human following miss frazetti into the lounge mulch closed the door i dont get many visitors actually youre the first usually bruno beeps me and i come into the chop shop bruno the cheese was the mobs local supervisor he ran his business from a local hotcar warehouse legend had it that he hadnt been out from behind his desk during work hours in fifteen years quite a look youve got going here said loafers sarcastically mould and woodlice i like it mulch ran a fond finger along a green strip of damp that mould was just sitting behind the wallpaper when i moved in amazing what people cover up carla frazetti took a bottle of white petals perfume from her bag and sprayed the air around her person ok enough conversation i have a special job for you mo mulch forced himself to stay calm this was his big chance maybe he could find a nice damp hell hole and settle down for a while is this the kind of job where theres a big payoff if you do it right no replied carla this is the kind of job where theres a painful payoff if you do it wrong mulch sighed didnt anyone talk nicely any more so why me he asked carla frazetti smiled her ruby winking in the gloom im going to answer that question mo even though im not used to explaining myself to the hired help especially not a monkey like yourself mulch swallowed sometimes he forgot how ruthless these people were never for long youve been chosen for this assignment mo because of the outstanding job you did with that van gogh mulch smiled modestly the museum alarm had been childs play there hadnt even been any dogs but also because you have an irish passport a gnome fugitive hiding out in nyc had run him up some irish papers on a stolen lep copier the irish had always been mulchs favourite humans so he had decided to be one he should have known it would lead to trouble this particular job is in ireland which might be a problem generally but for you two itll be like a paid holiday mulch nodded at loafers whos the mutt loafers squint narrowed mulch knew that if miss frazetti gave the word the man would kill him on the spot the mutt is loafers mcguire your partner hes a metal man its a twotiered job you open the doors loafers escorts the mark back here escorting the mark mulch understood what that term meant and he didnt want any part of it robbery was one thing but kidnapping was another mulch knew that he couldnt actually turn down this assignment what he could do was ditch the metal man at the first opportunity and head to one of the southern states apparently florida had some lovely swamps so whos the mark said mulch pretending that it mattered thats needtoknow information said loafers and let me guess i dont need to know carla frazetti pulled a photograph from her coat pocket the less you know the less you have to feel guilty about this is all you need the house this photograph is all we have for the moment you can case the joint when you get there mulch took the photo what he saw on the paper hit him like a gas attack it was fowl manor therefore artemis was the target this little psychopath was being sent to kidnap artemis frazetti sensed his discomfort something wrong mo dont let it show on your face thought mulch dont let them see no its eh thats quite a setup i can see alarm boxes and outdoor spots its not going to be easy if it was easy id do it myself said carla loafers took a step forward looking down at mulch whats the matter little man too tough for you mulch was forced to think on his feet if carla frazetti thought he wasnt up to the job then they would send somebody else somebody with no qualms about leading the mob to artemiss door mulch was surprised to realize that he couldnt let that happen the irish boy had saved his life during the goblin rebellion and was the closest thing he had to a friend which was pretty pathetic when you thought about it he had to take the job if only to make sure that it didnt go according to plan hey dont worry about me a building hasnt been built that mo digence cant crack i just hope loafers is man enough for the job loafers grabbed the dwarf by the lapels whats that supposed to mean digence mulch generally avoided insulting people who were likely to kill him but it might be useful to establish loafers as a hothead now especially if he was going to blame him for things going wrong later its one thing being a midget monkey but a midget metal man how good can you be at close quarters loafers dropped the dwarf and ripped open his shirt to reveal a chest rippling with a tapestry of tattoos thats how good i am digence count the tattoos count em mulch shot miss frazetti a loaded look the look said youre going to trust this guy thats enough said carla the testosterone in here is starting to stink worse than the walls this is a very important job if you two cant handle it ill bring in another team loafers buttoned his shirt ok miss frazetti we can handle it this job is as good as done carla stood brushing a couple of centipedes from the hem of her jacket the insects didnt bother her unduly shed seen a lot worse in her twentyfive years glad to hear it mo put some clothes on and grab your monkey kit well wait in the limo loafers poked mulch in the chest five minutes then were coming in to get you mulch watched them go this was his last chance to duck out he could chew through the bedroom foundations and be on a southbound train before carla frazetti knew he was gone mulch thought about it seriously this kind of thing was totally against his nature it wasnt that he was a bad fairy it was simply that he wasnt accustomed to helping other people not unless there was something in it for him deciding to help artemis fowl was a completely selfless act mulch shuddered a conscience was the last thing he needed right now next thing you knew hed be selling cookies for the girl right now next thing you knew hed be selling cookies for the girl guides chapter assault on fowl manor excerpt from artemis fowls diary disk encrypted my father had finally regained consciousness i was of course relieved but his last words to me that day were chasing themselves around in my mind gold isnt allimportant arty he had said neither is power we have everything we need right here the three of us was it possible that the magic had transformed my father i had to know i needed to speak to him alone so at am the following morning i had butler bring me back to helsinkis university hospital in the rented mercedes father was still awake reading war and peace by lamplight not many laughs he commented more jokes i tried to smile but my face just wasnt in the mood father closed the book ive been expecting you arty we need to talk there are a few things we have to straighten out i stood stiffly at the foot of the bed yes father i agree fathers smile was tinged with sadness so formal i remember being the same with my own father i sometimes think that he didnt know me at all and i worry that the same thing will happen to us so i want us to talk son not about bank accounts not stocks and shares not corporate takeovers i dont want to talk business i want to talk about you i had been afraid of this me you are the priority here father perhaps but i cannot be happy until your mothers mind is put at rest at rest i asked as though i didnt know where this was going dont play the innocent artemis ive called a few of my lawenforcement contacts around europe apparently you have been active in my absence very active i shrugged unsure whether i was being scolded or praised not so long ago i would have been very impressed by your antics such audacity and still a minor but now speaking as a father things have to change arty you must reclaim your childhood it is my wish and your mothers that you return to school after the holidays and leave the familys business to me but father trust me arty ive been in business a lot longer than you i have promised your mother that the fowls are on the straight and narrow from now on all of the fowls i have another chance and i will not waste it on greed we are a family now a proper one from now on the fowl name will be associated with honour and honesty agreed agreed i said clasping his hand but what of my meeting with chicagos jon spiro i decided to proceed as planned one last adventure then the fowls could be a proper family after all butler would accompany me what could go wrong fowl manor butler opened his eyes he was home artemis was asleep in the armchair beside the bed the boy looked a hundred years old it wasnt surprising after all hed been through that life was over now though all of it anybody home said the manservant artemis was instantly alert butler youve come back to us butler struggled on to his elbows it was quite an effort its a surprise to me i never expected to see you or anyone ever again artemis poured a glass of water from the bedside jug here old friend just rest butler drank slowly he was tired but it was more than that he had felt battle fatigue before but this went deeper artemis what has happened i shouldnt be alive at all and if i accept that i am alive then i should be experiencing massive amounts of pain right about now artemis crossed to the window looking out over the estate blunt shot you it was a fatal wound and holly wasnt around to help so i froze you until she arrived butler shook his head cryogenics only artemis fowl you used the fish freezers i suppose artemis nodded i trust i am not part freshwater trout now eh when artemis turned to face his friend he was not smiling there were complications complications artemis took a breath it was a difficult healing no way to predict the outcome foaly warned that it might be too much for your system but i insisted we press on butler sat up artemis its all right im alive anything is better than the alternative artemis was not reassured he took a pearlhandled mirror from the locker prepare yourself and take a look butler took a deep breath and looked he stretched his jaw and pinched the bags beneath his eyes just how long was i out he asked transatlantic boeing mulch had decided that the best way to undermine the mission was to antagonize loafers until he went crazy driving people crazy was a talent of his and one that he did not get to exercise often enough the two diminutive individuals were seated side by side in a watching the clouds shoot past below first class one of the perks of working for the antonellis mulch sipped delicately from a champagne flute so slippers thats loafers oh yes loafers whats the story behind all the tattoos loafers rolled up his sleeve revealing a turquoise snake with drops of blood for eyes another of his own designs i get one done after every job oh said mulch so if you paint a kitchen then you get a tattoo not that kind of job stupid what kind of job then loafers ground his teeth do i have to spell it out for you mulch pinched some peanuts from a passing tray no point i never got no schoolin plain english will be fine you cant be this stupid spatz antonelli doesnt hire morons mulch gave a smarmy wink you sure about that loafers patted his shirt hoping to find a weapon of some kind you wait until this is over smart alec me and you will settle our differences you keep telling yourself that boots loafers whatever mulch hid behind the airline magazine this was too easy the mobster was halfcrazed already a few more hours in mulchs company should be enough to have loafers mcguire foaming at the mouth dublin airport ireland mulch and loafers passed through irish customs without incident after all they were simply citizens returning home for the holidays it wasnt as if they were a mob team up to no good how could they be whoever heard of little people being involved in organized crime nobody but maybe that was because they were very good at it passport control provided mulch with another opportunity to infuriate his partner the officer was doing his best not to notice mulchs height or lack of it so mister digence home to visit the family mulch nodded thats right my mothers folks are from killarney oh really oreilly actually but whats a vowel between friends very good you should be on the stage its funny you should mention that the passport officer groaned ten more minutes and his shift would have been over i was being sarcastic actually he muttered because my friend mister mcguire and i are also doing a stint in the christmas pantomime its snow white im doc and hes dopey the passport officer forced a smile very good next mulch spoke for the entire queue to hear of course mister mcguire there was born to play dopey if you catch my drift loafers lost it right there in the terminal you little freak he screamed ill kill you youll be my next tattoo youll be my next tattoo mulch tutted as loafers disappeared beneath half a dozen security guards actors he said highly strung they released loafers three hours later after a full search and several phone calls to the parish priest in his home town mulch was waiting in the preordered rental car a specially modified model with elevated accelerator and brake pedals your temper is seriously jeopardizing this operation commented the dwarf straightfaced ill have to phone miss frazetti if you cant control yourself drive said the metal man hoarsely lets get this over with ok then but youre on your very last chance one more episode like that and im going to have to crush your head between my teeth loafers noticed his partners teeth for the first time they were tombstoneshaped blocks of enamel and there seemed to be an awful lot of them for just one mouth was it possible that digence could actually do what he threatened no loafers decided he was just a bit spooked after the customs interrogation still there was something about the dwarfs smile a glint that spoke of hidden and frightening talents talents that the metal man would prefer to stay hidden mulch took care of the driving while loafers made a couple of calls on his mobile phone it was a simple matter for him to contact a few old associates and arrange for a weapon a silencer and two headsets to be left in a duffel bag behind the motorway exit sign for fowl manor loafers associates even took credit cards so there was no need for the usual macho tradeoff that generally accompanied blackmarket transactions loafers checked the weapons action and sights in the car he felt in control again so mo said loafers chuckling as if that simple rhyme was the funniest joke he had ever made and sadly it was have you put together a plan yet mulch didnt take his eyes from the road nope i thought you were the head honcho here plans are your department i just break and enter thats right i am the head honcho and believe me master fowl is going to realize that too when im finished talking to him master fowl said mulch innocently were here for some kid not just some kid revealed loafers against orders artemis fowl heir to the fowl criminal empire he has something in his head that miss frazetti wants so were supposed to impress upon the little brat how important it is that he come with us and spill the beans mulchs grip tightened on the wheel he should have made his move before now but the trick was not to incapacitate loafers it was persuading carla frazetti not to send another team artemis would know what to do he had to get to the boy before loafers did a mobile phone and a visit to the bathroom were all he needed a pity he had never bothered purchasing a phone but there had never been anybody to call before besides you could never be too careful with foaly that centaur could triangulate a chirping cricket we better stop for supplies said loafers it could take days to check this place out no need i know the layout i burgled it before in my youth piece of cake and you didnt mention this before because mulch made a rude gesture at a lorry driver hogging both lanes you know the way it is i work on commission the commission is calculated on a hardship basis the second i say i turned this place over before ten grand is cut off my fee loafers didnt argue it was true you always exaggerated the difficulty of the job anything to squeeze a few more bucks out of your employer so you can get us in there i can get me in there then i come back out for you loafers was suspicious why dont i just come with you it would be a lot easier than hanging around in broad daylight firstly im not going in until after dark and secondly sure you can come with me if you dont mind crawling through the septic tank and up nine metres of effluent pipe loafers had to open a window at the thought of it ok you come get me but we stay in contact over the headsets anything goes wrong and you let me know yes sir boss said mulch screwing the earpiece into a hairy ear and clipping the mike to his jacket wouldnt want you to miss your appointment intimidating a kid the sarcasm made a slight whistling noise as it flew over loafers head thats right said the kilkenny man i am the boss and you dont want to make me late for my appointment mulch had to concentrate to stop his beard hair curling dwarf hair is very moodsensitive especially to hostility and it was flowing out of this mans every pore mulchs bristles had never been wrong yet this little partnership was not going to end well mulch parked in the shadow of the fowl estates boundary wall you certain this is the place asked loafers mulch pointed a stubby finger at the ornate iron gate you see there where it says fowl manor yes id say this was probably the place even loafers couldnt miss a direct jibe like that you better get me in there digence or mulch showed him the teeth or what or miss frazetti will be extremely annoyed completed loafers lamely well aware that he was losing the hardmanbanter battle loafers resolved to teach mo digence a lesson as soon as possible we wouldnt want to annoy miss frazetti said mulch he climbed down from the elevated seat and reclaimed his gear bag from the trunk there were certain unorthodox burglary tools in the bag supplied by his fairy contact in new york hopefully none of them would be needed not the way he intended gaining entrance to the manor mulch rapped on the passenger window loafers buzzed it open what remember you stay here until i come and get you that sounds like an order digence are you giving me orders now me said mulch revealing the full expanse of his teeth giving orders i wouldnt dream of it loafers buzzed the window back up you better not be he said as soon as there was a layer of toughened glass between him and those teeth inside fowl manor butler had just finished clipping and shaving he was beginning to look like his old self again his older self kevlar you say he repeated examining the darkened tissue on his chest artemis nodded apparently some fibres were trapped in the wound the magic replicated them according to foaly the new tissue will restrict your breathing but it isnt dense enough to be bulletproof except for a smallcalibre bullet butler buttoned his shirt everything is different artemis i cant guard you any more i wont need guarding holly was right my grand schemes generally lead to people getting hurt as soon as we have dealt with spiro i intend to concentrate on my education as soon as we have dealt with spiro you make it sound like a foregone conclusion jon spiro is a dangerous man artemis i thought you would have learned that i have old friend believe me i wont underestimate him again i have already begun to formulate a plan we should be able to retrieve the c cube and neutralize mister spiro providing holly agrees to help where is holly i need to thank her again artemis glanced out of the window she has gone to complete the ritual you can guess where butler nodded they had first encountered holly at a sacred fairy site in the southeast while she was conducting the powerrestoring ritual although encountered was not the term holly used abducted was closer to the truth she should be back within the hour i suggest you rest until then butler shook his head i can rest later right now i have to check the grounds its unlikely that spiro could put a team together so quickly but you never know the bodyguard crossed to a wall panel that linked his room to the securitysystem control booth artemis could see that each step was an effort with butlers new chest tissue just climbing the stairs would seem like a marathon butler splitscreened his monitor so he could view all the cctvs simultaneously one of the screens interested him more than the others so he punched it up on the monitor well well he chuckled look whos dropped in to say hello artemis crossed to the security panel there was a very small individual making rude gestures at the kitchendoor camera mulch diggums said artemis just the dwarf i wanted to see butler transferred mulchs image to the main screen perhaps but why does he want to see you melodramatic as always the dwarf insisted on a sandwich before explaining the situation unfortunately for mulch it was artemis who volunteered to prepare it for him he emerged from the pantry with what resembled nothing more than an explosion on a plate its more difficult than it looks explained the boy mulch cranked open his massive jaws pouring the whole pile down in one swallow after several minutes chewing he reached an entire hand into his mouth and dislodged a chunk of roast turkey next time more mustard he said brushing some crumbs from his shirt and in the process inadvertently switching on the mike clipped there youre welcome said artemis you should be thanking me mud boy said mulch i came all the way from chicago to save your life surely thats worth one lousy sandwich and when i say sandwich i mean it in the loosest sense of the word chicago jon spiro sent you the dwarf shook his head possibly but not directly i work for the antonelli family of course they have no idea that i am an actual fairy dwarf they think im simply the best cat burglar in the business chicagos district attorney has linked the antonellis to spiro in the past or rather hes tried to whatever anyway the plan is that i break in here and then my partner encourages you to accompany us to chicago butler was leaning against the table where is your partner now mulch outside the gate hes the small angry one glad to see youre alive by the way big man there was a rumour going around the underworld that you were dead i was said butler heading for the security booth but im better now loafers took a small spiral pad from his breast pocket in it he had recorded any quips that he felt had really worked in dangerous situations snappy dialogue that was the trademark of a good gangster according to the movies at any rate he flicked through the pages smiling fondly its time to close your account permanently larry ferrigamo bent banker th august im afraid your hard drive has just been wiped david spinski computer hacker rd september im doing this cause i knead the dough morty the baker th july it was good material maybe he would write his memoirs some day loafers was still chuckling when he heard mo talking in his earpiece at first he thought the monkey was speaking to him but then he realized that his socalled partner was spilling the beans to their pigeon you should be thanking me mud boy said digence i came all the way from chicago to save your life to save his life mo was working for the other side and the little idiot had forgotten about his mike loafers climbed out of the car being careful to lock it he would lose the deposit if the rental was stolen and miss frazetti would take it out of his commission there was a small pedestrian entrance in the wall beside the main gate mo digence had left it open loafers slipped through and hurried down the avenue careful to stay in the shadow of the trees in his ear mo kept rabbiting on he laid out their entire plan to the fowl kid without so much as the threat of torture it was completely voluntary digence had somehow been working for the irish kid all along and whats more mo was not mo he was mulch what kind of a name was that mulch who was apparently a fairy dwarf this was getting weirder and weirder maybe the fairy dwarfs were some kind of gang although it wasnt much of a gang name the fairy dwarfs were hardly going to strike terror into the hearts of the competition loafers trotted up the avenue past a line of elegant silver birches and an honesttogod croquet pitch two peacocks strutted around the edge of a water feature loafers snorted water feature in the days before tv gardeners it would have been called a pond loafers was wondering where the delivery entrance was when he saw the sign deliveries at rear thank you very much he checked his silencer and load one more time and tiptoed across the gravel driveway artemis sniffed the air whats that smell mulch poked his head round the refrigerator door me im afraid he mumbled an unfeasible amount of food revolving inside his mouth sunblock disgusting i know but id smell a whole lot worse without it think bacon strips on a flat rock in death valley a charming image dwarfs are subterranean creatures explained mulch even during the frond dynasty we lived underground frond was the first elfin king during his reign fairies and humans had shared the earths surface being photosensitive makes it difficult to exist among humans to be honest im a bit fed up of this life your wish is my command said a voice it was loafers he was standing at the kitchen door brandishing a very large gun in fairness to mulch he recovered well i thought i told you to wait outside its true you did but i decided to come in anyway and guess what no septic tank no effluent pipe the back door is wide open mulch tended to grind his teeth when he thought it sounded like nails being scraped down a chalkboard ah yes a stroke of luck there i took advantage of it but unfortunately i was interrupted by the boy i had just gained his confidence when you burst in dont bother said loafers your mike is on i heard the whole thing mo or should i say mulch the fairy dwarf mulch swallowed the halfchewed mass of food once again his big mouth had got him into trouble maybe it could get him out of trouble too it was just possible that he could unhinge his jaw and swallow the little hit man hed eaten bigger a quick burst of dwarf gas should be enough to propel him across the room hed just have to hope that the gun didnt go off before he could pass it loafers caught the look in mulchs eye thats right little man he said cocking his pistol you go for it see how far you get artemis was thinking too he knew that he was safe for the moment the newcomer would not harm him against orders but mulchs time was running out and there was no one to save him butler was too weak to intervene even if he had been here holly was away completing the ritual and artemis himself was not the best in physical situations he would have to negotiate i know what youre here for he began the cubes secrets ill tell you but not if you harm my friend loafers waved the gun barrel youll do whatever i ask when i ask possibly youll cry like a girl too sometimes that happens very well ill tell you what you want to know just dont shoot anyone loafers swallowed a grin sure thats fine you just come with me nice and quiet and i wont hurt a soul you have my word butler entered the kitchen his face was slick with perspiration and his breath came in short gasps i checked the monitor he said the car is empty the other man must be here completed loafers old news to everyone except you grandad now no sudden moves and you might not have a heart attack artemis saw butlers eyes flitting around the room he was searching for an angle some way to save them maybe yesterdays butler could have done it but todays butler was fifteen years older and not yet fully recovered from magical surgery the situation was desperate you could tie the others up ventured artemis then we could leave together loafers smacked his own head what a great idea then maybe i could agree to some other delaying tactic on account of me being a complete amateur loafers felt a shadow fall across his back he spun round to see a girl standing in the doorway another witness carla frazetti would be getting the bill for all these sundries this whole job had been misrepresented from the start ok miss said loafers go join the others and dont do anything stupid the girl at the door flicked her hair over one shoulder blinking her glittering green eyelids i dont do stupid things she said then her hand flicked out brushing against loafers weapon she grabbed the pistols slide and deftly twisted it from the stock the gun was now completely useless except for hammering nails loafers jerked backwards hey hey watch it i dont want to wound you by accident this gun could go off thats what he thought loafers continued brandishing his piece of harmless metal back off little girl i wont say it again juliet dangled the slide under his nose or what youll shoot me with this loafers stared crosseyed at the piece of metal hey that looks just like then juliet hit him in the chest so hard he crashed through the breakfast bar mulch stared over at the unconscious mobster then at the girl in the doorway hey butler just a shot in the dark here but id say thats your sister youre right said the manservant hugging juliet tightly how on earth did you guess chapter bestlaid plans fowl manor it was time for consultation that night the group sat in the manors conference room facing two monitors that juliet had brought down from the security booth foaly had hijacked the monitors frequency and was broadcasting live images of commander root and himself much to his own annoyance mulch was still present he had been attempting to weasel some kind of reward from artemis when holly returned and cuffed him to a chair roots cigar smoke was hazing the screen looks like the gangs all here he said using the fairy gift of tongues to speak english and guess what i dont like gangs holly had placed her headset in the centre of the conference table so all the rooms occupants could be picked up i can explain commander oh ill just bet you can but strangely i have a premonition that your explanation is going to cut no ice with me whatsoever and i will have your badge in my drawer by the end of this shift artemis tried to intervene really commander holly captain short is only here because i tricked her is that a fact and then pray tell why is she still there doing lunch are we this is no time for sarcasm commander we have a serious situation here potentially disastrous root exhaled a cloud of greenish smoke what you humans do to each other is your own affair we are not your personal police force fowl foaly cleared his throat were involved whether we like it or not artemis was the one who pinged us and thats not the worst of it julius root glanced across at the centaur foaly had called him by his first name things must be serious very well captain he said continue with your briefing holly opened a report on her handheld computer yesterday i responded to a recording from the sentinel warning system the call was sent by artemis fowl a mud man well known to the lep for his part in the bwa kell uprising fowls associate butler had been mortally injured on the orders of another mud man jon spiro and he requested my assistance with a healing which you refused and then requested technical backup to perform a mind wipe as per regulations holly could have sworn the screen was heating up no taking into account butlers considerable assistance during the goblin revolution i performed the healing and transported butler and fowl back to their domicile tell me you didnt fly them there was no alternative they were wrapped in cam foil root rubbed his temples one foot if there was so much as one foot sticking out we could be all over the internet by tomorrow holly why do you do this to me holly didnt reply what could she say theres more we have detained one of spiros employees a nasty piece of work did he see you no but he heard mulch say that he was a fairy dwarf no problem said foaly do a block mind wipe and send him home its not that simple the man is an assassin he could be sent back to finish the job i think we need to relocate him believe me he wont be missed here ok said foaly sedate him do the wipe and get rid of anything that might trigger his memories then send him somewhere he cant do any harm the commander took several long puffs to calm himself ok tell me about the probe and if fowl is responsible is the alert over no the human businessman jon spiro stole the fairy technology from artemis which artemis stole from us noted foaly this spiro character is determined to acquire the technologys secret and hes not particular how he gets it continued holly and who knows the secret asked root artemis is the only one who can operate the c cube do i want to know what a c cube is foaly took up the narrative artemis cobbled together a microcomputer from old lep technology most of it is obsolete below ground but by human standards its approximately fifty years ahead of their developmental schedule and therefore worth a fortune concluded the commander and therefore worth an absolute fortune agreed foaly suddenly mulch was listening a fortune exactly how much of a fortune root was relieved to have someone to shout at shut your mouth convict this doesnt concern you you just concentrate on enjoying your last few breaths of free air this time tomorrow youll be shaking hands with your cell mate and i hope hes a troll mulch was unbowed give me a break julius every time theres a fowl situation im the one who saves your sorry hide i have no doubt that whatever plan artemis concocts will feature yours truly probably in some ridiculously dangerous capacity roots complexion went from rose to fullbodied red well artemis do you plan on using the convict that depends on what on whether or not you give me holly roots head disappeared behind a fog of cigar smoke with the red tip glowing he looked like a steam train coming out of a tunnel some of the smoke drifted across to foalys screen it doesnt look good commented the centaur eventually root calmed down sufficiently to talk give you holly gods give me patience have you any idea the amount of red tape im ignoring just for this conference quite a lot id imagine a mountain of the stuff artemis a mountain i wouldnt be talking to you at all if it werent for the bwa kell thing if this ever leaked out id end up directing sewagetreatment subs in atlantis mulch winked at the screen i probably shouldnt have heard that the commander ignored him you have thirty seconds artemis sell it to me artemis rose standing directly before the screen spiro has fairy technology it is unlikely that he will be able to use it but it will put his scientists on to ion technology the man is a megalomaniac with no respect for life or the environment who knows what ghastly machine he will construct from fairy technology there is also the definite chance that his new technology will lead him to discover haven itself and if that happens the life of every creature on the planet and under it is at risk root wheeled his chair offcamera reappearing in foalys monitor he leaned close to the centaurs ear whispering in low tones it doesnt look good said holly i could be on the next shuttle home artemis drummed his fingers on the table it was difficult to see how he could take on spiro without fairy assistance after several moments the commander reappeared in his own screen this is serious we cannot afford to risk that this spiro person will activate another probe however small the possibility theres still a chance i will have to put together an insertion team the works a fully tooledup retrieval team a full team protested holly in an urban area commander you know what retrieval is like this could turn into a disaster let me take a crack at it root considered it it will take fortyeight hours to clear an operation so thats what you have i can cover for you for a couple of days i cant let you have foaly hell have enough to do putting this operation together but diggums can help if he wants its his choice i might drop a couple of the burglary charges but hes still facing five to ten for the bullion robbery thats all i can do if you fail then the retrieval team is waiting in the wings artemis thought about it very well root took a breath there is a condition i thought as much said artemis you want a mind wipe correct thats right artemis you are becoming a severe liability to the people if we are to assist you in this matter then you and your staff would have to submit to mind wipes and if we dont then we go straight to plan b and you get wiped anyway no offence commander but this is a technical matter foaly stepped in there are two kinds of mind wipe a block wipe which takes out everything in the chosen period holly could do that with the equipment in her bag and a finetune wipe which only deletes certain memories this is a more specialized procedure but there is less danger of a drop in iq we do a finetune wipe on all of you i detonate a data charge in your computer system that automatically deletes any fairyrelated files also i will need your permission to do a sweep of your house just in case there is any fairy memorabilia lying around in practical terms you will wake up the day after this operation with absolutely no record or memory of the fairy people youre talking about nearly two years of memories you wont miss them your brain will invent some new ones to fill the gaps it was a tough decision on the one hand his knowledge of the people was now a large part of artemiss psychological makeup on the other he could no longer put peoples lives at risk very well said the teenager i accept your offer root tossed the cigar into a nearby incinerator ok then we have a deal captain short keep a channel open at all times yes sir holly commander be careful on this one your career wont survive another blow understood sir said holly oh and convict mulch sighed you mean me i suppose julius root scowled its over mulch you wont escape again so get your brain ready for cold food and hard walls mulch stood presenting his back to the screen somehow the bumflap on his specially adapted tunnelling trousers flopped open presenting the commander with a lovely view of his rear end in the dwarf world presenting your behind was the ultimate insult as it is in most cultures commander root terminated the link after all there was no comeback from an affront like that west of wajir kenya east africa loafers mcguire woke up with a debilitating headache it was so painful that he felt obliged to come up with some imagery in case he had to describe it later his head felt he decided like there was an angry porcupine crawling around inside his cranium not bad he thought i should put that in the book then he thought whats a book his next thought was who am i shoes something to do with shoes it is always this way when memoryimplant subjects first regain consciousness the old identity hangs around for a few moments trying to assert itself until outside stimuli wash it away loafers sat up and the porcupine went crazy jamming needles into every square inch of his soft brain tissue oh groaned loafers cradling his aching skull what did all this mean where was he and how did he get here loafers looked at his arms for a second his brain projected tattoos on to the skin but the images quickly disappeared his skin was unblemished sunlight rolled across his forearms like white lightning all around him was scrubland terracotta earth stretched away to indigo hills in the distance a golden disc of sun blasted cracks in the shimmering earth two figures ran through the heatwaves elegant as cheetahs the men were giants easily seven feet tall each carried an oval hide shield a thin spear and a mobile phone their hair necks and ears were adorned with multicoloured beads loafers jumped to his feet feet which he noticed were clad in leather sandals the men were wearing nikes helphe criedhelp me the men altered their course jogging across to the confused mobster jambo brother are you lost asked one im sorry said loafers in perfect swahili i dont speak swahili the man glanced at his partner i see and what is you name loafers said loafers brain nuru said his mouth well nuru unatoka wapi where are you from the words were out before loafers could do anything about it i dont know where im from but i want to go with you to your village thats where i should be the kenyan warriors stared down at the little stranger he was the wrong colour true but he seemed sane enough the taller of the two unhooked a mobile phone from his leopardskin belt he punched in the village chieftains number jambo chief this is bobby the earth spirits have left us another one bobby laughed looking loafers up and down yes hes tiny but he looks strong and hes got a smile bigger than a peeled banana loafers stretched his smile just in case it was a factor for some reason all he wanted in this world was to go to the village and live a productive life ok chief ill bring him in he can have the missionarys old hut bobby clipped the phone back on to his belt very well brother nuru youre in follow us and try to keep up the warriors set off at a brisk run loafers henceforth to be known as nuru raced after them his leather sandals flapping beneath his feet he really would have to see about getting a pair of trainers one hundred and fifty feet over their heads captain holly short hovered shielded from view recording the entire incident relocation complete she said into her helmet mike the subject has been adopted successfully no apparent signs of original personality but he will be monitored at monthly intervals just in case foaly was on the other end of the line excellent captain return to shuttle port e immediately if you open the throttle you might just make the evening shuttle well have you back in ireland in a couple of hours holly did not need to be told twice it wasnt often you got clearance for a speed run she activated her radar in case of buzzards and set the stopwatch on her visor now she said lets see if we cant break the airspeed record a record that julius root had set eighty years ago part counterattack chapter hooks lines and sinkerss excerpt from artemis fowls diary disk encrypted today father was fitted for his prosthetic limb he joked throughout the entire process as though he were being measured for a new suit on grafton street i must admit his good humour was infectious and i found myself making excuses just to sit in the corner of the hospital room and enjoy his presence it wasnt always this way in the past one needed valid grounds to visit my father of course he wasnt generally available and even when he was his time was limited one did not burst into the fowl study without good reason but now i feel welcome at his side it is a nicefeeling my father always liked to impart wisdom but now it is more philosophical than financial in the old days he would direct my attention to the latest share prices in the financial times look artemis he would say everything else jails but gold stays steady that is because there is not enough of it and there never will be buy gold boy and keep it safe i liked to listen to his pearls of wisdom but now they are harder to understand on the third day of his consciousness i fell asleep on the hospital bed while my father did his walking exercises i woke to find him looking at me thoughtfully shall i tell you something arty he said i nodded unsure what to expect while i was a prisoner i thought about my life how i had wasted it gathering riches whatever the cost to my family and others around me in a mans life he gets few chances to make a difference to do the right thing to be a hero if you will i intend to become involved in that struggle this was not the kind of wisdom i was accustomed to hearing from my father was this his natural personality or the fairy magic or a combination of both i never got involved before i always thought the world could not be changed fathers gaze was intense burning with new passion but things are different now my priorities are different i intend to seize the day be the hero that every father should be he sat on the bed beside me and what about you arty will you make the journey with me when the moment comes will you take your chance to be a hero i couldnt respond i didnt know the answer i still dont fowl manor for two hours artemis locked himself in his study sitting crosslegged in the meditative position taught to him by butler occasionally he would voice an idea aloud to be picked up by a voiceactivated digital recorder placed on the mat before him butler and juliet knew better than to interrupt the planning process this period was crucial to the success of their mission artemis had the ability to visualize a hypothetical situation and calculate the likely outcomes it was almost a dream state and any disturbance could send the thread of his ideas flying like vapours eventually artemis emerged tired but satisfied he held three cdwritable disks i want you to study these files he said they contain details of your assignment when you have memorized the contents destroy the disks holly took the disks a cd how quaint we have these in museums there are several computers in the study continued artemis use any terminal you wish butler was emptyhanded nothing for me artemis he asked artemis waited until the others had gone i needed to give you your instructions verbally he began i dont want to risk foaly picking them up from the computer butler sighed deeply sinking into a leather armchair by the fireplace im not going with you am i artemis sat on the chairs arm no old friend but i have an important task for you really artemis said butler ive skipped right over my midlife crisis you dont have to invent a job just to make me feel useful no butler this is of vital importance it concerns the mind wipes if my plan succeeds we will have to submit to them i see no way to sabotage the process itself so i must ensure that something survives foalys search something that will trigger our memories of the people foaly once told me that a strong enough stimulus can result in total recall butler shifted his position in the chair wincing his chest was still giving him trouble not surprising really he had been alive less than two days any ideas we need to lay a couple of false trails foaly will be expecting that of course a hidden file on the server i could send an email to ourselves but not pick it up then the first time we check our mail all this information will come through artemis handed the bodyguard a folded sheet of a no doubt we will be mesmerized and questioned in the past we have hidden from the mesmer behind mirrored sunglasses we wont get away with that on this occasion so we need to come up with something else here are the instructions butler studied the plans its possible i know someone in limerick the best man in the country for this kind of specialized work excellent said artemis after that you need to put everything we have on the people on a disk all documents videos schematics everything and dont forget my diary the whole story is there and where do we hide this disk asked butler artemis untied the fairy pendant from around his neck id say this was about the same size as the disk wouldnt you butler tucked the gold medallion into his jacket pocket it soon will be he said butler prepared them a meal nothing fancy vegetarian spring rolls followed by mushroom risotto with creme caramel to finish mulch opted for a bucket of diced worms and beetles sauteed in a rainwater and moss vinaigrette has everybody studied their files artemis asked when the group had adjourned to the library yes said holly but i seem to be missing a few key pieces nobody has the entire plan just the parts concerning them i think its safer that way do we have the equipment i specified holly dumped the contents of her pack on the rug a complete lep surveillance kit including camouflage foil mikes video clips and a first aid box plus we still have two intact lep helmets and three laser handguns left over from the siege added butler and of course one of the prototype cubes from the lab artemis passed the cordless phone to mulch very well then we may as well get started the spiro needle jon spiro sat in his opulent office staring glumly at the c cube on his desk people thought it was easy being him how little they knew the more money you had the more pressure you were under he had eight hundred employees in this building alone all relying on him for a pay cheque they wanted yearly salary reviews medical plans babycare centres regular coffee breaks double pay for overtime and even stock options for heavens sake sometimes spiro missed the times when a troublesome worker was thrown out of a high window and that was the end of him these days if you threw someone out of a window theyd phone their lawyer on the way down but this cube could be the answer to his prayers a onceinalifetime deal the brass ring if he could get this weird little gizmo working the sky was the limit literally the worlds satellites would be his to command he would have complete control over spy satellites military lasers communications networks and most important of all television stations he could feasibly rule the world his secretary buzzed from reception mister blunt to see you sir spiro jabbed the intercom button ok marlene send him in and tell him he better look sorry blunt did indeed look sorry when he pushed through the double doors the doors themselves were imposing enough spiro had them stolen from the ballroom of the sunken titanic they were a perfect example of power gone mad arno blunt was not quite so cocky as he had been in london then again it is difficult to look arrogant when your forehead is a mass of bruises and your mouth is full of gums and nothing else spiro winced at the sight of his sunken cheeks how many teeth did you lose blunt touched his jaw gingerly all ob em dendish shaid de roods are shaddered it serves you right said spiro matteroffactly what do i gotta do arno i hand you artemis fowl on a platter and you mess it up tell me what happened and i dont want to hear about any earthquakes i want the truth blunt wiped a blob of drool from the corner of his mouth i doh undershtan ih shomeshin explohduh i dunno wha shome kinna shoun grenay buh i dell you shomeshin budlah ish dead i shod him in de head no way hesh geddin uh affer da oh shut up snapped spiro youre giving me a headache the sooner you get those new teeth the better my gumsh wi be healed suffishendly by hish afernoo i thought i told you to shut up shorry bosh youve put me in a very difficult situation arno because of your incompetence i had to hire a team from the antonellis carla is a smart girl she could decide that they deserve a percentage it would cost me billions arno tried his best to look remorseful and dont bother with the puppy dog look blunt it doesnt cut any ice with me if this deal goes south youll be losing a lot more than a couple of teeth arno decided to change the subject sho di your shiendishds geh de cube worging no said spiro twisting his gold identity bracelet fowl has it sealed up tight an eternity code or some such thing that idiot pearson couldnt get a peep out of it it was at that moment dramatically that a voice emanated from the c cubes microspeaker mesh mister spiro said the voice this is ireland calling do you read mister spiro jon spiro was not a man who spooked easily he hadnt seen a horror movie yet that could make him jump in his seat but the voice coming out of that speaker almost knocked him off his chair the quality was incredible close your eyes and youd swear that the person speaking was standing right in front of you you wan me do anshwer da i told you to shut up anyway i dont know how to answer this thing i can hear you mister spiro said the voice you dont need to do anything just talk the box does the rest spiro noticed that a digital wave meter had appeared on the cubes screen when he spoke it registered ok then we got communication now who the hell are you and how did you get this box working the name is mo digence mister spiro im the monkey from carla frazettis team i dont know what kind of box you have at your end i just have a plain old telephone well who dialled the number then a little kid i have here by the scruff of the neck i impressed upon him how important it was that i talk to you and how did you know to talk to me who gave you my name again the kid he was very eager to tell me everything after he saw what i did to the metal man spiro sighed if the metal man was damaged he would have to pay the antonellis a fine what did you do to the metal man nothing permanent but he wont be aiming any guns at kids for a while why did you feel it necessary to damage your own partner digence there was a pause on the other end while mulch got the supposed sequence of events sorted out it was like this mister spiro our instructions were to escort the kid across to the us but loafers goes crazy and starts waving a gun about i figured this was the wrong way to go so i stopped him forcibly anyway the kid gets so scared that he tells me everything i want to know and here i am now having a conversation with you spiro rubbed his hands together you did the right thing digence therell be a bonus in this for you ill see to it personally thanks mister spiro believe me the pleasure was mine is the fowl kid there right beside me a little pale but not a scratch on him put him on ordered spiro all traces of depression vanishing spiro its me artemiss voice was aloof but with an unmistakable tremor spiro squeezed the air as though it were artemiss neck not so cocky now kid its like i told you you dont have the guts for this job me on the other hand if i dont get what i want then ill have mo put you out of my misery do we understand each other yes loud and clear good said spiro clamping a huge cuban cigar between his teeth it would be chewed to a pulp but not lit now talk what do i have to do to get this cube working artemiss voice sounded even shakier than before its not that simple mister spiro the c cube is coded something called an eternity code i can remotely access certain basic functions the phone mp player and so on but to disable the code completely and unlock the cubes potential i need to have it here in front of me if you could just bring the cube here spiro spat out the cigar hold it right there fowl just how stupid do you think i am im going to bring this priceless technology back to europe forget it if youre going to disable this thing youre going to do it here in the spiro needle but my tools my lab i got tools here and a lab the best in the world you do it here yes whatever you say thats right kid whatever i say i want you to fuel up the lear jet that i happen to know you have and do a quick hop across to o hare airport ill have a chopper waiting for you i dont suppose i have a choice thats right kid you dont but do this right and i might just let you go did you get all that digence loud and clear mister spiro good im counting on you to get the kid here safely consider it done the line went dead spiro chuckled i think im going to celebrate he said punching the intercom button marlene send in a pot of coffee and no lowcaffeine junk either i want the real thing but mister spiro your doctors said spiro waited for his secretary to realize who she was arguing with im sorry sir right away sir spiro leaned back in his chair lacing his fingers behind his head you see blunt this is going to turn out fine in spite of your incompetence i got that kid just where i want him yesh shir mashderfully done shir spiro laughed shut up you clown you sound like some cartoon character yesh mosh amushing shir spiro licked his lips anticipating his coffee for a supposed genius that kid sure is gullible do this right and i might just let you go he fell for that one hook line and sinker blunt tried to grin it was not a pretty sight yesh mishduh shpiro hoo line an shinkuh fowl manor artemis hung up the phone his face flushed with the thrill of the sting what do you think he asked i think he bought it replied butler hook line and sinker added mulch you have a jet i presume theres a kitchen butler drove them to dublin airport in the bentley it was to be his final act in this particular operation holly and mulch huddled in the back glad of the tinted glass the butler siblings sat up front dressed in corresponding black armani suits juliet had jazzed hers up with a pink cravat and glitter makeup the family resemblance was clear the same narrow nose and full lips the same eyes jumping in their sockets like roulette balls in the wheel watching always watching you dont need a traditional gun on this trip said butler use an lep blaster they dont need reloading they shoot in a straight line forever and theyre nonlethal i gave holly a couple from my stash got it dom butler took the airport exit dom i havent been called that in so long being a bodyguard becomes your world you forget to have your own life are you sure thats what you want juliet juliet was twining her hair in a tight braid at the end of the plait she attached an ornamental jade ring ornamental and dangerous where else would i get to bodyslam people outside of a wrestling ring bodyguarding fits the bill for the moment butler lowered his voice of course its completely against protocol for you to have artemis as your principal he already knows your first name and truth be told i think hes a little fond of you juliet slapped the jade ring against her palm this is just temporary im not anybodys bodyguard just yet madame ko doesnt like my style im not surprised said butler pointing to the jade ring where did you get that juliet smiled my own idea a nice little surprise for anyone who underestimates females butler pulled into the setdown area listen to me juliet he said catching his sisters hand spiro is dangerous look what happened to me and in all modesty i was the best if this mission werent so vital to humans and fairies i wouldnt let you go at all juliet touched her brothers face i will be careful they climbed on to the walkway holly hovered shielded just above the throngs of business travellers and holidaymakers mulch had applied a fresh layer of sunblock and the stink repelled every human who was unfortunate enough to pick up his scent butler touched artemiss shoulder are you going to be all right artemis shrugged i honestly dont know without you by my side i feel as though one of my limbs is missing juliet will keep you safe she has an unusual style but she is a butler after all its one mission old friend then there will be no more need for bodyguards its a pity holly couldnt have simply mesmerized spiro through the cube artemis shook his head it wouldnt have worked even if we could have set up a link a fairy needs eyetoeye contact to mesmerize a strong mind like spiros i dont want to take any chances with this man he needs to be put away even if the fairies relocated him he could do some damage what about your plan butler asked from what you told me its quite convoluted are you sure its going to work artemis winked a very unusual display of levity im sure he said trust me im a genius juliet piloted the lear jet across the atlantic holly sat in the copilots chair admiring the hardware nice bird she commented not bad fairy girl said juliet switching to autopilot not a patch on fairy craft id bet the lep doesnt believe in comfort said holly theres barely enough room in an lep shuttle to swing a stink worm if you wanted to swing a stink worm true holly studied the pilot youve grown a lot in two years the last time i saw you you were a little girl juliet smiled a lot can happen in two years i spent most of that time wrestling big hairy men you should see fairy wrestling two pumpedup gnomes having it out in a zero g chamber not a pretty sight ill send you a videodisc no you wont holly remembered the mind wipes youre right she said no i wont in the passenger section of the lear jet mulch was reliving his glory days hey artemis he said through a mouthful of caviar remember the time i nearly blew butlers head off with a blast of gas artemis did not smile i remember mulch you were the spanner in an otherwise perfect works to tell you the truth it was an accident i was just nervous i didnt even realize the big guy was there that makes me feel better scuppered by a bowel problem and do you remember the time i saved your neck in koboi laboratories if it hadnt been for me youd be locked up in howlers peak right now cant you do anything without me artemis sipped mineral water from a crystal flute apparently not though i live for the day holly made her way back through the aisle wed better get you kitted out artemis we land in thirty minutes good idea holly emptied the bags contents on to the central table ok what do we need for now the throat mike and an iriscamera the lep captain selected what looked like a circular adhesive bandage from the pile she peeled back the adhesive layer and stuck the material to artemiss neck it immediately turned the colour of his skin memory latex explained holly its almost invisible maybe an ant crawling up your neck might notice it but apart from that the material is also xray proof so the mike is undetectable it will pick up whatever is said within a tenmetre radius and i record it on my helmet chip unfortunately we cant risk an earpiece too visible so we can hear you but you wont be able to hear us artemis swallowed feeling the mike ride on his adams apple and the camera here we go holly removed a contact lens from a jar of fluid this thing is a marvel weve got hiresolution digital quality recordable picture with several filter options including magnification and thermal mulch sucked a chicken bone dry youre starting to sound like foaly artemis stared at the lens a technological marvel it may be but its hazel of course its hazel my eyes are hazel im glad to hear it holly but my eyes are blue as you well know this iriscam will not do dont look at me like that mud boy youre the genius i cant go in there with one brown eye and one blue eye spiro will notice well you should have thought of that while you were meditating its a little late now artemis pinched the bridge of his nose youre right of course i am the mastermind here thinking is my responsibility not yours holly squinted suspiciously was that an insult mud boy mulch spat the chicken bone into a nearby bin i have to tell you arty a cockup this early in the proceedings doesnt exactly fill me with confidence i hope youre as clever as you keep telling everyone you are i never tell anybody exactly how clever i am they would be too scared very well we will have to risk the hazel iriscam with any luck spiro might not notice if he does i can invent some excuse holly placed the camera on the tip of her finger sliding the lens under artemiss lid its your decision artemis she said i just hope you havent met your match in jon spiro pm o hare airport chicago spiro was waiting for them at ohares private hangar he wore a furcollared greatcoat over his trademark white suit halogen lamps blasted the tarmac and the downdraught from the chopper blades snagged his coat tails it was all very cinematic all we need now is background music thought artemis as he descended the motorized steps as per instructions mulch was putting on the gangster act move it kid he snarled quite convincingly we dont want to keep mister spiro waiting artemis was about to respond when he realized that he was supposed to be the terrified kid it wasnt going to be easy being humble was a real problem for artemis fowl i said move it repeated the dwarf stressing the point with a firm shove artemis stumbled the last few steps almost colliding with a grinning arno blunt and this was no ordinary grin blunts teeth had been replaced by a customcrafted porcelain set the tips had been filed to sharp points the bodyguard looked for all the world like a human shark hybrid blunt caught artemiss stare you like em i got other sets too one is all flat for crushing stuff a cynical sneer was forming on artemiss mouth before he remembered his role replacing the sneer with a set of quivering lips he was basing his performance on the effect butler usually had on people spiro was not impressed nice acting sonny but pardon me if i doubt the great artemis fowl has fallen to pieces quite so easily arno check the plane blunt nodded curtly ducking inside the private jet juliet was dressed in a flight attendants uniform and was straightening the headrest covers for all her athletic ability she was finding it difficult not to fall out of her high heels wheres the pilot growled blunt living up to his name master artemis flies the plane replied juliet hes been flying it since he was eleven years old oh really is that legal juliet put on her best innocent face i dont know about legal mister i just serve the drinks blunt grunted charming as ever and had a quick poke about the jets interior eventually he decided to accept the flight attendants word lucky for him because had he decided to argue two things would have happened first juliet would have clobbered him with the jade ring and second holly who was lying shielded in an overhead locker would have blasted him into unconsciousness with her neutrino of course holly could simply have mesmerized the bodyguard but after what he had done to butler a blasting seemed more appropriate blunt stuck his head through the hatch no one in there except some dumb attendant spiro was not surprised i didnt think so but theyre here somewhere believe it or not digence artemis fowl did not get suckered by a goon like you hes here because he wants to be here artemis was not surprised by this deduction it was only natural that spiro should be suspicious i dont know what you mean he said im here because this odious little man threatened to crush my skull between his teeth why else would i come the c cube is useless to you and i could easily construct another one spiro was not even listening yeah yeah whatever you say kid but let me tell you something you bit off more than you could chew when you agreed to come here the spiro needle has the best security on the planet weve got stuff in there that even the military dont have once those doors close behind you youre on your own nobody is coming to save you nobody understand artemis nodded he understood what spiro was saying to him that wasnt to say that he agreed with it jon spiro might have stuff that the military didnt have but artemis fowl had stuff that humans had never seen a sikorsky executive helicopter whisked them downtown to the spiro needle they landed on a helipad on the skyscrapers roof artemis was familiar with helicopter controls and realized how difficult it must be to land in the bluster of the windy city the wind speed must be treacherous at this altitude he said casually holly could record the information on her helmet chip youre telling me shouted the pilot over the rotors din it gets over sixty miles an hour on top of the needle the helipad can sway up to ten metres in rough conditions spiro groaned giving blunt a nod arno reached forward and whacked the pilots helmet shut up you moron snapped spiro why dont you give him the blueprints to the building while youre at it he turned to artemis and in case youre wondering arty there arent any blueprints floating around anybody who goes looking in city hall is going to find that file mysteriously missing i have the only set so dont bother getting one of your associates to do an internet search no surprises there artemis had already run several searches himself although he hadnt really expected spiro to be so careless they climbed down from the sikorsky artemis was careful to point the iriscam at any security feature that could be useful later butler had often told him that even a seemingly insignificant detail like the number of steps in a stairwell could be vital when planning an operation a lift brought them down from the helipad to a keycoded door closedcircuit cameras were strategically placed to cover the entire rooftop spiro moved ahead to the keypad artemis felt a sharp sting in his eye and suddenly the iriscam magnified his vision by four in spite of the distance and shadows he could easily discern the entry code i hope you got that he muttered feeling the mike vibrating on his throat arno blunt bent his knees so his extraordinary teeth were a centimetre from artemiss nose are you talking to someone me said artemis who would i be talking to were eighty floors up in case you hadnt noticed blunt grabbed the teenager by the lapels hoisting him off the tarmac maybe youre wearing a wire maybe you have someone listening to us right now how could i be wearing a wire you big oaf your miniature hit man hasnt let me out of his sight for the entire journey he even accompanied me to the bathroom spiro cleared his throat noisily hey there mister igottamakemypoint that kid slips over the side and you might as well throw yourself off because that boy is worth more to me than an army of bodyguards blunt set artemis down youre not going to be valuable forever fowl he whispered ominously and when your stock falls ill be waiting they took a mirrored lift to the eightyfifth floor where doctor pearson waited along with two more musclebound minders artemis could tell by the look in their eyes that these two werent exactly brain surgeons in fact they were as close as you could get to rottweillers still balanced on two legs it was probably handy to have them around to break things and not ask questions spiro called one of them over pex do you know what the antonellis charge if you lose their personnel pex had to consider it for a moment his lips moved as he thought yeah wait i got it twenty grand for a metal man and fifteen for a monkey thats dead right dead or incapaci incatacip broken ok said spiro i want you and chips to go over to carla frazettis and tell her i owe her thirtyfive grand for the team ill wire it to her cayman account in the morning mulch was understandably curious and not a little apprehensive excuse me thirtyfive grand but im still alive you only owe twenty grand for loafers unless the extra fifteen k is my bonus spiro sighed with almost convincing regret this is the way it is mo he said punching mulch playfully on the shoulder this deal is huge mammoth were talking telephone numbers i cant afford any loose ends maybe you know something maybe you dont but im not about to take the chance that you might tip off phonetix or one of my other competitors im sure you understand mulch stretched his lips revealing a row of tombstone teeth i understand all right spiro youre a backstabbing snake you know the kid offered me two million dollars to cut him loose you should have taken the cash said arno blunt propelling mulch into pexs gigantic arms the dwarf kept talking even as he was being dragged down the corridor you better bury me deep spiro you better bury me real deep spiros eyes narrowed to wet slits you heard the man boys before you go to frazettis bury him deep doctor pearson led the party through to the vault room they had to pass through a small antechamber before entering the main security area please stand on the scanner pad said pearson we wouldnt want any bugs in here especially not the electronic kind artemis stepped on to the mat it sank like a sponge beneath his feet spurting jets of foam over his shoes antiinfection foam explained pearson kills any virus you might have picked up were keeping some biotechnology experiments in the vault at the moment very susceptible to disease the foam has the added advantage of shorting out any surveillance devices in your shoes overhead a mobile scanner bathed artemiss frame in purple light one of my own inventions said pearson a combination scanner i have incorporated thermal xray and metaldetector beams the beam basically breaks your body down into its elements and displays them on this screen here artemis saw a d replica of himself being traced out on the small plasma screen he held his breath praying that foalys equipment was as clever as the centaur thought it was onscreen a red light pulsed on artemiss jacket front aha said doctor pearson plucking off a button what have we here he cracked the button open revealing a tiny chip mike and power source very clever a microbug our young friend was attempting to spy on us mister spiro jon spiro was not angry in fact he was delighted to have the opportunity to gloat you see kid you may be some kind of genius but surveillance and espionage are my business you cant slip anything past me and the sooner you accept that the sooner we can get this thing over with artemis stepped off the pad the decoy had worked and the real bugs hadnt caused a blip in the system pearson was smart but foaly was smarter artemis made sure he had a good look around the antechamber there was more here every square centimetre of the metal surface contained a security or surveillance device from what artemis could see an invisible ant would have trouble sneaking in not to mention two humans an elf and a dwarf assuming the dwarf survived pex and chips the vault door itself was impressive most corporate vaults looked impressive plenty of chrome and keypads but that was just to make an impression on stockholders in spiros vault there wasnt a tumbler out of place artemis spotted the very latest computer lock on the face of titanium double doors spiro keyed in another complicated series of numbers and the metrethick doors slid back to reveal another barrier the secondary door imagine you are a thief said spiro an actor introducing a play and you somehow get into the building past the electronic eyes and the locked doors then imagine you somehow cheat the lasers the sensor pad and the door code and open the first vault door an impossible feat by the way and while were imagining all this lets pretend you disable the half dozen cameras and even then even after all that would you be able to do this spiro stood on a small red plate on the floor in front of the door he placed a thumb on a gelprint scanner held his left eyelid open and enunciated clearly jon spiro i am the boss so open up quick four things happened a retinal scanner filmed his left eye and fed the image into the computer a print plate scanned his right thumb and a vocal analyser scrutinized his voices accent timbre and intonations once the computer had verified all this information the alarms were deactivated and the secondary door slid open to reveal an expansive vault in the very middle in the centre of a custommade steel column rested the c cube it was enclosed in a perspex case with at least six cameras focused on its various planes two burly guards stood back to back forming a human barrier in front of the fairy technology spiro could not resist a jibe unlike you he said i look after my technology this is the only vault of its kind in the world live security in an airtight room interesting these guys are trained at high altitude also we change the guards on the hour and they all carry oxygen cylinders to keep them going what did you think i was going to put air vents into a vault artemis scowled no need to show off spiro im here you win so can we get on with it spiro punched a final number sequence into the columns keypad and the perspex panes retracted he took the cube from its foam nest overkill dont you think commented artemis all of this is hardly necessary you never know some crooked businessman could attempt to relieve me of my prize artemis took a chance on some calculated sarcasm really spiro did you think i would attempt a breakin perhaps you thought i would fly in here with my fairy friends and magic your box away spiro laughed you can bring all the fairy friends you like arty boy short of a miracle that cube is staying right where it is juliet was an american citizen by birth even though her brother had been born on the other side of the world she was glad to be back in her home country the discord of chicagos traffic and the constant chorus of multicultural voices made her feel at home she loved the skyscrapers and the steam vents and the affectionate sarcasm of the street vendors if she ever got the chance to settle down it would be in the us on the west coast though somewhere with sun juliet and holly were circling the spiro needle in a blacked out minivan holly sat in the back watching the live video feed from artemiss iriscam on her helmet visor at one point she punched the air triumphantly juliet stopped at a red light how are we doing not bad replied the fairy raising her visor theyre taking mulch to bury him cool just like artemis said they would and spiro has just invited all of artemiss fairy friends into the building this was a crucial development the book forbade fairies from entering human buildings without an invitation now holly was free to break in and wreak havoc without violating fairy doctrine excellent said juliet were in i get to bodyslam the guy who shot my brother not so fast this building has the most sophisticated mud man security system ive seen spiro has a few tricks in there that ive never come across before juliet finally found a space opposite the needles main revolving doors no problem for the little horsey guy surely no but foalys not supposed to help us juliet focused a set of binoculars on the door i know but it all depends on how you ask a smart guy like foaly what he needs is a challenge three figures emerged from the needle two large men in black and a smaller nervouslooking individual mulchs feet were treading air so fast that he seemed to be performing an irish jig not that he had any hope of escaping pex and chips had him tighter than two badgers fighting over a bone here comes mulch now we better give him backup just in case holly strapped on her mechanical harness extending the wings with the touch of a button ill follow them from the air you keep an eye on artemis juliet ran a video lead from one of the spare helmets handheld computers artemiss point of view sprang to life on the screen do you really think mulch needs help she asked holly buzzed into invisibility help im just going along to make sure he doesnt harm those two mud men inside the vault spiro was finished playing the gracious host let me tell you a little story arty he said lovingly caressing the c cube there was this irish kid who thought he was ready for the big time so he messed with a very serious businessman dont call me arty thought artemis my father calls me arty this businessman didnt appreciate being messed with so he messed back and this kid is dragged kicking and screaming into the real world so now this kid has to make a choice does he tell the businessman what he needs to know or does he put himself and his family in mortal danger well arty which one is it spiro was making a serious mistake by toying with artemis fowl it was difficult for adults to believe that this palefaced thirteenyearold could actually be a threat artemis had tried to take advantage of this by wearing casual clothes in place of his usual designer suit he had also been practising an innocent wideeyed look on the jet but wideeyed was not how you wanted to look when one iris did not match the other blunt prodded artemis between the shoulder blades mister spiro asked you a question his new teeth clicked as he talked im here am i not replied artemis ill do whatever you wish spiro placed the cube on a long steel table that ran down the centre of the vault what i wish is for you to disable your eternity code and get this cube working right now artemis wished that he could make himself perspire so that his anxiety would seem more authentic right now its not that simple spiro grabbed artemis by the shoulders staring him in the eye and why wouldnt it be that simple just punch in the code word and away we go artemis averted his mismatched eyes staring at the floor there is no straightforward code word an eternity code is built to be irreversible i have to reconstruct an entire language it could take days dont you have any notes yes on disk in ireland your monkey wouldnt let me bring anything in case it was boobytrapped can we access your hard drive online yes but i only keep my notes on disk we could fly back to ireland eighteen hours round trip spiro wouldnt even consider that option forget it as long as i have you here im in control who knows what kind of reception is waiting for me in ireland we do it here as long as it takes artemis sighed very well spiro replaced the cube in its perspex case get a good nights sleep kid because tomorrow youre going to peel this gizmo apart like an onion and if you dont whats about to happen to mo digence will happen to you artemis wasnt unduly worried by that threat he didnt believe mulch to be in any danger in fact if anyone was in trouble it was those two musclemen pex and chips chapter ghosts in the machine vacant lot malthouse industrial estate south chicago jon spiro had not hired pex and chips for their debating skills in the job interview they had only been set one task a hundred applicants were handed a walnut and asked to smash it however they could only two succeeded pex had shouted at the walnut for a few minutes then flattened it between his giant palms chips opted for a more controversial method he placed the walnut on the table grabbed his interviewer by the ponytail and used the mans forehead to smash the nut both men were hired on the spot they quickly established themselves as arno blunts most reliable lieutenants for inhouse work they were not allowed outside chicago as this could involve map reading something pex and chips were not very good at at the moment pex and chips were bonding under a full moon while mulch dug a dwarfsized pit in the dry clay behind an abandoned cement factory you wanna guess why they call me pex asked pex flexing his chest muscles as a hint chips opened a packet of the potato chips he was forever crunching i dunno is it like short for something like what i dunno said chips he used the phrase a lot francis this sounded dumb even to pex francis how could pex be short for francis chips shrugged hey i had an uncle robert and everyone called him bobby that dont make no sense neither pex rolled his eyes its pectorals moron pex is short for pectorals on account of me having big chest muscles in the pit mulch groaned listening to this mindless banter was almost as bad as having to dig a hole with a shovel mulch was tempted to deviate from the plan and launch himself into the flaky soil but artemis did not want any display of fairy powers at this stage of the proceedings if he took off and these goons escaped without being mesmerized then spiros paranoia would be driven up another notch on the surface chips was eager to continue the game guess why they call me chips he said hiding the bag of chips behind his back pex kneaded his forehead he knew this one dont tell me he said i can work it out mulch poked his head from the hole its because he eats chips you idiot chips eats chips you two are the thickest mud men i have ever met why dont you just kill me at least i wont have to listen to your drivel pex and chips were stunned with all the mental exercise they had almost forgotten about the little man in the hole plus they were unaccustomed to prospective victims saying anything besides oh no please god no pex leaned over the graves lip what do you mean drivel i mean that whole chips pex thing pex shook his head no i mean what does the word drivel mean ive never heard that one mulch was delighted to explain it means rubbish garbage claptrap twaddle baloney is that clear enough for you chips recognized the last one baloney hey thats an insult are you insulting us little man mulch clasped his hands in mock prayer finally a breakthrough the musclemen were uncertain how to react to actual abuse there were only two people alive who insulted them regularly arno blunt and jon spiro but that was part of the job you just ignored that by turning up the music in your head do we have to listen to his smart mouth pex asked his partner i dont think so maybe i should phone mister blunt mulch groaned if stupidity were a crime these two would be public enemies one and two what you should do is kill me that was the idea wasnt it just kill me and get it over with what do you think chips should we just kill him chips chewed on a handful of barbecue ruffles yeah course orders is orders but i wouldnt just kill me interjected mulch you wouldnt oh no after the way i just insulted your intelligence no i deserve something special you could almost see the steam coming out of pexs ears as his brain overheated thats right little man were gonna do something special to you we dont take no insults from anybody mulch did not bother pointing out the double negative youre right ive got a smart mouth and i deserve everything ive got coming to me there followed a short silence as pex and chips tried to come up with something worse than the usual straight shooting mulch gave them a minute then made a polite suggestion if it were me id bury me alive chips was horrified bury you alive thats terrible youd be screaming and clawing the dirt i could get nightmares i promise to lie still anyway i deserve it i did call you a pair of overdeveloped singlecelled cromagnons did you well i have now pex was the more impulsive of the duo ok mister digence you know what were gonna do were going to bury you alive mulch clapped two hands to his cheeks oh the horror you asked for it buddy i did didnt i pex grabbed a spare shovel from the boot nobody calls me an overdeveloped signal bell crow magnet mulch lay down obligingly in his grave no i bet nobody does pex shovelled furiously gymnasiumsculpted muscles stretching his suit jacket in minutes mulchs form was completely covered chips was feeling a bit squeamish that was horrible horrible that poor little guy pex was unrepentant yeah well he asked for it calling us all those things but buried alive thats like in that horror movie yknow the one with all the horror i think i saw that one with all the words going up the screen at the end yeah that was it tell you the truth those words kinda ruined it for me pex stamped on the loose earth dont worry buddy there are no words in this movie they climbed back into their chevrolet automobile chips was still a bit upset you know its much more real than a movie when its real pex ignored a noaccess sign and pulled on to the motorway its the smell you cant smell stuff in a movie chips sniffed emotionally digence musta been upset right there at the end im not surprised cause i could see him cryin his shoulders were shaking like he was laughing but he must have been crying i mean what sort of crazy whacko would laugh when hes getting buried alive he musta been crying chips opened a bag of smoky bacon curls yeah he musta been crying mulch was laughing so much that he nearly choked on the first mouthful of soil what a pair of clowns then again it was lucky for them that they had been clowns otherwise they might have chosen their own method of execution jaw unhinged mulch tunnelled straight down for five metres and then veered north to the cover of some abandoned warehouses his beard hair sent out sonar signals in all directions you couldnt be too careful in builtup areas there was always some wildlife and mud people had a habit of burying things in places you wouldnt expect them pipes septic tanks and barrels of industrial waste were all things he had taking an unwitting bite of in his day and there is nothing worse than finding something in your mouth that you werent expecting to be there especially if its wriggling it felt good to be tunnelling again this was what dwarfs were born to do the earth felt right between his fingers and he soon settled into his distance rhythm scooping muck between his grinding teeth breathing through slitted nostrils and pumping waste material out the other end mulchs hair antennae informed him that there were no vibrations on the surface so he kicked upwards using the last vestiges of dwarf gas to propel him from his hole holly caught him a metre from the ground charming she said what can i tell you said mulch unapologetically im a force of nature you were up there all that time yes just in case things got out of hand you put on quite a show mulch slapped the clay from his clothes a couple of neutrino blasts could have saved me a lot of digging holly smiled in spooky imitation of artemis thats not in the plan and we must stick to the plan now mustnt we she draped a sheet of cam foil around the dwarfs shoulders and hooked him on to her moonbelt take it easy now wont you said mulch anxiously dwarfs are creatures of the soil we dont like flying we dont even like jumping too high holly opened the throttle on her wings heading downtown ill be just as considerate of your feelings as you are of the leps mulch paled funny how this diminutive elf was much scarier than two sixfoot hit men holly if i ever did anything to offend you i unreservedly he never finished that particular sentence because their sudden acceleration forced the words back down his throat the spiro needle arno blunt walked artemis to his cell it was comfortable enough with its own bathroom and entertainment system there were a couple of things missing windows and a handle on the door blunt patted artemis on the head i dont know what happened in that london restaurant but you try anything like that here and i will turn you inside out and eat your organs he gnashed his pointy teeth to make the point and leaned close whispering into artemiss ear artemis could hear the teeth click with every syllable i dont care what the boss says youre not going to be useful forever so if i were you id be very nice to me if you were me responded artemis then id be you and if i were you then id hide somewhere far away oh really and why would you do that artemis paused to give him the full effect of his words because butler is coming for you and hes extremely annoyed blunt backed off a few steps no way kid i saw him go down i saw the blood artemis grinned i didnt say he was alive i just said he was coming youre just messing with my mind mister spiro warned me about this blunt edged out of the door never taking his eyes off artemis dont worry blunt i dont have him here in my pocket you have hours maybe days before the time comes arno blunt slammed the door so hard that the frame shook artemiss grin widened every cloud had a silver lining artemis stepped into the shower allowing the jet of hot water to pound him on the forehead in truth he felt a little anxious it was one thing to formulate a plan in the safety of ones own home it was quite another to execute that plan while trapped in the lions den and even though he would never admit it his confidence had taken quite a pounding in the last few days spiro had outwitted him back in london and without apparent effort he had strolled into the entrepreneurs trap as naively as a tourist down a back alley artemis was well aware of his talents he was a plotter a schemer a planner of dastardly deeds there was no thrill greater than the execution of a perfect plan but lately his victories had been tainted by guilt especially over what had happened to butler artemis had been so close to losing his old friend that it made him queasy just thinking about it things had to change his father would be watching soon hoping that artemis would make the right choices and if he didnt artemis senior would quite possibly take those choices away from him he remembered his fathers words and what about you arty will you make the journey with me when the moment comes will you take your chance to he a hero artemis still did not have the answer to that question artemis wrapped himself in a robe monogrammed with his captors initials not only was spiro reminding him of his presence with the gold letters but a motionsensitive closedcircuit camera was following artemis around the room artemis focused on the challenging task of breaking into spiros vault and stealing back the c cube he had anticipated many of spiros security measures and packed accordingly although some were unforeseen and quite ingenious artemis had fairy technology on his side and hopefully foaly too the centaur had been ordered not to help but if holly presented the breakin as a test artemis felt sure that the centaur would be unable to resist he sat on the bed casually scratching his neck the mikes latex covering had survived the shower as holly had assured him it would it was comforting to know that he was not alone in his prison because the microphone operated on vibrations artemis did not have to speak aloud for his instructions to be transmitted good evening friends he whispered his back to the camera everything proceeds according to plan taking it as read that mulch made it back alive i must warn you to expect a visit from spiros goons i am certain his personnel have been monitoring the streets and it should lull him into a false sense of security if he believes my people to be wiped out mister spiro has kindly given me a tour of the facility and hopefully you have recorded everything we need to complete our mission i believe the local term for this kind of operation is heist this is what i want you to do artemis whispered slowly enunciating each point clearly it was vital that his team members followed his instructions to the letter if they did not the entire plot could explode like an active volcano and at the moment he was sitting in the volcanos crater pex and chips were in a good mood on their return to the needle not only had mister blunt handed over their fivegrand bonus for the mo digence job but he had also given them another assignment the needles external surveillance cameras had picked up a black van parked opposite the main door it had been there for over three hours and a review of the tapes showed the vehicle circling the building for over an hour looking for a space mister spiro had warned them to look out for suspicious vehicles and this was certainly suspicious go down there blunt had ordered from his chair in the security office and if theres anything breathing inside ask them why theyre breathing outside my building this was the kind of instruction that pex and chips understood no asking questions no operating complex machinery just open the door scare everything close the door easy they kidded around in the lift punching each other in the shoulder until their upper arms went numb we could make big bucks tonight partner said pex massaging his biceps to get the circulation going we sure could enthused chips thinking about all the barney dvds he could buy this must be worth another bonus five grand at least altogether thats there followed several moments silence while both men counted on their fingers thats a lot of cash said pex finally a lot of cash agreed chips juliet had her binoculars trained on the needles revolving door it would have been easier to use the optix on a fairy helmet but unfortunately her head had grown too large in the past couple of years that wasnt the only thing to have changed juliet had transformed from gangly kid to toned athlete she wasnt perfect bodyguard material though there were still a few wrinkles to be ironed out personality wrinkles juliet butler was a funloving creature she couldnt help it she found the idea of standing pofaced at the shoulder of some opinionated politician appalling shed go crazy from boredom unless artemis asked her to stay on professionally a person could never be bored at artemis fowls side but that was not likely to happen artemis had assured everyone that this was his last job after chicago he was going straight if there was an after chicago this stakeout business was boring too sitting quietly was not in juliets nature her hyperactive disposition had caused her to fail more than one class at madame kos academy be at peace with yourself girl the japanese instructor had said find that quiet place at your core and inhabit it juliet generally had to stifle a yawn when madame ko started on the kung fu wisdom stuff butler on the other hand ate it up he was forever finding his quiet place and inhabiting it in fact he only came out of his quiet place to pulverize whoever was threatening artemis at the time maybe that was why he had his blue diamond tattoo and juliet didnt two burly figures emerged from the needle they were grinning and punching each other on the shoulder captain short were on said juliet into a walkietalkie tuned to hollys frequency understood responded holly from her position above the spiro needle how many hostiles two big and dumb you need backup negative ill wrap these two you can have a word on your return ok ill be down in five as soon as ive had a talk with foaly and juliet dont mark them understood juliet switched off the radio climbing into the rear of the van she swept a pile of surveillance equipment under a foldup seat just in case the two heavies actually managed to incapacitate her it wasnt likely but her brother would hide the incriminating equipment just in case juliet pulled off her suit jacket and placed a baseball cap backwards on her head she then popped the rear door and clambered out on to the road pex and chips crossed state street to the suspect van it certainly looked suspicious with its blackedout windows but the pair were not unduly concerned every testosteronefuelled college freshman had blackedout windows these days whatcha think pex asked his partner chips curled his fingers into fists i think we dont bother knocking pex nodded this was the plan that they generally went with chips would have proceeded to wrench the door from its hinges had a young lady not appeared from around the bonnet you guys looking for my dad said the girl in perfect mtv tones people are always like looking for him and hes never around daddy is so not here and i mean that spiritually pex and chips blinked in unison the blink being universal body language for huh this girl was a stunning blend of asian and caucasian but she might as well have been talking greek for all the comprehension that registered on the security mens faces spiritually had five syllables for heavens sake you own this van asked chips taking the offensive the girl twisted her ponytail as much as any of us can like own anything one world one people right man ownership is like you know an illusion maybe we dont even own our own bodies we could be like the daydreams of some greater spirit pex cracked do you own the van he shouted wrapping thumb and forefinger round the girls neck the girl nodded there wasnt enough air in her windpipe for speech thats better anyone inside a shake of the head this time pex relaxed his grip slightly how many more in the family the girl answered in a whisper using as little air as possible seven dad mom two grandparents and the triplets beau mo and joe theyre gone for sushi pex cheered up considerably triplets and grandparents that didnt sound like any problem ok we wait open her up kid sushi said chips thats raw fish you ever have that buddy pex held the girl by the neck while she fiddled with the key yeah i bought some in the supermarket once was it good yeah i threw it in the deepfat fryer for ten minutes not bad the girl slid back the van door and climbed into the interior pex and chips followed ducking under the rim pex released the girls neck momentarily to take the step that was his mistake a properly trained private soldier would never allow an untethered prisoner to lead the way into an unsecured vehicle the girl stumbled accidentally dropping to both knees on the interiors carpet sushi said pex its good with french fries then the girls foot snapped back catching him in the chest the hired muscle collapsed gasping on to the floor oops said the girl straightening accident chips thought he must be having some kind of waking dream because there was no way a little pop princess clone could have decked ninety kilograms of muscle and attitude you you just he stuttered thats impossible no way way said juliet pirouetting like a ballerina the jade ring in her ponytail swung round loaded with centrifugal force it struck chips between the eyeballs like a stone from a sling he staggered backwards landing in a heap on a leatherette sofa behind her pexs breath was returning his eyeballs stopped rolling wildly and focused on his assailant hi said juliet bending over him guess what what said pex youre not supposed to deepfry sushi said the girl clapping the assassin on both temples with the palms of her hands unconsciousness was immediate mulch emerged from the bathroom buttoning the bumflap on his tunnelling trousers what did i miss he asked holly hovered one hundred and fifty feet above chicagos downtown district known locally as the loop after the curve of elevated track that enclosed the area she was up there for two reasons firstly they needed an xray scan of the spiro needle in order to construct d blueprints and secondly she wanted to talk to foaly alone she spotted a stone eagle perched on the roof of an early twentiethcentury apartment block and alighted on its head she would have to move perch after a few minutes or her shield vibration would begin to pulverize the rock juliets voice sounded in her earpiece captain short were on understood responded holly how many hostiles two big and dumb you need backup negative ill wrap these two you can have a word on your return ok ill be down in five as soon as ive had a talk with foaly and juliet dont mark them understood holly smiled juliet was a piece of work a chip off the butler block but she was a wild card even on stakeout she couldnt stop chattering for more than ten seconds none of her brothers discipline she was a happy teenager a kid she should not be in this line of business artemis had no business dragging her into his crazy schemes but there was something about the irish boy that made you forget your reservations in the past sixteen months she had fought a troll for him healed his entire family dived into the arctic ocean and now she was preparing to disobey a direct order from commander root she opened a channel to lep operations foaly are you listening nothing for several seconds then the centaurs voice burst through the helmets microspeaker holly hold on youre a bit fuzzy im just going to finetune the wavelength talk to me say something testing one two one two trolls cause terrible trouble in a tantrum ok gotcha crystal clear how goes it in the land of mud holly gazed down at the city below her no mud here just glass steel and computers youd like it oh no not me mud people are mud people no matter if theyre wearing suits or loincloths the only good thing about humans is the television all we get on pptv is reruns im almost sorry the goblin generals trial is over guilty on all counts thanks to you sentencing is next month anxiety loosened its grip on hollys stomach guilty thank heavens things can finally go back to normal foaly snickered normal youre in the wrong job for normal you can kiss normal goodbye if we dont get artemiss gizmo back from spiro the centaur was right her life had not been normal since shed been promoted to recon from the vice squad but did she really want a normal life wasnt that the reason she transferred from vice in the first place so why the call asked foaly feeling a bit homesick are you no replied holly and it was true she wasnt the elf captain had barely thought of haven since artemis embroiled her in his latest intrigue i need your advice advice oh really that wouldnt be another way of asking for help now would it i jaelieve commander roots words were you got what you got rules are rules holly holly sighed yes foaly rules are rules julius knows best thats right julius knows best said foaly but he didnt sound convinced you probably couldnt help anyway spiros security is pretty advanced foaly snorted and a centaur snorting is something to hear yeah sure what has he got a couple of tin cans and a dog ooh scary i wish theres stuff in this building that ive never seen before smart stuff a small liquidcrystal screen flickered into life in the corner of hollys visor foaly was broadcasting a visual from police plaza technically not something he should be doing for an unofficial operation the centaur was curious i know what youre doing by the way said foaly wagging a finger i have no idea what you mean said holly innocently you probably couldnt help anyway spiros security is pretty advanced mimicked the centaur youre trying to light a fire under my ego im not stupid holly ok maybe i am do you want the straight truth oh youre going to tell me the truth now interesting tactic for the lep the spiro needle is a fortress theres no way in without you even artemis admits it were not looking for equipment or extra fairypower just advice over the airwaves maybe a bit of camera work keep the lines open thats all im asking foaly scratched his chin no way in eh even artemis admits it we cant do it without foaly his exact words the centaur struggled to keep the smugness from his features have you got any video holly took a handheld computer from her belt artemis shot some film inside the needle im mailing it to you now i need a blueprint of the building holly panned her visor left and right so foaly could see where she was thats why im up here to do an xray scan itll be in your mainframe in ten minutes holly heard a bell chime in her speakers it was a computer alert her mail had arrived in police plaza foaly opened the file key codes ok cameras no problem wait until i show you what ive developed for cctv cameras im fastforwarding through the corridors dum de dum de dum ah the vault on the eightyfifth pressure pads antibiotic mats motion sensors temperature sensitive lasers thermal cameras voicerecognition retina and gelthumbprint scanners he paused impressive for a mud man youre telling me agreed holly a bit more than two tin cans and a dog fowl is right without me youre sunk so will you help foaly had to milk the moment im not promising anything mind yes ill keep a screen open for you but if something comes up i understand no guarantees no guarantees i owe you a carton of carrots two cartons and a case of beetle juice done the centaurs face was flushed with the promise of a challenge will you miss him holly he asked suddenly holly was caught offguard by the question miss who she said though she already knew the fowl boy of course if everything goes according to plan well be wiped from his memory no more wild plots or seatofthepants adventures it will be a quiet life holly made to avoid foalys gaze although the helmet cam was pointofview and the centaur could not see her no she said i will not miss him but her eyes told the real story holly circled the needle several times at various altitudes until the xray scanner had accumulated enough data for a d model she mailed a copy of the file to foaly in police plaza and returned to the van i thought i told you not to mark them she said bending over the fallen hit men juliet shrugged hey no big deal fairy girl i got carried away in the heat of battle just give him a shot of blue sparks and send him on his way holly traced a finger round the perfectly circular bruise on chipss forehead you should have seen me said juliet bang bang and they were down never had a chance holly sent a solitary spark down her finger it wiped away the bruise like a damp cloth cleaning a coffee ring you could have used the neutrino to stun them you know the neutrino wheres the fun in that captain short removed her helmet glaring up at the teenage human this is not supposed to be fun juliet its not a game i thought you realized that considering what happened to butler juliets grin disappeared i know its not a game captain maybe this is the way i deal with things holly held her gaze well then maybe youre in the wrong line of work or maybe youve been in this line of work too long argued juliet according to butler you used to be a bit of a wild card yourself mulch emerged from the bathroom this time he had been applying a layer of sunblock it was now the middle of the night but the dwarf wasnt taking any chances if this insertion went pearshaped as it probably would then he could very well be on the run by morning whats the problem ladies if youre fighting over me dont bother i make it a point never to date outside my species the tension deflated like a punctured balloon dream on hairball said holly nightmare more like added juliet i make it a point never to date anyone who lives in a dung heap mulch was unperturbed youre both in denial i have that effect on females i dont doubt it said holly grinning the lep captain folded out a stowaway table and placed her helmet on top she switched her helmet cam to project and opened the d plan of the spiro needle it revolved in the air a lattice of neongreen lines ok everyone heres the plan team one burns their way in through the wall of the eightyfifth floor team two goes in through the helipad door here holly marked the entrances by tapping the corresponding spot on the screen of her handheld computer an orange pulse appeared on the floating plan foaly has agreed to help so hell be with us over the airwaves juliet you take this handheld computer you can use it to conference with us on the move just ignore the gnommish symbols well send you any files you need to view wear an earpiece though to cut out the speakers the last thing we need is computers beeping at the wrong moment that little indent below the screen is a mike whispersensitive so no need to shout juliet strapped the creditcardsized computer on to her wrist what are the teams and what are their objectives holly stepped into the d image her body was surrounded by strobes of light team one goes after the security and switches the vault guards oxygen canisters team two goes after the box simple we go in pairs you and mulch artemis and me oh no said juliet shaking her head i have to go with artemis hes my principal my brother would stick to artemis like glue and so will i holly stepped out of the hologram wont work you cant fly and you cant climb walls there has to be one fairy per team if you dont like it take it up with artemis next time you see him juliet scowled it made sense of course it did artemiss plans always made sense it was only too clear now why artemis had not revealed the entire thing in ireland he knew she would object it was bad enough being separated for the past six hours but the most difficult phase of the mission lay ahead and artemis would not have a butler at his shoulder holly stepped back into the hologram team one you and mulch climb the needle and burn through on the eightyfifth floor from there you place this video clip on a cctv cable holly held up what looked like a twist of wire loaded fibre optic she explained allows for remote hijacking of any video system with this in place foaly can send the signal from every camera in the building to our helmets he can also send the humans any signal he wants them to see you will also replace two oxygen cylinders with our own special mix juliet placed the video clip in her jacket pocket i will enter from the roof continued holly from there i proceed to artemiss room as soon as team one gives us the all clear well go after the c cube you make it sound so easy said juliet mulch laughed she always does that he said and it never is team one the spiro needles base juliet butler had been trained in seven martial arts disciplines she had learned to ignore pain and sleep deprivation she could resist torture both physical and psychological but nothing had prepared her for what she would have to endure to get into this building the needle had no blind sides with twentyfourhour activity on each face so they were forced to begin their ascent from the pavement juliet pulled the van round doubleparking it as close to the wall as she could they went out through the sunroof draped in hollys single sheet of camouflage foil juliet was clipped on to the moonbelt on mulchs waist she rapped on mulchs helmet you stink mulchs reply came through the cylindrical transmitter in juliets ear to you maybe but to a dwarf female i am the essence of a healthy male youre the one that stinks mud girl to me you smell worse than a skunk in twomonthold socks holly stuck her head through the sunroof quiet she hissed both of you were on a tight schedule in case youd forgotten juliet your precious principal is stuck in a room up there waiting for me to show up its five minutes past four already the guards are due to change in less than an hour and i still have to finish mesmerizing these goons we have a fiftyfiveminute window here lets not waste it arguing why cant you just fly us up to the ledge basic military tactics if we split up then one team might make it if were together then one goes down we all go down divide and conquer her words sobered juliet the fairy girl was right she should have known that it was happening again she was losing concentration at a vital moment ok lets go ill hold my breath mulch stuck both palms in his mouth sucking any last vestiges of moisture from the pores hold on he said having removed his hands from his palate here we go the dwarf flexed his powerful legs leaping one and a half metres to the wall of the spiro needle juliet bobbed along behind feeling for all the world as though she were underwater the problem with riding a moonbelt was that as well as the weightlessness you got the loss of coordination and sometimes the space nausea too moonbelts were designed for carrying inanimate objects not live fairies and certainly not human beings mulch had not had a drink for several hours causing his dwarf pores to open to the size of pinholes they sucked noisily latching on to the smooth external surface of the spiro needle the dwarf avoided the tinted windows sticking to the metal girders because even though the pair were draped in a sheet of camouflage foil there were still enough limbs sticking out to be spotted cam foil did not render the wearer completely invisible thousands of microsensors threaded through the material analysed and reflected the surroundings but one shower of rain could short out the whole thing mulch climbed quickly settling into a smooth rhythm his doublejointed fingers and toes curled to grip the smallest groove and where there were no grooves the dwarfs pores adhered to the flat surface his beard hair fanned out under the helmets visor probing the buildings face juliet had to ask your beard thats a bit freaky whats it doing searching for cracks vibrations grunted mulch sensors currents maintenance men obviously he wasnt going to devote any energy to full sentences motion sensor picks us up were finished foil or not juliet didnt blame her partner for saving his breath they had a long way to go straight up as they cleared the buffer provided by the adjacent buildings the wind picked up juliets feet were plucked from beneath her and she fluttered from the dwarfs neck like a scarf rarely had she felt so helpless events were utterly beyond her control training counted for absolutely nothing in this situation her life was in mulchs hands completely the floors slid by in a blur of glass and steel the wind pulled at them with grabby fingers threatening to spin the pair into the night theres a lot of moisture up here from the wind gasped the dwarf i cant hold on much longer juliet reached in running a finger along the outer wall it was slick with tiny beads of dew sparks were popping along the sheet of cam foil as the moistureladen wind shorted out its microsensors patches of the foil failed altogether the effect was of blocks of circuits apparently suspended in the night the entire building was swaying too maybe just enough to shake off a tired dwarf and his passenger finally the dwarfs fingers locked on to the ledge of the eightyfifth floor mulch climbed on to the narrow outcrop directing his visor into the building this room is no good he said my visor is picking up two motion detectors and a laser sensor we need to move along he scampered down the ledge surefooted as a mountain goat this was his business after all dwarfs did not fall off things not unless they were pushed juliet followed cautiously not even madame kos academy could have prepared her for this finally mulch arrived at a window that satisfied him ok he said his voice sounding strained in juliets earpiece we got a sensor with a dead battery his beard hair latched on to the windowpane i dont feel any vibration so nothing electrical running and no conversation it seems safe mulch trickled a few drops of dwarf rock polish on to the toughened pane it liquefied the glass immediately leaving a puddle of turgid fluid on the carpet with any luck the hole would remain undiscovered over the weekend ooh said juliet that stinks nearly as much as you do mulch did not bother returning the insult preferring instead to tumble indoors to safety he checked the moonometer in his visor four twenty human time were behind schedule lets go juliet hopped through the hole in the window typical mud man said mulch spiro spends millions on a security system and it all falls apart because of one battery juliet drew an lep neutrino she flicked aside the safety cap and pressed the power button the light changed from green to red were not in yet she said making for the door wait hissed mulch grabbing her arm the camera juliet froze shed forgotten the camera they were barely a minute inside the building and she was already making mistakes concentrate girl concentrate mulch aimed his visor at the recessed cctv camera the helmets ion filter highlighted the cameras arc as a shimmering gold stream there was no way past to the camera itself theres no blind spot he said and the camera cable is behind the box well just have to huddle close together behind the cam foil said juliet her lip curling at the idea foalys image popped up on the computer screen on her wrist you could do that but unfortunately cam foil doesnt work onscreen why not cameras have better eyes than humans did you ever see a tv picture on television the camera breaks down the pixels if you go down that corridor behind cam foil youre going to look like two people behind a projector screen juliet glared at the monitor anything else foaly maybe the floor is going to dissolve into a pool of acid doubt it spiro is good but hes not me cant you loop the video feed pony boy said juliet into the computers mike just send them a false signal for a minute foaly gnashed his horsey teeth i am so unappreciated no i cannot set up a loop unless i am onsite as i was during the fowl siege that is what the video clip is for im afraid youre on your own up there ill blast it then negatori a neutrino blast would certainly knock out one camera and possibly chainreact along the entire network you may as well dance a jig for arno blunt juliet kicked the skirting board in frustration she was falling at the first hurdle her brother would know what to do but he was on the other side of the atlantic a mere six metres of corridor separated them from the camera but it might as well have been a thousand metres of broken glass she noticed that mulch was unbuttoning his bumflap oh great now the little man needs a potty break this is hardly the time im going to ignore your sarcasm said mulch lying flat on the floor because i know what spiro can do to people he doesnt like juliet knelt beside him not too close i hope your next sentence is going to begin with i have a plan the dwarf appeared to be aiming his rear end actually youre not serious deadly i have quite a considerable force at my disposal here juliet couldnt help smiling the little guy was a dwarf after her own heart metaphorically he was adapting to the situation just as she would all we have to do is swing the camera about twenty degrees on its stand and we have a clear run to the cable and youre going to do that with wind power precisely what about the noise mulch winked silent but deadly im a professional all you have to do is squeeze my little toe when i give you the word in spite of arduous training in some of the worlds toughest terrain juliet was not quite prepared to be involved in a wind offensive do i have to participate it seems like a oneman operation to me mulch squinted at the target adjusting his posterior accordingly this is a precision burst i need a gunner to pull the trigger so i can concentrate on aiming reflexology is a proven science with dwarfs every part of the foot is connected to a part of the body and it just so happens that the left little toe is connected to my ok said juliet hurriedly i get the picture lets get on with it then juliet pulled mulchs boot off the socks were opentoed and five hairy digits wiggled with a dexterity no human toes possessed this is the only way unless you have a better idea juliet gingerly grasped the toe its black curly hairs obligingly parting to allow her access to the joint now wait the dwarf licked his forefinger testing the air no wind not yet muttered juliet mulch finetuned his aim ok squeeze juliet held her breath and squeezed and in order to do the moment justice it has to be described in slow motion juliet felt her fingers close round the joint the pressure sped up mulchs leg in a series of jolts the dwarf fought to keep his aim true in spite of the spasms pressure built in his abdomen and exploded through his bumflap with a dull thump the only thing juliet could relate the experience to was crouching beside a mortar a missile of compressed air shot across the room heat blur surrounding it like waves of water too much topspin groaned mulch i loaded it the air ball spiralled towards the ceiling shedding layers like an onion right urged mulch right a bit the next unlikely missile impacted against the wall a metre ahead of its target luckily the ricochet clipped the camera box sending it spinning like a plate on a stick the intruders waited for it to settle with bated breath the camera finally creaked to a halt after a dozen revolutions well asked juliet mulch sat up checking the cameras ion stream through his visor lucky he breathed very lucky we have a path straight through he slapped shut his smoking bumflap its been a while since i launched a torpedo juliet took the video clip from her pocket waving it in front of her wrist computer so foaly could see it so i just wind this round any old cable is that it no mud maid sighed foaly comfortable in his familiar role as unappreciated genius that is a complex piece of nanotechnology complete with microfilaments that act as receivers broadcasters and clamps naturally it leeches its power from the mud peoples own system naturally said mulch trying to keep his eyes open you need to ensure that it is firmly clamped to one of the video cables luckily its multisensor does not have to be in contact with all the wires just one and which ones are the video wires well all of them juliet groaned so i just wind it round any old cable i suppose so admitted the centaur but wind it tightly all the filaments have to penetrate juliet reached up selected a wire at random and wound the clip round it ok there was a moments pause while foaly waited for reception below the surface pictureinpicture screens began popping up on the centaurs plasma screen perfect we have eyes and ears lets go then said juliet impatiently start the loop foaly wasted a minute delivering another lecture this is much more than a loop young lady i am about to completely wipe moving patterns from the surveillance footage in other words the pictures they see in the surveillance booth will be exactly as they should be except you wont be in them just be careful never to stand still or youll become visible keep something moving even if its only your little finger juliet checked the digital clock on the computer face four thirty we need to hurry ok the security centre is one corridor over we take the shortest route juliet projected the schematic into the air down this corridor here two rights and there we are mulch strode past her to the wall i said the shortest route mud girl think laterally the office was an executive suite with a skyline view and floortoceiling pine shelving mulch hauled back a section of the pine and knocked on the wall behind it plasterboard he said no problem juliet closed the panel behind them no debris dwarf artemis said we werent to leave any trace dont worry im not a messy eater mulch unhinged his jaw expanding his oral cavity to basketball proportions he opened his mouth to an incredible one hundred and seventy degrees and took a whopping bite out of the wall a ring of tombstone teeth soon reduced the wall to dust a bi dry he commented har oo shwallow three bites later they were through mulch climbed into the next office without a crumb dropping from his lips juliet followed pulling the pine shelving across to cover the hole the next office was not quite so salubrious the dark cubby of a vice president no city view and plain metal shelving juliet rearranged the shelving to cover the newly excavated entrance mulch knelt at the door his beard hair latching on to the wood some vibration outside thats probably the compressor nothing irregular so no conversation id say we were safe you could just ask me said foaly in his helmet earpiece i do have footage from every camera in the building thats over two thousand in case youre interested thanks for the update well are we clear yes remarkably so no one in the immediate vicinity except a guard at the lobby desk juliet took two grey canisters from her backpack ok this is where i earn my keep you stay here this shouldnt take more than a minute juliet cracked open the door creeping along the corridor on rubbersoled boots aeroplanestyle lighting strips were inlaid in the carpet otherwise the only lighting came from exit boxes over the fireescape doors the schematic on her wrist computer told her that she had twenty metres to go before reaching the security office after that she could only hope that the oxygen rack was unlocked and why shouldnt it be oxygen canisters were hardly highrisk objects at least she would have ample warning if any personnel happened to be doing their rounds juliet crept pantherlike down the corridor her footfalls muffled by the carpet on reaching the final corner she lay flat and inched her nose round the bend she could see the floors security station just as pex had revealed under the mesmer the vault guards oxygen canisters were slotted in a rack in front of the desk there was only one guard on duty and he was busy watching basketball on a portable television juliet moved forward on her stomach until she was directly below the rack the guard had his back to her concentrating on the game what the hell exclaimed the security man who was roughly the size of a refrigerator he had noticed something in a security monitor move hissed foaly in juliets earpiece what move youre showing up on the monitors juliet wiggled her toe she had forgotten to keep moving butler would never have forgotten that over her head the guard employed the ageold method of rapid repair slapping the monitors plastic casing the fuzzy figure disappeared interference he muttered stupid satellite tv juliet felt a bead of sweat run along the bridge of her nose the younger butler reached up slowly and slipped two substitute oxygen canisters into the rack although oxygen canisters was a bit of a misnomer because it wasnt oxygen in these canisters she checked her watch it might already be too late team two above the spiro needle holly hovered six metres above the needle waiting for the green light she was not comfortable with this operation there were too many variables if this mission werent so vital to the future of the fairy civilization she would have refused to participate in it altogether her mood did not improve as the night progressed team one was proving extremely unprofessional bickering like a pair of adolescents although to be fair to juliet she was barely beyond adolescence mulch on the other hand couldnt find his childhood with an encyclopaedia captain short followed their progress on her helmet visor wincing at each new development finally and against all the odds juliet managed to switch the canisters go said mulch doing his best to sound military i say again we have a go situation on the black op code red thing holly shut off mulchs communication in the middle of the dwarfs giggling fit foaly could open a screen in her visor if there was a crisis below her the spiro needle pointed spacewards like the worlds biggest rocket low fog gathered around its base adding to the illusion holly set her wings to descend dropping gently towards the helipad she called up the video file of artemiss entry to the needle on her visor and slowed it down at the point where spiro keyed in the access code for the rooftop door thank you spiro she said grinning as she punched in the code the door slid open pneumatically automatic lights flickered into life along the stairwell there was a camera every six metres no blind spots this didnt matter to holly as human cameras could not detect a shielded fairy unless they were of the type with an extremely high framepersecond rate and even then the frames had to be viewed as stills to catch a glimpse of the fairy folk only one human had ever managed to do this an irish one who was twelve years old at the time holly floated down the stairwell activating an argon laser filter on her visor this entire building could be crisscrossed with laser beams and she wouldnt know it until she set off an alarm even a shielded fairy had mass enough to stop a beam reaching its sensor if only for a millisecond the view before her turned a cloudy purple but there were no beams she was certain that wouldnt be the case when they came to the vault holly continued her flight to the brushedsteel lift doors artemis is on eightyfour said foaly the vault is on eightyfive spiros penthouse is on eightysix where we are now how are the walls according to the spectrometer mostly plaster and wood in the partition walls except round key rooms which are reinforced steel let me guess artemiss room the vault and spiros penthouse dead on captain but do not despair i have plotted the shortest course i am sending it to your helmet now holly waited a moment until a quill icon flashed in the corner of her visor informing her that she had mail open mail she said into the helmet mike enunciating clearly a matrix of green lines superimposed themselves in front of her regular vision her trail was marked by a thick red line follow the laser holly foolproof no offence none taken for now but if this doesnt work ill be so offended you wont believe it the red laser led straight into the belly of the lift holly floated into the metal box and descended to the eightyfifth floor the guiding laser led her out of the lift and down the corridor she tried the door to an office on her left locked hardly surprising im going to have to unshield to pick this lock are you sure my pattern is wiped from the video of course said foaly holly could imagine the childish pout on his lips she unshielded and took an omnitool from her belt the omnitools sensor would send an xray of the locks workings to the chip and select the right bit it even did the turning of course the omnitool only worked on keyhole locks which in spite of their unreliability the mud people still used in less than five seconds the door lay open before her five seconds said holly this thing needs a new battery the red line in her visor ran to the offices centre and then took a rightangle turn downwards through the floor let me guess artemis is down there yes asleep judging by the pictures coming in from his iriscam you said the cell was lined with reinforced steel true but no motion sensors in the walls or roof so all you have to do is burn through holly drew her neutrino oh is that all she chose a spot adjacent to a wall air conditioner and peeled back the carpet underneath the floor was dull and metallic no trace remember said foaly in her earpiece thats vital ill worry about that later said holly adjusting the air con to extract for now i need to get him out of there were on a schedule holly adjusted the neutrinos output concentrating the beam so it cut through the metal floor acrid smoke billowed from the molten gash and was immediately siphoned off into the chicago night by the air con artemis isnt the only one with brains around here grunted holly sweat streaming down her face in spite of the helmets climate control the air con stops the fire alarm going off very good is he awake asked holly leaving the last centimetre of a halfmetre square uncut wideeyed and bushytailed to use centaurian imagery a laser carving through the ceiling will do that to a person good said captain short cutting through the final section the metal square twisted on a final strand of steel wont that make a lot of noise asked foaly holly watched the section fall i doubt it she said chapter fingers and thumbs artemis fowls cell the spiro heedle artemis was meditating when the first laserstroke cut through the ceiling he rose from the lotus position pulled his sweater back on and arranged some pillows on the floor moments later a square of metal fell to the floor its impact silenced by the cushions hollys face appeared in the hole artemis pointed at the pillows you anticipated me the lep captain nodded only thirteen and already predictable i presume you used the air conditioner to vacuum the smoke exactly i think were getting to know one another too well holly reeled a piton line from her belt lowering it into the room make a loop at the bottom with the clamp and hop aboard ill reel you in artemis did as he was told and in seconds he was clambering through the hole do we have mister foaly on our side he asked holly handed artemis a small cylindrical earpiece ask him yourself artemis inserted the miracle of nanotechnology well foaly astound me below in haven city the centaur rubbed his hands together artemis was the only one who actually understood his lectures youre going to love this mud boy not only have i wiped you from the video not only did i erase the ceiling falling in but i have created a simulated artemis artemis was intrigued a sim really how exactly did you do that simple really said foaly modestly i have hundreds of human movies on file i borrowed steve mcqueens solitary confinement scene from the great escape and altered his clothes what about the face i had some digital interrogation footage from your last visit to haven i put the two together and voilа our simulated artemis can do whatever i tell him whenever i say at the moment the sim is asleep but in half an hour i may just instruct him to go to the bathroom holly reeled in her piton cord the miracle of modern science the lep pours millions into your department foaly and all you can do is send mud boys to the toilet you should be nice to me holly im doing you a big favour if julius knew i was helping you hed be extremely angry which is exactly why you are doing it holly moved quietly to the door opening it a crack the corridor was clear and silent but for the drone of panning cameras and the hum of fluorescent lighting one section of hollys visor displayed miniature transparent feeds from spiros security cameras there were six guards doing the rounds on the floor holly closed the door ok lets get going we need to reach spiro before the guards change artemis arranged the carpet over the hole in the floor have you located his apartment directly above us we need to get up there and scan his retina and thumb an expression flashed across artemiss face just for a second the scans yes the sooner the better holly had never seen that look on the human boys features before was it guilt could it be is there something youre not telling me she demanded the expression vanished to be replaced by the customary lack of emotion no captain short nothing and do you really think that now is the time for an interrogation holly wagged a threatening finger artemis if you mess with me now in the middle of an operation i wont forget it dont worry said artemis wryly i will spiros apartment was two floors directly above artemiss cell it made sense to reinforce the same block unfortunately jon spiro did not like the idea of anyone spying on him so there were no cameras in his section of the building typical muttered foaly powercrazed megalomaniacs never like anyone to see their own dirty secrets i think someones in denial said holly focusing a tight beam from her neutrino at the ceiling a section of floating ceiling melted like ice in a kettle revealing the steel above molten beads of metal ate into the carpet as the laser sliced through the flooring when the hole was of sufficient diameter holly shut down the beam and popped her helmet camera into the space nothing appeared on the screen switching to infrared a rack of suits sprang into focus they might have been white the wardrobe were in the wardrobe perfect said foaly put him to sleep he is asleep its ten to five in the morning well make sure he doesnt wake up then holly replaced the camera in its groove she plucked a silver capsule from her belt and inserted it into the hole foaly supplied the commentary for artemis the capsule is a sleeper deeper in case youre wondering gaseous no brainwaves artemis was intrigued go on basically it scans for brainwave patterns then replicates them anyone in the vicinity stays in the state theyre in until the capsule dissolves no trace none and no aftereffects whatever theyre paying me it isnt enough holly counted off a minute on her visor clock ok hes out providing he wasnt awake when the sleeper deeper went in lets go spiros bedroom was as white as his suits except for the charred hole in the wardrobe holly and artemis climbed through on to a white shagpile carpet with whitewood slide wardrobes they stepped through the doors into a room that glowed in the dark futuristic furniture white of course white spotlights and white drapes holly took a moment to study a painting that dominated one wall oh give me a break she said the picture was in oils completely white there was a brass plaque beneath it read snow ghost spiro lay in the centre of a huge futon lost in the dunes of its silk sheets holly pulled back the covers rolling him over on to his back even in sleep the mans face was malevolent as though his dreams were every bit as despicable as his waking thoughts nice guy said holly using her thumb to raise spiros left eyelid her helmet camera scanned the eye storing the information on chip it would be a simple matter to project the file on to the vaults scanner and fool the security computer the thumb scan would not be so simple because the device was a gel scanner the tiny sensors would be searching for the actual ridges and whorls of spiros thumb a projection would not do it had to be d artemis had come up with the idea of using a memorylatex bandage standard issue in any lep firstaid kit and the same latex used to glue the mike to his throat all they had to do was wrap spiros thumb in a bandage for a moment and they would have a mould of the digit holly spooled a bandage from her belt tearing off a fifteencentimetre strip it wont work said artemis hollys heart sank this was it the thing that artemis hadnt told her what wont work the memory latex it wont fool the gel scanner holly climbed off the futon i dont have time for this artemis we dont have time for it the memory latex will make a perfect copy right down to the last molecule artemiss eyes were downcast a perfect model true but in reverse like a photo negative ridges where there should be grooves darvit swore holly the mud boy was right of course he was the scanner would read the latex as a completely different thumbprint her cheeks glowed red behind the visor you knew this mud boy you knew it all along artemis didnt bother denying it im amazed no one else spotted it so why lie artemis walked round to the far side of the bed grasping spiros right hand because there is no way to fool the gel scanner it has to see the real thumb holly snorted what do you want me to do cut it off and take it with us artemis silence was response enough what you want me to cut off his thumb are you insane artemis waited patiently for the outburst to pass listen to me captain its only a temporary measure the thumb can be reattached true holly raised her palms just shut up artemis just close your mouth and i thought youd changed the commander was right theres no changing human nature four minutes persisted artemis we have four minutes to crack the vault and get back spiro wont feel a thing four minutes was the textbook healing deadline after that there were no guarantees that the thumb would take the skin would bind but the muscles and nerve endings could reject holly felt as though her helmet were shrinking artemis ill stun you so help me think holly i had no choice but to lie about my plan would you have agreed if i had told you earlier no and im not agreeing now artemiss face glowed as pale as the walls you have to captain there is no other way holly waved artemis aside as though he were a persistent fly and spoke into her helmet mike foaly are you listening to this insanity it sounds insane holly but if you dont get this technology back we could lose a whole lot more than a thumb i cant believe it whose side are you on foaly i dont even want to think about the legal ramifications of this the centaur snickered legal ramifications were a tad beyond the court systems here captain this is a secret operation no records and no clearance if this came out wed all be out of a job a thumb here or there is not going to make any difference holly turned up the climate control in her helmet directing a blast of cold air at her forehead are you sure we can make it artemis artemis ran a few mental calculations yes im sure and anyway we have no option but to try holly crossed to the other side of the futon i cant believe im even considering this she lifted spiros hand gently he did not react not so much as a sleep murmur behind his eyelids spiros eyes jittered in rem sleep holly drew her weapon of course in theory it was perfectly feasible to remove a digit and then magically reattach it there would be no harm done and quite possibly the injection of magic would clear up a few of the liver spots on spiros hand but that wasnt the point this was not how magic was supposed to be used artemis was manipulating the people to his own ends once again fifteencentimetre beam said foaly in her ear very high frequency we need a clean cut and give him a shot of magic while youre doing it it might buy you a couple of minutes for some reason artemis was checking behind spiros ears hmm he said clever what hissed holly what now artemis stepped back nothing important continue a red glow reflected from hollys visor as a short concentrated laser beam erupted from the nozzle of her neutrino one cut said artemis clean holly glared at him dont mud boy not a word especially not advice artemis backed off certain battles were won by retreating using her left thumb and forefinger holly made a circle round spiros thumb she sent a gentle pulse of magic into the humans hand in seconds the skin tightened lines disappeared and muscle tone returned filter she said into her mike xray the filter dropped and suddenly everything was transparent including spiros hand the bones and joints were clearly visible below the skin they only needed the print so she would cut between the knuckles it would be difficult enough reattaching under pressure without adding a complex joint into the equation holly took a breath and held it the sleeper deeper would act more effectively than any anaesthetic spiro would not flinch or feel the smallest jolt of discomfort she made the cut a smooth cut that sealed as it went not a drop of blood was spilt artemis wrapped the thumb in a handkerchief from spiros closet nice work he said lets go the clock is ticking artemis and holly climbed back down through the wardrobe to the eightyfifth there was almost a mile and a half of corridor on this floor and six guards patrolling it in pairs at any one time their routes were specially planned so that one pair could always have an eyeballsighting of the vault door the vault corridor was a hundred metres long and took eighty seconds to travel at the end of that eighty seconds the next pair of guards stepped round the corner luckily two of the guards were seeing things in a different light this particular morning foaly gave them their cue ok our boys are approaching their corner are you sure its them these gorillas all look the same small heads no necks im sure their targets are showing up bright and clear holly had painted pex and chips with a stamp generally used by customs and immigration for invisible visas the stamps glowed orange when viewed through an infrared filter holly pushed artemis out the door in front of her ok go and no sarcastic comments there was no need for the warning even artemis fowl was not inclined to be sarcastic at such a dangerous stage of the operation he ran down the corridor straight towards the two mammoth security guards their jackets protruded angularly beneath their armpits guns no doubt big ones with lots of bullets are you sure theyre mesmerized he asked holly who was hovering overhead of course their minds are so blank it was like writing with chalk on a board but i could stun them if youd prefer no panted artemis no trace there must be no trace pex and chips were closer now discussing the merits of various fictional characters captain hook rocks said pex he would kick barneys purple butt ten times out often chips sighed youre missing the whole point of barney its a values thing buttkicking is not the issue they walked right past artemis without seeing him and why would they see him holly had mesmerized them not to notice anybody out of the ordinary on this floor unless they were specifically pointed out to them the outer security booth lay before them there were approximately forty seconds left before the next set of guards turned the corner the unmesmerized set just over half a minute holly you know what to do holly turned up the thermo coils in her suit so they were exactly at room temperature this would fool the lattice of lasers that crisscrossed the vaults entrance next she set her wings to a gentle hover any more downdraughts could activate the pressure pad underfoot she pulled herself forward finding purchase along the wall where her helmet told her no sensors were hidden the pressure pad trembled from the air displacement but not enough to activate the sensor artemis watched her progress impatiently hurry holly twenty seconds holly grunted something unprintable dragging herself to within touching distance of the door video file spiro she said and her helmet computer ran the footage of jon spiro punching in the vault door code she mimicked his actions and inside the steel door six reinforced pistons retracted allowing the counterweighted door to swing wide on its hinges all external alarms were automatically shut off the secondary door stood firm three red lights burning on its panel only three barriers left now the gel pad the retina scan and voice activation this kind of operation was too complicated for voice command foalys computers had been known to misinterpret orders even though the centaur insisted it was fairy error holly ripped back the velcro strap covering the helmet commandpad on her wrist first she projected a d image of spiros eyeball to a height of five foot six the retina scanner sent out a revolving beam to read the virtual eyeball apparently satisfied it disabled the first lock a red light switched to green the next step was to call up the appropriate soundwave file to trick the voice check the equipment was very sophisticated and could not be fooled by a recording a human recording that is foalys digital mikes made copies that were indistinguishable from the real thing even stink worms whose entire bodies were covered with ears could be attracted by a wormmating hiss from foalys recording equipment he was currently in negotiation with a bugcollection agency for the patent holly played the file through her helmet speakers jon spiro i am the boss so open up quick alarm number two disengaged another green light excuse me captain said artemis an undercurrent of apprehension creeping into his voice were almost out of time he unwrapped the thumb and stepped past holly on to the red floor plate artemis pressed the thumb into the scanner green gel oozed into the severed digits whorls the alarm display flashed green it had worked of course it had the thumb was genuine after all but nothing else happened the door did not open holly punched artemis in the shoulder well are we in apparently not the punching is not helping my concentration by the way artemis glared at the console what had he missed think boy think put those famed brain cells to work he leaned closer to the secondary door shifting his weight from his back leg beneath him the red plate squeaked of course exclaimed artemis he grabbed holly hugging her close its not just a red marker he explained hurriedly its weightsensitive artemis was right their combined mass was close enough to spiros own to hoodwink the scales obviously a mechanical device a computer would never have been fooled the secondary door slid into its groove below their feet artemis handed holly the thumb go he said spiros time is running out im right behind you holly took the thumb and if youre not then we go to plan b holly nodded slowly lets hope we dont have to lets hope artemis strode into the vault he ignored the fortune in jewels and bearer bonds heading straight for the cubes perspex prison there were two bullish security guards blocking the way both men had oxygen masks strapped over their faces and were unnaturally still excuse me gentlemen would either of you mind if i borrowed mister spiros cube neither man responded not so much as a flicker of an eyebrow this was undoubtedly because of the paralytic gas in their oxygen tanks concocted from the venom of a nest of peruvian spiders the gas was similar in chemical makeup to a salve used by southamerican natives as an anaesthetic artemis keyed in the code which foaly was reciting in his ear and the four sides of the perspex box descended into the column on silent motors leaving the c cube unprotected he reached out a hand for the box spiros bedroom holly climbed through the wardrobe into spiros bedroom the industrialist lay in the same position she had left him his breathing regular and normal the stopwatch on hollys visor read am and counting just in time holly unwrapped the thumb gingerly aligning it with the rest of the digit spiros hand felt cold and unhealthy to her touch she used the magnification filter in her visor to zoom in on the severed thumb as close as she could figure the two halves were lined up heal she said and the magical sparks erupted from the tips of her fingers sinking into the two halves of spiros thumb threads of blue light stitched the dermis and epidermis together fresh skin breaking through the old to conceal the cut the thumb began to vibrate and bubble steam vented from the pores forming a mist around spiros hand his arm shook violently the shock travelling across his bony chest spiros back arched until holly thought it would snap then the industrialist collapsed back on to the bed throughout the entire process his heart never skipped a beat a few stray sparks skipped along spiros body like stones on a pond targeting the areas behind both ears exactly where artemis had been looking earlier curious holly pulled back one ear to reveal a crescentshaped scar rapidly being erased by the magic there was a matching scar behind the other ear holly used her visor to zoom in on one of the scars foaly what do you make of these surgery replied the centaur maybe our friend spiro got himself a facelift or maybe or maybe its not spiro completed holly switching to artemiss channel artemis its not spiro its a double do you hear me respond artemis artemis didnt reply maybe because he wouldnt maybe because he couldnt the vault artemis reached out a hand for the box and a false wall hissed back pneumatically behind it stood jon spiro and arno blunt spiros smile was so wide he could have swallowed a slice of watermelon he clapped his hands jewellery jangling bravo master fowl some of us didnt think youd make it this far blunt took a hundreddollar bill from his wallet and handed it to spiro thank you very much arno i hope this teaches you not to bet against the house artemis nodded thoughtfully in the bedroom that was a double yes costa my cousin we got the same shaped head one or two cuts and we could be peas in a pod so you set the gel scanner to accept his print for one night only i wanted to see how far youd get youre an amazing kid arty no one ever made it into the vault before and youd be amazed how many professionals have tried there are obviously a few glitches in my system something the security people will have to look at how did you get in here anyway you dont appear to have costa with you trade secret spiro stepped down from a low platform no matter well review the tapes there are bound to be a couple of cameras you couldnt rig one thing is for sure you didnt do it without help check him for an earpiece arno it took blunt less than five seconds to find the earpiece he plucked it out triumphantly crushing the tiny cylinder beneath his boot spiro sighed i have no doubt arno that that little electronic wonder was worth more than you will make in a lifetime i dont know why i keep you around i really dont blunt grimaced this set of teeth was perspex halffilled with blue oil a macabre wave machine sorry mister spiro you will be sorrier still my dentally challenged friend said artemis because butler is coming blunt took an involuntary step backwards dont think that mumbo jumbo is scaring me butler is dead i saw him go down go down perhaps but did you see him die if i remember the sequence of events correctly after you shot butler he shot you blunt touched the sutures on his temple a lucky shot lucky butler is a proud marksman i wouldnt say that to his face spiro laughed delightedly the kid is messing with your mind arno thirteen years old and hes playing you like a grand piano in carnegie hall get yourself a spine man youre supposed to be a professional blunt tried to pull himself together but the ghost of butler haunted his features spiro plucked the c cube from its cushion this is fun arty all this tough talk and repartee but it doesnt mean anything i win again youve been outflanked this has all been a game to me amusement your little operation has been most educational if pathetic but you gotta realize that its over now youre on your own and i dont have time for any more games artemis sighed the picture of defeat all of this has been a lesson hasnt it just to show me whos boss exactly it takes some people a while to learn i find the smarter the enemy the bigger the ego you had to realize that you were no match for me before you would do what i asked spiro placed a bony hand on the irish boys shoulder artemis could feel the weight of his jewellery now listen carefully kid i want you to unlock this cube no more blarney i never met a computer nerd yet who didnt leave himself a back door you open this baby up now or im gonna stop being amused and believe me you dont want that artemis took the red cube in both hands staring at its flat screen this was the delicate phase of his plan spiro had to believe that once again he had outmanoeuvred artemis fowl do it arty do it now artemis ran a hand across his dry lips very well i need a minute spiro patted his shoulder im a generous man take two he nodded at blunt stay close arno i dont want our little friend setting any more booby traps artemis sat at the stainlesssteel table exposing the cubes inner workings he quickly manipulated a complicated bunch of fibre optics removing one strand altogether the lep blocker after less than a minute he resealed the cube spiros eyes were wide with anticipation and dreams of unlimited wealth danced in his brain good news arty i want good news only artemis was more subdued now as if the reality of his situation had finally eaten through his cockiness i rebooted it its working except spiro waved his hands bracelets jingled like cat bells except this better be an itty bitty except kinda thing its nothing hardly worth mentioning i had to revert to version version was coded strictly to my voice patterns is less secure if a bit more temperamental temperamental youre a box not my grandmother cube i am not a box said foaly the cubes new voice thanks to the removed blocker i am a marvel of artificial intelligence i live therefore i learn see what i mean said artemis weakly the centaur was going to blow it spiros suspicions must not be aroused at this stage spiro glared at the cube as though it were an underling are you gonna give me attitude mister the cube did not reply you have to address it by name explained artemis otherwise it would answer every question within hearing distance of its sensors and what is its name juliet often used the term duh artemis would not use such colloquialisms himself but it would be apt at this particular moment its name is cube ok cube are you going to give me attitude i will give you whatever is in my processors capacity to give spiro rubbed his palms with childish glee jewellery flashing like ripples in a sunset sea ok lets try this baby out cube can you tell me are there any satellites monitoring the building foaly was silent for a moment artemis could imagine him calling up his sattrack information on a screen just one at the moment though judging from the ion trails this building has been hit with more rays than the millennium falcon spiro shot artemis a glance his personality chip is faulty explained the boy thats why i discontinued him it we can fix that at any time spiro nodded he didnt want his very own technological genie growing the personality of a gorilla what about that group the lep cube he asked they were monitoring me in london are they watching the lep thats a lebanese satellite tv network said foaly following artemiss instructions game shows mostly their footprint doesnt reach this far ok forget about them cube i need to know that satellites serial number foaly consulted a screen ah let me see us registered to the federal government number stp spiro clenched both fists yes correct i happen to already have that information myself cube you have passed my test the billionaire danced around the laboratory reduced to childish displays by his greed im telling you arty this has taken years off me i feel like putting on a tuxedo and going to the prom indeed i dont know where to start should i make my own money or should i rip off somebody elses artemis forced a smile the world is your oyster spiro patted the cube gently exactly thats exactly what it is and im going to take every pearl it has to offer pex and chips arrived at the vault door guns drawn mister spiro stammered pex is this some kind of drill spiro laughed oh look here comes the cavalry an eternity too late no this is not a drill and i would dearly love to know how little artemis here got past you two the hired muscle stared at artemis as though he had just appeared from nowhere which for their mesmerized brains he had we dont know mister spiro we never saw him do you want us to take him outside for a little accident spiro laughed a short nasty bark i gotta new word for you two dumbbells expendable you are and he isnt just yet get it so just stand there and look dangerous otherwise i may replace you with two shaved gorillas spiro gazed into the cubes screen as though there were nobody else in the room i reckon ive got twenty years left in me after that the world can go to hell as far as im concerned i dont have any family no heirs theres no need to build for the future im going to suck this planet dry and with this cube i can do whatever i want to whoever i want i know the first thing id do said pex his eyes seemed surprised that the words were coming out of his mouth spiro froze he wasnt used to being interrupted in midrant what would you do dumbbell he said buy yourself a booth at mervs rib n roast no said pex id stick it to those phonetix guys theyve been rubbing spiro industries nose in it for years it was an electric moment not only because pex had actually had an idea but because it was actually a good one the notion lit a thoughtful spark in spiros eyes phonetix my biggest competitors i hate those guys nothing would give me greater satisfaction than to destroy that bunch of secondrate phone freaks but how now it was chips turn i hear theyre working on a new topsecret communicator superlife battery or something spiro did a double take first pex now chips next thing you knew theyd be learning to read nevertheless cube said spiro i want you to access the phonetix database copy the schematics for all their projects in development no can do boss man phonetix is operating on a closed system no internet connection whatsoever in its r d department i have to be onsite spiros euphoria disappeared he rounded on artemis what is he talking about artemis coughed clearing his throat the cube cannot scan a closed system unless the omnisensor is actually touching the computer or at least close by phonetix is so paranoid about hackers that the research and development lab is completely contained buried under several floors of solid rock they dont even have email i know because ive tried to hack it myself a few times but the cube scanned the satellite didnt it the satellite is broadcasting and if its broadcasting the cube can trace it spiro toyed with the links of his id chain so id have to go to phonetix i wouldnt recommend it said artemis its a lot to risk for the sake of a personal vendetta blunt stepped forward let me go mister spiro ill get those plans spiro chewed on a handful of vitamin supplements from a dispenser on his belt its a nice idea arno good work but i am reluctant to hand control of the cube over to anyone else who knows what temptation they might yield to cube can you disable the phonetix alarm system can a dwarf blow a hole in his pants what was that eh nothing technical term you wouldnt understand it i have already disabled the phonetix system what about the guards cube can you disable them no problemo i could remoteactivate the internal security measure which is tanks of vapour inside the air vents sleeping gas illegal by the way according to chicago state law but clever no aftereffects untraceable the intruder comes to in lockup two hours later spiro cackled those paranoid phonetix boys go ahead cube knock em out night night said foaly with a glee that seemed all too real good now cube all that stands between us and the phonetix blueprints is an encrypted computer dont make me laugh they havent invented a unit of time short enough to measure how long it will take me to crack the phonetix hard disk spiro clipped the cube on to his belt you know something im starting to like this guy artemis made one last sinceresounding attempt to contain the situation mister spiro i really dont think that this is a good idea of course you dont laughed jon spiro jangling towards the door thats why im bringing you along phonetix research development laboratories chicagos industrial sector spiro selected a lincoln town car from his extensive garage it was a nineties model with fake registration he often used it as a getaway vehicle it was old enough to be unremarkable and even if the police did get a shot of the plates it wouldnt lead them anywhere blunt parked opposite the phonetix r d labs main entrance a security guard was visible at his desk behind the glass revolving door arno pulled a pair of foldup binoculars from the glove compartment he focused on the guard sleeping like a baby he announced spiro clapped him on the shoulder good we have less than two hours can we do it if this cube is as good as it says it is then we can be in and out in fifteen minutes its a machine said artemis coldly not one of your steroidmunching associates blunt glanced over his shoulder artemis sat in the back seat squashed between pex and chips youre very brave all of a sudden artemis shrugged what have i got to lose after all things can hardly get worse there was a normal door beside the revolving one the cube remoteactivated the buzzer admitting the band of intruders to the lobby no alarms sounded and no platoon of security guards came rushing to detain them spiro strode down the corridor emboldened by his newfound technological friend and the thought of finally putting phonetix out of business the security lift put up no more resistance to the cube than a picket fence would to a tank and soon spiro and co were riding the eight floors down to the sunken laboratory were going underground chortled pex down where the dinosaur bones are did you know that after a million billion years dinosaur dung turns into diamonds usually a comment like that would have been a shootable offence but spiro was in a good mood no i didnt know that pex maybe i should pay your wages in dung pex decided that it would be better for his finances if he just kept his mouth shut from then on the lab itself was protected by a thumbprint scanner not even gel it was a simple matter for the cube to scan the fingerprint on the plate then project it back on to the sensor there wasnt even a keycode backup easy crowed spiro i should have done this years ago a little credit would be nice said foaly unable to hide his pique after all i did get us in here and disable the guards spiro held the box before him not crushing you into scrap metal cube is my way of saying thank you youre welcome grumbled foaly arno blunt checked the security monitor bank throughout the facility guards lay unconscious one with half a rye sandwich stuffed in his mouth i gotta admit it mister spiro this is beautiful phonetix is even gonna have to foot the bill for the sleeping gas spiro glanced towards the ceiling several camera lights winked red in the shadows cube are we gonna have to raid the video room on our way out it aint gonna happen said foaly the method actor i wiped your patterns from the video artemis was suspended by the armpits between pex and chips traitor he muttered i gave you life cube i am your creator yeah well maybe you made me too much like you fowl aurum potestas est gold is power im just doing what you taught me spiro patted the cube fondly i love this guy hes like the brother i never had i thought you had a brother said chips puzzled which was not unusual for him ok said spiro hes like a brother i actually like the phonetix server was located in the centre of the lab a monolithic hard drive with pythonlike cables rippling out to various workstations spiro undipped his new best friend from his belt where do you need to be cube just pop me down on the lid of the server and my omnisensor will do the rest spiro complied and in seconds schematics were flickering across the c cubes tiny screen i have them crowed spiro his hands two fists of triumph thats the last snide email with stock prices i get from these guys download complete said foaly smugly we have every phonetix project for the next decade spiro cradled the cube against his chest beautiful i can launch our version of the phonetix phone before they do make myself a few extra million before i release the cube arnos attention was focused on the security monitors eh mister spiro i think we have a situation here a situation growled spiro what does that mean youre not a soldier any more blunt speak english the new zealander tapped a screen as if that would change what he was seeing i mean we have a problem a big problem spiro grabbed artemis by the shoulders what have you done fowl is this some kind of the accusation died before it could be completed spiro had noticed something your eyes whats wrong with your eyes they dont match artemis treated him to his best vampire smile all the better to see you with spiro in the phonetix lobby the sleeping security guard suddenly regained her senses it was juliet she peeped out from under the brim of a borrowed cap to make sure spiro had not left anyone in the corridor following artemiss capture in spiros vault holly had flown them both to phonetix to initiate plan b of course there had been no sleeping gas for that matter there had only been two guards one was taking a restroom break and the other was doing the rounds of the upper floors still spiro wasnt to know that he was busy watching foalys family of sim security snoring all over the building thanks to a video clip on the phonetix system juliet lifted the desk phone and dialled three numbers spiro reached two fingers delicately into artemiss eye plucking out the iriscam he studied it closely noting the microcircuitry on the concave side this is electronic he whispered amazing what is it artemis blinked a tear from his eye its nothing it was never here just as i was never here spiros face twisted in sheer hatred you were here all right fowl and youll never leave here blunt tapped his employer on the shoulder an act of unforgivable familiarity boss mister spiro you really need to see this juliet stripped off her phonetix security jacket underneath she wore a chicago pd swat uniform things could get hairy in the rd lab and it was her job to make sure that artemis did not get hurt she hid behind a pillar in the lobby and waited for the sirens spiro stared at the labs security monitors the pictures had changed there were no more guards slumbering around the facility instead the screens played a tape of spiro and his cronies breaking into phonetix with one crucial difference there was no trace of artemis on the screen whats happening cube spluttered spiro you said that wed all be wiped from the tapes i lied it must be the criminal personality im developing spiro smashed the cube against the floor it remained intact tough polymer said artemis picking up the microcomputer almost unbreakable unlike you retorted spiro artemis looked like a doll between pex and chips dont you understand yet youre all on tape the cube was working for me big deal so were on tape all i have to do is pay the security booth a visit and take the recordings its not going to be that simple spiro still believed that there was a way out and why not whos gonna stop me little old you artemis pointed to the screens no little old them the chicago pd brought everything they had and a few things they had to borrow phonetix was the citys biggest single employer not to mention one of the top five subscribers to the police benevolent fund when the call came in the duty sergeant put out a citywide summons in less than five minutes there were twenty uniforms and a full swat team beating on the phonetix doors two choppers hovered overhead and eight snipers lined the roofs of the adjacent buildings no one was leaving the area unless they were invisible the phonetix security guard had returned from his rounds and just noticed the intruders on the monitors shortly after that he noticed a group of chicago pd uniforms tapping the door with their gun barrels he buzzed them in i was just about to call you guys he said theres a buncha intruders in the vault they musta tunnelled in or somethin cause they didnt come past me the security guard on a restroom break was even more surprised he was just finishing off the sports section of the herald tribune when two very seriouslooking men in body armour burst into the cubicle id growled one who apparently did not have the time for full sentences the security guard held up his laminated card with a shaking hand stay put sir advised the other police officer he didnt have to say it twice juliet slipped out from behind the pillar joining the ranks of the swat team she pointed her gun and roared with the best of them and was instantly assimilated into the group their assault was cut short by a tiny problem there was only one accesspoint to the lab the lift shaft two officers prised open the lift door with crowbars heres our dilemma said one we cut the power then we cant get the lift up here if we call the lift up here first then we tip off our intruders juliet shouldered herself to the front of the group excuse me sir let me go down on the cables i blow the doors and you cut the power the commander did not even consider it no too dangerous the intruders would have plenty of time to put a hundred rounds into the lift who are you anyway juliet took a small gripper from her belt she clipped it on to the lift cable and hopped into the shaft im new she said disappearing into the blackness in the laboratory spiro and co were hypnotized by the monitors foaly had allowed the screens to show what was actually happening on the upper levels swat said blunt helicopters heavy armament how did this happen spiro smacked his own forehead repeatedly a setup this entire thing a setup i suppose mo digence was working for you too yes pex and chips too even if they didnt know it you would never have come here if id suggested it but how how did you do this its not possible artemis glanced at the monitors obviously it is i knew you would be waiting for me in the spiro needle vault after that all i had to do was use your own hatred of phonetix to lure you here out of your environment if i go down so do you incorrect i was never here the tapes will prove it but you are here roared spiro his nerves shot his whole body vibrated and spittle sprayed from his lips in a wide arc your dead body will prove it give me the gun arno im going to shoot him blunt could not hide his disappointment but he did as he was told spiro pointed the weapon with shaky hands pex and chips stepped rapidly to one side the boss was not known for his marksmanship you have taken everything from me he shouted everything artemis was strangely calm you dont understand jon its like i told you i am not here he paused for breath and one more thing about my name artemis you were right in london it is generally a female name after the greek goddess of archery but every now and then a male comes along with such a talent for hunting that he earns the right to use the name i am that male artemis the hunter i hunted you and just like that he disappeared holly had been hovering above spiro and co all the way from the spiro needle to the phonetix building she had got permission to enter the facility minutes earlier when juliet had called to enquire about the public tours juliet had put on her best cutesy voice for the security guide hey mister is it ok if i bring my invisible friend sure it is honey replied the guide bring your security blanket too if it makes you happy they were in holly hovered at ceiling level following artemiss progress below the mud boys plan was fraught with risk if spiro decided to shoot him in the needle then it was all over but no just as artemis predicted spiro had opted to gloat for as long as possible basking in the glow of his own demented genius but of course it wasnt his own genius it was artemiss the boy had orchestrated this whole operation from beginning to end it had even been his idea to mesmerize pex and chips it was crucial that they plant the idea to invade phonetix holly was ready when the lift door opened she had her weapon charged and targets selected but she couldnt go wait for the signal artemis dragged it out melodramatic to the end and then just when holly was about to disregard her orders and start blasting he spoke i am that male artemis the hunter i hunted you artemis the hunter the signal holly squeezed the manual throttle on her wing rig and descended stopping short a metre from the ground she clipped artemis on to a retractable cord on her moonbelt then dropped a sheet of cam foil in front of him to everybody in the room it would seem as though the boy had disappeared up we go she said though artemis could not hear her and opened the throttle wide in under a second they were nestled safely among the cables and ducts that ran along the ceiling below them jon spiro lost his mind spiro blinked the boy had gone just gone it couldnt be he was jon spiro nobody outsmarted jon spiro he turned to pex and chips gesticulating wildly with the gun where is he huh said the bodyguards in perfect unison unrehearsed where is artemis fowl what did you do with him nothing mister spiro we were just standing here playing the shoulder game fowl said you were working for him so hand him over pexs brain was churning this was an operation akin to a food blender mixing concrete careful mister spiro guns are dangerous especially the end with the hole this isnt over artemis fowl spiro roared at the ceiling i will find you i will never give up youve got jon spiros word on it my word he began to fire random shots blowing holes in monitors vents and conduits one even came within a metre of artemis pex and chips were not quite sure what was going on but decided that it might be a good idea to join in the fun they pulled out their weapons and began shooting up the lab blunt did not get involved he considered his employment contract terminated there was no way out of this for spiro it was every man for himself he crossed to the walls metal panelling and began to dismantle it with a power screwdriver a section dropped from its casing behind it a fivecentimetre cable space then solid concrete they were trapped behind him the lift door dinged juliet was crouched in the lift shaft were clear said holly in her earpiece but spiro is shooting up the lab juliet frowned her principal was in danger knock them out with the neutrino i cant if spiro is unconscious when the police arrive he could claim a frameup ok im going in negative wait for swat no you take out the weapons ill handle the rest mulch had given juliet a bottle of dwarf rock polish she poured a little puddle on the lift roof and it dissolved like fat on a pan juliet hopped into the carriage crouching low in case blunt decided to put a few rounds into the lift on three juliet im going on three ok juliet reached up to the dooropen button one holly drew her neutrino locking all four targets into her visors targeting system two she unshielded for accuracy the vibration would throw her aim right off for a few seconds she would have to hide behind the foil with artemis three juliet pressed the button holly squeezed off four shots artemis had less than a minute to make his move less than a minute while holly targeted and disarmed spiro and co the circumstances were hardly ideal screaming gunfire and general mayhem but then again what better time to implement the final step in this stage of the plan a very vital step the second holly unshielded to fire artemis scrolled out a perspex keyboard from the c cubes base and began to type in seconds he had hacked into spiros bank accounts all thirtyseven of them in institutions from the isle of man to the cavmans the various account numbers locked into place he had access to each secret fund the cube quickly ran a tot on the total funds billion us dollars not counting the contents of various safety deposit boxes which could not be touched over the net billion dollars plenty to restore the fowls status as one of the top five richest irish families just as he was about to complete the transaction artemis remembered his fathers words his father returned to him by the fairy folk and what about you arty will you make the journey with me when the moment comes will you take your chance to be a hero did he really need billions of dollars of course i need it aurum potestas est gold is power really will you take your chance to be a hero to make a difference because he could not groan aloud artemis rolled his eyes and gritted his teeth well if he was going to be a hero he would be a well paid one he quickly deducted a ten per cent finders fee from the billion then sent the rest to amnesty international he made the transaction irreversible in case he weakened later on artemis wasnt finished yet there was one more good deed to be attended to the success of this venture depended on foaly being too busy watching the show to notice artemis hacking into his system he brought up the lep site and set the code breaker working on a password it took ten valuable seconds per character but he was soon flying around lep microsites artemis found what he needed on perp profiles mulch diggumss complete arrest record from there it was a simple matter to follow the electron trail back to the original search warrant for mulchs dwelling artemis changed the date on the warrant to read the day after mulchs arrest this meant that all subsequent arrests and convictions were null and void a good lawyer would have him out of prison in a heartbeat i have not finished with you yet mulch diggums he whispered logging out and clipping the cube on hollys belt juliet came through the door so fast her limbs were a blur the jade ring trailed behind her like a fishing lure on the end of a line butler would never take chances like this she knew he would have some perfectly practical safe plan which was why he had his blue diamond tattoo and she didnt well maybe she didnt want a tattoo maybe she wanted a life of her own she quickly assessed the situation hollys aim was true the two gorillas were rubbing their scorched hands and spiro was stamping his feet like a spoiled child only blunt was on the floor going for his gun even though the bodyguard was on his hands and knees he was still almost at her eye level arent you going to give me a chance to get up he asked no said juliet whipping the jade ring around like the stone that felled goliath it impacted on the bridge of blunts nose cracking it and effectively blinding him for a couple of minutes plenty of time for the chicago police to get down the shaft blunt was now out of the game juliet had expected to feel some satisfaction but all she felt was sadness there was no joy in violence pex and chips felt they should do something perhaps disabling the girl would earn them a bonus from mister spiro they circled juliet fists raised juliet wagged a finger at them sorry boys you have to go to sleep the bodyguards ignored her tightening the radius of their circle i said go to sleep still no response you have to use exactly the words that i mesmerized them to respond to said holly in her ear juliet sighed if i must ok gentlemen barney says go to sleep pex and chips were snoring before they hit the ground that just left spiro and he was too busy gibbering to be any threat he was still gibbering when the swat team put the cuffs on him ill talk to you back at base said the swat captain sternly to juliet youre a danger to your comrades and yourself yessir said juliet contritely i dont know what came over me sir she glanced upwards a slight heat haze seemed to be drifting towards the lift shaft the principal was safe holly holstered her weapon buzzing up her shield time to go she said the volume on her pa turned to minimum holly wrapped the cam foil tightly round artemis making certain no limbs were peeking out it was imperative they leave while the lift was empty once forensics and the press got there even a slight shimmer in the air might be caught on film as they flew across the room spiro was being led from the lab he had finally managed to calm down this is a setup he proclaimed in his best innocent voice my lawyers are gonna rip you guys apart artemis could not resist speaking as they floated past his ear farewell jon he whispered never mess with a boy genius spiro howled at the ceiling like a demented wolf mulch was waiting across the street from the phonetix lab revving the van like a grand prix driver he sat behind the wheel on an orange crate with a short plank taped to his foot the other end of the plank was taped to the accelerator juliet studied the system nervously shouldnt you untie that foot in case you need to use the brakes brakes laughed mulch why would i use the breaks im not doing my driving test here in the back of the van artemis and holly simultaneously reached for their seat belts chapter the invisible man fowl manor they reached ireland without major incident though mulch did attempt to escape hollys custody fifteen times including once on the lear jet where he was discovered in the bathroom with a parachute and a bottle of dwarf rock polish holly did not let him out of her sight after that butler was waiting for them at fowl manors front door welcome back glad to see everyones alive now i need to go artemis put a hand on his arm old friend youre in no condition to go anywhere butler was determined one last mission artemis i have no choice anyway ive been doing pilates i feel much more limber blunt yes but hes in prison protested juliet butler shook his head not any more artemis could see that his bodyguard was not about to be turned from his path at least take holly she can be of some help butler winked at the elf i was counting on it the chicago police had put arno blunt in a van with a couple of officers two would be sufficient they reasoned as the perp was handcuffed and manacled they revised this opinion when the van was discovered six miles south of chicago with the officers manacled and no sign of the suspect to quote sergeant iggy lebowskis report the guy ripped those handcuffs apart as though they were links in a paperchain he came at us like a steam train we never had a chance but arno blunt did not escape clean his pride had taken a severe beating in the spiro needle he knew that word of his humiliation would soon spread through the bodyguard network as pork belly larue later put it on the soldiers for hire web site arno done got hisself outsmarted by some snotnosed kid blunt was painfully aware that he would have to suffer chortles every time he walked into a room full of tough guys unless he avenged the insult paid to him by artemis fowl the bodyguard knew that he had minutes before spiro gave up his address to the chicago pd so he packed a few spare sets of teeth and took the shuttle to ohare international airport blunt was delighted to find that the authorities had not yet frozen his spiro corporate credit card and used it to purchase a first class british airways concorde ticket to london heathrow from there he would enter ireland on the rosslare ferry just another one of five hundred tourists visiting the land of the leprechaun it wasnt a terribly complicated plan and it would have worked if it hadnt been for one thing the passport official at heathrow just happened to be sid commons the exgreen beret who had served with butler on bodyguard duty in monte carlo the second blunt opened his mouth alarm bells went off in commons head the gentleman before him fitted the description butler had faxed over perfectly right down to the strange teeth blue oil and water if you dont mind commons pressed a button under his desk and in seconds a squad of security men relieved blunt of his passport and took him into custody the chief security official took out his mobile phone as soon as the detainee was under lock and key he dialled an international number it rang twice the fowl residence butler its sid commons in heathrow a man came through here you might be interested in funny teeth neck tattoos new zealand accent detective inspector justin barre faxed out the description from scotland yard a few days ago he said you might be able to id him do you still have him asked the manservant yes hes in one of our holding cells theyre running a check right now how long will that take a couple of hours max but if hes the professional you say he is a computer check wont turn up anything we need a confession to turn him over to scotland yard i will meet you in the arrivals hall under the departure board in thirty minutes said butler severing the connection sid commons stared at his mobile phone how could butler possibly get there in thirty minutes from ireland it wasnt important all sid knew was that butler had saved his life a dozen times in monte carlo all those years ago and now the debt was about to be repaid thirtytwo minutes later butler showed up in the arrivals hall sid commons studied him as they shook hands you seem different older the battles are catching up with me said butler a palm across his heaving chest time to retire i think is there any point asking how you got here butler straightened his tie not really youre better off not knowing i see wheres our man commons led the way towards the rear of the building past hordes of tourists and cardbearing taxi drivers through here youre not armed are you i know were friends but i cant allow firearms in here butler spread his jacket wide trust me i know the rules they took a security lift up two floors and followed a dimly lit corridor for what seemed like miles here we are said sid eventually pointing at a glass rectangle in there the glass was actually a twoway mirror butler could see arno blunt seated at a small table drumming his fingers impatiently on the formica surface is that him is that the man who shot you in knightsbridge butler nodded it was him all right the same indolent expression the same hands that had pulled the trigger a positive id is something but its still your word against his and to be honest you dont look too shot butler laid a hand on his friends shoulder i dont suppose commons didnt even let him finish no you can not go in there absolutely not id be out of a job for sure and anyway even if you did prise a confession out of him it would never hold up in court butler nodded i understand do you mind if i stay i want to see how this turns out commons agreed eagerly relieved that butler hadnt pressured him no problem stick around as long as you like but i have to get you a visitors badge he strode down the corridor then turned dont go in there butler if you do we lose him forever and anyway there are cameras all over this place butler smiled reassuringly something he didnt do very often dont worry sid you wont see me in that room commons sighed good great its just sometimes when you get that look in your eye im a different man now more mature commons laughed thatll be the day he rounded the corner his chuckles lingering in the air he was no sooner gone than holly unshielded by butlers leg cameras hissed the bodyguard from the corner of his mouth i checked the ion beams im clear right here she pulled a sheet of camouflage foil from her backpack laying it on the floor she then twisted a video clip around a cable tacked to the cells outer wall ok she said listening to foalys voice in her ear were in foaly has wiped our patterns from the video we are camera and mikeproof now do you know what to do butler nodded they had been through this before but holly had a soldiers need to doublecheck im going to shield again give me a second to move then put the foil on and do your thing i give you two minutes tops before your friend returns after that youre on your own understood good luck said holly shimmering out of the visible spectrum butler waited a beat then took two steps to the left he picked up the foil and draped it over his head and shoulders to the casual passerby he was now invisible but if anyone paused on his or her way down the corridor something of the manservants bulk was bound to be poking out from under the foil best to move quickly he slid the latch on the cell door across and stepped inside arno blunt was not unduly worried this was a bum rap how long could you be held for having novelty false teeth for heavens sake not much longer that was for sure maybe he would sue the british government for trauma and retire home to new zealand the door swung open thirty centimetres then closed again blunt sighed it was an old interrogators trick let the prisoner sweat for a few hours then open the door to make him think help was on the way when no one entered the prisoner would be plunged into even deeper despair ever closer to breaking point arno blunt sighed a voice from nowhere blunt stopped drumming his fingers and sat up straight what is this he sneered are there speakers in here thats lame guys really lame ive come for you said the voice ive come to even the score arno blunt knew that voice hed been dreaming about it since chicago ever since the irish kid had warned him butler would return ok it was ridiculous there were no such things as ghosts but there was something about artemis fowls stare that made you believe everything he told you butler is that you ah said the voice you remember me arno took a deep shuddering breath composing himself i dont know whats going on here but im not falling for it what im supposed to cry like a baby now because you found somebody who sounds like one of my somebody i knew this is no trick arno im right here sure if youre right there why cant i see you are you sure you cant see me arno look closely blunts stare hopped wildly around the room there was no one else in there no one he was certain of it but there was a patch of air in the corner of the room that seemed to be bending light like a floating mirror ah youve spotted me ive spotted nothing said blunt shakily all i see is a heat blur maybe from a vent or something oh really said butler throwing off the cam foil to blunt it seemed as though he had stepped from the air the bodyguard stood abruptly catapulting his chair against the wall oh god what are you butler bent his knees slightly ready for action he was older now true and slower but the fairy magic had bolstered his reaction time and he had so much more experience than blunt juliet would have liked to handle this job for him but there were some things you had to finish personally i am your guide arno ive come to take you home there are a lot of people waiting to see you hhhome stammered blunt what do you mean home butler took a step forward you know what i mean arno home the place youve always been headed the place youve sent so many others including me blunt pointed a shaky finger you stay away from me i killed you once i can do it again butler laughed it was not a pleasant sound thats where youre wrong arno i cant be killed again anyway death is no big deal not compared to what comes after what comes after there is a hell arno said butler ive seen it and believe me so will you blunt was utterly convinced after all butler had appeared from nowhere i didnt know he sobbed i didnt believe it i never would have shot you butler i was just following spiros orders you heard him give the order i was just the metal man thats all ive ever been butler laid a hand on his shoulder i believe you arno you were just following orders thats right but thats not enough you need to clear your conscience if you dont i have to take you with me blunts eyes were red with tears how he pleaded how do i do that confess your sins to the authorities leave nothing out or i will be back blunt nodded eagerly prison was better than the alternative remember i will be watching this is your one chance to save yourself if you dont take it i will be back blunts teeth popped from his open mouth rolling across the floor don worry ill confesh i promish butler lifted the cam foil concealing himself completely see that you do or therell be hell to pay butler stepped into the corridor stuffing the foil inside his jacket seconds later sid commons reappeared with a security badge he caught sight of arno blunt standing stunned in his cell what did you do butler he said hey it wasnt me check your tapes he just went crazy talking to thin air yelling how he wanted to confess he wants to confess just like that i know how it sounds but thats what happened if i were you id give justin barre a call over at scotland yard i have a feeling that blunts statement could clear up a lot of outstanding cases commons squinted at him suspiciously why do i have a feeling that you know more than youre telling search me said butler but feelings arent evidence and your own surveillance tapes will prove that i never set foot in that room are you sure thats what theyll show butler glanced at the patch of air shimmering above sid commonss shoulder i am positive he said chapter mind wipe fowl manor the return trip from heathrow took over an hour thanks to some particularly strong turbulence and an easterly wind over the welsh hills when holly and butler finally touched down in the grounds of fowl manor the lep was busy humping their mindwiping gear up the avenue under cover of night butler undipped himself from the moonbelt leaning against the trunk of a silver birch you ok asked holly fine replied the bodyguard massaging his chest its this kevlar tissue handy if you get shot with a small calibre but its playing havoc with my breathing holly sheathed her mechanical wings its the quiet life for you from now on butler noticed an lep pilot attempting to park his shuttle in the double garage nudging the bentleys bumper quiet life he muttered heading for the garage i wish once butler had finished terrorizing the pixie pilot he made for the study artemis and juliet were waiting for him juliet hugged her brother so tightly that the air was squeezed from his lungs im ok little sister the fairies have fixed it so that i will live to well over a hundred ill still be around to keep an eye on you artemis was all business how did you fare butler butler opened a wall safe behind an airconditioning vent pretty well i got everything on the list what about the custom job butler laid out six small vials on the baizecovered desk my man in limerick followed your instructions to the letter in all his years in the trade hes never done anything like this theyre in a special solution to stop corrosion the layers are so fine that once they come into contact with the air they begin to oxidize right away so i suggest we dont insert them until the last possible moment excellent in all probability i am the only one who will need these but just in case we should all put them in butler held the gold coin up by its leather thong i copied your diary and fairy files on to a laser minidisc then brushed on a layer of gold leaf it wont stand up to close examination im afraid but molten gold would have destroyed the information on the disc artemis tied the thong round his neck it will have to do did you plant the false trails yes i sent an email that has yet to be picked up and i hired a few megabytes on an internet storage site i also took the liberty of burying a time capsule in the maze artemis nodded good i hadnt thought of that butler accepted the compliment but he didnt believe it artemis thought of everything juliet spoke for the first time you know artemis maybe it would be better to let these memories go give the fairies some peace of mind these memories are part of who i am responded artemis he examined the vials on the table selecting two now everybody its time to put these in im sure the people are eager to wipe our minds foalys technical crew set up shop in the conference room laying out a complex assembly of electrodes and fibreoptic cable each cable was connected to a plasma screen that converted brainwaves to actual binary information in laymans terms foaly would be able to read the humans memories like a book and edit out what shouldnt be there possibly the most incredible part of the entire procedure was that the human brain itself would supply alternative memories to fill the blank spots we could do the mind wipes with a field kit explained foaly once the patients were assembled but field kits are just for blanket wipes it would erase everything thats happened over the past sixteen months that could have serious implications for your emotional development not to mention your iq so better we use the lab kit and simply erase the memories that pertain to the people obviously we will have to erase the days you spent in fairy company completely we cant take any chances there artemis butler and juliet were seated round the table technical gnomes swabbed their temples with disinfectant ive thought of something said butler dont tell me interrupted the centaur the age thing right butler nodded a lot of people know me as a fortyyearold man you cant wipe them all way ahead of you butler were going to give your face a laser peel while youre unconscious get rid of some of that dead skin we even brought a cosmetic surgeon to give your forehead a dewer injection to smooth out the wrinkles dewer fat explained the centaur we take it from one area and inject it into another butler was not enthused by the idea this fat it doesnt come from my behind does it foaly shuffled uncomfortably well it doesnt come from your behind explain research has shown that of all the fairy races dwarfs have the greatest longevity theres a miner in poll dyne who is allegedly over two thousand years old havent you ever heard the expression smooth as a dwarfs bottom butler slapped away a technician who was attempting to attach an electrode patch to his head are you telling me that fat from a dwarfs backside is going to be injected into my head foaly shrugged the price of youth there are pixies on the west bank paying a fortune for dewer treatments butler spoke through gritted teeth i am not a pixie weve also brought some gel to colour any hair you may decide to grow in the future and some pigment dye to cover the cell corruption on your chest continued the centaur hurriedly by the time you wake up your exterior will look young again even if your interior is old clever said artemis i expected as much holly entered with mulch in tow the dwarf was wearing cuffs and looking extremely sorry for himself is this really necessary he whined after all weve been through my badge is on the line retorted holly the commander said to come back with you or not at all what do i have to do i donated the fat didnt i butler rolled his eyes please no juliet giggled dont worry dom you wont remember a thing about it knock me out said butler quickly dont mention it grumbled mulch attempting to rub his behind holly uncuffed the dwarf but stayed within grabbing distance he wanted to say goodbye so here we are she nudged mulch with her shoulder so say goodbye juliet winked bye smelly so long stinker dont go chewing through any concrete walls i dont find that kind of thing funny said mulch with a pained expression who knows maybe well see each other again mulch nodded at the technicians busy firing up their hard drives if we do thanks to these people itll be the first time butler knelt to the dwarfs level you look after yourself little friend stay clear of goblins mulch shuddered you dont have to tell me that commander roots face appeared on a rolldown screen erected by an lep officer maybe you two would like to get married he barked i dont know what all the emotion is about in ten minutes you people wont even remember this convicts name we have the commander online said a technician a tad unnecessarily mulch stared at the button camera mounted on the screen julius please do you realize that all of these humans owe me their lives this is an emotional moment for them roots rosy complexion was exaggerated by poor reception i couldnt care less about your touchy feely moment im here to make sure this wipe goes smoothly if i know our friend fowl hes got a few tricks up his sleeve really commander said artemis such suspicion is wounding but the irish teenager couldnt suppress a grin everybody knew that he would have hidden items to spark residual memories it was up to the lep to find them their final contest artemis stood and approached mulch diggums mulch of all the fairy people i will miss your services the most we could have had such a future together mulch looked a touch teary true with your brains and my special talents not to mention your mutual lack of morals interjected holly no bank on the planet would have been safe completed the dwarf a missed opportunity artemis tried his best to look sincere it was vital for the next step in the plan mulch i know you risked your life betraying the antonelli family so id like to give you something mulchs imagination churned with visions of trust funds and offshore accounts theres no need really although it was incredibly brave and i was in mortal danger exactly said artemis untying the gold medallion from round his neck i know this isnt much but it means a lot to me i was going to keep it but i realized that in a few minutes it will mean absolutely nothing i would like you to have it i think holly would too a little memento of our adventures gee said mulch hefting the medallion half an ounce of gold great you really broke the bank there artemis artemis gripped the dwarfs hand its not always about money mulch root was craning his neck trying to see more whats that what has he given to die convict holly snatched the medallion holding it up for the camera just a gold coin commander i gave it to artemis myself foaly glanced at the small medal actually this kills two stink worms with one skewer the medallion could have triggered some residual memories highly unlikely but possible and the other stink worm mulch gets something to look at in prison root mulled it over for several moments ok he can keep it now get that convict into the shuttle and lets get on with this ive got a council meeting in ten minutes holly led mulch out and artemis realized that he really was sorry to see the dwarf go but more than that he was sorry that the memory of their friendship could be gone forever the technicians descended like flies on a carcass in seconds every human in the room had electrodes attached to temples and wrists each set of electrodes ran through a neural transformer and on to a plasma screen memories flickered on the screens foaly studied the images way too early he announced calibrate them to sixteen months ago actually make that about three years i dont want artemis planning his initial kidnap all over again bravo foaly said artemis bitterly i was hoping you might miss that the centaur winked thats not all i didnt miss on the pulldown screen roots pixelated mouth stretched into a smile tell him foaly i cant wait to see the humans face foaly consulted a file on his handheld computer we checked your email and guess what do tell we found a fairy file just waiting to be delivered we also ran a search on the internet in general and lo and behold someone with your email address had rented some storage megabytes more fairy files artemis was unrepentant i had to try im sure you understand nothing else you want to tell us about artemis opened his eyes wide the epitome of innocence nothing youre too clever for me foaly took a laserdisc from a toolbox sliding it into the drive of a networked computer on the table well just in case im going to detonate a data charge in your computer system the virus will leave your files unharmed unless they pertain to the people not only that but the virus will monitor your system for a further six months just in case you have outwitted us somehow and youre telling me all this because i wont remember it anyway foaly did a little fourstep clapping his hands together exactly holly pushed through the door dragging a metallic capsule behind her look what they found buried in the grounds she flipped the lid pouring the capsules contents on the tunisian rug several computer disks and hard copies of artemiss diary fanned across the carpet foaly examined a disk something else you forgot to mention artemis was not quite so cocky now his lifelines to the past were being cut one by one it slipped my mind thats it i suppose theres nothing else artemis returned to his chair folding his arms and if i say yes youll believe me i suppose root laughed so hard that it seemed the screen was shaking oh yes artemis we trust you completely how could we not after all youve put the people through if you dont mind wed like to ask you a few questions under the mesmer and this time you wont be wearing sunglasses sixteen months previously artemis had successfully deflected hollys hypnotic gaze with mirrored sunglasses it was the first time he had outwitted the fairies it was not to be the last well then lets get on with it captain short barked root you know what to do holly removed her helmet massaging the tips of her ears to get the circulation going im going to mesmerize you and ask a few questions its not the first time youve been under so you know that the procedure is not painful i advise you to relax if you try to resist it could cause memory loss or even brain damage artemis held up his palm wait a moment am i right in thinking that when i wake up again this will all be over holly smiled yes artemis this is goodbye for the last time artemiss face was composed in spite of the emotions churning inside him well then i have a few things to say root was curious in spite of himself one minute fowl then nighty night very well firstly thank you i have my family and friends around me thanks to the people i wish i didnt have to forget that holly laid a hand on his shoulder its better this way artemis believe me and secondly i want you all to think back to the first time you met me remember that night holly shuddered she remembered the cold individual who had attacked her at a magical hot spot in southern ireland commander root would never forget escaping an exploding tanker by the skin of his wings and foalys first glimpse of artemis had been a recording of the negotiations for hollys release he had been a despicable creature if you take away the memories and influences of the people continued artemis i might become that person again is that what you really want it was a chilling thought were the people responsible for artemiss transformation and were they to be responsible for changing him back holly turned to the screen is it possible artemis has come a long way do we have the right to destroy all that progress hes right added foaly i never thought i would say this but i kinda like the new model root opened another computer window on the screen the psych brotherhood did this probability report for us they say the chances of a reversion are slim fowl will still have strong positive influences from his family and the butlers the psych brotherhood objected holly argon and his cronies and when exactly did we start trusting those witch doctors root opened his mouth to yell but thought better of it not something that happened every day holly he said almost gently the future of our culture is at stake here the bottom line is that artemiss future is not our problem hollys mouth was a grim slash if thats true then were as bad as the mud people the commander decided to revert to his usual mode of communication listen to me captain he roared being in command means making tough decisions not being in command means shutting up and doing what youre told now mesmerize those humans before we lose the link yes sir whatever you say sir holly stood directly in front of artemis careful to make eye contact goodbye holly i wont see you again though im sure you will see me just relax artemis deep breaths when holly spoke again her voice was layered with bass and alto the hypnotic layers of the mesmer that was some job we did on spiro eh artemis smiled sleepily yes the last adventure no more hurting people how do you come up with these plans artemiss lids drooped natural ability i suppose handed down by generations of fowls i bet you would do anything to hang on to your fairy memories almost anything so what did you do artemis smiled i played a few little tricks what kind of tricks pressed holly its a secret i cant tell you holly added a few more layers to her voice tell me artemis it will be our secret a vein pulsed in artemiss temple you wont tell you wont tell the fairies holly glanced guiltily at the screen root gestured at her to continue i wont tell it will be just between us butler hid a capsule in the maze and i sent myself an email but i expect foaly to find that its to throw him offguard very clever is there anything you dont expect him to find artemis smiled craftily i hid a file on an internet storage site foalys data charge wont affect it the providers will mail me a reminder in six months when i retrieve the data it should trigger residual memories and possibly total recall anything else no the storage site is our last hope if the centaur finds that then the fairy world is lost forever roots image crackled on the screen ok the uplink is breaking up knock them out and wipe them tape the whole process i wont believe artemis is out of the game until i see the footage commander maybe i should ask the others a few questions negative captain fowl said it himself the storage site was their last hope hook them up and run the program the commanders image disappeared in waves of static yes sir holly turned to the technical crew you heard the fairy lets go sun up is in a couple of hours i want us below ground before that the techies checked that the electrodes had strong contacts then unwrapped three sets of sleep goggles ill do that said holly taking the masks she hooked the elastic over juliets ponytail you know something she said personal protection is a cold business you have too much heart for it juliet nodded slowly ill try to hold on to that thought holly settled the eyepieces gently ill keep an eye on you juliet smiled see you in my dreams holly pressed a small button on the sleep mask and a combination of hypnolights in the eyepieces and sedative administered through the seals knocked juliet out in less than five seconds butler was next the technical crew had added a length of elastic to the masks strap so that it could encircle his shaven crown make sure foaly doesnt go crazy with that mind wiper said the bodyguard i dont want to wake up with four decades of nothing in my head dont worry said holly reassuringly foaly generally knows what hes doing good remember if the people ever do need help im available holly pressed the button ill remember that she whispered artemis was last in the line in his mesmerized state he seemed almost peaceful for once there were no thought lines wrinkling his brow and if you didnt know him he could almost be a normal thirteenyearold human hollv turned to foaly are you sure about this the centaur shrugged what choice do we have orders are orders holly placed the mask over artemiss eyes and pushed the button seconds later the teenager slumped in his chair immediately lines of gnommish text began to flash across the screen behind him in the days of frond gnommish had been written in spirals but reading in spirals gave most fairies a migraine commence deleting ordered foaly but keep a copy some time when i have a few weeks off im going to find out what makes this guy tick holly watched artemiss life being written in green symbols on the screen this doesnt feel right she commented if he found us once he could find us again especially if he becomes the monster he used to be foaly tapped commands into an ergonomic keyboard maybe but next time well be ready holly sighed its a pity because now we were almost friends the centaur snorted sure like you can be friends with a viper holly suddenly shut her helmet visor hiding her eyes youre right of course we could never have been friends it was circumstance that pushed us together nothing more foaly patted her shoulder thats the girl keep your ears up where are you going tara replied holly im going to fly i need the fresh air you dont have clearance for a flight objected foaly root will have your badge for what said holly firing up her wings im not supposed to be here remember and she was gone flying in a lazy loop through the entrance hall she cleared the main door with centimetres to spare climbing quickly into the night sky for a second her slim frame was backlit by the full moon and then she disappeared vibrating out of the visible spectrum foaly watched her go emotional creatures elves in some respects they made the worst recon operatives all decisions were taken by the heart but root would never fire holly because policing was what she was born to do and anyway who else would save the people if artemis fowl ever found them again mulch sat in the shuttles holding booth feeling extremely sorry for himself he tried to sit on the bench without actually touching it with his tender behind not an easy task things did not look good it had to be said even after all hed done for the lep they were going to lock him up for at least a decade just for stealing a few measly bars of gold and it didnt seem likely that hed get an opportunity to escape he was surrounded by steel and laser bars and would remain so until the shuttle docked in haven after that it was a quick jaunt to police plaza a summary hearing and off to a secure facility until his beard turned grey which it would if he was forced to spend more than five years out of the tunnels but there was hope a tiny glimmer mulch forced himself to wait until all the technical staff had cleared their equipment from the shuttle then he casually opened his right hand rubbing his temples with thumb and forefinger what he was actually doing was reading the tiny note concealed in his palm the one slipped to him by artemis fowl when they shook hands i have not finished with you yet mulch diggums the note read on youre your return tell your lawyer to check the date on the original search warrant for your cave when you are released keep your nose clean for a couple of years then bring the medallion to me together we will be unstoppable your friend and benefactor artemis fowl the second mulch crumpled the note he made a cylinder of his fingers and sucked the paper into his mouth his dwarf molars quickly destroyed the evidence mulch breathed deeply through his nose it wasnt time to pop the skaylian rock worm wine cork just yet a review of his case could take months possibly years but there was hope the dwarf wrapped his fingers round artemiss medallion together they would be unstoppable epilogue arterms fowls journal disk i encrypted i have decided to keep a diary in fact i am surprised that the idea has never occurred to me before an intellect such as mine should be documented so that future generations of fowls can take advantage of my brilliant ideas of course i must be careful with such a document as valuable as it would be to my descendants it would be more valuable to the law enforcement agents who are forever trying to gather evidence against me it is even more important that i keep this journal a secret from my father he is not himself since his escape from russia he has become obsessed with nobility and heroism abstract concepts at best as far as i know nobility and heroism are not accepted by any of the worlds major banks the familys fortune is in my hands and i will preserve it in the way i always have through ingenious plots most of these plots will be illegal the best always are real profit lies in the shadowy areas beyond the law i have decided however out of respect for my parents values to change my criteria for victim selection it would seem better for the worlds ecology if several global corporations went bankrupt and so i have resolved to help them on their way not victimless crimes but ones where few tears will be shed for the injured parties this does not mean that i have become a weak latterday robin hood far from it i intend to reap substantial benefits from my crimes my father is not the only one to have changed butler has grown old almost overnight his appearance is the same as ever but he has slowed down considerably no matter how he tries to hide it but i will not replace him he has been a loyal employee and his expertise in matters of intelligence will be invaluable perhaps juliet will accompany me when actual protection is needed though she now claims that a life in personal protection is not for her next week she travels to the united states to try out for a wrestling team apparently she has chosen jade princess as her stage name i can only hope that she fails the audition though i doubt it she is a butler after all of course i have some ongoing ventures that i can work on without the aid of a bodyguard in recent years i have developed software to divert funds from various bank accounts to my own this software will have to be upgraded to stay ahead of the computer crime squads version should be online within six months then there is my talent for art forgery in the past i have favoured the impressionists but now for some reason i am drawn to more fantastical subject matter such as the fairy creatures depicted by pascal hervй in his magical world series but these projects must be suspended temporarily for today i discovered that i am the victim of a conspiracy the day began strangely when i awoke i experienced an instant of weakness for a single moment before i opened my eyes i felt content my drive to accumulate wealth forgotten this has never happened before perhaps the mood was left over from some magical dream or perhaps my fathers newfound positive attitude is contagious whatever the cause i must be careful to avoid such lapses in the future with my father in his current frame of mind this is no time to lose my resolve i must remain as driven as always crime is the way forward for the fowls aurum potestas est minutes later a greater mystery presented itself as i washed my face at the basin a tiny object fell from one of my eyes close examination in the lab revealed it to be a semicorroded tinted contact lens not only that but a mirrored layer had been added behind the tinted lens ingenious undoubtedly the work of a master craftsman but to what purpose it is strange but even though i have no knowledge of this lens or how it came to be in my eye i feel the answer is somewhere in my own brain hidden in the shadows imagine my surprise when juliet and butler discovered mirrored lenses in their own eyes these lenses are so clever they could have been my own invention so obviously this unknown adversary must not be underestimated i will track the culprit down make no mistake no clue will be left uninvestigated butler has a contact in limerick an expert in the field of lenses and scopes he may recognize our intruders handiwork butler is on his way there as i write and so a new chapter begins in the life of artemis fowl the second in a matter of days my father returns with his newfound conscience i will shortly be shipped off to boarding school where i will have access to a pathetic computer centre and an even more pathetic laboratory my bodyguard seems to be too old for physical tasks and there is an unknown adversary planting strange objects on my very person overwhelming difficultiesyou may think an ordinary person would draw the shutters and hide from the world but i am no ordinary person i am artemis fowl the latest in the fowl crime dynasty and i will not be turned from my path i will find whoever planted those lenses and they will pay for their presumption and once i am rid oj this nuisance my plans will proceed unhindered i shall unleash a crime wave the like of which has never been seen the world will remember the name of artemis fowl year
