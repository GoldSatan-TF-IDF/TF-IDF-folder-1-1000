mary higgins clark a cry in the night in happy memory of my parents and brothersluke nora joseph and john higginswho did indeed give joy to my youth acknowledgment my very special thanks to dr john t kelly md mph professor of psychiatry and professor and associate head of the department of family practice and community health university of minnesota medical school for his generous and expert assistance in helping me design and interpret the psychopathic personalities found in this book and in the cradle will fall prologue jenny began looking for the cabin at dawn all night she had lain motionless in the massive fourposter bed unable to sleep the stillness of the house oppressive and clutching even after weeks of knowing it would not come her ears were still tuned for the babys hungry cry her breasts still filled ready to welcome the tiny eager lips finally she switched on the lamp at the bedside table the room brightened and the leaded crystal bowl on the dresser top caught and reflected the light the small cakes of pine soap that filled the bowl cast an eerie green tint on the antique silver mirror and brushes she got out of bed and began to dress choosing the long underwear and nylon windbreaker that she wore under her ski suit she had turned on the radio at four oclock the weather report was unchanged for the area of granite place minnesota the temperature was twelve degrees fahrenheit the winds were blow ing at an average of twentyfive miles per hour the windchill factor was twentyfour below zero it didnt matter nothing mattered if she froze to death in the search she would try to find the cabin somewhere in that forest of maples and oaks and evergreens and norwegian pines and overgrown brush it was there in those sleepless hours she had devised a plan erich could walk three paces to her one his naturally long stride had always made him unconsciously walk too fast for her they used to joke about it hey wait up for a city girl shed protest once he had forgotten his key when he went to the cabin and immediately returned to the house for it hed been gone forty minutes that meant that for him the cabin was usually about a twentyminute walk from the edge of the woods he had never taken her there please understand jenny hed begged every artist needs a place to be totally alone she had never tried to find it before the help on the farm was absolutely forbidden to go into the woods even clyde whod been the farm manager for thirty years claimed he didnt know where the cabin was the heavy crusted snow would have erased any path but the snow also made it possible for her to try the search on crosscountry skis shed have to be careful not to get lost with the dense underbrush and her own miserable sense of direction she could easily go around in circles jenny had thought about that and decided to take a compass a hammer tacks and pieces of cloth she could nail the cloth to trees to help her find her way back her ski suit was downstairs in the closet off the kitchen while water boiled for coffee she zipped it on the coffee helped to bring her mind into focus during the night she had considered going to sheriff gunderson but he would surely refuse help and would simply stare at her with that familiar look of speculative disdain she would carry a thermos of coffee with her she didnt have a key to the cabin but she could break a window with the hammer even though elsa had not been in for over two weeks the huge old house still glistened and shone with visible proof of her rigid standards of cleanliness her habit as she left was to tear off the current day from the daily calendar over the wall phone jenny had joked about that to erich she not only cleans what was never dirty she eliminates every weekday evening now jenny tore off friday february crumpled the page in her hand and stared at the blank sheet under the bold lettering saturday february she shivered it was nearly fourteen months since that day in the gallery when shed met erich no that couldnt be it was a lifetime ago she rubbed her hand across her forehead her chestnutbrown hair had darkened to nearblack during the pregnancy it felt drab and lifeless as she stuffed it under the woolen ski cap the shelledged mirror to the left of the kitchen door was an incongruous touch in the massive oakbeamed kitchen she stared into it now her eyes were heavily shadowed normally a shade somewhere between aqua and blue they reflected back at her widepupiled and expressionless her cheeks were drawn the weight loss since the birth had left her too thin the pulse in her neck throbbed as she zipped the ski suit to the top twentyseven years old it seemed to her that she looked at least ten years older and felt a century older if only the numbness would go away if only the house werent so quiet so fearfully frighteningly quiet she looked at the castiron stove at the east wall of the kitchen the cradle filled with wood was beside it again its usefulness restored deliberately she studied the cradle made herself absorb the constant shock of its presence in the kitchen then turned her back on it and reached for the thermos bottle she poured coffee into it then collected the compass hammer and tacks and strips of cloth thrusting them into a canvas knapsack she pulled a scarf over her face put on her crosscountry ski shoes yanked thick furlined mittens on her hands and opened the door the sharp biting wind made a mockery of the face scarf the muffled lowing of the cows in the dairy barn reminded her of the exhausted sobs of deep mourning the sun was coming up dazzling against the snow harsh in its goldenred beauty a faroff god that could not affect the bitter cold by now clyde would be inspecting the dairy barn other hands would be pitching hay in the polebarns to feed the scores of black angus cattle which were unable to graze beneath the hardpacked snow and would habitually head there for food and shelter a halfdozen men working on this enormous farm yet there was no one near the houseall of them were small figures seen like silhouettes against the horizon her crosscountry skis were outside the kitchen door jenny carried them down the six steps from the porch tossed them on the ground stepped into them and snapped them on thank god shed learned to ski well last year it was a little after seven oclock when she began looking for the cabin she limited herself to skiing no more than thirty minutes in any direction she started at the point where erich always disappeared into the woods the overhead branches were so entangled that the sun barely penetrated through them after shed skied in as straight a line as possible she turned right covered about one hundred feet more turned right again and started back to the edge of the forest the wind covered her tracks almost as soon as she passed any spot but at every turning point she hammered a piece of cloth into the tree at eleven oclock she returned to the house heated soup changed into dry socks forced herself to ignore the tingling pain in her forehead and hands and set out again at five oclock half frozen the slanting rays of the sun almost vanishing she was about to give up for the day when she decided to go over one more hilly mound it was then she came upon it the small barkroofed log cabin that had been built by erichs greatgrandfather in she stared at it biting her lips as savage disappointment sliced her with the physical impact of a stiletto the shades were drawn the house had a shuttered look as though it had not been open for a time the chimney was snowcovered no lights shone from within had she really dared to hope that when she came upon it that chimney would be smoking lamps would glow through the curtains that shed be able to go up to the door and open it there was a metal shingle nailed to the door the letters were faded but still readable absolutely no admittance violators will be prosecuted it was signed erich fritz krueger and dated there was a pump house to the left of the cabin an outhouse discreetly halfhidden by fullbranched pines she tried to picture the young erich coming here with his mother caroline loved the cabin just as it was erich had told her my father wanted to modernize the old place but she wouldnt hear of it no longer aware of the cold jenny skied over to the nearest window reaching into the knapsack she pulled out the hammer raised it and smashed the pane flying glass grazed her cheek she was unaware of the trickle of blood that froze as it ran down her face careful to avoid the jagged peaks she reached in unfastened the latch and shoved the window up kicking off her skis she climbed over the low sill pushed aside the shade and stepped into the cabin the cabin consisted of a single room about twenty feet square a franklin stove on the north wall had wood piled neatly next to it a faded oriental rug covered most of the white pine flooring a widearmed highbacked velour couch and matching chairs were clustered around the stove a long oak table and benches were near the front windows a spinning wheel looked as though it might still be functional a massive oak sideboard held willowware china and oil lamps a steep stairway led to the left next to it rows of file baskets held stacks of unframed canvases the walls were white pine unknotted silksmooth and covered with paintings numbly jenny walked from one to the other of them the cabin was a museum even the dim light could not hide the exquisite beauty of the oils and watercolors the charcoals and penandink drawings erich had not even begun to show his best work yet how would the critics react when they saw these masterpieces she wondered some of the paintings on the walls were already framed these must be the next ones he planned to exhibit the polebarn in a winter storm what was so different about it the doe head poised listening about to flee into the woods the calf reaching up to its mother the fields of alfalfa blueflowered ready for harvest the congregational church with worshipers hurrying toward it the main street of granite place suggesting timeless serenity even in her desolation the sensitive beauty of the collection gave jenny a momentary sense of quietude and peace finally she bent over the unframed canvases in the nearest rack again admiration suffused her being the incredible dimensions of erichs talent his ability to paint landscapes people and animals with equal authority the playfulness of the summer garden with the oldfashioned baby carriage the and then she saw it not understanding she began to race through the other paintings and sketches in the files she ran to the wall from one canvas to the next her eyes widened in disbelief not knowing what she was doing she stumbled toward the staircase leading to the loft and rushed up the stairs the loft sloped with the pitch of the roof and jenny had to bend forward at the top stair before she stepped into the room as she straightened up a nightmarish blaze of color from the back wall assaulted her vision shocked she stared at her own image a mirror no the painted face did not move as she approached it the dusky light from the slitlike window played on the canvas shading it in streaks like a ghostly finger pointing for minutes she stared at the canvas unable to wrench her eyes from it absorbing every grotesque detail feeling her mouth slacken in hopeless anguish hearing the keening sound that was coming from her own throat finally she forced her numbed reluctant fingers to grasp the canvas and yank it from the wall seconds later the painting under her arm she was skiing away from the cabin the wind stronger now gagged her robbed her of breath muffled her frantic cry help me she was screaming somebody please please help me the wind whipped the cry from her lips and scattered it through the darkening wood it was obvious that the exhibition of paintings by erich krueger the newly discovered midwest artist was a stunning success the reception for critics and specially invited guests began at four but all day long browsers had filled the gallery drawn by memory ofcaroline the magnificent oil in the showcase window deftly jenny went from critic to critic introducing erich chatting with collectors watching that the caterers kept passing fresh trays of hors doeuvres and refilling champagne glasses from the moment shed opened her eyes this morning it had been a difficult day beth usually so pliable had resisted leaving for the daycare center tina teething with twoyear molars awakened a halfdozen times during the night crying fretfully the new years day blizzard had left new york a nightmare of snarled traffic and curbsides covered with mounds of slippery sooty snow by the time shed left the children at the center and made her way across town she was nearly an hour late for work mr hartley had been frantic everything is going wrong jenny nothing is ready i warn you i need someone i can count on im so sorry jenny tossed her coat in the closet what time is mr krueger due about one can you believe three of the paintings werent delivered until a few minutes ago it always seemed to jenny that the small sixtyish man reverted to being about seven years old when he was upset he was frowning now and his mouth was trembling theyre all here arent they she asked soothingly yes yes but when mr krueger phoned last night i asked if hed sent those three he was terribly angry at the prospect theyd been lost and he insists that the one of his mother be exhibited in the window even though its not for sale jenny im telling you you could have posed for that painting well i didnt jenny resisted the impulse to pat mr hartley on the shoulder weve got everything lets get on with hanging them swiftly she helped with the arrangement grouping the oils the watercolors the penandink sketches the charcoals youve got a good eye jenny mr hartley said visibly brightening as the last canvas was placed i knew wed make it sure you did she thought trying not to sigh the gallery opened at eleven by five of eleven the featured painting was in place the handsomely lettered velvetframed announcement beside it first new york showing erich krueger the painting immediately began to attract the passersby on fiftyseventh street from her desk jenny watched as people stopped to study it many of them came into the gallery to see the rest of the exhibit not a few of them asked her were you the model for that painting in the window jenny handed out brochures with erich kruegers bio two years ago erich krueger achieved instant prominence in the art world a native of granite place minnesota he has painted as an avocation since he was fifteen years old his home is a fourthgeneration family farm where he breeds prize cattle he is also president of the krueger limestone works a minneapolis art dealer was the first to discover his talent since then he has exhibited in minneapolis chicago washington dc and san francisco mr krueger is thirtyfour years old and is unmarried jenny studied his picture on the cover of the brochure and hes also marvelouslooking she thought at eleventhirty mr hartley came over to her his anxious fretful look had almost disappeared everythings all right everythings fine she assured him anticipating his next question she said i reconfirmed the caterer the times the new yorker newsweek time and art news critics are definitely coming we can expect at least eight at the reception and allowing for gatecrashers about one hundred well close to the public at three oclock that will give the caterer plenty of time to set up youre a good girl jenny now that everything was in order mr hartley was relaxed and benign wait till she told him that she couldnt stay till the end of the reception lee just got in jenny continued referring to her parttime assistant so were in good shape she grinned at him now please stop worrying ill try tell lee ill be back before one to have lunch with mr krueger you go out and get yourself something to eat now jenny she watched him march briskly out the door for the moment there was a lull in the number of new arrivals she wanted to study the painting in the window without bothering to put on a coat she slipped outside to get perspective on the work she backed up a few feet from the glass passersby on the street glancing at her and the picture obligingly walked around her the young woman in the painting was sitting in a swing on a porch facing the setting sun the light was oblique shades of red and purple and mauve the slender figure was wrapped in a dark green cape tiny tendrils of blueblack hair blew around her face which was already halfshadowed i see what mr hartley means jenny thought the high forehead thick brows wide eyes slim straight nose and generous mouth were very like her own features the wooden porch was painted white with a slender corner column the brick wall of the house behind it was barely suggested in the background a small boy silhouetted by the sun was running across a field toward the woman crusted snow suggested the penetrating cold of the oncoming night the figure in the swing was motionless her gaze riveted on the sunset despite the eagerly approaching child the solidity of the house the sweeping sense of space it seemed to jenny that there was something peculiarly isolated about the figure why perhaps because the expression in the womans eyes was so sad or was it just that the entire painting suggested biting cold why would anyone sit outside in that cold why not watch the sunset from a window inside the house jenny shivered her turtleneck sweater had been a christmas gift from her exhusband kevin he had arrived at the apartment unexpectedly on christmas eve with the sweater for her and dolls for the girls not one word about the fact that he never sent support payments and in fact owed her over two hundred dollars in loans the sweater was cheap its claim to warmth feeble but at least it was new and the turquoise color was a good background for nanas gold chain and locket of course one asset of the art world was that people dressed to please themselves and her toolong wool skirt and toowide boots were not necessarily an admission of poverty still shed better get inside the last thing she needed was to catch the flu that was making the rounds in new york she stared again at the painting admiring the skill with which the artist directed the gaze of the viewer from the figure on the porch to the child to the sunset beautiful she murmured absolutely beautiful unconsciously she backed up as she spoke skidded on the slick pavement and felt herself bump into someone strong hands gripped her elbows and steadied her do you always stand outside in this weather without a coat and talk to yourself the tone of voice combined annoyance and amusement jenny spun around confused she stammered im so sorry please excuse me did i hurt you she pulled back and as she did realized that the face she was looking at was the one depicted on the brochure shed been passing out all morning good god she thought of all people i have to go slamming into erich krueger she watched as his face paled his eyes widened his lips tightened hes angry she thought dismayed i practically knocked him down contritely she held out her hand im so sorry mr krueger please forgive me i was so lost in admiring the painting of your mother its its indescribable oh do come in im jenny macpartland i work in the gallery for a long moment his gaze remained on her face as he studied it feature by feature not knowing what to do she stood silently gradually his expression softened jenny he smiled and repeated jenny then he added i wouldnt have been surprised if you told me well never mind the smile brightened his appearance immeasurably they were practically eye to eye and her boots had threeinch heels so she judged him to be about five nine his classically handsome face was dominated by deepset blue eyes thick wellshaped brows kept his forehead from seeming too broad bronzegold hair sprinkled with touches of silver curled around his head reminding her of the image on an old roman coin he had the same slender nostrils and sensitive mouth as the woman in the painting he was wearing a camels hair cashmere coat a silk scarf at his throat what had she expected she wondered the minute shed heard the word farm she had had a mental image of the artist coming into the gallery in a denim jacket and muddy boots the thought made her smile and snapped her back to reality this was ludicrous she was standing here shivering mr krueger he interrupted her jenny youre cold im so terribly sorry his hand was under her arm he was propelling her toward the gallery door opening it for her he immediately began to study the placement of his paintings remarking how fortunate it was that the last three had arrived fortunate for the shipper he added smiling jenny followed him around as he made a meticulous inspection stopping twice to straighten canvases that were hanging a hairbreadth offcenter when he was finished he nodded seemingly satisfied why did you put spring plowing next to harvest he asked its the same field isnt it jenny asked i felt a continuity between plowing the ground and then seeing the harvest i just wish there was a summer scene as well there is he told her i didnt choose to send it jenny glanced at the clock over the door it was nearly noon mr krueger if you dont mind im going to settle you in mr hartleys private office mr hartleys made a luncheon reservation for you and him at the russian tea room for one oclock hell be along soon and im going to go out now for a quick sandwich erich krueger helped her on with her coat mr hartley is going to have to eat alone today he said im very hungry and i intend to go to lunch with you unless of course youre meeting someone no im going to get something fast at the drugstore well try the tea room i imagine theyll find room for us she went under protest knowing mr hartley would be furious knowing that her hold on her job was becoming increasingly more precarious she was late much too often shed had to stay home two days last week because tina had croup but she realized she wasnt being given a choice in the restaurant he brushed aside the fact they had no reservation and succeeded in being placed at the corner table he wanted jenny turned down the suggestion of wine id be drowsy in fifteen minutes i was a bit short on sleep last night perrier for me please they ordered club sandwiches then he leaned across the table tell me about yourself jenny macpartland she tried not to laugh did you ever take the dale carnegie course no i didnt why thats the kind of question they teach you to ask on a first meeting be interested in the other fellow i want to know about you but it happens that i do want to know about you the drinks came and they sipped as she told him i am the head of what the modern world calls the single parent family i have two little girls beth is three and tina just turned two we live in an apartment in a brownstone on east thirtyseventh street a grand piano if i had one would just about take up the whole place ive worked for mr hartley for four years how could you work for him four years with such young children i took a couple of weeks off when they were born why was it necessary to go bck to work so quickly jenny shrugged i met kevin macpartland the summer after i finished college id been a fine arts major at fordham university in lincoln center kev had a small part in an offbroadway show nana told me i was making a mistake but naturally i didnt listen nana my grandmother she raised me since i was a year old anyhow nana was right kevs a nice enough guy but hes alightweight two children in two years of marriage wasnt on his schedule right after tina was born he moved out were divorced now does he support the children the average income for an actor is three thousand dollars a year actually kev is quite good and with a break or two might make it but at the moment the answer to the question is no surely you havent had those children in a daycare center from the time they were born jenny felt the lump start to form in her throat in a minute her eyes would be filling with tears she said hurriedly my grandmother took care of them while i worked she died three months ago i really dont want to talk about her now she felt his hand close over hers jenny im sorry forgive me im not usually so dense she managed a smile my turn do tell me all about you she nibbled on the sandwich while he talked you probably read the bio on the brochureim an only child my mother died in an accident on the farm when i was ten on my tenth birthday to be exact my father died two years ago the farm manager really runs the place i spend most of my time in my studio it would be a waste if you didnt jenny said youve been painting since you were fifteen years old havent you didnt you realize how good you were erich twirled the wine in his glass hesitated then shrugged i could give the usual answer that i painted strictly as an avocation but it wouldnt be the whole truth my mother was an artist im afraid she wasnt very good but her father was reasonably well known his name was everett bonardi of course i know of him jenny exclaimed but why didnt you include that in your bio if my work is good it will speak for itself i hope ive inherited something of his talent mother simply sketched and enjoyed doing it but my father was terribly jealous of her art i suppose hed felt like a bull in a china shop when he met her family in san francisco i gather they treated him like a midwest hunky with hayseed in his shoes he reciprocated by telling mother to use her skill to do useful things like making quilts even so he idolized her but i always knew he would have hated to find me wasting my time painting so i kept it from him the noonday sun had broken through the overcast sky and a few stray beams colored by the stainedglass window danced on their table jenny blinked and turned her head erich was studying her jenny he said suddenly you must have wondered about my reaction when we met frankly i thought i was seeing a ghost your resemblance to caroline is quite startling she was about your height her hair was darker than yours and her eyes were a brilliant green yours are blue with just a suggestion of green but there are other things about you your smile the way you tilt your head when you listen youre so slim just as she was my father was always fretting over her thinness hed keep trying to make her eat more and i find myself wanting to say jenny finish that sandwich youve barely touched it im fine jenny said but would you mind ordering a quick coffee mr hartley will be having a heart attack as it is that you arrived when he was out and i have to sneak away from the reception early which wont endear me to him erichs smile vanished you have plans for tonight big ones if im late picking up the girls at mrs curtis progressive day care center im in trouble jenny raised her eyebrows pursed her lips imitated mrs curtis my usual time for closing is five pm but i make an exception for working mothers mrs macpartland but fivethirty is the finish i dont want to hear anything about missed buses or lastminute phone calls you be here by fivethirty or you keep your kids home the next morning understan erich laughed i understan now tell me about your girls oh thats easy she said obviously theyre brilliant and beautiful and lovable and and walked at six months and talked at nine months you sound like my mother people tell me thats the way she used to talk about me jenny felt an odd catch at her heart at the wistful expression that suddenly came over his face im sure it was true she said he laughed and im sure it wasnt jenny new york staggers me what was it like growing up here over coffee they talked she about city life there isnt a building in manhattan i dont love he drily i cant imagine that but then youve never really experienced the other way of life they talked about her marriage how did you feel when it was over surprisingly only the same degree of regret that i imagine id have for the typical first love the difference is i have my children for that ill always be grateful to kev when they got back to the gallery mr hartley was waiting nervously jenny watched the angry red points on his cheekbones then admired the way erich placated him as im sure youll agree airline food is not fit to eat since mrs macpartland was just leaving for lunch i prevailed on her to allow me to join her i merely nibbled and now look forward to lunching with you and may i compliment you on the placement of my work the red points receded thinking of the thick sandwich erich had consumed jenny said demurely mr hartley i recommended the chicken kiev to mr krueger please make him order it erich quirked one eyebrow and as he passed her he murmured thanks a lot afterward she regretted her impulsive teasing she hardly knew the man then why this sense of rapport he was so sympathetic and yet gave an impression of latent strength well if youre used to money all your life and have good looks and talent thrown in why wouldnt you feel secure the gallery was busy all afternoon jenny watched for the important collectors theyd all been invited to the reception but she knew many of them would come in early to have a chance to study the exhibit the prices were steep very steep for a new artist but erich krueger seemed to be quite indifferent whether or not they sold mr hartley got back just as the gallery was closed to the public he told jenny that erich had gone to his hotel to change for the reception you made quite an impression on him jenny he said sounding rather puzzled he did nothing but ask questions about you by five oclock the reception was in full swing efficiently jenny escorted erich from critics to collectors introducing him making small talk giving him a chance to chat then extricating him to meet another visitor not infrequently they were asked is this young lady your model for memory of caroline erich seemed to enjoy the question im beginning to think she is mr hartley concentrated on greeting guests as they arrived from his beatific smile jenny could surmise that the collection was a major success it was obvious that the critics were equally impressed by erich krueger the man he had changed his sports jacket and slacks for a welltailored dark blue suit his white frenchcuffed shirt was obviously custommade a maroon tie against the crisp white collar brought out his tanned face blue eyes and the silver tints in his hair he wore a gold band on the little finger of his left hand shed noticed it at lunch now jenny realized why it looked familiar the woman in the painting had been wearing it it must be his mothers wedding ring she left erich talking with alison spencer the elegant young critic from art news magazine alison was wearing an offwhite adolfo suit that complemented her ashblond hair jenny became suddenly aware of the drooping quality of her own wool skirt the fact that her boots still looked scuffed even though shed had them resoled and shined she knew that her sweater looked just like what it was a cheap misshapen polyester rag she tried to rationalize her sudden depression it had been a long day and she was tired it was time for her to leave and she almost dreaded picking up the girls when nana was still with them going home had been a pleasure now sit down dear nana would say and get yourself relaxed ill fix us a nice little cocktail shed enjoyed hearing what was going on at the gallery and shed read the children a bedtime story while jenny got dinner from the time you were eight years old you were a better cook than i am jen well nana jenny would tease maybe if you didnt cook hamburgers so long they wouldnt look like hockey pucks since theyd lost nana jenny picked up the girls at the daycare center bused them to the apartment and placated them with cookies while she threw a meal together as she was reaching for her coat one of the most important collectors cornered her finally at she managed to get away she debated about saying good night to erich but he was still deep in conversation with alison spencer what possible difference would it make to him that she was going shrugging away the renewed sensation of depression jenny quietly left the gallery by the service door patches of ice on the sidewalk made the going treacherous avenue of the americas fifth madison park lexington third second long long blocks whoever said manhattan was a narrow island had never run across it on slick pavements but the buses were so slow she was better off on foot still shed be late the daycare center was on fortyninth street near second avenue it was quarter of six before panting from running jenny rang the bell of mrs curtis apartment mrs curtis was clearly angry her arms folded her lips a narrow slash in her long unpleasant face mrs macpartland we had a terrible day the grim lady continued tina wouldnt stop crying and you told me that beth was terlettrained but let me tell you she isnt she is terlet i mean toilettrained jenny protested its probably that the girls arent used to being here yet and they wont get the chance your kids are just too much of a handful you try to understand my position a threeyearold who isnt trained and a twoyearold who never stops crying are a fulltime job by themselves mommy jenny ignored mrs curtis beth and tina were sitting together on the battered couch in the dark foyer that mrs curtis grandly referred to as the play area jenny wondered how long theyd been bundled in their outside clothes with a rush of tenderness she hugged them fiercely hi mouse hello tinker bell tinas cheeks were damp with tears lovingly she smoothed back the soft auburn hair that spilled over their foreheads theyd both inherited kevs hazel eyes and thick sooty lashes as well as his hair her was scared today beth reported pointing at tina her cried and cried tinas bottom lip quivered she reached up her arms to jenny and youre late again mrs curtis accused im sorry jennys tone was absentminded tinas eyes were heavy her cheeks flushed was she starting another siege of croup it was this place she never should have settled on it she picked up tina fearful of being left behind beth slid off the couch ill keep both girls until friday which is a favor mrs curtis said but thats it without saying good night jenny opened the door and stepped out into the cold it was completely dark now and the wind was sharp tina burrowed her head in jennys neck beth tried to shield her face in jennys coat i only wet once she confided jenny laughed oh mouse love hang on well be in the nice warm bus in a minute but three buses went by full at last she gave up and began walking downtown tina was a dead weight trying to hurry meant she had to halfdrag beth at the end of two blocks she bent down and scooped her up i can walk mommy beth protested im big i know you are jenny assured her but well make better time if i carry you locking her hands together she managed to balance both small bottoms on her arms hang on she said the marathon is under way she had ten more blocks to go downtown then two more across town theyre not heavy she told herself theyre your children where in the name of god would she find another day care by next monday oh nana nana we need you so much she couldnt dare take more time off from the gallery had erich asked alison spencer to have dinner with him she wondered someone fell in step beside her jenny looked up startled as erich reached down and took beth from her arms beths mouth formed a halfsurprised halffrightened circle seeming to realize she was about to protest he smiled at her well get home a lot faster if i carry you and we race mommy and tina his tone was conspiratorial but jenny began now surely youre going to let me help you jenny he said id like to carry the little one too but im sure she wouldnt come to me she wouldnt jenny agreed and im grateful of course mr krueger but jenny will you please stop calling me mr krueger why did you leave me stuck with that tiresome woman from art news i kept expecting you to rescue me when i realized you were gone i remembered the daycare center that awful woman told me youd left but i got your address from her i decided to walk down to your apartment and ring your bell then right in front of me i see a pretty girl in need of help and here we are she felt his arm tuck firmly under her elbow suddenly instead of feeling fatigued and depressed she was absurdly happy she glanced at his face do you go through this every night he asked his tone was both incredulous and concerned we usually manage to get a bus in bad weather she said tonight they were so full there was hardly room for the driver the block between lexington and park was filled with highstooped brownstones jenny pointed to the third house on the uptown side thats it she eyed the street affectionately to her the rows of brownstones offered a sense of tranquillity houses nearly one hundred years old built when manhattan still had large neighborhoods of singlefamily homes most of them were gone now reduced to rubble to make way for skyscrapers outside her building she tried to say good night to erich but he refused to be dismissed ill see you in he told her reluctantly she preceded him into the groundlevel studio shed made slipcovers in a cheerful yellowandorange pattern for the battered secondhand upholstery a piece of dark brown carpet covered most of the scarred parquet floor the cribs fit into the small dressing room off the bathroom and were almost concealed by the louver door chagall prints hid some of the peeling wall paint and her plants brightened the ledge over the kitchen sink glad to be released beth and tina ran into the room beth spun around im very glad to be home mommy she said she glanced at tina tina is glad to be home too jenny laughed oh mouse i know what you mean you see she explained to erich its a little place but we love it i can see why its very pleasant well dont look too hard jenny said the management is letting it run down the building is going coop so theyre not spending any more money on it now are you going to buy your apartment jenny began to unzip tinas snowsuit i havent a prayer it will cost seventyfive thousand dollars if you can believe it for this room well just hang in till they evict us and then find someplace else erich picked up beth lets get out of those heavy clothes quickly he unfastened her jacket then said now weve got to make up our minds ive invited myself to dinner jenny so if you have plans for the evening kick me out otherwise point me to a supermarket they stood up together and faced each other which is it jenny he asked the supermarket or the door she thought she detected a wistful note in the question before she could answer beth tugged at his leg you can read to me if you want she invited that settles it erich said decisively im staying you have nothing more to say about it mommy jenny thought he really wants to stay he honestly wants to be with us the realization sent unexpected waves of delight through her theres no need to go shopping she told him if you like meatloaf were in great shape she poured chablis then turned on the evening news for him while she bathed and fed the children he read a story to them while she prepared dinner as she set the table and made a salad she stole glances at the couch erich was sitting one little girl under each arm reading the three bears with appropriate histrionics tina began to doze and quietly he pulled her on his lap beth listened rapturously her eyes never leaving his face that was very very good she announced when he finished you read almost as good as mommy he lifted one eyebrow to jenny smiling triumphantly after the children were in bed they ate at the dinette table that overlooked the garden the snow in the yard was still white the barelimbed trees glistened in the reflection of the lights from the house thick high evergreens almost hid the fence that separated the property from the adjacent yards you see jenny explained country within the city after the girls are settled i linger over coffee here and imagine im gazing at my acreage turtle bay about ten blocks uptown is a beautiful area the brownstones have magnificent gardens this is sort of mock turtle bay but ill be very sorry when moving day arrives where will you go im not sure but ive got six months to worry about it well find something now how about coffee the bell rang erich looked annoyed jenny bit her lip its probably fran from upstairs shes between boyfriends now and pops in to visit every couple of nights but it was kevin he filled the doorway boyishly handsome in his expensive ski sweater a long scarf casually knotted over his shoulder his dark red hair wellbarbered his face evenly tanned come in kevin she said trying not to sound exasperated timing she thought by heaven hes got it he strode into the room kissing her quickly she felt suddenly embarrassed knowing erichs eyes were on them kids in bed jen kevin asked too bad i was hoping to see them oh you have company his voice changed became formal almost english ever the actor jenny thought the former husband meeting the exwifes new friend in a drawingroom comedy she introduced the men and they nodded to each other without smiling kevin apparently decided to lighten the atmosphere smells good in here jen what have you been cooking he examined the stove top my word what a fancy meatloaf he sampled it excellent i cant imagine why i let you get away from me it was a dreadful mistake erich said his voice chipped with ice it surely was kevin agreed easily well look i wont delay just thought id pop by on my way past oh jen could i speak with you outside for a minute she knew exactly why he wanted to speak with her it was payday hoping erich wouldnt notice she slipped her purse under her arm as she went out to the foyer kev i really havent jen its just that going overboard for christmas for you and the kids left me short my rent is due and the landlord is getting nasty just lend me thirty dollars for a week or so thirty dollars kevin i cant jen i need it reluctantly she took out her wallet kevin weve got to talk i think im going to lose my job quickly he took the bills stuffing them in his pocket he turned toward the outside door that old joker would never let you go jen he knows a good thing when he has it call his bluff and strike for a raise hell never hire anyone for what hes paying you youll see she went back into the apartment erich was clearing the table running water in the sink he picked up the pan with the remaining meatloaf and walked over to the garbage can hey hold it jenny protested the kids can have that tomorrow night for dinner deliberately he dumped it out not after that actorex of yours touched it they wont he looked directly at her how much did you give him thirty dollars hell pay me back you mean to say you allow him to walk in here kiss you joke about abandoning you and breeze out with your money to spend at some expensive bar hes short on his rent dont kid yourself jenny how often does he pull that every payday i suppose jenny smiled wearily no he missed one last month look erich please leave those dishes i can do them myself youve got far too much work to do as it is silently jenny picked up a towel why had kevin chosen just this evening to walk in what a fool she was to hand him money the rigid disapproval in erichs face and stance began to ease he took the towel from her hands thats enough of that he smiled he poured wine into fresh glasses and brought it over to the couch she sat beside him keenly aware of a deep but vague intensity about him she tried to analyze her feelings and could not in a little while erich would leave tomorrow morning he was going back to minnesota tomorrow night at this time shed be here by herself again she thought of the happiness on the childrens faces when erich read to them the blessed relief shed felt when he appeared beside her and took beth from her lunch and dinner had been such fun as though by his very presence he could dispel worry and loneliness jenny his voice was tender what are you thinking she tried to smile i dont think i was thinking i was just content i suppose and i dont know when ive been this content jenny youre sure youre not still in love with kevin macpartland she was astonished enough to laugh good lord no then why are you so willing to give him money a misguided feeling of responsibility i suppose the worry that maybe he does need his rent jenny i have an early flight tomorrow morning but i can get back to new york for the weekend are you free on friday night he was coming back to see her the same delicious sense of relief and pleasure that had been hers when he suddenly appeared on second avenue filled her im free ill find a sitter how about saturday do you think the children would enjoy going to the central park zoo if it isnt too cold and then we could take them to rumpelmayers for lunch theyd love it but erich really im not only sorry i cant just stay in new york for a while but ive got a meeting in minneapolis about some investments im planning to make oh may i he had spotted the photo album on the shelf under the cocktail table if you wish its not terribly exciting they sipped wine as he inspected the book thats me being picked up at the childrens home she told him i was adopted those are my new parents theyre a nicelooking young couple i dont remember them at all they were in an automobile accident when i was fourteen months old after that it was just nana and me is that a picture of your grandmother yes she was fiftythree when i was born i remember when i was in the first grade and came home with a long face because the kids were making fathers day cards and i didnt have a father she said listen jenny im your mother im your father im your grandmother im your grandfather im all you need you make me a card for fathers day she felt erichs arm around her shoulders no wonder you miss her so hurriedly jenny went on nana worked in a travel agency we took some terrific trips see here we are in england i was fifteen this is our trip to hawaii when they came to the pictures of her wedding to kevin erich closed the album its getting late he said you must be tired at the door he took both her hands in his and held them to his lips she had kicked off her boots and was in her stocking feet even this way you are so like caroline he said smiling you look tall in heels and quite small without them are you a fatalist jenny what is to be will be i suppose i believe that that will do the door closed behind him at exactly eight oclock the phone rang how did you sleep jenny very well it was true she had drifted off to sleep in a kind of euphoric anticipation erich was coming back she would see him again for the first time since nanas death she did not wake up around dawn with the sickening feeling of heavyhearted pain im glad so did i and i might add i enjoyed some very pleasant dreams jenny starting this morning ive arranged for a limousine to come for you and the girls at eightfifteen hell take them to the daycare center and you to the gallery and hell pick you up evenings at ten after five erich thats impossible jenny please its such a little thing for me i simply cant be worrying about you struggling with those babies in this weather but erich jenny i have to run ill call you later at the daycare center mrs curtis was elaborately pleasant such a distinguished boyfriend you have mrs macpartland he phoned this morning and i want you to know that you dont have to transfer the children i think we just need to get to know each other better and give them a chance to settle in isnt that right girls he called her at the gallery i just landed in minneapolis did the car get there erich it was a blessing not having to rush the girls out made such a difference whatever did you say to mrs curtis she was oozing sweetness and light ill bet she was jenny where do you want to eat friday night it doesnt matter choose a restaurant that youve always wanted to try someplace youve never been with anyone else erich there are thousands of restaurants in new york the ones on second avenue and greenwich village are my speed have you ever been to lutèce good lord no fine well eat there friday night in a daze jenny got through the day it didnt help to have mr hartley repeatedly comment how taken erich had been with her love at first sight jenny hes got it fran the flight attendant who lived in apartment e of the brownstone dropped in that evening she was consumed with curiosity i saw that gorgeous guy in the foyer last night i figured he had to have been here and you have a date with him friday wow she volunteered to mind the girls for jenny id love to meet him maybe he has a brother or a cousin or an old college pal jenny laughed fran hell probably think this through and call to tell me to forget it no he wont fran shook her tightly curled head ive got a hunch the week dragged wednesday thursday and then miraculously it was friday erich came for her at seventhirty she had decided to wear a longsleeved dress shed bought on sale the gold locket was set off by the oval neckline and its center diamond gleamed brilliantly against the black silk she had twisted her hair into a french braid youre lovely jenny he looked quietly expensive in a dark blue suit with a faint pinstripe a dark blue cashmere coat a white silk scarf she phoned fran to come down caught the amused gleam in erichs eye at frans open approval tina and beth were enchanted with the dolls erich had brought them jenny looked at the beautiful painted faces on the dolls the eyelids that opened and closed the dimpled hands the curling hair and compared them with the shabby gifts kevin had chosen for christmas she caught erichs frown as she handed him her wellworn thermal coat and for a moment wished that shed accepted frans suggestion that she borrow her fur jacket but nana always told her not to borrow erich had hired a limousine for the evening she leaned back against the upholstery and he reached for her hand jenny ive missed you these were the longest four days of my life ive missed you too it was the simple truth but she wished she hadnt sounded so fervent in the restaurant she glanced around at the other tables spotting celebrity faces why are you smiling jenny erich asked culture shock jet lag from one lifestyle to another do you realize not one person in this room is even aware of mrs curtis day care center lets hope not his eyes had a look of amused tenderness the waiter poured champagne you were wearing that locket the other day jenny its quite lovely did kevin give it to you no it was nanas he leaned across the table his slender sculptured fingers entwined around hers im glad otherwise it would have been bothering me all night now i can enjoy seeing it on you in excellent french he discussed the menu with the captain she asked him where he had acquired the language abroad i did quite a bit of traveling finally i realized i was happiest and least lonely when i was at the farm painting but these last few days were pretty bad why i was lonely for you on saturday they went to the zoo endlessly patient erich rotated having the girls on his shoulders and at their entreaties returned to the monkey section three times at lunch he cut beths food as jenny prepared tinas plate he talked tina into finishing her milk by promising to finish his bloody mary and with mock solemnity shook his head at jennys twitching lips over jennys protests he insisted the girls each select one of rumpelmayers famed stuffed animals and seemed blissfully unaware of the interminable time beth took to make her decision are you sure you dont have six kids on your minnesota farm jenny asked him as they stepped onto the street nobody comes naturally by that kind of patience with children but i was raised by someone who had that kind of patience and its all i know i wish id known your mother i wish id known your grandmother mommy beth asked why do you look so happy on sunday erich arrived with doublerunner ice skates for tina and beth and took them all to the rink at rockefeller center to skate that evening he took jenny to the park lane for a quiet dinner over coffee they both became silent finally he said its been a very happy two days jenny yes but he didnt say anything about coming back she turned her head and looked out at central park now sparkling from the combination of streetlights headlights and the windows of the apartments that bordered it the park is always so pretty isnt it would you miss it very much miss it minnesota has a different kind of beauty what was he saying she turned to face him in a spontaneous gesture their hands met their fingers entwined jenny its fast but its right if you insist ill come to new york every weekend for six monthsfor a yearand court you but is it necessary erich you hardly know me ive always known you you were a solemn baby you swam when you were five you won the general excellence medal in the fifth sixth and seventh grades seeing an album doesnt mean you know me i think it does and i know myself ive always understood what i was looking for was confident that when it came i would recognize it you feel it too admit it ive already made one mistake i thought i felt all the right things for kevin jenny youre not fair to yourself you were very young you told me he was the first date you ever cared about and dont forget wonderful as your grandmother was you have to have missed having a man in your life a father a brother you were ready to fall in love with kevin she considered i suppose thats true and the girls dont lose their childhood jenny theyre so happy when youre with them i think they could be happy with me marry me jenny soon a week ago she hadnt known him she felt the warmth of his hand looked into his questioning eyes felt that her own reflected the same blaze of love and she knew without a doubt what her answer would be they sat up till dawn in the apartment and talked i want to adopt the girls jenny ill have my lawyers prepare forms for macpartland to sign i dont think hell give up the children my guess is that he will i want them to have my name when we have a family of our own i dont want beth and tina to feel like outsiders ill be a good father to them hes worse than a bad one hes indifferent to them by the way what kind of engagement ring did you get from macpartland i didnt good ill have carolines ring reset for you wednesday evening on the phone he told her that hed arranged to meet kevin on friday afternoon i think its best if i see him alone dear all week tina and beth kept asking when mr kruer would come back when he arrived at the apartment on friday evening they flew into his arms jenny felt happy tears in her eyes at their whoops of joy as he hugged them over dinner at the four seasons he told her about his session with kevin he wasnt too friendly im afraid hes something of a spoiler darling he doesnt want you or the children but he doesnt want anyone else to have you but i persuaded him it was in their best interest well complete the formalities by the end of the month then the adoption will take about six months to finalize lets get married on february third that will be almost a month to the day we met which reminds me he opened his attaché case shed been surprised that he brought that case to the dinner table lets see how this fits it was an emeraldcut solitaire as erich slipped it on her finger jenny stared down into the fiery beauty of the perfect stone i decided not to have it reset he told her it really is perfect just as it is its beautiful erich and darlinglets get this out of the way too he pulled out a sheaf of papers when my lawyers prepared the adoption papers they also insisted on taking care of the premarital agreement the premarital agreement jenny asked absently she was absorbed in admiring her ring it was not all a dream it was real it was happening she was going to marry erich she almost laughed thinking of frans reaction jenny hes too perfect hes handsome hes rich hes talented he worships you god he cant take his eyes off you hes crazy about the kids let me tell you theres got to be something wrong hes gotta be a gambler or a drinker or a bigamist shed almost told erich that and then decided against it she knew frans brash humor didnt go over very well with him what was he saying its just that i am a ratherwealthyman my lawyers werent happy about the way things have moved so rapidly this simply says that if we were to break up before ten years have passed the krueger interests will remain intact she was taken aback if we broke up i wouldnt want anything from you erich i would rather die than lose you jen this is just a formality he laid the papers by her plate of course you may want your lawyers to go over these carefully in fact i was instructed to tell you that even if you or they are satisfied with all the clauses you should not mail them back before youve held them two days erich i dont have a lawyer she glanced at the top page was aghast at the legal jargon and shook her head incongruously she remembered nanas habit of carefully checking the grocery tape her occasional triumphant he charged me twice for the lemons nana would scrutinize any document like this before she signed it erich i dont want to wade through all this where shall i sign ive marked the places for you darling quickly jenny scrawled her name obviously erichs lawyers feared that she might be marrying him for his money she supposed she couldnt blame them but even so it felt uncomfortable and darling besides that one provision this sets up a trust fund for each of the girls which theyll inherit at twentyone it goes into effect as soon as the adoption is complete it also provides that you will inherit everything i have on my death dont even talk about that erich he put the papers back in his case what a terribly unromantic thing to have to do he said what do you want for our fiftieth anniversary jen darby and joan what theyre royal doulton figurines an old man and an old woman sitting contentedly side by side ive always loved them the next morning when erich came to the house he had a gift box under his arm the two figurines were in it even more than the ring they made jenny sure about the rest of her life i appreciate this jen three hundred bucks is a big help you were always a good sport well you and i collected this stuff together the money is rightfully half yours kev god when i think of how wed go around late at night to pick up the furniture people were leaving out with their garbage remember how we just beat someone to the love seat you sat on it before the other guy could get to it i remember jenny said he was so mad i thought hed pull a knife on me look kevin i wish youd come earlier erich will be here in a few minutes and i dont think hell be pleased to run into you they were standing in the dismantled apartment the furniture had been taken outjenny had sold everything for just under six hundred dollars the walls now bare of the cheerful prints looked soiled and cracked the basic shabbiness of the apartment was cruelly revealed without the furniture and carpet to hide its nakedness the handsome new suitcases were the only items in the room kevin was wearing an ultrasuede jacket no wonder hes always broke she thought dispassionately she studied him noticing the puffy lines under his eyes another hangover she guessed with guilt she realized that she felt more nostalgia at leaving this tiny apartment than she did at the prospect of not seeing kevin again you look beautiful jen that blue is a great color on you she was wearing a twopiece blue silk dress on one of his visits erich had insisted on outfitting her and the children at saks shed protested but hed overridden her objection look at it this way by the time the bill comes in youll be my wife now her vuitton bags were filled with designer suits and blouses and sweaters and slacks and evening skirts raphael boots and magli shoes after her first uneasiness about having erich paying for them before they were married shed had a marvelous time and what joy it had been to shop for the girls youre so good to us it became a constant refrain i love you jenny every penny i spend is pleasure for me ive never been happier hed helped her select the clothes erich had an excellent sense of style the artists eye she joked where are the girls kevin asked id like to say goodbye to them fran took them for a walk well pick them up after the ceremony fran and mr hartley are having lunch with us then well go right to the airport jen i think youve rushed into this too fast youve only known krueger a month thats long enough when youre sure when youre very sure and we both are well im still not sure about the adoption i dont want to give up my kids jenny tried not to show irritation kevin weve been through this youve signed the papers you dont bother with the girls you dont support them in fact whenever youre interviewed you deny having a family how are they going to feel when theyre grown and understand that i gave them up grateful for giving them the chance to be with a father who wants them you seem to forget im adopted and ill always be grateful to whoever gave me up being raised by nana was mighty special i agree nana was mighty special but i dont like erich krueger theres something about him kevin all right ill go ill miss you jen i still love you you know that he took her hands and i love my kids too act three curtain jenny thought not a dry eye in the house please kevin i dont want erich to find you here jen theres a chance i may be coming to minnesota ive got a good crack at getting in the repertory company at the guthrie theater in minneapolis if i do ill look you up kevin dont look me up firmly she opened the apartment door the buzzer rang that must be erich jenny said nervously darn it i didnt want him to see you here come on ill walk you out erich was waiting behind the locked frenchglass foyer doors he was holding a large giftwrapped box dismayed she watched his expression change from anticipation to displeasure as he saw her coming down the hall with kevin she opened the outer door to admit him then said quickly kevin stopped over for just a minute goodbye kevin the two men stared at each other neither spoke then kevin smiled and bent over jenny kissing her on the mouth he said his tone intimate it was wonderful being with you thanks again jen see you in minnesota darling we are crossing over green bay wisconsin our altitude is thirty thousand feet well be landing at the twin cities airport at fivefiftyeight pm the temperature in minneapolis is eight degrees fahrenheit its a clear beautiful afternoon hope youre enjoying your flight folks thanks again for flying northwest erichs hand covered jennys enjoying your flight she smiled at him very much they both looked down at his mothers gold wedding band now on her finger beth and tina had fallen asleep the flight attendant had removed the center arm and they were curled up together auburn ringlets overlapping their new green velvet jumpers and white turtleneck pullovers somewhat rumpled now jenny turned to study the cushion of clouds that floated outside the plane window underneath her happiness she was still furious with kevin shed known he was weak and irresponsible but shed always thought of him as being casually goodnatured but he was a spoiler hed managed to cloud their wedding day in the apartment after he left erich had said why did he thank you and what did he mean did you invite him to our home shed tried to explain but the explanation felt hollow in her own ears you gave him three hundred dollars erich asked incredulously how much does he owe you in support payments and loans but i dont need that and the furniture was half his or maybe you wanted to be sure he had fare to come visit you erich how can you believe that shed forced back the tears that threatened to fill her eyes but not before erich had seen them jenny forgive me im sorry im jealous of you i admit that i hate the fact that man ever touched you i dont want him to ever put a finger on you again he wont i can promise you that god if anything im so grateful to him for signing the adoption papers i kept my fingers crossed right to the last minute on that money talks erich you didnt pay him not much two thousand dollars a thousand per girl a very cheap price to get rid of him he sold you his children jenny had tried to keep the contempt from showing in her voice id have paid fifty times more you should have told me i wouldnt have told you now except i dont want any leftover pity for him lets forget him this is our day how about opening your wedding present it was a blackglama mink coat oh erich come ontry it on it felt luxurious soft lightweight warm its exactly right with your hair and eyes erich said pleased do you know what i was thinking this morning no hed put his arms around her i slept so badly last night i hate hotels and all i could think is that tonight jenny will be with me in my own home do you know that poem jenny kissed me im not sure i could only remember a couple of the lines say im weary say im sad and then the triumphant last line is jenny kissed me i was thinking that as i rang the bell and then a minute later i have to watch kevin macpartland kiss you please erich forgive me lets get out of this place its depressing she hadnt had time to take a final look before he rushed her to the limousine even during the ceremony kevin had been on her mind especially her marriage to him at st monicas four years ago theyd chosen that church because nana had been married there nana sat beaming in the first row she hadnt approved of kevin but put her doubts behind her when she couldnt dissuade jen what would she think of this ceremony before a judge instead of a priest i jennifer take you she hesitated dear god shed almost said kevin she felt erichs questioning eyes and began again firmly i jennifer take you erich what god has joined together man must not separate the judge had spoken the words solemnly but theyd said that at her wedding to kevin they arrived in minneapolis one minute ahead of schedule a large sign said welcome to the twin cities jenny studied the airport with avid interest ive been all over europe but never farther west than pennsylvania she laughed i had a mental image of landing in the midst of a prairie she was holding beth by the hand erich was carrying tina beth looked backward at the ramp that led to the plane more plane mommy she begged you may have started something erich jenny said they seem to be developing a taste for firstclass travel erich was not listening i told clyde to have joe waiting for us he said he should have been at the arrival gate joe one of the farmhands hes not too bright but hes excellent with horses and a good driver i always have him chauffeur me when i dont want to leave the car at the airport oh here he is jenny saw rushing toward them a strawhaired slenderly built young man of about twenty with wide innocent eyes and rosy cheeks he was neatly dressed in a thermal coat dark knit trousers heavy boots and gloves a chauffeurs cap sat incongruously on his thick hair he pulled it off as he stopped in front of erich and she had time to reflect that for such a handsome young man he looked awfully worried mr krueger im sorry im late the roads are pretty icy wheres the car erich asked brusquely ill get my wife and children settled then you and i can attend to the luggage yes mr krueger the worried look deepened im really sorry im late oh for heaven sake jenny said were early one minute early she held out her hand im jenny he took it holding it gingerly as though he feared hurting it im joe mrs krueger everybodys looking forward to seeing you everybodys been talking about you im sure they have erich said shortly his arm urged jenny forward joe fell back behind them she realized erich was annoyed maybe she wasnt supposed to have been so friendly her life in new york and hartley gallery and the apartment on thirtyseventh street suddenly seemed terribly far away erichs maroon fleetwood was mintnew and the only car in the parking area not spattered with crusted snow jenny wondered if joe had taken precious minutes to have it washed before arriving at the airport erich settled her and tina in the back seat gave permission to beth to ride in front and hurried away to help joe collect the baggage a few minutes later they were pulling onto the highway its nearly a threehour drive to the farm erich told her why dont you lean against me and nap he seemed relaxed even genial now the spasm of anger forgotten he reached for tina who willingly settled in his lap erich had a way with the little girl seeing the contentment on tinas face snapped jenny out of her momentary homesickness the car sped into the country the lights along the highway began to disappear the road darkened and narrowed joe switched on the high beams of the headlights and she could discern clumps of graceful maples and irregular poorly shaped oaks the land seemed absolutely flat it was all so different from new york that was why shed felt that terrible sense of alienation as they left the airport she needed time to think to get in focus to adjust settling her head on erichs shoulder she murmured you know something i am tired she didnt want to talk any more not right now but oh how good it was to lean against him to know that their time together wouldnt ever again be rushed and frantic he had suggested that they defer an official honeymoon you dont have anyone to leave with the girls hed said once theyre comfortably settled on the farm well find a reliable sitter and take a trip how many other men would have been that thoughtful she wondered she felt erich looking down at her awake jenny he asked but she didnt answer his hand smoothed back her hair his fingers kneaded her temple tina was asleep now her breathing came soft and measured in the front seat beth had stopped chattering to joe so she too must be napping jenny made her own breath rise and fall evenly it was time to plan ahead to turn away from the life she had left and begin to anticipate the one that was waiting for her erichs home had been without a womans touch for a quarter of a century it probably needed a massive overhaul it would be interesting to see how much of carolines influence remained in it funny she mused i never think of erichs mother as his mother i think of her as caroline she wondered if his father hadnt referred to her that way if instead of saying your mother to erich when he reminisced hed say caroline and i used to redecorating would be a joy how many times had she studied the apartment and thought if i could afford it id do this and this and this what a sense of freedom it would be to wake up in the morning and know she didnt have to rush off to work just to be with the children to spend time with them real time not endoftheday exhausted time shed already lost the best part of their baby years and to be a wife just as kevin had never been a real father to the children hed never been a real husband to her even in their most intimate moments shed always felt that kevin had a mental image of himself playing the romantic lead in an mgm film and she was certain that hed been unfaithful to her even during the short time they lived together erich was mature he could have married long before now but hed waited he welcomed responsibility kevin had shunned it erich was so reticent fran said she thought he was a bit stodgy and jenny knew that even mr hartley wasnt comfortable with him they didnt realize that his seeming aloofness was simply a cover for an innately shy nature i find it easier to paint my sentiments than to express them hed told her there was so much love expressed in everything he painted she felt erichs hand stroking her cheek wake up darling were nearly home what oh did i fall asleep she pulled herself up im glad you slept darling but look out the window now the moon is so bright you should be able to see quite a bit his voice was eager were on county road twentysix our farm begins at that fence on both sides of the road the right side eventually ends at grays lake the other side winds and twists the woods take up nearly two hundred acres alone they end at the river valley that slopes into the minnesota river now watch youll see some of the outer buildings those are the polebarns where we feed the cattle in the winter beyond them are the grainery and stables and the old mill now as we come around this bend you can see the west side of the house its set on that knoll jenny pressed her face against the car window from the background glimpses shed seen in some of erichs paintings she knew that at least part of the exterior of the house was pale red brick shed imagined a currier and ives kind of farmhouse nothing erich had said had prepared her for what she was looking at now even viewed from the side it was obvious that the house was a mansion it was somewhere between seventy and eighty feet long and three stories high lights streamed from the long graceful windows on the first floor overhead the moon blanched the roof and gables into glistening tiaras the snowcovered fields shone like layers of white ermine framing the structure enhancing its flowing lines erich do you like it jenny like it erich its magnificent its twice no five times larger than i expected why didnt you warn me i wanted to surprise you i told clyde to be sure and have it lighted for your first impression i see he took me at my word jenny stared trying to absorb every detail as the car moved slowly along the road a white wooden porch with slender columns began at the side door and extended to the rear of the house she recognized it as the setting of memory of caroline even the swing in the painting was still there the only piece of furniture on the porch a gust of wind was making it sway gently to and fro the car turned left and drove through open gates a sign krueger farm was lighted by the torchères that topped the gateposts the car followed the driveway skirting snowcovered fields to their right the woods began a thick heavy forest of trees whose branches were bare and skeletal against the moon the car turned left and completed the arc stopping in the driveway in front of wide stone steps massive ornately carved double doors were illuminated by the fan window arching over them joe hurried to open jennys door quickly erich handed the sleeping tina to him you bring in the girls joe he said taking jennys hand he hurried up the steps turned the latch and pushed open the doors pausing he looked directly into her eyes i wish i could paint you now he said i could call the painting coming home your long lovely dark hair your eyes so tender looking at me you do love me dont you jenny i love you erich she said quietly promise youll never leave me swear that jenny erich how can you even think that now please promise jenny ill never leave you erich she put her arms around his neck his need is so great she thought all this month shed been troubled by the onesided aspect of their relationship he the giver she the taker she was grateful to realize it wasnt that simple he picked her up jenny kissed me now he was smiling as he carried her into the house he kissed her lips at first tentatively then with gathering emotion oh jenny he set her down in the entrance hall it had gleaming parquet floors delicately stenciled walls a crystal and gold chandelier a staircase with an ornately carved balustrade led to the second floor the walls were covered with paintings erichs bold signature in the righthand corner for a moment jenny was speechless joe was coming up the steps with the girls now dont run he was cautioning them but the long nap had revived them and they were eager to explore keeping one eye on them jenny listened as erich began to show her through the house the main parlor was to the left of the entry foyer she tried to absorb everything he was telling her about the individual pieces like a child showing off his toys he pointed out the walnut étagère kidneyshaped and marblebased its early eighteenth century he said ornate oil lamps now wired stood on either side of a massive highbacked couch my grandfather had that made in austria the lamps are from switzerland memory of caroline was hung above the couch an overhead light revealed the face in the portrait more intimately than it had appeared in the gallery window it seemed to jenny that in this lighting in this room her own resemblance to caroline was accentuated the woman in the painting seemed to be looking directly at her its almost like an icon jenny whispered i feel as though her eyes are following me i always feel that way erich said do you think they might be an immense rosewood reed organ on the west wall immediately attracted the children they climbed onto the velvetcushioned bench and began to press the keys jenny saw erich wince as the buckle of tinas shoe scratched the leg of the bench quickly she lifted the protesting girls down lets see the rest of the house she suggested the dining room was dominated by a banquet table large enough to accommodate twelve chairs an elaborate heart motif was carved out of each of the chairbacks a quilt was hung like a tapestry on the far wall pieced entirely of hexagons with a scalloped border and stitched in flower motifs it added a bright note to the austerely handsome room my mother made it erich said see her initials all the walls of the large library were covered with walnut bookcases each shelf held an even row of precisely placed books jennie glanced at some of the titles am i going to have a good time she exclaimed i cant wait to catch up on reading about how many books have you got eleven hundred and twentythree you know exactly how many of course the kitchen was huge the left wall contained the appliances a round oak table and chairs were placed exactly in the center of the room on the east wall a giant old iron stove with highly polished nickel chrome and isinglass windows looked capable of heating the whole house an oak cradle next to the stove held firewood a couch covered in a colonial print and matching chair were at rigid right angles to each other in this room as in the others she had seen absolutely nothing was out of place its a little different from your apartment isnt it jenny his tone was proud you see why i didnt tell you i wanted to enjoy your reaction jenny felt an urge to defend the apartment its certainly bigger she agreed how many rooms are there twentytwo erich said proudly lets just have a quick look at our bedrooms well finish the tour tomorrow he put his arm around her as they walked up the stairs the gesture was comforting and helped to relieve some of the strangeness she was feeling all right she thought i do feel as though im on a guided tour look but dont touch the master bedroom was a large corner room in the front of the house dark mahogany furniture gleamed with a fine velvet patina the massive fourposter bed was covered with a spread of cranberrycolored brocade the brocade was repeated in the canopy and draperies a leaded crystal bowl on the left side of the dresser was filled with small bars of pine soap an initialed silver dressing set each piece an inch apart was to the right of the bowl the dressing set had been erichs greatgrandmothers the bowl was carolines and had come from venice caroline never wore perfume but loved the scent of pine erich said that soap is imported from england the pine soap that was what she had detected as she came into the roomthe faint aroma of pine so subtle it was almost impossible to distinguish is this where tina and i sleep mommy beth asked erich laughed no mouse you and tina will be across the hall but do you want to see my room first its right next door jenny followed expecting to see the room of a bachelor in the family home she was anxious to experience erichs personal taste in furnishing almost everything she had seen so far seemed to have been left to him he threw open the door of the room next to the master bedroom here too the overhead light was already on she saw a single maple bed covered by a colorful quilt a rolltop desk halfopen revealed pencils and crayons and sketch pads a threeshelf bookcase contained the book of knowledge a little league trophy stood on the dresser a highbacked rocker was in the left corner near the door a hockey stick was propped against the right wall it was the room of a tenyearold child i never slept here after mother died erich explained when i was little i used to love lying in bed listening to the sound of her moving around in her room the night of the accident i couldnt stand to come in here to calm me down dad and i both moved to the two back bedrooms we never moved back are you saying that this room and the master bedroom havent been slept in in nearly twentyfive years thats right but we didnt close them off we just didnt use them but someday our son will use this room sweetheart jenny was glad to go back into the foyer despite the cheerful quilt and warm maple furniture there was something disquieting about erichs boyhood room beth tugged at her restlessly mommy were hungry she said positively oh mouse im sorry lets go to the kitchen beth raced down the long hall her footsteps noisy for such little feet tina ran behind her wait for me beth dont run erich called after them dont break anything jenny warned remembering the delicate porcelain in the parlor erich lifted the mink off her shoulders dropped it over his arm well what do you think something about the way he asked the question was disturbing it was as though he was too eager for approval and she reassured him now the same way she answered a similar question from beth its perfect i love it the refrigerator was wellstocked she heated milk for cocoa and made ham sandwiches i have champagne for us erich said he put his arm over the back of her chair ill be ready for it in a little while jenny smiled at him and tilted her head toward the girls as soon as i clear the decks they were just about to get up when the doorbell rang erichs scowl changed to a look of pleasure when he opened the door mark for heaven sake come on in the visitor filled the entry his windblown sandy hair almost touched the top of the doorway rangy shoulders were not hidden by his heavy hooded parka piercing blue eyes dominated his strongfeatured face jenny erich said this is mark garrett ive told you about him mark garrett dr garrett the veterinarian who had been erichs closest friend since boyhood marks like a brother erich had told her in fact if anything had happened to me before i married he would have inherited the farm jenny extended her hand felt his cold and strong cover hers ive always said you had good taste erich mark commented welcome to minnesota jenny she liked him immediately its lovely to be here she introduced the girls to him they were both unexpectedly shy youre very very big beth told him he refused coffee i hate to barge in he told erich but i wanted you to hear it from me baron pulled a tendon pretty badly this afternoon baron was erichs horse erich had talked about him a thoroughbred flawless breeding nervous badtempered a remarkable animal i could have raced him but prefer having him for myself were any bones broken erichs voice was absolutely calm positively not what happened mark hesitated somehow the stable door was left open and he got out he stumbled when he tried to jump the barbedwire fence on the east field the stable door was open each word was precisely enunciated who left it open no one admits to it joe swears he closed it when he left the stable after he fed baron this morning joe the driver no wonder he had looked so frightened jenny thought she looked at the girls they were sitting quietly at the table a minute ago theyd been ready to scamper away now they seemed to sense the change in the atmosphere the anger erich wasnt bothering to hide i told joe not to discuss it with you until i had a chance to see you baron will be fine in a couple of weeks i think joe probably didnt pull the door fast when he left hed never be deliberately careless he loves that animal apparently no one in his family inflicts harm deliberately erich snapped but they certainly manage to inflict it if baron is left lame he wont be ive hosed him down and bandaged him why dont you walk out and see him now youll feel better i might as well erich reached into the kitchen closet for his coat his expression was coldly furious mark followed him out again welcome jenny he said my apologies for being the bearer of bad news as the door closed behind them she heard his deep calm voice now erich dont get upset it took a warm bath and bedtime story before the children finally settled down jenny tiptoed out of the room exhausted shed pushed the beds together with one against the wall then shed shoved the steamer trunk against the exposed side of the other one the room that an hour before had been in perfect order was a mess the suitcases were open on the floor shed rifled through them hunting for pajamas and tinas favorite old blanket but had not bothered to unpack properly she was too tired now it could wait till morning erich was there just as she came out she watched his expression change as he surveyed the untidiness inside lets leave it darling she said wearily i know its every which way but ill put it right tomorrow it seemed to her that he made a deliberate attempt to sound casual im afraid i couldnt go to bed and leave this it took him only a few minutes to completely unpack to stack underwear and socks in furniture drawers to hang dresses and sweaters in the closet jenny gave up trying to help if they wake up theyll be around for hours she thought but was suddenly too tired to protest finally erich pushed the outer bed so that it was lined exactly with its twin straightened the small shoes and boots stacked the suitcases on an upper shelf and closed the closet door which jenny had left ajar when he was finished the room was infinitely neater and the children hadnt awakened jenny shrugged she knew she should be grateful but could not help feeling that the risk of waking the children should have overcome the need for a cleanup session particularly on a wedding night in the hall erich put his arms around her sweetheart i know what a long day this has been i drew a tub for you it should be about the right temperature now why dont you get changed and ill fix a tray for us ive got champagne cooling and a jar of the best caviar i could find in bloomingdales how does that sound jenny felt a rush of shame at her feeling of irritation she smiled up at him youre too good to be true the bath helped she soaked in it enjoying the unaccustomed length and depth of the tub which was still mounted on its original brass claw feet as the hot water soothed the muscles in her neck and shoulders she determined to relax she realized now that erich had carefully avoided describing the house to her what had he said oh yes things like nothing much has been changed since caroline died i think the extent of the redecorating was to replace some curtains in the guest bedroom was it just that nothing had worn out in these years or was erich religiously preserving intact everything that reminded him of his mothers presence here the scent she loved was still lingering in the master bedroom her brushes and combs and nail buffer were on the dresser she wondered if there might not still be a few strands of carolines hair caught in one of the brushes his father had been desperately wrong to have allowed erichs childhood bedroom to be left intact frozen in time as though growth in this house had stopped with carolines death the thought made her uneasy and she deliberately pushed it aside think of erich and yourself she told herself forget the past remember that you belong to each other now her pulse quickened she thought of the lovely new nightgown and peignoir inside her new suitcase shed bought them in bergdorf goodman with her last paycheck splurging extravagantly but wanting to truly look like a bride tonight suddenly lighthearted she got out of the tub released the stopper and reached for a towel the mirror above the sink was clouded over she started to dry herself then paused and began to wipe away the steam she felt that in the midst of all the newness she needed to see herself find her own image as the glass dried she glanced into it but it was not her own bluegreen eyes that she saw reflected back it was erichs face erichs midnightblue eyes meeting hers in the reflection he had opened the door so silently she hadnt heard him spinning around she instinctively clutched the towel in front of her then deliberately let it fall oh erich you scared me she said i didnt hear you come in his eyes never left her face i thought youd want your gown darling he said here it is he was holding an aquamarine satin nightgown with a deep v cut in the front and back erich i have a new gown did you just buy this one for me no erich said it was carolines he ran his tongue nervously over his lips he was smiling strangely his eyes as they rested on her were moist with love when he spoke again his tone was pleading for my sake jenny wear it tonight for minutes jenny stood staring at the bathroom door not knowing what to do i dont want to wear a dead womans nightgown she protested silently the satin felt soft and clinging under her fingers after erich handed her the gown hed abruptly left the room she began to shiver as she looked at the suitcase should she simply put on her own gown and peignoir simply say i prefer this erich she thought of his expression when he handed his mothers gown to her maybe it wont fit she hoped that would solve everything but when she pulled it over her head it might have been made for her she was thin enough for the tapered waist the narrowly cut hips the straight line to the ankles the v cut accentuated her firm breasts she glanced in the mirror the steam was evaporating now and tiny driblets of water were running down that must be why she looked different or was it that something in the aqua tone of the gown emphasized the green in her eyes she could not say the gown did not fit and certainly it was becoming but i dont want to wear it she thought uneasily i dont feel like myself in it she was about to pull it over her head when there was a soft tap on the door she opened it erich was wearing gray silk pajamas and a matching dressing gown he had turned off all the lights except for the one on the night table and his burnished gold hair was a counterpoint to the glow of the lamp the brocaded cranberrycolored spread was off the bed the sheets were turned back lace embroidered pillows were propped against the massive headboard erich was holding two glasses of champagne he handed one of them to her they walked to the center of the room and he touched his glass to hers i looked up the rest of the poem darling his voice soft he spoke the words slowly jenny kissed me when we met jumping from the chair she sat in time you thief who love to get sweets into your list put that in say im weary say im sad say that health and wealth have missed me say im growing old but add jenny kissed me jenny felt tears in her eyes this was her wedding night this man who had offered so much love to her and whom she loved so much was her husband this beautiful room was theirs what difference what nightgown she wore it was such a little thing to do for him she knew her smile was as happy as his as they toasted each other when he took the glass from her hand and set it down she joyfully went into his arms long after erich slept his arm pillowing her head his face buried in her hair jenny lay awake she was so accustomed to the street noises that were part of the night sounds of the new york apartment that she was not yet able to absorb the absolute stillness of this room the room was very cool she liked that and reveled in the clear fresh air but it was so quiet so absolutely still except for the even breathing that rose and fell against her neck i am so happy she thought i didnt know it was possible to be this happy erich was a shy tender and considerate lover she had always suspected that there were far deeper emotions possible than kevin had ever aroused in her it was true before erich fell asleep they had talked was kevin the only one before me jenny yes he was theres never been anyone before for me did he mean hed never loved anyone before or hed never slept with anyone before was that possible she drifted off to sleep light was just beginning to trickle into the room when she felt erich stir and slip out of bed erich darling im sorry to wake you i never sleep more than a few hours in a little while ill go to the cabin and paint ill be back around noon she felt his kiss on her forehead and lips as she drifted back to sleep i love you she murmured the room was flooded with light when she awoke again quickly she ran to the window and pulled up the shade as she watched she was surprised to see erich disappearing into the woods the scene outside was like one of his paintings the tree branches were white with frozen snow snow covered the gambrel roof of the barn nearest the house far back in the fields she could catch glimpses of cattle she glanced at the porcelain clock on the night table eight oclock the girls would be waking up soon they might be startled to find themselves in a strange room barefoot she hurried out of the bedroom and started down the wide foyer as she passed erichs old room she glanced into it then stopped the coverlet was tossed back the pillows were bunched up she went into the room and touched the sheet it was still warm erich had left their room and come in here why he doesnt sleep much she thought he probably didnt want to toss and turn and wake me up hes used to sleeping alone maybe he wanted to read but he said hed never slept in this room since he was ten years old footsteps were running down the hall mommy mommy quickly she hurried to the foyer bent down and opened her arms beth and tina their eyes shining from the long sleep ran to her mommy we were looking for you beth said accusingly me like it here tina chirped in and we have a present beth said a present what have you got love me too tina cried thank you mommy it was on our pillows beth explained jenny gasped and stared each little girl was holding a small round cake of pine soap she dressed the children in new red corduroy overalls and striped tee shirts no school beth said positively no school jenny agreed happily quickly she put on slacks and a sweater and they went downstairs the cleaning woman had just arrived she had a scrawny frame with incongruously powerful arms and shoulders her small eyes set in a puffy face were guarded she looked as though she rarely smiled her hair too tightly braided seemed to be pulling up the skin around her hairline robbing her of expression jenny held out her hand you must be elsa im she started to say jenny and remembered erichs annoyance at her too friendly greeting to joe im mrs krueger she introduced the girls elsa nodded i do my best i can see that jenny said the house looks lovely you tell mr krueger that stain on the diningroom paper was not my fault maybe he had paint on his hand i didnt notice a stain last night i show you there was a smudge on the diningroom paper near the window jenny studied it for heaven sake you almost need a microscope to see it elsa went into the parlor to begin cleaning and jenny and the girls breakfasted in the kitchen when they were finished she got out their coloring books and crayons tell you what she proposed let me have a cup of coffee in peace and then well go out for a walk she wanted to think only erich could have put those cakes of soap on the girls pillows of course it was perfectly natural that hed look in on them this morning and there was nothing wrong with the fact that he obviously liked the smell of pine shrugging she finished her coffee and dressed the children in snowsuits the day was cold but there was no wind erich had told her that winter in minnesota could range from severe to vicious were breaking you in easy this year hed said its just middlin bad at the doorway she hesitated erich might want to show them around the stables and barns and introduce her to the help lets go this way she suggested she led tina and beth around the back of the house and toward the open fields on the east side of the property they walked on the crunching snow until the house was almost out of sight then as they strolled toward the country road that marked the east boundary of the farm jenny noticed a fencedoff area and realized they had come upon the family cemetery a halfdozen granite monuments were visible through the white pickets whats that mommy beth asked she opened the gate and they went inside the enclosure she walked from one to the other of the tombstones reading the inscriptions erich fritz krueger and gretchen krueger they must have been erichs greatgrandparents two little girls marthea and amanda erichs grandparents erich lars and olga krueger both born in she died in he in a baby boy erich hans who lived eight months in so much pain jenny thought so much grief two little girls lost in one generation a baby boy in the next one how do people bear that kind of hurt at the next monument erich john krueger erichs father there was one grave at the south end of the plot as separate from the others as it was possible to be it was the one she realized she had been looking for the inscription read caroline bonardi krueger erichs father and mother were not buried together why the other monuments were weathered this one looked as though it had been recently cleaned did erichs love for his mother extend to taking extraordinary care of her tombstone inexplicably jenny felt a stab of anxiety she tried to smile come on you two ill race you across the field laughing they ran after her she let them catch and then pass her pretending to try to keep up with them finally they all stopped breathless clearly beth and tina were elated to have her with them their cheeks were rosy their eyes sparkled and glowed even beth had lost her perpetually solemn look jenny hugged them fiercely lets walk as far as that knoll she suggested then well turn back but when they reached the top of the embankment jenny was surprised to see a fairsized white farmhouse nestled on the other side she realized it had to be the original family farmhouse now used by the farm manager who lives there beth asked some people who work for daddy as they stood looking at the house the front door opened a woman came out on the porch and waved to them clearly indicating she wanted them to come up to the house beth tina come on jenny urged it looks as though were about to meet our first neighbor it seemed to her that the woman stared at them unrelentingly as they walked across the field unmindful of the cold day she stood in the doorway the door wide open behind her at first jenny thought from her slight frame and sagging body that she was elderly but as she got closer she realized that the woman was no more than in her late fifties her brown hair was streaked with gray and twisted high on her head in a carelessly pinned knot her rimless glasses magnified sad gray eyes she wore a long shapeless sweater over baggy doubleknit slacks the sweater accentuated her bony shoulders and acute thinness still there were vestiges of prettiness about the face and the drooping mouth had wellshaped lips there was a hint of a dimple in her chin and somehow jenny visualized this woman younger more joyous the woman stared at her as she introduced herself and the girls just like erich told me the woman said her voice low and nervous rooney he said wait till you meet jenny youll think youre looking at caroline but he didnt want me talking about it she made a visible effort to calm herself impulsively jenny held out both her hands and erich has told me about you rooney how long youve been here i understand your husband is the farm manager i havent met him yet the woman ignored that youre from new york city yes i am how old are you twentysix our daughter arden is twentyseven clyde said she went to new york maybe you met her the question was asked with fierce eagerness im afraid i havent jenny said but of course new york is so big what kind of work does she do where does she live i dont know arden ran away ten years ago she didnt have to run away could just as easily have said ma i want to go to new york i never denied her her dad was a bit strict with her i guess she knew he wouldnt let her go so young but she was such a good girl why she was president of the h club i didnt know she wanted to go so bad i thought she was really happy with us the womans gaze was fixed on the wall she seemed to be in a reverie of her own as though explaining something she had explained many times before she was our only one we waited a long time for her she was such a pretty baby and so wanting you know what i mean so active right from the minute she was born so i said lets call her arden short for ardent it suited her real nice beth and tina shrank against jenny there was something about this woman about the staring eyes and slight tremor that frightened them my god jenny thought her only child and she hasnt heard from her in ten years i would go mad see her picture here rooney indicated a framed picture on the wall i took that just two weeks before she left jenny studied the picture of a sturdy smiling teenager with curly blond hair maybe shes married and has babies too rooney said i think about that a lot thats why when i saw you coming along with the little ones i thought maybe thats arden im sorry jenny said no its all right and please dont tell erich ive been talking about arden again clyde said erich is sick of listening to me always going on about arden and caroline clyde said thats why erich retired me from my job at the house when his dad died i took real good care of that house just like my own clyde and i came here when john and caroline were married caroline liked the way i did things and even after she died i kept everything just so for her as though shed be walking in any minute but come on in the kitchen i made doughnuts and the coffeepots on jenny could smell the perking coffee they sat around the white enamel table in the cheerful kitchen hungrily tina and beth munched at stillwarm powdered doughnuts and drank milk i remember when erich was that age rooney said i used to make those doughnuts for him all the time i was the only one caroline ever left him with if she went out shopping felt almost like he was my own still do i guess i didnt have arden for ten years after we wuz married but caroline had erich that first year never saw a little boy loved his mother more never wanted her out of his sight oh you do look like her you do she reached for the coffeepot and refilled jennys cup and erichs been so good to us he spent ten thousand dollars on private detectives trying to find where arden went yes jenny thought erich would do that the clock over the kitchen sink began to chime it was noon hastily jenny got up erich would be home she wanted terribly to be with him mrs toomis wed better run i do hope youll come and visit us call me rooney everybody does clyde dont want me to go to the big house anymore but i fool him i go up there a lot to make sure everythings nice and you come back here again and visit i like having company a smile made a remarkable transformation in her face for a moment the drooping sad lines disappeared and jenny knew shed been right in guessing that at one time rooney toomis had been a very pretty woman rooney insisted they take a plate of doughnuts home theyre good for an afternoon snack as she held open the door for them she started to turn up the collar of her sweater i think ill start looking for arden now she sighed once again her voice had become vague the noon sun was brilliant high in the heavens shining on the snowcovered fields as they turned the bend the house came into view the pale red of the brick glowed under the suns rays our home jenny thought she held the girls by the hand was rooney going to walk aimlessly around these acres looking for her lost child that was a very nice lady beth announced yes she was jenny agreed come on now on the double daddys probably waiting for us which daddy beth asked matteroffactly the only one just before she opened the kitchen door jenny whispered to the children lets tiptoe in and surprise daddy eyes sparkling they nodded noiselessly she turned the handle the first sound they heard was erichs voice it was coming from the dining room each angry word pitched slightly higher than its predecessor how dare you tell me that i might have caused that stain its obvious that you let the oil rag touch the wallpaper when you dusted the windowsill do you realize the entire room will have to be repapered now do you know how difficult it will be to get that pattern again how many times have i warned you about those oil rags but mr krueger elsas protest nervously loud was cut off i want you to apologize for blaming that mess on me either apologize or get out of this house and dont come back there was silence mommy beth whispered frightened sshh jenny said erich couldnt be that upset over that little smudge on the paper could he she wondered stay out of it some instinct warned theres nothing you can do as she heard elsas sullen unhappy voice say i apologize mr krueger she pulled the children outside and closed the door why is daddy mad tina asked im really not sure love but well pretend that we didnt hear him all right but we did hear him beth said seriously i know jenny agreed but it doesnt have anything to do with us now come on lets go in again this time she called erich hi before they were even in the house not pausing to allow an answer she called again is there a husband in this place sweetheart erich hurried into the kitchen his smile welcoming his entire manner relaxed ive just been asking elsa where you were im disappointed you went out i wanted to show you around myself his arms were around her his cheek still cold from the outdoors rubbed against hers jenny blessed the instinct that had kept her from visiting the farm buildings i knew youd want to give us the tour she said so we just walked across the east fields and got some fresh air you cant imagine how wonderful it is not to stop for a traffic light every few feet ill have to teach you to be sure to avoid the fields where the bulls are kept erich smiled believe me youd prefer the traffic lights he became aware of the plate she was holding whats that mrs toom gave that to mommy beth told him mrs toomis jenny corrected mrs toomis erich said his arms dropped to his sides jenny i hope youre not going to tell me you were in rooneys house she waved to us jenny explained it would have been so rude she waves to anyone who passes erich interrupted this is why you really ought to have waited for me to take you around darling rooney is a very disturbed woman and if you give her an inch shell take a stranglehold on you i finally had to lay it to clyde that he must keep her away from this house even after i retired her id come home and find her puttering in here god help her im sorry for her jenny but it got pretty rough waking up in the middle of the night and hearing her walking around the hall or even standing in my room he turned to beth come on mouse lets get that snowsuit off he lifted beth in the air and to her delight sat her on top of the refrigerator me too me too tina cried you too you too he mimicked now isnt this a good way to get your boots off he asked them just the right height isnt it mommy apprehensively jenny moved nearer to the refrigerator to make sure that one of the girls didnt lean forward too far and topple off it but she realized there was no need to worry erich quickly yanked the small overshoes off and lifted the girls down before he put them on the ground he said okay you two whats my name tina looked at jenny daddy she said her voice a question mommy said youre the only daddy beth informed him mommy said that erich put the girls down and smiled at jenny thank you mommy elsa came into the kitchen her face was flushed and set in angry defensive lines mr krueger i finish upstairs you want me to do something special now upstairs jenny asked quickly i meant to tell you i hope you didnt bother to separate the beds in the childrens room theyre on their way up for a nap i told elsa to straighten the room erich said but erich they cant sleep on those high beds the way they are jenny protested im afraid well really have to get them youth beds a thought occurred to her it was a gamble but it would be a natural request erich couldnt the girls nap in your old room that bed is quite low she studied his face waiting for his reaction even so she did not miss the sly look elsa threw at him shes enjoying this jenny thought she knows he wants to refuse erichs expression became closed as a matter of fact jenny he said his tone suddenly formal i intended to speak to you about allowing the children to use that room i thought i made myself plain about the fact that that room is not to be occupied elsa tells me she found the bed unmade this morning jenny gasped of course it had never occurred to her that tina and beth might have gotten into that bed when they were wandering around before she woke up im sorry his face softened its all right darling let the girls nap in the beds they used last night well order youth beds for them immediately jenny prepared soup for the children then took them upstairs as she pulled down the shades she said now look you two when you wake up i dont want you getting into any other beds understand but we always get into your bed at home beth said her tone injured thats different i mean any other beds in this house she kissed them gently promise i dont want daddy to get upset daddy yelled loud tina murmured her eyes closing wheres my present the cakes of soap were on the night table tina slipped hers under her pillow thank you for giving that to me mommy we didnt get into your bed mommy erich had begun slicing turkey for sandwiches deliberately jenny closed the door that shut the kitchen off from the rest of the house hi she said putting her arms around him she whispered look we had our wedding dinner with the children at least let me fix our first byourselves meal on krueger farm and you pour us some of that champagne we never got around to finishing last night his lips were on her hair last night was beautiful for me jenny was it for you it was beautiful i didnt get much done this morning all i could think of is how you look when youre asleep he made a fire in the castiron stove and they sipped the champagne and ate the sandwiches curled up together on the couch in front of it you know jenny said walking around today made me realize the sense of continuity this farm has i dont know my roots i dont know if my people lived in the city or country i dont know if my birth mother liked to sew or paint or if she could carry a tune its so wonderful that you know everything about your people just looking at the burial plot made me appreciate that you went to the burial plot erich asked quietly yes do you mind then you saw carolines grave yes i did and you probably wondered why she and my father arent together the way the others are i was surprised it isnt any mystery caroline had those norwegian pines planted at that time she told my father she wanted to be buried at the south end of the graveyard where the pines would shelter her he never really approved but he respected her wishes before he died he told me hed always expected to be placed in the grave next to his parents somehow i felt that was the right thing to do for both of them caroline always wanted more freedom than my father would give her anyway i think that afterward he regretted the way he ridiculed her art until she threw out her sketch pad what difference would it have made if shed painted instead of making quilts he was wrong wrong he paused staring into the fire jenny felt that erich seemed to be unaware of her presence but so was she he whispered with a tremor of anxiety jenny realized that for the first time erich was hinting that the relationship between his mother and father had been troubled jenny settled into a daily routine that she found immensely satisfying each day she realized how much she had missed by being away from the children so much she learned that beth the practical quiet child had a definite musical talent and could pick out simple tunes on the spinet in the small parlor after hearing them played only a few times tinas whiny streak vanished as she blossomed in the new atmosphere she who had always cried so easily became positively sunnydispositioned and showed signs of a natural sense of humor erich usually left for the studio by dawn and never returned until noon jenny and the girls had breakfast around eight and at ten oclock when the sun was becoming stronger bundled up in snowsuits and went for a walk the walks soon assumed a pattern first the chicken house where joe taught the girls to collect the freshlaid eggs joe had decided that jennys presence had saved his job after barons accident i bet if mr krueger wasnt so happy about your being here hed have fired me my maw says hes not a forgiving man mrs krueger i really didnt have a thing to do with it jenny protested dr garrett says im taking real good care of barons leg when the weather gets warmer and he can exercise a little it will be fine and mrs krueger i tell you now i check that stable door ten times every day jenny knew what he meant unconsciously she had begun to check so many little things a second time things she never would have dreamed of noticing before erich was more than tidy he was a perfectionist she quickly learned to tell by a certain tenseness in his face and body if something had upset hima closet door left open a glass standing in the sink the mornings erich didnt go to the cabin he worked in the farm office next to the stable with clyde toomis the farm manager clyde a stocky man of about sixty with a leathery wrinkled face and thick yellowwhite hair had a matteroffact manner that approached brusqueness when he introduced jenny to him erich said clyde really runs the farm sometimes i think im just window dressing around here well youre certainly not window dressing in front of an easel she laughed but was surprised that clyde did not make even a perfunctory effort to contradict erich think youll like it here clyde asked her i do like it here she smiled its quite a change for a city person clyde said abruptly hope it isnt too much for you it isnt funny business clyde said the country girls hanker after the city the city girls claim they love the country she thought she heard a note of bitterness in his voice and wondered if he was thinking about his own daughter she decided he was when he added my wifes all excited about having you and the children here if she starts dropping in on you just let me know rooney dont mean to bother people but sometimes she kind of forgets herself it seemed to jenny there was a defensive tone in his voice when he spoke of rooney i enjoyed visiting with her she said sincerely the brusque manner softened thats good to hear and shes looking up patterns to make jumpers or some such things for your girls is that all right its fine when they left the office erich said jenny jenny dont encourage rooney i promise i wont let it get out of hand erich shes just lonely every afternoon after lunch while the children napped she and erich put on crosscountry skis and explored the farm elsa was willing to mind the children as they slept in fact it was she who suggested the arrangement it occurred to jenny that elsa was trying to make up for accusing erich of damaging the diningroom wall and yet she wondered if it werent possible that he had caused the stain often when he came in for lunch his hands would still have paint or charcoal smudges if he noticed anything out of order a curtain not centered on the rod bricabrac not exactly in place he would automatically adjust it several times jenny stopped him before he touched something with paintspattered fingers the paper in the dining room was replaced when the paperhanger and his assistant came in they were incredulous you mean to say that he bought eight double rolls at these prices and hes replacing exactly what he has my husband knows what he wants when they were finished the room looked exactly the same except that the smudge was gone during the evenings she and erich liked to settle in the library reading listening to music talking he asked her about the faint scar at her hairline an automobile accident when i was sixteen someone jumped the divider and plowed into us you must have been frightened darling i dont remember a thing about it jenny laughed id just leaned my head back and fallen asleep the next thing i was aware of was being in the hospital three days later i had a pretty bad concussionenough to give me amnesia for those days nana was frantic she was sure id be braindamaged or something i did have headaches for a while and even did some sleepwalking around final exam time stress brought it on according to the doctor but gradually it stopped at first hesitantly then the words tumbling out erich talked about his mothers accident caroline and i had just gone into the dairy barn to see the new calf it was being weaned and caroline held the nursing bottle to its lips the stock tankthats that thing that looks like a bathtub in the calving penwas full of water it was muddy underfoot and caroline slipped she tried to grab something to keep from falling the something was the lamp cord she fell into the tank pulling the lamp with her that fool of a workman joes uncle incidentally was rewiring the barn and hed left the lamp slung over a nail on the wall in a minute it was all over i hadnt realized you were with her i dont like to talk about it luke garrett marks father was here he tried to revive her but it was hopeless and i stood there holding the hockey stick shed just given me for my birthday jenny was sitting on the hassock at the foot of erichs leather easy chair she raised his hands to her lips leaning down he lifted her up and held her tightly against him for a long time i hated the sight of that hockey stick then i started to think of it as her last present to me he kissed her eyelids dont look so sad jenny having you makes up for everything please jenny promise me she knew what he wanted to hear with a wrench of tenderness she whispered ill never leave you one morning when she was walking with tina and beth jenny spotted rooney leaning over the picket fence at the southern end of the graveyard she seemed to be looking down at carolines grave i was just thinking of all the nice times i had when caroline and i were young and erich was little and then when arden was born caroline drew a picture of arden once it was so pretty i dont know what happened to it it disappeared right out of my room clyde says i was probably carrying it around like i used to do sometimes why dont you come visit me again jenny had braced herself for the question its just weve been so busy settling beth tina arent you going to say hello to mrs toomis beth said hello shyly tina ran forward and raised her face for a kiss rooney bent down and smoothed tinas hair from her forehead she reminds me of arden this one always jumping from one place to the next erich probably told you to keep away from me well i cant say i blame him i guess i am an awful nuisance sometimes but i found the pattern i was looking for can i make the jumpers for the girls id like that jenny said deciding that erich would have to get used to the idea that she would become friendly with rooney there was something infinitely appealing about the woman rooney turned so that once again she was gazing into the graveyard do you get lonesome here yet she asked no jenny said honestly its different of course i was used to a busy job and talking to people all day and the phones ringing and friends popping into my apartment some of that i miss i suppose but mostly im just so glad to be here so was caroline rooney said so happy for a while and then it changed she stared down at the simple headstone on the other side of the fence there were snow clouds in the air and the pines threw restless shadows across the pale pink granite oh indeed it changed for caroline she whispered and after she was gone it started right then to change for us all youre trying to get rid of me erich protested i dont want to go sure im trying to get rid of you jenny agreed oh erich this is perfectly beautiful she held up a threebyfourfoot oil to examine it more closely youve caught the haze that comes around the trees just before they start to bud and that dark spot circling the ice in the river that shows the ice is about to break up that theres moving water below doesnt it youve got a good eye darling thats right well dont forget i was a fine arts major changing seasons is a lovely title the change is so subtle here erich draped an arm across her shoulders and studied the painting with her remember anything you want us to keep i wont exhibit no thats foolish this is the time to keep building your reputation i wont mind at all eventually being known as the wife of the most prestigious artist in america theyll point me out and say see isnt she lucky and hes gorgeous too erich pulled her hair is that what theyll say uhhuh and theyll be right i could just as easily send word that i cant make the show erich dont do it theyve already planned a reception for you i just wish i could go but i cant leave the kids yet and dragging them with us wont work next time he began to stack the canvases promise youll miss me jenny ill miss you lots its going to be a lonesome four days unconsciously jenny sighed in nearly three weeks shed spoken only to a handful of people clyde joe elsa rooney and mark elsa was taciturn almost to the point of absolute silence rooney clyde and joe were hardly companions shed only chatted with mark briefly once since that first evening even though she knew from joe that hed checked on baron at least half a dozen times shed been on the farm a week before she realized that the telephone never rang havent they heard about the reach out and touch someone campaign around here she joked the calls all go through the office erich explained i only have them come directly to the house if im expecting a particular one otherwise whoever is in the office will buzz me but suppose no ones in the office then the phonemate will take messages but erich why darling if i have one quirk its that i despise the intrusion of a telephone ringing constantly of course whenever im away clyde will set the line to ring through to the house at night so i can call you jenny wanted to protest then decided against it later on when she had friends in the community it would be time enough to coax erich into normal phone service he finished separating the canvases jenny i was thinking its about time i showed you off a bit would you like to go to church next sunday i swear you can read my mind she laughed i was just thinking that id like to meet some of your friends im better at donating money than attending services jen how about you i never missed sunday mass growing up then after kev and i were married i got careless but as nana always said the apple doesnt fall far from the tree ill probably be back at mass regularly one of these days they attended zion lutheran the following sunday the church was old and not very large actually almost chapelsized the delicate stainedglass windows diffused the winter light so that it shone blue and green and gold and red on the sanctuary she could read the names on some of the windows donated by erich and gretchen krueger donated by erich and olga krueger the window over the alter an adoration of the magi scene was particularly beautiful she gasped at the inscription in loving memory of caroline bonardi krueger donated by erich krueger she tugged at his arm when did you give that window last year when the sanctuary was renovated tina and beth sat between them sedately conscious of their new blue coats and bonnets people looked over at the children throughout the service she knew erich was aware of the glances too he had a contented smile on his face and during the sermon slipped his hand into hers midway through the sermon he whispered youre beautiful jenny everybody is looking at you and the girls after the service he introduced her to pastor barstrom a slight man in his late sixties with a gentle face were happy to have you with us jenny he said warmly he looked down at the girls now whos beth and whos tina you know their names jenny commented pleased indeed i do erich told me all about you when he stopped by the parsonage i hope you realize what a very generous husband you have thanks to him our new senior citizen center will be very comfortable and wellequipped ive known erich since he was a boy and were all very happy for him now im mighty happy too jenny smiled theres a meeting of the women in the parish thursday night perhaps youd like to join them we want to get to know you id love to jenny agreed darling wed better start erich said there are others who want to visit with the pastor of course as she extended her hand the pastor said it certainly must have been very difficult for you to be widowed so young with such little babies jenny both you and erich are surely deserving of much good fortune and many blessings now erich propelled her forward before she could do more than gasp in the car she exclaimed erich surely you didnt tell pastor barstrom that i was widowed did you erich steered the car from the curb jenny granite place isnt new york its a small town in the midwest people around here were shocked to hear i was getting married a month after i met you at least a young widow is a sympathetic image a new york divorcée says something quite different in this community and i never exactly said you were a widow i told pastor barstrom you had lost your husband he surmised the rest so you didnt lie but in effect ive lied for you by not correcting him jenny said erich dont you understand the kind of position that places me in no i dont dear and i wont have people around here wondering if i had my head turned by a sophisticated new yorker taking advantage of a hayseed erich had a mortal fear of looking ridiculous so much so that he would lie to his clergyman to avoid the possibility erich i will have to tell pastor barstrom the truth when i go to the meeting thursday night ill be gone thursday i know thats why i think it would be pleasant to be there id like to meet the people around here are you planning to leave the children alone of course not surely there are babysitters surely you dont intend to leave the children with just anyone pastor barstrom could recommend jenny please wait dont start getting involved in activities and dont tell pastor barstrom youre a divorcée knowing him hell never bring up the subject again unless you introduce it but why do you object to my going erich took his eyes from the road and looked at her because i love you so much im not ready to share you with other people jenny i wont share you with anyone jenny erich was leaving for atlanta on february on the twentyfirst he told jenny he had an errand to do and would be late for lunch it was nearly onethirty when he returned come over to the stable he invited ive got a surprise for you grabbing a jacket she ran out with him mark garrett was waiting there smiling broadly meet the new tenants he said two shetland ponies stood side by side in the stalls nearest the door their manes and tails were full and lustrous their copper bodies gleaming my present to my new daughters erich said proudly i thought wed call them mouse and tinker bell then the krueger girls will never forget their pet names he hurried her to the next stall and this is your gift speechless jenny stared at a bay morgan mare who returned her gaze amiably shes a treasure erich exulted four years old impeccable breeding gentle shes already won half a dozen ribbons do you like her jenny reached a hand to pat the mares head and was thrilled that the animal did not draw back whats her name the breeder called her fire maid claims she has fire and heart as well as heritage of course you can call her anything you want fire and heart jenny whispered thats a lovely combination erich im so delighted he looked pleased i dont want you riding yet the fields are still too icy but if you and the girls start making friends with the horses and visiting them every day by next month you can get started on lessons now if you dont mind how about lunch impulsively jenny turned to mark you cant have had lunch either wont you join us its just cold meat and a salad she caught erichs frown but was relieved to see it disappear as fast as it came please do mark he urged over lunch jenny realized that she was constantly thinking about fire maid finally erich said darling you have the most happychild smile on your face is it me or the bay mare erich i have to say im so darn delighted about that horse i havent even begun to think about thanking you have you ever had a pet jenny mark asked there was something sturdy and easygoing about mark that made her feel instantly at home in his presence i almost had a pet she laughed one of our neighbors in new york had a miniature poodle when puppies were born i used to stop every afternoon on my way home from school to help take care of them i was about eleven or twelve but we werent allowed to have pets in our apartment so you always felt cheated mark guessed i certainly felt as though i missed something growing up they finished coffee and mark pushed back his chair jenny thank you this has been very pleasant i wish youd come to dinner when erich gets back from atlanta bring a date thats a good idea erich agreed and she thought he sounded as though he meant it how about emily mark shes always had an eye for you she always had an eye for you mark corrected but yes i will ask her before erich left he held her tightly ill miss you so jenny be sure to lock the doors at night i will well be fine the roads are icy if you want something from the store let joe drive you erich im a big girl she protested dont worry about me i cant help it ill call you tonight darling that night jenny felt a guilty sense of freedom as she lay propped up in bed reading the house was still except for the occasional hum of the furnace as it went off and on from across the hallway she could hear tina occasionally talking in her sleep she smiled realizing that tina never woke up crying anymore erich should have gotten to atlanta by now hed be calling soon she glanced around the room the closet door was half open and shed left her robe tossed over the slipper chair erich would have objected of course but tonight she didnt have to worry she returned to her book an hour later the telephone rang she reached for the receiver eagerly hello darling she said what a nice way to be greeted jen it was kevin kevin jenny pulled herself up from the pillows so suddenly that her book slid from the bed onto the floor where are you in minneapolis the guthrie theater im auditioning jenny felt acute uneasiness kevin thats wonderful she tried to sound convincing well see what happens hows it going with you jen very very well and the kids theyre simply fine im coming down to see them you gonna be home tomorrow his words were slurred his tone aggressive kevin no i want to see my kids jen wheres krueger something warned jenny not to admit that erich would be gone for four days hes out at the moment i thought he was calling now give me directions for getting to your place ill borrow a car kevin you cant do that erich would be furious you have no right here i have every right to see my children that adoption isnt final yet i can stop it by snapping my fingers i want to be sure tina and beth are happy i want to be sure youre happy jen maybe we both made a mistake maybe we should talk about it now how do i get to your place youre not coming jen granite place is on the map and i guess everybody there knows where mr high and mighty lives jenny felt her palms become sticky as she gripped the phone she could imagine the gossip in town if kevin showed up asking directions to krueger farm it would be just like him to say hed been married to her she remembered the look in erichs face when hed seen kevin in the foyer of the apartment on their wedding day kev she pleaded dont come here youll spoil everything for us the girls and i are very happy ive always been pretty decent to you have i ever once turned you down when you asked me for money even when i hardly had my own rent that should count for something i know you did jen now his voice took on the intimate coaxing tone she knew so well as a matter of fact im a little short right now and youre loaded how about giving me the rest of the furniture money jenny felt relief flood her he was just looking for money that would make it a lot easier where do you want me to send it ill come down for it he was obviously determined to see her there was no way she could allow him to come to this house even to this town she shuddered thinking how painstakingly erich had been teaching the girls to say beth krueger tina krueger there was a small restaurant in the shopping center twenty miles away it was the only place she could think of to suggest quickly she gave kevin directions and agreed to meet him at one oclock the next day after he hung up she leaned back on the pillows the relaxed pleasure of the evening was gone now she dreaded erichs call should she tell him that she was going to see kevin when erichs call came she still was not sure what to do erich sounded tense i miss you im sorry i came darling did the girls ask for me tonight she still hesitated to tell him about kevin of course they did and beth is starting to call her dolls critters erich laughed theyll end up talking like joe yet i should let you go to sleep she had to tell him erich yes darling she paused suddenly remembering erichs astonishment when she admitted giving kevin half the furniture money his suggestion that maybe she wanted him to have plane fare to minnesota she couldnt tell him about meeting kevin i i love you so much erich i wish you were here right now oh darling so do i good night she could not sleep the moonlight filtered into the room reflecting against the crystal bowl jenny thought that the bowl seemed almost urnshaped as it stood silhouetted on the dresser could ashes be pinescented she wondered what a crazy horrible thought she chided herself restlessly caroline was buried in the family cemetery even so jenny suddenly felt uneasy enough to want to go in and check the girls they were deeply asleep beth had her cheek pillowed on her hand tina was fetalpositioned the satin binding of the blanket hugged against her face jenny kissed them softly they looked so content she thought about how happy they were to have her home with them all day about their ecstasy when erich had shown them the ponies silently she vowed that kevin was not going to spoil this new life for them the keys to the cadillac were in the farm office but erich kept spare keys to all the buildings and machines in the library it would make sense that the extra cadillac keys were there as well her guess was right slipping them in the pocket of her slacks she fed the girls an early lunch and settled them for a nap elsa i have an errand to do ill be back by two oclock elsa nodded was elsa naturally this taciturn she didnt think so sometimes when shed come in after skiing with erich tina and beth would be already awake and shed hear elsa chatting with them her swedish accent more pronounced when she spoke quickly but when jenny or erich was around she was silent the country roads had a few patches of ice but the highway was completely clear jenny realized how good it felt to drive again she smiled to herself remembering the weekend jaunts she and nana took in her secondhand beetle but after she and kev were married shed had to sell it the upkeep had become too expensive now she would ask erich to pick up a small car for her it was twenty of one when she got to the restaurant surprisingly kevin was already there a nearly empty carafe of wine in front of him she slid into the booth and looked across the table hello kev incredible that in less than a month he could seem older less buoyant his eyes were puffy was kevin drinking too much she wondered he reached for her hand jenny ive missed you ive missed the kids she disengaged her fingers tell me about the guthrie im pretty sure ive got the job id better have it broadway is tight as a drum and ill be that much nearer you and the kids out here jen lets try again kev youre crazy no im not youre beautiful jenny i like that outfit that jacket must have cost a fortune i guess it was expensive youre classy jen i always knew it but didnt think about it i always believed youd be there for me again he covered her hand with his are you happy jen yes i am look erich would be terribly upset about my seeing you i have to tell you you didnt make much of an impression on him the last time you met and he didnt make much of an impression on me when he stuck a piece of paper in front of me and told me youd sue me for nonsupport and attach every nickle i ever made if i didnt sign erich said that erich said that come on jen that was a lousy trick i was up for a part in the new hal prince musical that would have really queered me too bad i didnt know id already been eliminated believe me there wouldnt have been any adoption papers signed it isnt that simple jenny said i know erich gave you two thousand dollars that was just a loan she was torn between pity for kevin and the nagging certainty that he would always use the girls as a wedge for staying in her life she opened her pocketbook kev i must get back heres the three hundred dollars but after today please dont contact me dont try to see the children if you do youll make trouble for them for you for me he took the money flipped his fingers idly through the bills then put them in his wallet jen you want to know something i have a bad feeling about you and the kids its something i cant explain but i do jenny got up in an instant kevin was beside her his arms were pulling her to him i still love you jenny his kiss was harsh and demanding she could not pull away without creating a scene it was fully half a minute before she felt his arms loosen and she could step back leave us alone she whispered i beg you i warn you kevin leave us alone she almost bumped into the waitress who was standing behind her order pad in hand the two women at the window table were staring at them as jenny fled from the restaurant she realized why one of the women seemed familiar she had sat across the aisle from them at church on sunday morning after that first evening erich did not call again jenny tried to rationalize her uneasiness erich had a thing about telephones but he had planned to call every night should she try to reach him at the hotel a halfdozen times she put her hand on the phone and then removed it did kevin get hired by the guthrie if he did hed be trying the same thing here that hed done at the apartment dropping in when he was broke or feeling sentimental erich would never stand for it and it was no good for the children why didnt erich phone he was due home on the twentyeighth joe was picking him up at the airport should she ride up to minneapolis with joe no shed wait at the farm and have a good dinner ready she missed him she hadnt realized how totally she and the girls had embraced their new life in these past weeks if it werent for the miserable feeling of guilt over meeting kevin jenny knew she wouldnt be troubled that erich hadnt phoned kevin was the spoiler suppose when the three hundred dollars was gone he came back it would be twice as bad if erich learned shed met him and said nothing she flew into erichs arms when he opened the door he held her against him in the short distance from the car to the porch the chill of the evening had caught in his coat and his lips were cool they warmed quickly as he kissed her with a halfsob she thought it will be all right ive missed you so they said it together he hugged the girls asked them if theyd been good and at their enthusiastic response presented them with brightly wrapped packages he smiled indulgently at their squeals of delight over their new dolls thank you very very much beth said solemnly thank you daddy he corrected thats what i mean beth said her tone puzzled what did you bring mommy tina asked he smiled at jenny has mommy been a good girl they agreed that she had youre sure mommy why was it that the most ordinary teasing seemed doubleedged when you have something to hide jen thought of nana shaking her head about an acquaintance that ones bad news shed lie even when the truth would serve her better was that what shed done ive been a good girl she tried to make her voice sound amused casual jenny youre blushing erich shook his head she knew her smile was forced wheres my present he reached into his suitcase since you like royal doulton figurines i thought id try to find another one for you in atlanta this one leaped out at me its called the cup of tea she opened the box the figurine was of an old woman sitting in a rocking chair a cup of tea in her hand a look of contentment on her face it even looks like nana she sighed his eyes were tender as he watched her examine the figurine her eyes bright with tears she smiled at him and kevin would spoil this for me she thought she had made a fire in the stove a carafe of wine and wedge of cheese were on the table linking her fingers in his she brought him over to the couch smiling she poured wine into his glass and handed it to him welcome home she sat beside him turning so that her knee touched his she was wearing a green rufflenecked yves st laurent silk blouse and tweed slacks in a brownandgreen weave she knew it was one of erichs favorite outfits her hair was growing longer and fell loosely on her shoulders except when it was bitterly cold she liked to go bareheaded and the winter sun had bleached gold highlights in her dark hair erich studied her his face inscrutable youre a beautiful woman jen arent you quite dressed up it isnt every night my husband comes home after being away four days if i hadnt come home tonight it would have been a waste getting all dolled up i hope if you hadnt come home tonight id have worn this for you tomorrow jenny decided to change the subject how did it go in atlanta it was miserable the gallery people spent most of their time trying to persuade me to sell memory of caroline they had a couple of big offers for it and could smell the commission you ran into the same thing in new york maybe youll have to stop showing that painting and maybe i choose to show it because its still my best work erich said quietly was there an implied criticism of her suggestion in his voice why dont i finish putting dinner together as she got up jenny leaned over and kissed him hey she whispered i love you while she was tossing the salad and stirring a hollandaise sauce he called beth and tina over a few minutes later he had both girls on his lap and was animatedly telling them the story of the peachtree hotel in atlanta where the elevators were glass and went up outside the building just like a magic carpet someday hed take them there mommy too tina asked jenny turned smiling but the smile ended when erich said if mommy wants to come with us shed cooked a rib roast he ate well but his fingers drummed restlessly on the table and no matter what she said he answered in monosyllables finally jenny gave up and started talking only to the children did you tell daddy that you sat on the ponies backs beth put down her fork and looked at erich it was fun i said giddyap but mouse didnt go i said giddyap too tina chimed in where were the ponies erich asked right in the stalls jenny said hastily and joe lifted them up for just a minute joe takes too much on himself erich interrupted i want to be there when the girls are put on the ponies i want to be sure hes watching them carefully how do i know hes not as careless as that fool of an uncle was erich that was so long ago it doesnt seem long ago when i bump into that drunken sot and joe tells me hes back in town again was that the reason erich was so upset beth tina if youre finished you can excuse yourselves and play with your new dolls when the children were out of earshot she said is joes uncle the problem erich or is it something else he reached across the table in that familiar gesture of entwining their fingers its that its the fact that i think joe has been tootling around in the car again it has at least forty extra miles on it of course he denies driving it but he used it once in the fall without permission he didnt drive you anywhere did he she clenched her fist no she had to say something about kevin she wouldnt have erich believe that joe had deceived him erich i he interrupted her and its the damn art galleries for four days i had to keep telling that fool in atlanta that memory of caroline was not for sale i think its still my best work and i want to exhibit it but his voice stopped when he spoke again it was calmer ill be doing more painting jen you dont mind do you it means ill have to hole up in the cabin for three or four days at a stretch but its necessary dismayed jenny thought how these last days had dragged she tried to make her voice sound casual if its necessary of course when she came back to the library from putting the girls to bed erichs eyes were filled with tears erich what is it hastily he brushed his eyes with the back of his hand forgive me jenny its just i was so depressed i missed you so much and mothers anniversary is next week you cant know how hard a time that always is for me every year its still as though its just happened when joe told me his uncle is around it was like a punch in the stomach i felt so lousy then the car turned in from the road and the house was lighted i was so afraid it would be dark and empty and i opened the door and you were there so beautiful so glad to see me i was so afraid that maybe while i was away somehow id lost you jenny slipped to her knees she smoothed the hair back from his forehead glad to see you you cant guess his lips silenced her when they went up to bed jenny reached for one of her new nightgowns then stopped reluctantly she opened the dresser drawer that held the aqua gown the bosom of the gown felt too small well maybe thats one solution she thought ill outgrow the damn thing later just before she fell asleep she realized what it was that had been teasing her subconscious the only times erich made love to her was when she was wearing this gown she heard erich walking around the bedroom before dawn are you going to the cabin she murmured trying to pull herself from sleep yes darling his whisper was barely audible will you be back for lunch as she started to wake up she remembered that he had talked about staying at the cabin im not sure the door closed behind him she and the girls took their usual walk after breakfast the ponies had replaced the chickens as first attraction for beth and tina they ran ahead of her now hold it you two she called make sure baron is locked up joe was already in the stable good morning mrs krueger his round face broke into a smile the soft sandy hair spilled out from under his cap hello girls the ponies were immaculate their thick manes and tails were brushed and shining just groomed them for you joe said did you bring some sugar with you he held the girls up to feed the sugar now how about sitting on their backs for a couple of minutes joe im afraid not jenny said mr krueger didnt approve of putting the girls on the ponies i want to sit on tinker bells back tina said daddy will let us beth said positively mommy youre mean beth mean mommy tina said her lip trembled dont cry tina beth said she looked up at jenny mommy please joe was looking at her too well jenny wavered then thought of erichs face when he said that joe took too much on himself she could not have erich accuse her of deliberately ignoring his wishes tomorrow she said positively ill talk to daddy now lets go see the chickens i want to ride my pony tina cried her small hand slapped jennys leg youre a bad mommy jenny reached down in a reflex action she swatted tinas bottom and youre a very fresh little girl tina ran from the barn crying beth was right behind her jenny hurried after the girls they were holding hands walking toward the barn as she caught up with them she heard beth say soothingly dont be sad tina well tell daddy on mommy joe was at her side mrs krueger yes joe jenny turned her face from him she did not want him to see the tears that were swimming in her eyes in her bones she knew that when they asked him erich would give permission to the girls to sit on the ponies in the stable mrs krueger i was wondering we have a new puppy at our place were just down the road about half a mile maybe the girls would like to see randy it might take their minds off the ponies joe that would be nice jenny caught up with the children she crouched in front of tina im sorry i spanked you tinker bell i want to ride fire maid just as much as you want to ride your pony but we have to wait till daddy says okay now joe wants to take us to see his puppy want to go they walked together joe pointing out the first signs of the approaching spring see how the snow is going in a couple of weeks the ground will be real muddy thats because all the frost will be coming out of it then the grass starts to grow your dad wants me to build a ring for you to ride in joes mother was home his father had died five years ago she was a heavyset woman in her late fifties with a practical nononsense approach she invited them in the small house was comfortably shabby souvenir knickknacks covered the tables the walls were strewn with family pictures indiscriminately hung nice to meet you mrs krueger my joe talks about you all the time no wonder he says youre pretty you sure are and oh my land how you look like caroline im maude ekers you call me maude wheres joes dog tina asked come on in the kitchen maude told them they followed her eagerly the puppy looked to be a combination of german shepherd and retriever awkwardly it struggled up on ungainly legs we found it on the road joe explained somebody must have pushed it out of a car if i hadnt come along it probably would have frozen to death maude shook her head hes always bringing home stray animals my joe has the kindest heart i ever come across never was one for schoolwork but let me tell you hes magic with animals you shoulda seen his last dog he was a beauty smart as a whip too what happened to him jenny asked we dont know we tried to keep him fenced in but sometimes hed get away he used to want to trail after joe to your farm mr krueger didnt like it i dont blame mr krueger joe said hastily he had a purebred bitch and he didnt want tarpy to get near her but one day tarpy did follow me and was on juna mr krueger was real mad wheres juna now jenny asked mr krueger got rid of her said she wouldnt be any use if she carried a litter from a mongrel what happened to tarpy we dont know maude said he got out again one day and never came back ive got my suspicions she hinted darkly maw joe said hastily erich krueger threatened to shoot that dog she continued simply if tarpy ruined his expensive bitch i dont much blame him for getting sore but least he coulda told you joe hunted high and low for that dog she told jenny i thought hed get sick tina and beth squatted on the floor beside randy tinas face was rapturous mommy can we have a dog please well ask daddy she promised the children played with the puppy while she had coffee with maude the woman immediately began interrogating her how did she like the krueger home pretty fancy wasnt it must be tough to come out from new york city to a farm jenny replied that she was sure shed be happy caroline said that too maude hinted darkly but the krueger men arent very sociable kind of makes it hard on their wives everybody around here thought the world of caroline and they respected john krueger same as they do erich but the kruegers arent warm even with their own and theyre not forgiving people when they get angry they stay angry jenny knew maude was referring to her brothers role in carolines accident quickly she finished her coffee wed better get back the kitchen door was pushed open just as she stood up well whos this the voice was raspy as though the vocal cords had been strained the man was in his midfifties his eyes were bloodshot and faded with the bleary expression of the heavy drinker he was painfully thin so that the waist of his pants settled somewhere around his hips he stared at jenny then his eyes narrowed thoughtfully you gotta be the new mrs krueger ive been hearing about yes i am im josh brothers joes uncle the electrician who had been responsible for the accident jenny sensed immediately that erich would be furious if he heard about this meeting i can see why erich picked you josh said heavily he turned to his sister swear it was caroline wouldnt you maude without waiting for an answer he asked jenny heard all about the accident i suppose yes i did the krueger version not mine clearly josh brothers was about to tell an oftenrepeated story jenny got the smell of whiskey from his breath his voice took on a reciting quality in spite of the fact they were divorcing john was crazy about caroline divorcing jenny interrupted erichs father and mother divorcing the bleary eyes became crafty oh erich didnt tell you that he likes to pretend it didnt happen lots of gossip here let me tell you when caroline didnt even try to get custody of her only child anyhow the day of the accident i was working in the dairy barn and caroline and erich came in she was leaving for good that afternoon it was his birthday and he was holding his new hockey stick and crying his eyes out she waved me away thats why i hung the lamp over the nail i heard caroline say just like this little calf has to be weaned away from its mother then i pulled the door closed behind me so they could say goodbye to each other and a minute later erich began screaming luke garrett pounded on her chest and did that mouthtomouth breathing but we all knew it was no good when she slipped and fell into the stock tank she grabbed the cord and pulled the lamp in with her that voltage went right through her she never had no chance josh keep quiet maude said sharply jenny stared at josh why had erich never told her that his parents were divorcing that caroline was leaving him and his father and to have witnessed that ghastly accident no wonder erich was so terribly insecure now so afraid of losing her deep in thought she collected the girls and murmured goodbyes as they walked back home joe spoke timidly to jenny mr krueger wouldnt be pleased to hear my mom talked so much and that you met my uncle im not going to discuss it joe i promise she reassured him the country road back to krueger farm was peaceful in the late morning beth and tina ran ahead of them happily scooping up loose snow jenny felt depressed and frightened she thought of the countless times erich had talked about caroline never once had he even hinted about the fact that she had been planning to leave him if only i had a friend here jenny thought someone i could talk to she remembered how she and nana had been able to talk through any problem that came up in their lives how she and fran would have coffee after the girls were in bed and exchange confidences mrs krueger joe said softly you look as though you feel real bad i hope my uncle didnt upset you i know mom talks kind of mean about the kruegers but please dont take offense i wont jenny promised but joe will you please do one thing for me anything for god sake when mr krueger isnt around call me jenny im beginning to forget my own name around here i call you jenny whenever i think about you terrific jenny laughed feeling better then glanced at joe the open worship on his face was unmistakable oh dear god she thought if he ever looks at me like that in front of erich therell be hell to pay as they neared the big house jenny thought she saw someone watching them from the window of the farm office erich often stopped there on his way back from the cabin she hurried the girls into the house and began preparing grilled cheese sandwiches and hot cocoa tina and beth perched at the table expectantly watching the toaster oven as the bubbling smell of melting cheese filled the kitchen what could have made caroline so desperately unhappy that she would leave erich how much resentment was mixed in with erichs love for her jenny tried to visualize any circumstance under which shed leave beth and tina there was none the children were tired from the long walk and fell asleep as soon as she put them in for their nap she watched as their eyes drooped and closed she was reluctant to leave the room she sat on the window seat for a moment realizing she felt lightheaded why finally she went downstairs pulled on a jacket and walked over to the office clyde was working at the big desk trying to sound casual she remarked erich hasnt come in yet for lunch i thought he might have been delayed over here clyde looked puzzled he just stopped in for a couple of minutes on his way back from getting supplies he told me you knew hes planning to stay up at the cabin and paint wordlessly jenny turned to leave then her eye spotted the incoming mail basket oh clyde if i get any mail while erich is at the cabin will you be sure that someone brings it over to me sure will usually i just give anything for you to erich anything for you in the month shed been here even though shed written to fran and mr hartley she hadnt received a single piece of mail im afraid he forgot about it she could hear the strain in her voice how much has come in a letter last week a couple of postcards i dont know i see jenny looked at the telephone how about phone calls someone from church phoned last week about a meeting and the week before you got a call from new york you mean erich didnt give you those messages he was so concerned with getting ready for the trip jenny murmured thanks clyde slowly she started back to the house the sky was overcast now snow was beginning to fall in stinging slapping gusts the ground that had begun to thaw had hardened again the temperature was dropping swiftly i wont share you jenny erich had meant that literally who had phoned from new york kevin to say he was coming to minnesota if so why didnt erich warn her who had written mr hartley fran i cant let this happen jenny thought ive got to do something jenny mark garrett was hurrying from the barn with his long strides he covered the distance between them in seconds his sandy hair was rumpled he was smiling but his eyes were serious havent had a chance to say hello for a while hows everything how much did he suspect could she discuss erich with him no that wouldnt be fair to erich but there was one thing she could do she tried to make her smile seem natural im fine she replied and youre just the person i wanted to see remember we talked about having you and your friendis it emilyfor dinner yes lets make it march eighth thats erichs birthday i want to have a little party for him mark frowned jenny i have to warn you erich still finds his birthday a pretty rough day i know jenny said she looked up at mark aware of his tallness mark that was twentyfive years ago isnt it about time that erich got over losing his mother mark seemed to be choosing his words go easy jenny he suggested it takes time to wean someone like erich off imprinted reactions he smiled but i must say it shouldnt take him very long to start to appreciate what he has now then you will come definitely and emilys been dying to meet you jenny laughed wistfully ive been dying to meet some people too she said goodbye and went into the house elsa was just ready to leave the girls are still asleep tomorrow i can shop on my way in i have the list list yes when you were out with the girls this morning mr krueger came in he said i should do the shopping from now on thats nonsense jenny protested i can go or joe can take me mr krueger said he was taking the keys to the car i see thank you elsa jenny would not let the woman see the dismay she felt but when the door closed behind elsa she realized she was trembling had erich taken the keys to make sure joe didnt use the car or was it possible he guessed that she had used it nervously she glanced around the kitchen in the apartment whenever shed been upset shed calmed herself by tackling some big cleaning job that needed to be done but this house was immaculate she stared at the canisters on the counter space they took up so much room and were so seldom used every room here was formal cold overcrowded it was her home surely erich would be pleased if she put her own stamp on this place she made room for the canisters on a pantry shelf the round oak table and chairs were exactly centered in the middle of the room placed under the window on the south wall theyd be infinitely more convenient to the buffet bar and at meals it would be pleasant to look out at the far fields not caring if the table legs scuffed the floor jenny dragged it over the hook rug that had been in the girls bedroom had been taken up to the attic she decided that placing it near the castiron stove and grouping the couch its matching chair and a slipper chair from the library on it would create a pleasant den area in the kitchen fired now with nervous energy she went into the parlor swept some of the bricabrac into her arms and carried it to a cupboard tugging and straining she managed to pull down the lace curtains that blocked sunlight and view from the parlor and the dining room the couch in the parlor was almost too heavy to push somehow she managed to reverse it with the mahogany trestle table when she was finished the room seemed airier more inviting she went through the rest of the downstairs rooms making mental notes a little at a time she promised herself she folded the curtains neatly and carried them up to the attic the braided rug was there if she couldnt manage to bring that down by herself shed call joe she yanked at the rug she wanted realized there was no way she could manage it alone and with idle curiosity glanced at the other pieces in the room a small blue leather vanity case with the initials cbk caught her eye she pulled it out to examine it was it unlocked hesitating for only an instant she deflected one then the other of the catches the lid swung up toilet articles were set in a traylike holder creams and makeup and pinescented soap a leatherbound daily reminder notebook was under the tray the date on the cover was twentyfive years old jenny opened the book and flipped through the pages january am teacher conference erich january dinner luke garrett the meiers the behrends january return library books she skimmed through the entries february judges chambers am would that have been the divorce hearing feb order hockey stick for e the last entry march erich bday that had been written in light blue ink then with a different pen pm northwest flight minneapolis to san francisco a ticket unused oneway clipped to that page a note under it the name printed across the top of the note everett bonardi carolines father jenny thought quickly she read the uneven handwriting caroline dear your mother and i are not surprised to learn you are leaving john we are deeply concerned about erich but after reading your letter agree it is best if he stays with his father we had no idea of the true circumstances neither of us has been well but are looking forward to having you with us our love to you jenny folded the letter slipped it back in the notebook and closed the lid of the vanity case what had everett bonardi meant when he wrote we had no idea of the true circumstances slowly she went down the attic stairs the girls were still asleep lovingly she looked down at them then her mouth went dry the girls dark red hair was tumbled out on their pillows on the top of each pillow positioned so it almost seemed to be a hair ornament was a small round cake of pine soap the faint scent of pine permeated the air arent they the little beauties a voice sighed in her ear too startled to scream jenny spun around a thin bony arm encircled her waist oh caroline rooney toomis sighed her eyes vacant and moist dont we just love our babies somehow jenny got rooney out of the room without waking the girls rooney went willingly although she kept her arm wrapped around jennys waist awkwardly they descended the stairs lets have a cup of tea jenny suggested trying to keep her voice normal how had rooney gotten in she must still have a house key rooney sipped the tea silently never taking her gaze from the window arden used to love those woods she said course she knew she wasnt to go any farther than the edge but she was always climbing trees shed perch up there in that onerooney pointed vaguely to a large oakand watch the birds did i tell you she was president of the h club one year her voice was calming her eyes were clearer when she turned to look at jenny youre not caroline she said puzzled no im not im jenny rooney sighed im sorry i guess i forgot something came over me one of my spells i was thinking i was late getting to work thought id overslept course caroline would never care but mr john krueger was so exacting and you had a key jenny asked i forgot my key the door was unlocked but i dont have a key anymore do i jenny was positive the lock had been on the kitchen door on the other hand she decided not to try to pin rooney down and i went upstairs to make the beds rooney said but they were all finished and then i saw caroline no i mean i saw you and you put the pine soap on the childrens pillows jenny asked oh no caroline must have done that she was the one who loved that scent it was useless rooneys mind was too confused to attempt to separate imagination from reality rooney do you ever go out to church or to any meetings do you ever have friends in rooney shook her head i used to go to all the activities with arden the h the school plays her band concerts but no more her eyes were clear now i shouldnt be here erich wont like it she looked fearful you wont tell him or clyde will you promise you wont tell of course i wont youre like caroline pretty and gentle and sweet i hope nothing happens to you that would be such a shame toward the end caroline was so anxious to get away she used to say i just have a feeling rooney that something terrible is going to happen and im so helpless rooney got up to go didnt you wear a coat jenny asked i guess i didnt notice wait a minute jenny dug her thermal coat out of the foyer closet put this on look it fits you perfectly button it up around the neck its cold out hadnt erich said practically the same thing to her at that first lunch in the russian tea room was that really less than two months ago rooney glanced around uncertainly if you want ill help you move the table back before erich comes i dont intend to move the table back its staying right where it is caroline had it at the window once but john said she was just trying to show herself off to the men on the farm what did caroline say nothing she just put on her green cape and went outside and sat on the porch swing just like in the picture once she told me she used to like to sit out there and face west because thats where her folks were she got awful homesick for them didnt they ever come here to visit never but caroline still loved the farm she was raised in the city but shed always say this country is so beautiful rooney so special in what it does for me and then she left something happened and she decided she had to go what was that i dont know rooney glanced down this coat is nice i like it please keep it jenny told her ive hardly worn it since i came here if i do can i make the girls jumpers like you promised of course you can and rooney id like to be your friend jenny stood at the kitchen door watching the slight figure now warmly wrapped bend forward against the wind it was the waiting that was so hard was erich angry had he simply become so involved in painting that he hadnt wanted to break his concentration did she dare go into the woods try to find the cabin and confront him no she must not do that the days seemed endlessly long even the children became restless wheres daddy was a constant inquiry in this short time erich had become terribly important to them let kevin stay away jenny prayed make him leave us alone she spent her time concentrating on the house room by room she rearranged furniture sometimes switching only a chair or table sometimes making radical adjustments unwillingly elsa helped her take down the rest of the heavy lace curtains look elsa jenny finally said firmly these curtains are coming down and i dont want any more talk about checking with mr krueger first either help me or dont outside the farm seemed gray and depressing when the snow was on the ground it had had a currier and ives beauty when spring came she was sure the lush green of the fields and trees would be magnificent but now the frozen mud the brown fields the dark tree trunks and overcast skies chilled and depressed her would erich come back to the house for his birthday hed told her that he was always on the farm that day should she cancel his birthday dinner the evenings alone were interminable in new york when the children were settled for the night shed often gone to bed with a book and a cup of tea the library on the farm was excellent but the books in this library didnt invite leisurely reading they were placed in exact rows seemingly by size and color rather than author or subject to her they had the same effect as furniture with plastic covers she hated to touch them her problem was solved when on one of her trips to the attic she noticed a box marked bookscbk happily she helped herself to a couple of the comfortably shabby wellread volumes but even though she read far into the night she was finding it harder and harder to sleep all her life shed only had to close her eyes and instantly shed be in a sound sleep for hours now she began to wake up frequently to dream vague frightening dreams in which shadowy figures slithered through her subconscious on march following a particularly restless night she made up her mind she needed more exercise after lunch she went out to hunt for joe and found him in the farm office his unaffected pleasure at the visit was reassuring quickly she explained joe i want to start riding lessons today twenty minutes later she was sitting astride the mare trying to keep joes instructions straight in her head she realized she was enjoying herself thoroughly she forgot the chill the sharp wind the fact that her thighs were getting sore that her hands were tingling against the reins softly she spoke to fire maid now you at least give me a chance old girl she suggested ill probably make mistakes but im new at this business by the end of an hour she was getting the feel of moving her body in cadence with the horse she spotted mark watching her and waved to him he came over you look pretty good this your first time on a horse the very first jenny started to dismount quickly mark took the horses bridle the other side he said what oh sorry she slid down easily you did real good jenny joe told her thank you joe monday okay with you anytime jenny mark walked with her to the house youve got a fan in joe was there some kind of warning in his voice she tried to sound matteroffact hes a good teacher and i think erich will be pleased that im learning to ride it will be a surprise for him that ive started taking lessons i hardly think so mark commented he was watching you for quite a while watching me yes for nearly half an hour from the woods i thought he didnt want to make you nervous where is he now he went up to the house for a minute and then started back to the cabin erich was in the house i sound stupid jenny thought hearing the astonishment in her voice mark stopped took her arm and turned her to him whats the matter jenny he asked somehow she could imagine him examining an animal searching for the source of pain they were almost at the porch she said stiffly erich has been staying at the cabin since he came back from atlanta its just that its rather lonely for me now im used to being terribly busy and around people and now i guess i feel out of touch all around see if it doesnt get much better after tomorrow mark advised by the way are you sure you want us for dinner no i mean im not even sure erich will be home could we make it the thirteenth instead that will separate his birthday party from the anniversary if he still hasnt come back by then ill give you a call and you two can decide if you want to come just to visit me or go out and enjoy yourselves she was afraid she sounded resentful whats the matter with me she thought dismayed mark took both her hands in his well come jenny whether erich is home or not for what its worth ive had erich turn on me when he gets in one of his moods the rest of the picture is that when he comes out of them hes all the good things intelligent generous talented kind give him a chance to get through tomorrow and see if he isnt the real erich again with a quick smile he squeezed her hands released them and left her sighing jenny entered the house elsa was ready to go tina and beth were crosslegged on the floor crayons in hand daddy brought us new coloring books beth announced arent they good mr krueger left note for you elsa pointed to a sealed envelope on the table jenny felt the curiosity in the womans eyes she slipped the note into her pocket thank you as the door closed behind the cleaning woman jenny pulled the envelope from her pocket and ripped it open the sheet of paper covered by oversized letters in erichs bold handwriting held one sentence you should have waited for me to ride with you mommy mommy beth was tugging at her jacket you look sick mommy trying to smile jenny looked down at the woebegone face tina was next to beth now her face puckered ready to cry jenny crumbled the note and shoved it in her pocket no love im fine i just didnt feel so well for a minute she was not reassuring beth a wave of nausea had come over her as she read the note dear god she thought he cant mean this he wont let me go to the church meetings he wont let me use the car now he wont let me even learn to ride when hes painting erich dont spoil it for us she protested silently you cant have it both ways you cant hole up and paint and expect me to sit with my hands folded waiting for you you cant be so jealous that im afraid to be honest with you she glanced around wildly should she take a stand pack and go back to new york if there was any chance to keep their relationship from being destroyed hed have to get counseling get some help to overcome this possessiveness if she left hed know she meant it where could she go and with what she didnt have a dollar in her pocketbook she had no money for fare no place to go no job and she didnt want to leave him she was afraid she was going to be sick ill be right back she whispered and hurried upstairs in the bathroom she wrung out a cold cloth and washed her face her reflection had a sickly unnatural pallor mommy mommy beth and tina were in the hallway they had followed her upstairs she knelt down swooped them to her hugging them fiercely mommy youre hurting me tina protested im sorry moppet the warm wiggling bodies close to hers restored her balance you two certainly got yourselves one brilliant mother she said the afternoon dragged slowly to pass the time she sat with the girls at the spinet and began to teach them to pick out notes without the curtains it was possible to look out the parlor windows and see the sunset the clouds had been blown away and the sky was coldly beautiful in shades of mauve and orange gold and pink leaving the children banging on the keyboard she walked to the kitchen door that opened onto the west porch the wind was making the porch swing move gently ignoring the cold jenny stood on the porch and admired the last of the sunset when the final lights were ebbing into grayness she turned to go back into the house a movement in the woods caught her attention she stared someone was watching her a shadowy figure nearly concealed by the double trunk of the oak tree that arden used to climb whos there jenny called sharply the shadow receded into the woods as though trying to step back into the protection of the underbrush whos there jenny called again sharply aware only of her anger at the intrusion on her privacy she started down the porch steps toward the woods erich stepped out from the shelter of the oak and with outstretched arms started running toward her but darling i was only joking how could you have thought for a minute that i wasnt joking he took the crumbled note from her here lets throw that out he shoved it in the stove there its gone bewildered jenny looked at erich there wasnt a trace of nervousness about him he was smiling easily shaking his head at her in amusement its hard to believe you took that seriously jenny he said then he laughed i thought youd be flattered that i pretended to be jealous erich he locked his arms around her waist rubbed his cheek against hers umm you feel good nothing about the fact that they hadnt seen each other for a week and that note wasnt a joke he was kissing her cheek i love you jen for a moment she held herself rigid she had vowed that she would have it out with him the absences the jealousy her mail but she didnt want to start an argument shed missed him suddenly the whole house seemed cheerful again the girls heard his voice and came running back into the room daddy daddy he picked them up hey you two sounded great on the piano guess well have to start lessons for you pretty soon would you like that jenny thought marks right ive got to have patience give him time her smile was genuine when he looked at her over the childrens heads dinner had a festive air she prepared carbonara and an endive salad erich brought a bottle of chablis from the wine rack it gets harder and harder to work in the cabin jen he said especially when i know im missing dinners like this he tickled tina and its no fun being away from my family and your home she said it seemed a good moment to bring up the changes shed made you havent mentioned how you like the way ive moved things around im slow to react he said lightly let me think about it it was better than shed hoped for she got up walked around the table and put her arms around his neck i was so afraid you might be upset he reached up and smoothed her hair as always the feel of his nearness thrilled her pushed away the doubts and uncertainties beth had just left the table now she came running back mommy do you love daddy better than our other daddy why in the name of god had she thought to ask that question now jenny wondered despairingly desperately she tried to frame an answer she could only find the truth i loved your first daddy mostly because of you and tina why do you want to know that to erich she said they havent mentioned kevin for weeks beth pointed at erich because this daddy asked me if i love him better than our first daddy erich i wouldnt discuss that with the girls i shouldnt he said contritely i guess i was just anxious to see if their memory of him was beginning to fade he put his arms around her how about your memory darling she took a long time with the childrens baths somehow it was calming to watch their uncomplicated pleasure splashing in the tub she wrapped them in thick towels rejoicing in the sturdy little bodies and brushing back the freshly shampooed ringlets her hands trembled as she buttoned their pajamas im getting so nervous she fumed at herself its just i feel so dishonest that the smallest thing erich says i take the wrong way damn kevin she heard the girls prayers god bless mommy and daddy tina intoned she paused then looked up should we say god bless both daddies jenny bit her lip erich had started this she wasnt going to tell the children not to pray for kevin still why not tonight say god bless everyone she suggested and fire maid and mouse and tinker bell and joe beth added and randy tina reminded her can we have a puppy too jenny tucked them into bed realizing how every night she was becoming more and more reluctant to go downstairs again when she was alone the house seemed too big too silent on windy nights there was a mournful wail from the trees that penetrated the quiet and now when erich was here she didnt know what to expect would he stay overnight or go back to the cabin she went downstairs he had made the coffee they must have been pretty dirty for you to be so long with them sweetheart she had planned to ask him for the keys to the car but he didnt give her the chance he picked up the tray with the coffee service lets sit in the front parlor and let me absorb your changes as she followed him she realized how well the white cableknit sweater he was wearing set off his dark gold hair my handsome successful talented husband she thought and with a tinge of irony remembered fran saying hes too perfect in the parlor she pointed out to him how moving some furniture and putting away the excessive bricabrac made it possible to appreciate the lovely pieces in the room where did you put everything the curtains are in the attic the small pieces are in the cupboard in the pantry dont you think having the trestle table under memory of caroline is better i always felt the pattern in the couch was distracting so near the painting perhaps she couldnt be sure of his reaction nervously she tried to fill the silence with conversation and dont you think with the light that way we see more of the little boyof you before this your face was rather shadowed thats a bit fanciful the childs face was never meant to be defined as a fine arts major who worked in a prominent gallery you should realize that jenny he laughed was he intending to joke was it just that no matter what he said tonight there seemed to be a sting in it jenny picked up her coffee cup and realized her hand was shaking the cup slipped from her hand and the coffee splattered on the couch and oriental rug jenny darling why are you so nervous erichs face creased into worried lines with his napkin he began to swab the stain dont rub it in jenny cautioned rushing into the kitchen she grabbed a bottle of club soda from the refrigerator with a sponge she dabbed furiously at the spots thank god i hadnt put cream in yet she murmured erich said nothing would he consider the couch and carpet destroyed as he had the diningroom wallpaper but the club soda did the trick i think ive got it all she got up slowly im sorry erich sweetheart dont worry about it but cant you tell me why youre so upset you are upset jen that note for example a few weeks ago you would have known i was teasing you darling your sense of humor is one of the most delightful parts of your personality please dont lose it she knew he was right im sorry she said miserably she was going to tell erich about meeting kevin no matter what she had to clear the air the reason im so the phone rang answer it please jenny it wont be for me it rang again dont be so sure clyde tells me in the last week there have been a dozen disconnects where someone didnt want to leave a taped message thats why i told him to let it ring through tonight with a sense of fatality she preceded him into the kitchen the phone rang a third time she knew even before she picked it up that it was kevin jenny i cant believe i finally got through to you that damn answering machine how are you kevins voice was buoyant im all right kev she felt erichs eyes on her face he bent over the phone so he could hear the conversation what do you want would kevin talk about their meeting if only shed told erich first to share the good news im officially in the repertory company at the guthrie jen im glad for you she said stiffly but kevin i dont want you calling me i forbid you to call me erich is right here and hes very upset that youre contacting me listen jen ill call all i want you tell krueger for me that he can tear up those adoption papers im going to court to stop the adoption you can have custody jen and ill pay support but those kids are macpartlands and thats the way its going to be who knows someday tina and i might be doing a tatum and ryan oneal number shes a real little actress oh jen gotta run theyre calling for me ill get back to you bye slowly jenny hung up the phone can he stop the adoption she asked he can try he wont succeed erichs eyes were cold his tone icy a tatum and ryan oneal number my god jenny said disbelievingly id almost admire him if i thought he wanted the children really wanted them but this jenny i predicted you were making a mistake letting him sponge off you erich said if youd been yanking him into court for support payments youd have been finished with him two years ago as usual erich was right suddenly she felt infinitely weary and the faint nausea shed experienced earlier was coming back im going to bed she said abruptly are you staying here tonight erich im not sure i see she started down the foyer from the kitchen to the staircase she had gone only a few feet when he caught up with her jenny she turned what is it erich his eyes were warm now his face concerned and gentle i know it isnt your fault that macpartland is bothering you i promise i know that i shouldnt get upset with you it makes it so much harder for me when you do well work this out let me get through these next few days ill feel better then try to understand maybe its because mother promised me just before she died that shed always be here on my birthday maybe thats why im so depressed around this time i feel her presenceand her lossso much try to understand me try to forgive me when i hurt you i dont mean it jenny i love you they were wrapped in each others arms erich please jenny begged let this be the last year you react like this twentyfive years twentyfive years caroline would be fiftyseven years old you still see her as a young woman whose death was a tragedy it was but its over lets get on with life it could be good for us let me share your life really share it bring your friends in take me to see your studio get me a small car so i can go shopping or to an art gallery or take the kids to a movie when youre painting you want to be able to meet kevin dont you oh my god jenny pulled away let me go to bed erich i really dont feel well he did not follow her up the stairs she looked in on the girls they were fast asleep tina stirred when she kissed her she went into the master bedroom the faint scent of pine that always lingered in the room seemed heavier tonight was it because she felt queasy her eyes fell on the crystal bowl tomorrow shed move that bowl to a guest bedroom oh erich stay tonight she pleaded silently dont go away feeling like this suppose kevin started pestering them with calls suppose he stopped the adoption suppose he had regular visitation rights it would be unbearable for erich it would destroy their marriage she got into bed and determinedly opened her book but it was impossible to concentrate her eyes were heavy and her body ached in unaccustomed places joe had warned her the riding would cause that youll hear from muscles you didnt know you had hed grinned finally she turned off the light a little later she heard footsteps in the hall erich she pulled herself up on one elbow but the footsteps continued up the stairs to the attic what was he doing there a few minutes later she heard him coming down he must be dragging something there was a thudding sound every few steps what was he doing she was about to get up and investigate when she heard sounds from downstairs the sounds of furniture being moved of course she thought erich had gone upstairs for the carton of curtains now he was rearranging the furniture putting it back in its original places in the morning when jenny went downstairs the curtains were rehung every table and chair and piece of bricabrac was in place and her plants were missing later she found them in the trash container behind the barn slowly jenny walked through the downstairs rooms a second time erich had not failed to return a single vase or lamp or footstool to its original exact spot hed even found the ornately ugly owl sculpture that shed poked away in an unused cabinet over the stove she had known what to expect but even so the absolute rejection of her wishes and taste shocked her finally she made coffee and went back to bed shivering she pulled the covers around her and leaned back on the pillows propped against the massive headboard it would be another cold and gloomy day the sky was gray and misty a sharp wind rattled the windowpanes the eighth of march erichs thirtyfifth birthday carolines twentyfifth anniversary that last morning of her life had caroline awakened in this bed heartsick that she was leaving her only child or had she awakened counting the hours until she could leave this house jenny rubbed her forehead it ached dully once again her sleep had been restless shed been dreaming of erich always he had that same expression on his face an expression she could never quite understand once this anniversary was over and he came back to the house shed talk to him quietly she would ask him to go with her for counseling if he refused shed have to consider taking the children to new york where maybe her job would be available again maybe kevin would lend her a few hundred dollars for airfare lend he owed her hundreds fran would let her and the girls bunk in her place for a short time it was a terrible inconvenience to ask of anyone but fran was a good scout i dont have a cent jenny thought but it isnt that i dont want to leave erich i love him i want to spend the rest of my life with him she was still so chilled a hot shower might help and shed wear that warm argyll sweater it was in the closet jenny glanced at the closet and understood what had been subconsciously bothering her when she got up shed taken her robe from the closet but last night she had left the robe thrown over the vanity bench the bench had been pulled back from the dressing table now it was precisionstraight no wonder she dreamed of erichs face she must have subconsciously realized he was in the room why hadnt he stayed she shivered her skin felt prickly but it wasnt the cold she was afraid afraid of erich of her own husband of course not she told herself i am afraid of his rejection he came to me and then left me had erich gone back to the cabin during the night or had he slept in the house quietly she put on her robe and slippers and went into the hall the door of erichs boyhood room was closed she listened at the door there was no sound slowly she turned the handle and opened the door erich was curled up in bed the gaily patterned patchwork quilt wrapped around him only his ear and hairline showed his face was buried in folds of soft material silently jenny entered the room and became aware of a familiar faint scent she bent over erich in his sleep he was nuzzling the aqua nightgown to his face she and the children had almost finished breakfast when erich came downstairs he refused even coffee he was already wearing one of his heavy parkas and was carrying what was obviously an expensive hunting rifle even to jennys inexperienced eye jenny eyed it nervously i dont know if ill be back tonight he told her i dont know what ill do ill just be around the farm today all right dont go changing any of the furniture again jenny i didnt like it your way i gathered that jenny said evenly its my birthday jen his tone sounded highpitched young like the voice of a boy arent you going to wish me a happy birthday id rather wait until friday night mark and emily are coming to dinner well celebrate it with them wouldnt you prefer that maybe he came over to her the cold steel of the rifle brushed her arm do you love me jenny yes and youll never leave me id never want to leave you thats what caroline said those very words his eyes became reflective the children had been silent daddy can i go with you beth begged not now tell me your name beth crewgrr tina whats your name tina crewgrr very good ill get both of you presents he kissed them and came back to jenny propping the rifle against the stove he took her hands and ran them through his hair do it like that he whispered please jen his eyes were on her intently now they looked as they had in her dream with a wrench of tenderness she obeyed he looked so vulnerable and last night he had not been able to come to her for comfort thats good he smiled that feels so good thank you he picked up the rifle and walked to the door goodbye girls he smiled at jenny then hesitated sweetheart i have an idea lets go out together for dinner tonight just the two of us ill ask rooney and clyde to stay with the children for a few hours oh erich id love that if he began to share this date with her its a breakthrough she thought a good omen ill phone and make reservations for eight oclock at the groveland inn ive been promising to take you there darling its the best food around the groveland inn where she had met kevin jenny felt her face pale when she and the girls got to the stable joe was waiting for them his usually sunny smile was missing his young face was set in unfamiliar lines of worry uncle josh came over this morning he was pretty drunk and maw told him to get lost he left the door open and randy got out i just hope nothing happens to him hes not used to cars go look for him jenny said mr krueger wont like it will be all right joe ill see it is the girls would be heartsick if anything happened to randy she watched him hurry down the dirt road then said come on girls lets take our walk now you can visit the ponies later they ran ahead of her across the fields their rubber boots made soft squishing sounds the ground was thawing maybe it would be an early spring after all she tried to imagine these fields fleshed out with alfalfa and grass those sparse empty trees weighted with leaves even the wind had lost something of its biting edge in the south pastures she could see that the cattle had their heads down and were sniffing at the ground as though anticipating the shoots of grass that would soon be coming id like to start a garden jenny thought i dont know a thing about it but i could learn maybe it was because she needed exercise that she was feeling physically rotten it wasnt just nerves once again the clammy queasy feeling was back she stopped abruptly was it possible dear god was it possible of course it was shed felt this way when she was carrying beth she was pregnant that explained why the nightgown felt too tight in the bodice it explained the lightheadedness the queasiness it even explained the periods of depression what a marvelous gift to tell erich tonight that she believed she was expecting a child he wanted a son to inherit this farm surely the night staff at the restaurant was different from the lunchtime help it would be all right erichs son randy tina called look mommy theres randy oh good jenny said joe was so worried she called to him randy come here the puppy must have cut through the orchard he stopped turned and looked at her squealing beth and tina began running toward him with a bark of delight he turned tail and began to run toward the south fields randy stop jenny shouted now barking noisily the puppy loped ahead dont let erich hear him she prayed dont let him run toward the cow pastures erich would be furious if he upset the cows nearly a dozen of them were coming to term with calves but he wasnt heading toward the pastures instead he veered and started running along the east line of the property the cemetery he was heading straight for it jenny remembered how joe joked about randy digging around their house swear hes trying to get to china jenny you should just see him every spot that shows a bit of thawing hes into if the dog ever started digging in the graves jenny passed the girls running as fast as she could on the mushy ground randy she called again randy come here suppose erich heard her puffing heavily she ran around the line of norwegian pines that screened the graveyard and into the clearing the gate was open and the puppy was leaping among the tombstones in its isolated corner carolines grave was covered with a blanket of fresh roses randy romped over it crushing the flowers jenny saw the glint of metal coming from the woods instantly she realized what it was no no she screamed dont shoot erich dont shoot him erich stepped from the shelter of the trees with slowmotion precision he raised it to his shoulder dont please she screamed the sharp crack of the rifle sent sparrows squawking from the trees with a howl of pain the puppy crumbled to the ground his small body sinking into the roses as jenny watched in disbelieving horror erich worked the bolt with a welloiled click and shot the whimpering animal again as the echo of the blast died away the whimpering ceased later jenny remembered the hours after the shooting as a nightmare blurred and difficult to piece together she remembered her own frantic rush to head off the girls before they saw what had happened to randy yanking their hands we have to go home now but we want to play with randy she thrust them in the house wait here dont come out again a shirtsleeved grave erich was carrying randys still form the parka he had wrapped the animal in was soaked with blood joe tried to blink back tears joe i thought it was one of those damn strays you know half of them are rabid if id only realized you shouldnt have put him on your good coat mr krueger erich how can you be so cruel you shot him twice you shot him after i called to you i had to darling he insisted the first bullet shattered his spine do you think i could have left him like that jenny i was frantic when i thought the girls were chasing a stray a child nearly died last year after being bitten by one of them clyde looking uncomfortable shifted from one foot to the other you just cant go around petting animals on a farm miz krueger im sorry to give you so much trouble mr krueger joe said apologetically her own anger dissipated into confusion erich smoothed her hair joe ill replace him with a good hunter you dont need to do that mr krueger but there was hope in his voice joe took randy to bury him on his own property taking her back to the house erich insisted she lie on the couch bringing her a steaming cup of tea i forget my darling is still a city girl and then he left her finally she got up and got the girls lunch while they napped she rested forcing herself to read willing her mind to stop squirming about in hopeless worry it will be a fast dinner for you two tonight she told beth and tina daddy and i are going out me too tina volunteered no not you too jenny said hugging her for once daddy and i have a date but no wonder the girls expected to be included the few places she and erich had gone to in this last month hed always insisted on bringing them along how many stepfathers would be so considerate she took elaborate care with her own preparations soaking in a steaming tub took some of the soreness from her body hesitating only a minute she filled the tub with the pinescented bath crystals that shed so far ignored in the bathroom cabinet she washed her hair and pulled it back in a psyche knot when shed been in the restaurant with kevin her hair had been loose on her shoulders she studied the contents of her closet choosing a longsleeved huntergreen wraparound silk that accentuated her narrow waist and the green in her eyes erich came into the room just as she was fastening her locket jenny you dressed especially for me i love you in green she cupped his face in her hands i always dress for you i always will he was carrying a canvas miraculous as it might seem i managed to finish it this afternoon it was a spring scene a new calf halfhidden in a hollow the mother watchfully beside it eyeing the other cattle seeming to warn them to stay away the sunlight filtered through pine trees the sun was a fivepointed star the painting had the aura of a nativity scene jenny studied it and felt all her senses quickening to its profound beauty its magnificent she said quietly theres so much tenderness there today you told me i was cruel today i was terribly stupid and terribly wrong will this be for the next exhibit no darling this is my gift to you she pulled the collar of her coat around her face as they went into the restaurant the other time shed been so anxious to escape quickly that shed hardly noticed the details of the place now she realized that with its bright red carpeting pine furniture mellow lighting colonial curtains and blazing fire the inn was immensely appealing her eyes slid to the booth where shed sat with kevin right this way the hostess led them in that direction jenny held her breath but mercifully the hostess sailed past it and led them to a window table there was a bottle of champagne already in the cooler beside the table when their glasses had been filled jenny held hers up to erich happy birthday darling thank you quietly they sipped erich was wearing a dark gray tweed jacket a narrow black tie charcoal gray trousers his thick charcoal eyebrows and lashes intensified the blue of his eyes his bronzegold hair was highlighted by the flickering candle on the table he reached for her hand i enjoy taking you to places for the first time darling her mouth went dry i enjoy being everywhere anywhere with you i think thats why i left that note youre right sweetheart i wasnt only teasing i was jealous watching joe teach you to ride all i could think was that i wanted to share the first minute you were on fire maid i suppose its as though id bought you a piece of jewelry and youd worn it for someone else erich jenny protested i just thought it would be nice for you not to be bothered with the abcs of the learning process its not unlike the house is it jenny you came in and in four weeks you try to transform a historical treasure into a new york studio complete with bare windows and spider plants darling may i suggest a birthday present for me take a little time to find out who i am who we are you accused me of cruelty when i shot an animal i thought might attack our children may i suggest that you in a different way shoot from the hip utterly without justification and jenny i have to say this you have the distinction of being the first krueger woman in four generations to create a scene in front of a hired hand caroline would have fainted dead away before she would publicly criticize my father im not caroline jenny said quietly darling just understand that im not cruel to animals im not unreasonably rigid that first night in your apartment i could see you didnt understand why i was astonished that you gave macpartland money the same thing on our wedding day but its come back to haunt us hasnt it if you only knew jenny thought the maître d was heading toward them with menus a professional smile plastered on his face and now my sweet erich said lets consider that weve cleared the air a bit lets have a wonderful dinner together and please know that id rather be here with you in this place at this moment than anywhere else with anyone else in the world when they arrived home she deliberately put on the aqua gown she had not told erich at dinner about her possible pregnancy shed been too shaken by the truth of his observations when they were in bed his arms around her she would tell him but he did not stay with her i need to be completely alone ill be back by thursday but not before then she did not dare to protest now dont get into a creative haze and forget that mark and emily are coming to dinner on friday he looked down at her as she lay in bed i wont forget without kissing her he left once again she was alone in the cavernous bedroom to fall into the uneasy dreamfilled sleep that was becoming a way of life in spite of everything planning the dinner party was a pleasant diversion she wanted to shop herself but would not make driving the car an issue instead she compiled a long list for elsa coquilles st jacques she told erich when he came to the house on friday morning mine is really good and you say mark likes a rib roast she chatted on determined to bridge the perceptible estrangement hell get over it she thought especially when he knows about the baby kevin had not called again maybe he had met a girl in the cast and had become involved if so they wouldnt hear from him for a while if necessary as soon as the adoption became final they could take legal steps to make him stay away or if he did try to block the adoption erich might as a last resort buy him off silently she prayed please let the children have a home a real family let it be good again between erich and me the night of the dinner she set out the limoges china delicately beautiful with its goldandblue border mark and emily were due at eight jenny found herself eagerly looking forward to meeting emily all her life shed had girlfriends shed lost touch with most of them because of lack of time to keep up contacts after beth and tina came along maybe emily and she would hit it off she said as much to erich i doubt it he told her there was a time when the hanovers looked very fondly at the prospect of having me as a soninlaw roger hanover is the president of the bank in granite place and has a good idea of my net worth did you ever go out with emily a little but i wasnt interested and didnt want to get into a situation that would prove uncomfortable i was waiting for the perfect woman you see she tried to make her voice teasing well you found her dear he kissed her i certainly hope so she flinched hes joking she told herself fiercely after she got beth and tina into bed jenny changed into a white silk blouse with lace cuffs and a multicolored anklelength skirt she studied her reflection in the mirror and realized she was deathly pale adding a touch of rouge helped erich had set up the tea table in the parlor as a bar when she came into the room he studied her carefully i like that costume jen thats good she smiled you certainly paid enough for it i thought you didnt like it youve never worn it before it seemed kind of dressed up for just sitting around he came over to her is that a spot on your sleeve that oh its just a speck of dust it must have happened in the store then you havent worn this outfit before why did he ask that was he simply too sensitive not to know she was hiding something from him first time girl scouts honor the door chimes were a welcome interruption her mouth had begun to go dry its getting so that no matter what erich says im afraid of giving myself away she thought mark was wearing a pepperandsalt jacket that suited him well it brought out the gray in his hair accentuated his broad shoulders the lean strength of his tall frame the woman with him was about thirty smallboned with wide inquisitive eyes and dark blond hair that skimmed the collar of her wellcut brown velvet suit jenny decided that emily had the air of someone who never had experienced an instant of selfdoubt she made no secret of looking jenny over from head to toe you do realize i have to report to everyone in town what youre like the curiosity is overwhelming my mother gave me a list of twenty questions im to discreetly toss in you havent exactly made yourself available to the community before jenny could answer she felt erichs arm slip around her waist if wed taken a twomonth honeymoon cruise nobody would have thought a thing of it but as jenny says because we chose to honeymoon in our own home granite place is outraged not to be camped in our living room i never said that jenny thought helplessly as she watched emilys eyes narrow over cocktails mark waited until erich and emily were deep in conversation before he commented you look pale jenny are you all right fine she tried to sound as though she meant it joe told me about his dog i understand you were pretty upset i guess i have to learn to understand that things are different here in new york we cliff dwellers weep collectively over the picture of a stray about to be destroyed then somebody shows up to adopt him and we all cheer emily was looking around the room you havent changed anything have you she asked i dont know whether erich has mentioned it but i am an interior designer and if i were you id get rid of those curtains sure theyre beautiful but the windows are so overdressed and you lose that glorious view jenny waited for erich to defend her apparently jen doesnt agree with you he said smoothly his tone and smile were indulgent erich thats unfair jenny thought furiously should she contradict him the first krueger woman in four generations to create a scene in front of a hired hand how about a scene in front of friends what was emily saying and i happen to be never at peace if im not switching things around but maybe that isnt your interest i understand youre an artist too the moment had passed it was too late to correct the impression erich had left im not an artist jenny said my degree is in fine arts i worked in a gallery in new york thats where i met erich so ive heard your whirlwind romance has created quite a stir in these parts how does our rustic life compare with the big apple jenny chose her words carefully she had to undo the impression that she felt erich had given that she was scornful of the local people i miss my friends of course i miss bumping into people who know me and comment on how big the children are getting i like people and i make friends easily but once she glanced at erich once our honeymoon is officially over i hope to be active in the community report that to your mother emily mark suggested jenny thought bless you for underscoring mark knew what she was trying to do emily laughed a brittle mirthless sound from what i hear youve got at least one friend to keep you amused she had to be referring to the meeting with kevin the woman from church had been gossiping she felt erichs questioning look and did not meet his eyes jenny murmured something about seeing to the dinner and went into the kitchen her hands were shaking so she could hardly lift the roasting pan from the oven suppose emily followed through on her insinuations emily believed she was a widow now her telling the truth would in effect be branding erich as a liar what about mark the question had not come up but undoubtedly he too thought she had been a widow somehow she managed to get the food onto serving dishes to light the candles and call them to the table at least im a good cook she reflected emily can tell her mother that erich carved and served the rib roast one of our own steers he said proudly are you sure that doesnt repel you jenny he was teasing her she mustnt overreact the others didnt seem to notice think jenny he continued in the same bantering tone the yearling you pointed out to me in the field last month the one you said looked so wistful youre eating him now her throat closed she was afraid she would gag please god please dont let me get sick emily laughed erich you are so mean remember you used to bait arden like that and have her in tears arden jenny asked she reached for her water glass the knot in her throat started to dissolve yes what a nice kid she was talk about the allamerican girl crazy about animals at sixteen she wouldnt touch meat or poultry said it was barbaric and that she was going to be a vet when she grew up but i guess she changed her mind i was in college when she ran away rooneys never given up hope that shell come back mark commented its incredible the mother instinct you see it from the first moment of birth the dumbest animal knows its own calf and will protect it to the death youre not eating your meat darling erich commented a flash of anger made it possible for her to square her shoulders and look across the table directly into his eyes and youre not eating your vegetables darling she told him he winked at her he was just teasing touché he smiled the peal of the door chimes startled all of them erich frowned now who could that his voice trailed off as he stared at jenny she knew what he was thinking dont let it be kevin she prayed and realized as she pushed back her chair that all evening shed been sending frantic prayers for divine intervention a heavily built man of about sixty with massive shoulders a bulging leather jacket and narrow heavylidded eyes was there his car was parked directly in front of the house an official car with a red dome top mrs krueger yes relief made her weak no matter what this man wanted at least kevin hadnt come im wendell gunderson sheriff of granite county may i come in of course ill get my husband erich was hurrying down the hall into the foyer jenny noticed the instant respect that came into the sheriffs face sorry to bother you erich just have to ask your wife a few questions ask me a few questions but even as she spoke jenny knew that this visit had to do with kevin yes maam from the dining room they could hear the sound of marks voice could we speak quietly for a few minutes why dont you come and join us for coffee erich suggested perhaps your wife would rather answer my questions privately erich jenny felt clammy perspiration on her forehead she realized her palms were damp the queasiness was so strong she had to clamp her lips together theres certainly no reason we cant talk at the table she murmured helplessly she led the way into the dining room listened as emily greeted the sheriff with quickly concealed surprise watched as mark leaned back in his chair an attitude she had begun to realize meant he was diagnosing a situation as erich offered the sheriff a drink which was refused because of being on official business she set out the coffee cups mrs krueger do you know a kevin macpartland yes she knew her voice was trembling has kevin been in an accident when and where did you last see him she put her hands in her pockets clenched them into fists of course it had had to come out but why this way oh erich im so sorry she thought she could not look at erich on february twentyfourth at the shopping center in raleigh kevin macpartland is the father of your children he is my former husband and the father of my children she heard emily gasp when did you last speak with him he phoned on the evening of march seventh about nine oclock please tell me has anything happened to him the sheriffs eyes narrowed into slits on monday afternoon march ninth kevin macpartland received a telephone call during a rehearsal at the guthrie theater he said his former wife had to see him about the children he borrowed a car from one of the other actors and left half an hour later about fourthirty pm promising to return in the morning that was four days ago and he hasnt been heard from since the car he borrowed was only six weeks old and the actor who lent it had just met macpartland so you can understand that hes pretty concerned are you saying that you did not ask him to meet you no i did not may i ask why youve been in touch with your former husband we understood around here that you were a widow kevin wanted to see the girls jenny said he was talking about stopping the adoption it surprised her how lifeless her voice sounded she could see kevin as though he were in the room the expensive ski sweater the long scarf draped over his left shoulder the dark red hair so carefully barbered the poses and posturing had he deliberately staged a disappearance to embarrass her she had warned him that erich was upset did kevin hope to destroy their marriage before it had a chance and what did you tell him when i saw him and when he called i told him to leave us alone her voice was getting higher erich were you aware of this meeting of the phone call on march seventh i was aware of the phone call on march seventh i was here when it came i was not aware of the meeting but i can understand it jenny knew my feelings about kevin macpartland you were home with your wife on the evening of march ninth no as a matter of fact i stayed in the cabin that night i was just completing a new canvas did your wife know you were planning to be away there was a long silence jenny broke it of course i knew what did you do that evening mrs krueger i was very tired and went to bed shortly after i had settled my little girls in their room did you speak to anyone on the phone no one i went to sleep almost immediately i see and you are very sure you did not invite your former husband to visit you during erichs absence no i did not i would never ask him to come here it was as though she could read their minds of course they didnt believe her her untouched plate was on the serving buffet congealed fat was forming a narrow rim around the beef the beef had a crimson center she thought of randys body turning crimson with blood as he collapsed among the roses she thought of kevins dark red hair now the plate was going around and around she had to get fresh air she was spinning too pushing back her chair she tried to struggle to her feet her last conscious recollection was erichs expression was it concern or annoyanceas her chair slammed against the buffet behind her when she woke up she was lying on the couch in the parlor someone was holding a cold cloth on her head it felt so good her head hurt so much there was something she didnt want to think about kevin she opened her eyes im all right im so sorry mark was bending over her there was so much concern in his face it was oddly comforting take it easy he said can i get something for you jenny there was an undercurrent of excitement in emilys voice shes enjoying this jenny thought shes the kind of person who wants to be in on everything darling erichs tone was solicitous he came over and took both her hands not too close mark warned give her air her head started to clear slowly she sat up the taffeta skirt rustling as she moved she felt mark slip pillows behind her head and back sheriff i can answer any questions you have im sorry i dont know what came over me ive not felt quite well these past few days his eyes seemed wider and shinier now as though theyd locked into an intense focus on her mrs krueger ill make this brief you did not phone your former husband on the ninth of march to request a meeting nor did he arrive here that night thats correct why would he have told his colleagues that you had called him what purpose would he have in lying the only thought i have is that sometimes kevin used to say he was visiting me and the children when he wanted to get out of other plans if he was in the process of dropping one girlfriend for another hed often use us as an excuse then may i ask why youre so upset at his disappearance if you think he might be off with some woman her lips were so stiff it was hard to form words she spoke slowly like a teacher enunciating for a firstyear language class you must understand there is something terribly wrong kevin had been accepted by the guthrie theater for the repertory company that is true isnt it yes it is you must look for him she said he would never jeopardize that opportunity kevins acting is the most important thing in his life they all left a few minutes later she insisted on walking with them to the front door jenny could imagine the conversation that would take place when emily reported back to her mother shes not a widow that was her exhusband she was kissing in the restaurant and now hes missing the sheriff obviously thinks shes lying poor erich ill treat this as a missing person get out some flyers well be back to you mrs krueger thank you sheriff he was gone mark pulled on his coat jenny you ought to go right to bed you still look mighty rocky thanks for coming you two erich said sorry our evening ended so badly his arm was around jenny he kissed her cheek shows what happens when you marry a woman with a past doesnt it his tone was amused emily laughed marks face showed no emotion when the door closed behind him jenny wordlessly started up the staircase all she wanted to do was to go to bed erichs astonished voice stopped her jenny surely youre not planning to leave the house in this condition overnight rooney let herself in as jenny was sipping a second cup of tea after breakfast jenny spun around at the faint click of the door oh did i scare you rooney sounded pleased her eyes were vague her thin hair scattered by the wind blew around her birdlike face rooney that door was locked i thought you said youre not supposed to have a key i must have found one where mine is missing did i find yours of course jenny thought the coat i gave her it was in the pocket thank god i didnt admit to erich that i lost it may i have my key please she held out her hand rooney looked puzzled i didnt know there was a key in your coat we gave you back your coat i dont think so yes clyde made me he put it back himself i saw you wear it its not in the closet jenny said what difference she thought she tried a new approach let me see your key rooney please rooney pulled a heavy key ring out of her pocket the large bunch of keys were all individually tagged house barn office grainery rooney arent these clydes keys i guess so you must put them back clyde will be angry if you take his keys he says i shouldnt take them so that was how rooney got into the house ill have to tell clyde to hide his keys jenny thought erich would have a fit if he knew she could get at them jenny looked at rooney with pity in the three weeks since the sheriff had come she hadnt visited rooney and in fact had tried to avoid running into her sit down and let me pour you a cup of tea she urged for the first time she noticed that rooney had a package tucked under her arm what have you got there you said i could make the girls jumpers you promised yes i did let me see hesitantly rooney opened the brown paper and shook two violetblue corduroy jumpers from tissue wrapping the stitching was fine the strawberryshaped pockets were embroidered in red and green jenny could see that the sizes would be perfect rooney these are lovely she said sincerely you sew beautifully im glad you like them i made arden a skirt with this material and had some left over i was going to make her a jacket too but then she ran away dont you think this is a pretty shade of blue yes i do it will be wonderful with their hair i wanted you to see the material before i started but when i came that night you were on your way out and i didnt want to interfere on the way out at night not likely jenny thought but let it go she found herself glad for rooneys company these weeks had dragged so ceaselessly she thought about kevin what had happened to him he was a fast driver hed been driving a strange car the roads were icy that day could he have been in an accident maybe not hurt himself but have wrecked the borrowed car would that have panicked him into leaving minnesota always she got back to one irrefutable fact kevin would never walk away from the guthrie theater she felt so rotten she should tell erich she was pregnant she should see a doctor but not yet not until something was resolved about kevin the news of the baby should be joyful it shouldnt be told in this tense hostile atmosphere the night of the dinner party erich had insisted that every piece of china and crystal be handwashed every pot scrubbed before they went upstairs as they got into bed hed commented i must say you look pretty upset jenny i didnt realize that macpartland meant that much to you no ill correct myself maybe ive sensed it maybe thats why im not even surprised that you had a clandestine meeting with him shed tried to explain but to her own ears the justification seemed feeble and halting finally shed been too tired too upset to discuss it any further as shed drifted off to sleep hed put his arm around her im your husband jenny he said no matter what ill stand by you as long as you tell me the truth like i said i didnt want to interfere with your visit rooney was saying what oh im sorry jenny realized she had not been listening to rooney she looked across the table rooneys eyes were clearer how much of her problem was her absolute obsession with arden how much was the loneliness of no outside contacts rooney ive always wanted to learn to sew do you think you could teach me rooney brightened oh id love that i can teach you to sew and knit and crochet if you want she left a few minutes later ill get everything together and come back tomorrow afternoon she promised it will be like old times caroline didnt know how to do none of those things neither i was the one who taught her maybe you can make a nice quilt before something happens to you hallo jenny joe called cheerfully oh god jenny thought erich was just a few steps behind her with the girls but had not turned the corner into the stable how are you joe she asked nervously something in her voice made him look up quickly he saw erich and reddened oh good morning mr krueger didnt expect you i guess im sure you didnt erichs icy tone made joe blush several shades deeper i want to see how my girls are doing with their lessons yes sir ill tack up the ponies right away he scurried into the tack room is he in the habit of addressing you as jenny erich asked quietly its my fault jenny said then wondered how many times in the last weeks shed used those words joe came back with the tack as the girls squealed impatiently he put the saddles on well each lead one of the ponies erich told him how about you mrs krueger joe asked you up to riding today not yet joe havent you been riding erich asked no my back has been hurting quite a bit you didnt tell me that it will be fine she still couldnt tell him about the baby nearly four weeks had passed since sheriff gunderson had come and there hadnt been a single word more spring was about to break the trees all had a red haze around them joe told her that that happened just before the budding started there were shoots of green coming through the mud in the fields the chickens were wandering out of the chicken house and exploring the territory around them the boastful crowing of the roosters could be heard from behind the grainery and polebarn and stable one of the hens had selected a corner of the stable for her own nest and was brooding her unhatched eggs since when have you had a backache jenny do you want to see a doctor erichs tone was loving and concerned no lets see if it doesnt just go away ive had them before she had had mild backaches during her other pregnancies someone fell into step with them it was mark she hadnt run into mark since the night of the dinner hello you two mark said his manner was easy there was nothing to indicate he was thinking of what had happened at the dinner party stay a minute and watch the way my girls sit their ponies erich invited in the past weeks tina and beth had made rapid progress on the ponies jenny smiled unconsciously at their delighted faces as they sat straight up holding the reins with rapt concentration they look good mark commented theyll grow to be fine riders they love those animals erich left them to lead one of the ponies ive never seen erich happier he was showing their pictures to everyone at the hanovers the other night emily was sorry you couldnt make it couldnt make it jenny repeated couldnt make what the hanovers party erich said you werent feeling up to par have you seen a doctor yet i just overheard you mentioning your back and that fainting spell that night jenny was that unusual do you have any history of weak spells no i never faint and i will see a doctor soon she felt rather than saw mark studying her somehow she didnt mind whatever conclusion he had reached about kevins possible visit and her supposed widow status he had not condemned her should she tell him that she had no idea about emilys party what good would it do erich left us together here because he knew mark would probably bring up the party she thought erich wanted me to know about it why was it simply another way of trying to hurt her to punish her for the gossip around the krueger name how much did people in this community know she was sure emily had told her family and friends about the sheriffs visit if erich believed people thought he had made a mistake and were pitying him hed be furious she remembered his anger when elsa suggested he had made the smudge on the wall erich was a perfectionist as mark turned to leave erich called see you tonight tonight jenny wondered another party business of some kind whatever it was she wouldnt hear about it the girls ran to her when they dismounted daddy is going to ride baron with us soon beth said dont you like to ride with us mommy joe led the ponies into the barn see you mrs krueger he said she was very sure he would not call her jenny again come along dear erich took her arm didnt my little princesses do beautifully my princesses my girls my daughters not our only my when had that begun jenny realized that the emotion she was experiencing was stark jealousy good lord she thought dont let me start getting upset about that the one good thing in my life right now is that the children are so happy they were almost to the house when a car pulled into the driveway a car with a dome light on the roof sheriff gunderson did he have news about kevin she forced herself not to hurry not to let her face show anxiety as the sheriff got out of the car erich linked his arm in hers he was holding tina by the other hand beth was running in front of them the devoted husband standing by his wife in time of trouble jenny thought that had to be the impression the sheriff was getting wendell gundersons face was grim there was a trifle more formality in his manner even when he greeted erich he wanted to speak with jenny alone they went into the library jenny thought how in the first weeks this had been her favorite room the meeting with kevin had changed everything the sheriff ignored the couch and chose the one straight chair mrs krueger there has been absolutely no sign of your exhusband the minneapolis police are treating his disappearance as possible foul play there is no evidence he planned to stay away there was two hundred dollars in cash in a desk drawer he took only a small overnight bag with him when he left everyone he worked with at the guthrie agreed that he wouldnt walk away from that opportunity i realize that last time it would have been much easier if i insisted on speaking with you alone please tell the truth because once this investigation is in full swing i promise you the truth will come out did you phone kevin macpartland on the afternoon of monday march ninth i did not did you see him on the night of monday march ninth i did not he left minneapolis about fivethirty driving straight through that would get him here about nine well assume he might have stopped along the way to get something to eat where were you between ninethirty and ten that monday night i was in bed i turned out the light before nine oclock i was very tired you insist you did not see him i did not the guthrie operator confirmed that he received a call from a woman is there any woman who might have called him in your name any close friend i dont have any close friends here jenny said man or woman she stood up sheriff no one wants more than i do to find kevin macpartland he is the father of my children theres never been even a hint of animosity between us so will you please explain to me what youre driving at are you suggesting that i invited or enticed kevin here knowing that my husband planned to be away and if you believe that are you insinuating i had something to do with his disappearance im not suggesting anything mrs krueger im only asking you to tell us everything you know if macpartland was definitely on his way here and didnt show up it gives us a starting point if he was here and we knew what time he left it gives us something else can you see what im getting at i can understand why that might be embarrassing for you but i dont think we have anything more to discuss jenny said turning abruptly she left the library erich was in the kitchen with the girls hed made ham and cheese sandwiches the three of them were eating companionably jenny saw there was no place set for her erich i think the sheriff is ready to leave she said you might want to see him out mommy beth looked anxious oh mouse jenny thought that antenna of yours she tried to smile say you two looked terrific on the ponies today going to the refrigerator she poured a glass of milk dont you know better mommy beth asked know what better jenny picked up tina sat at the table with the little girl on her lap daddy told joe when we were on our ponies that even if you dont know better than to have joe call you mrs krueger joe should know better daddy said that yes beth was positive you know what else he said jenny sipped her milk no what he said that when joe got home for lunch today hed find a brandnew puppy daddy bought for him because randy runned away can we see the puppy mommy sure lets walk over there after your nap so randy runned away she thought thats the official version of what happened to that poor little puppy the new puppy was a golden retriever even to jennys unpracticed eye the long nose thin face and slender body indicated good breeding the thick old quilt on the kitchen floor was the same one randy had curled up on the bowl with water still had his name in the jaunty red letters joe had painted on it even joes mother seemed mollified by the gift erich krueger is a fair man she conceded to jenny feel as though i was wrong accusing him of maybe doing away with joes dog last year seems as though if he got rid of that dog hed a come out and said so except that this time i saw him jenny thought and then felt unfair to erich beth patted the sleek head you must be very careful because hes so little she instructed tina you must not hurt him they sure are pretty little girls maude ekers said they favor you except for the hair to jenny there was something different about the womans attitude today her welcome had been restrained she had hesitated before inviting them in jenny would not have accepted a cup of coffee from the everpresent percolator but was surprised when it wasnt offered whats the puppys name beth asked randy maude said joes decided hes another randy naturally jenny commented somehow i knew joe wouldnt just forget that other little dog so quickly hes much too goodhearted they were sitting at the kitchen table she smiled at the other woman but to her astonishment maudes face showed worried hostility you leave my boy alone mrs krueger she burst out hes a simple farm boy and i already got enough worries with the way that brother of mine is bringing joey to the bars with him at night joe moons about you too much as it is maybe its not for me to say but youre married to the most important man in this community and you should realize your position jenny pushed the chair back and stood up what do you mean i think you know what i mean with a woman like you theres bound to be trouble my brothers life was spoiled because of that accident in the dairy barn you got to have heard that john krueger felt my brother was careless with the work light cause he got so flustered around caroline joes all i got he means the world to me i dont want accidents or problems now that she had started the words tumbled from her mouth beth and tina stopped playing with the puppy uncertainly they clasped hands and something else it may not be my place but youre awful foolish to have your exhusband sneaking around here when everyone knows erich is in his cabin painting what are you talking about im no gossip and this aint passed my lips but one night last month that actor exhusband of yours came here looking for directions hes a talky one introduced himself boasted you invited him down said hed just been hired by the guthrie i pointed the road to your place myself but let me tell you i wasnt happy about doing it you must immediately phone sheriff gunderson and tell him what you know jenny said keeping her voice as steady as she could kevin never arrived at our house that night the sheriff is inquiring for him hes officially listed as a missing person he never got to your house maudes normally strong voice became louder no he did not please call sheriff gunderson immediately and thank you for letting us visit the puppy kevin had been in maudes house he had specifically told maude that she jenny had called him maude had pointed the way to the krueger farmhouse a threeminute drive away and kevin had not arrived if sheriff gunderson had been insolent with his insinuations today what would he be like now mommy youre hurting my hand beth protested oh sorry love i didnt mean to squeeze it she had to get out of here no that was impossible she couldnt leave until she knew what had happened to kevin and beyond that she was carrying in her womb the microcosm of a human being who was a fifthgeneration krueger who belonged to this place whose birthright was this land afterward jenny thought of that evening of april as the final calm hours erich was not in the house when she and the girls got home im glad she thought at least she would not have to keep up some sort of pretense the next time she saw him she would tell him what maude had told her maude had probably called the sheriff already would he come back here tonight somehow she didnt think so but why would kevin tell people shed called him what had happened to him what do you want for dinner ladies she asked frankfurters beth said positively ice cream was tinas hopeful contribution sounds terrific jenny said somehow shed felt the girls slipping away from her that wouldnt happen tonight recklessly she let the girls bring their plates to the couch the wizard of oz was on companionably nibbling frankfurters and sipping cokes they huddled together as they watched it by the time it was over tina was asleep in jennys lap and beths head was drooping on her shoulder she carried them both upstairs just over three months had passed since that wintry evening when shed been carrying them home from the daycare center and erich had caught up with them there was no use thinking about that he probably would stay in the cabin again even so she didnt want to sleep in the master bedroom she undressed the children buttoned them into pajamas patted their faces and hands with a warm washcloth and tucked them into bed her back hurt she should not carry them anymore too much weight too much of a strain it didnt take long to stack the dishwasher carefully she examined the couch for signs of crumbs she remembered the nights in the apartment when if she was very tired she left the dishes stacked and rinsed in the sink and got into bed with a cup of tea and a good book i didnt know when i was well off she thought and then she remembered the leaky ceiling rushing the girls to the daycare center the constant worry about money the relentless loneliness when she was finished straightening up it was not quite nine oclock she went through the downstairs rooms checking that no lights had been left on in the dining room she stopped under carolines quilt caroline had wanted to paint and had been shamed and ridiculed away from her art shed done something useful it had taken caroline eleven years before shed been driven away had she too experienced the sensation of being the outsider who did not belong slowly climbing the stairs jenny realized how close she felt to the woman who had lived in this house she wondered if caroline had entered the master bedroom with the same sense of hopeless entrapment that she now felt it was midmorning before sheriff gunderson came back to the house again jenny had had fitful dreams dreams of walking in the forest and smelling the pine trees was she looking for the cabin when she woke up she became ill how much of the earlymorning nausea had to do with the physical aspect of pregnancy and how much was the result of the anxiety over kevins disappearance elsa came in as usual at nine oclock dour silent vanishing upstairs with vacuum and window cleaners and polishing rags she was still reading to the girls when wendell gunderson came she had not yet dressed but was wearing a warm wool robe over her nightgown would erich object to her talking to the sheriff in her robe no how could he the robe zipped up to her neck she knew she was pale shed tied her hair at the nape of her neck the sheriff came to the front door mrs krueger she detected a pitch of excitement mrs krueger he repeated his voice deepening last night i received a call from maude ekers i asked her to phone you jenny said so she claims i didnt talk to you right away because i decided to figure out where kevin macpartland might have driven if he didnt come here was it possible the sheriff did believe her his face his voice were so serious no he looked like a poker player about to play his winning card i realized it could happen that a stranger might miss your gate if he turned off on the bend that leads to the riverbank the riverbank oh dear god jenny thought could kevin have made that turn and kept driving maybe driving quickly and then gone over the bank that road was so dark we investigated and im sorry to say thats what happened the sheriff said we found a latemodel white buick in the water near the shoreline its crusted by ice and that thick brush keeps anyone walking on the bank from seeing it we pulled it out kevin she knew what he would tell her kevins face flashed before her mind a mans body is in the car mrs krueger its badly decomposed but generally answers the description of the missing kevin macpartland including the clothing he was wearing when last seen the drivers license in his pocket is macpartlands oh kevin jenny mourned silently oh kevin she tried to speak but could not we will need you to give us positive identification as soon as possible no she wanted to shriek no kevin was so vain he worried about a blemish badly decomposed oh god mrs krueger you may want to engage a lawyer why because therell be an inquest into macpartlands death and some tough questions will be asked you dont have to say anything more ill answer any questions you have now all right im going to ask you again did kevin macpartland come to this house that monday night march ninth no i told you no mrs macpartland do you own a fulllength maroon thermal winter coat yes i do no i mean i did i gave it away why do you remember where you purchased it yes in macys in new york im afraid you have a lot of explaining to do mrs krueger a womans coat was found on the seat next to the body a maroon thermal coat with the label of macys department store well need you to look at it and see if its the one you claim you gave away the inquest was held a week later for jenny the week was a blur of unfocused pain in the morgue she stared down at the stretcher kevins face was mutilated but still recognizable with the long straight nose the curve of the forehead the thick dark red hair memories of their wedding day in st monicas kept flashing back to her i jennifer take thee kevin till death do us part never had her life been more entwined with his than now oh kevin why did you follow me here mrs krueger sheriff gundersons voice urging the identification her throat closed she hadnt even been able to swallow tea this morning yes she whispered thats my husband a low harsh laugh behind her erich oh erich i didnt mean but he was gone his footsteps decisively slapping the tiled floor when she got to the car he was there stonyfaced and did not speak to her on the way home during the inquest the same questions were asked a dozen different ways mrs krueger kevin macpartland told a number of people you had invited him to come to your home in your husbands absence i did not mrs krueger what is the phone number of your home she gave it do you know the telephone number of the guthrie theater i do not let me tell you or perhaps refresh your memory it is is it familiar to you no mrs krueger i am holding a copy of the march telephone bill from krueger farm a call to the guthrie theater appears on this bill dated march ninth do you still deny making that call yes i do is this your coat mrs krueger yes i gave it away do you have a key to the krueger residence yes but ive mislaid it the coat she thought of course it was in the pocket of the coat she told the prosecutor that he held up something a key the ring had her initials jk the key erich had given her is this your key it looks like it did you give it to anyone mrs krueger please tell us the truth no i did not this key was found in kevin macpartlands hand thats impossible on the stand maude unhappily doggedly repeated the story she had told jenny he said his exwife wanted to see him and i pointed the road im very sure of the date he came the night after my sons dog was killed clyde toomis on the stand was embarrassed tonguetied but patiently honest i told my wife she had her own good everyday winter coat i scolded her for accepting it i put that maroon coat back in the closet in the hall off the kitchen of krueger farmhouse myself put it there the very day my wife wore it home did mrs krueger know that dont know how she coulda missed it the closet aint that big and i hung it right next to that ski jacket she wears all the time i didnt notice jenny thought but knew it was possible she simply hadnt paid attention erich testified the questions were brief respectful mr krueger were you at home the night of monday march ninth did you make known your plans to paint in your cabin that night were you aware your wife had been in contact with her former husband erich might have been talking about a stranger he answered with detachment weighing his words unemotional jenny sat in the first row watching him not for a second did his glance meet hers erich who hated even talking on the phone erich who was one of the most private people she had ever known who had become estranged from her because he was upset about kevins phone call and her meeting with him the inquest was over when he summed up the coroner said that a severe bruise on the right temple of the deceased might have been incurred during the impact of the crash or might have been inflicted previous to it the official verdict was death by drowning but as jenny left the courthouse she knew the verdict that the community had passed at the least she was a woman who had been seeing her former husband clandestinely at the worst she had murdered him in the three weeks that followed the inquest the dinners erich ate with her fell into a pattern he never spoke directly to her only to the girls he would say ask mommy to pass the rolls tinker bell his tone was always warm and affectionate it would have taken sensitive ears to pick up the tension between them when she put the girls to bed she never knew whether she would find him still in the house when she came downstairs she wondered where he went to the cabin to the home of friends she dared not ask if he did sleep in the house it was in the rear bedroom that his father had used for so many years there was no one she could talk to something told her that he would get over it there were times she caught him looking at her with such tenderness in his face that she had to restrain herself from putting her arms around him begging him to believe in her quietly she mourned the waste of kevins life he could have accomplished so much he had been so talented if only he had disciplined himself stayed away from involvements with women drunk less but how did her coat get in the car one night she came downstairs to find erich sipping coffee at the kitchen table jenny he said we have to talk not sure whether the emotion she felt was relief or anxiety she sat down after the girls were settled shed showered and put on her nightgown and the robe nana had given her she watched as erich studied her that red is perfect against your hair dark cloud on scarlet symbolic isnt it like dark secrets in a scarlet woman is that why you wear it so this was to be the talk i put it on because i was cold jenny said its very becoming maybe youre expecting someone odd she thought in the midst of all this i can still feel sorry for him what had been worse for him she wondered suddenly carolines death or the fact that caroline had been planning to leave him im not expecting anyone erich if you think i am why not stay with me every night and reassure yourself she knew she should be outraged and furious but there was no emotion left in her except pity for him he looked so troubled so vulnerable always when he was upset he seemed younger almost boyish erich im so sorry about all this i know people are gossiping and how distressing this must be for you i dont have any logical explanation for what happened your coat i dont know how it got in that car you expect me to believe that i would believe you jenny i want to believe you and i cant but i do believe this if you agreed to let macpartland come here maybe you did want to warn him to stay away from us i can accept that but i cant live with the lie admit you invited him down here and ill put this behind us i can see how it happened you didnt want to bring him in the house so you had him drive to the dead end at the riverbank you warned him and you had your key in your hand maybe he made a pass at you did you struggle you slid out of your coat and got out of the car maybe when he went to reverse he went forward jenny its understandable but say so just dont look at me with those wide innocent eyes dont look thin and wan like some kind of wounded victim admit youre a liar and i promise ill never mention this again we love each other so much its still there all that love at least he was being totally honest she felt as though she were sitting on a mountain looking down into a valley observing what was going on a disinterested spectator it would almost be easier to do what you wanted she observed but its funny were all the sum total of our lives nana despised liars she was contemptuous of even the social life jenny she used to say dont evade if you dont want to go on a date with someone just say no thank you not that you have a headache or have to do math homework truth serves everyone best were not talking about math homework erich said im going to bed erich she said good night there was no point in continuing like this such a short time ago theyd gone upstairs arms around each other to think shed objected to wearing the aqua nightgown it was so unimportant in retrospect erich did not answer her even though she went up the stairs slowly giving him the chance to respond she dropped off to sleep quickly the exhaustion weighing her down forcing her into weary dreams she slept restlessly always just under the conscious level aware of herself moving around the bed she was dreaming again this time she was in the car struggling with kevin he wanted the key then she was in the woods walking in them searching she flung up her arm to push away the nearness of the trees and touched flesh her fingers felt the outline of a forehead the soft membrane of an eyelid long hair brushed her cheek biting her lips over the scream that tried to escape her throat she bolted up and fumbled for the nighttable light she snapped it on and looked around wildly there was no one there she was alone in bed in the room she sank back on the pillows her body trembling helplessly even her facial muscles were twitching im going crazy she thought im losing my mind for the rest of the night she did not turn off the light and the first rays of dawn were filtering through the drawn shades before she finally fell asleep jenny awoke to bright sunlight and instantly remembered what had happened a bad dream she thought a nightmare embarrassed she snapped off the table lamp and got out of bed the weather was finally breaking she stood at the window looking out at the woods the trees were a mass of opening buds from the chicken house she heard the strident crowing of the largest roosters opening the windows she listened to the sounds of the farm smiled as she heard the new calves bawling for their mothers of course it had been a nightmare even so the vivid memory made her perspire a cold clammy sweat it had seemed so real the feeling of touching a face could she be hallucinating and the dream about being in the car with kevin struggling with him could she have phoned kevin shed been so upset that day thinking about what erich said at the birthday dinner realizing that kevin could destroy her marriage could she have forgotten that she called kevin and asked to see him the concussion from the accident the doctor had warned her to take any future headaches seriously shed been having headaches she showered tied her hair in a knot at the top of her head pulled on jeans and a heavy wool sweater the girls werent awake yet maybe if she was very calm shed be able to eat some breakfast she must have lost ten pounds in these three months it was bound to be bad for the baby just as she put the kettle on she saw rooneys head bob past the window this time rooney knocked rooneys eyes were clear her face composed i had to see you sit down rooney coffee or tea jenny today rooney had none of the vagueness ive hurt you but ill try to make amends how could you hurt me rooneys eyes filled with tears ive been feeling so much better with you here a young pretty girl to talk to teaching you to sew its made me so happy and i didnt blame you a bit for meeting him krueger men arent easy to live with caroline found that out so i understand and i never was going to talk about it not ever talk about what rooney there cant be anything to be so upset about there is oh jenny there is last night i got one of my spells you know i just keep talking but this time i told clyde how i came to show you the blue corduroy that monday night after carolines anniversary to see if you liked the color it was late near ten oclock but being it was so near the anniversary i was restless and i thought id just look and see if your light was on in the kitchen and you were just getting in the white car i saw you get in i saw you drive away with him down the road to the riverbank but i swear jenny i never planned to tell i couldnt hurt you jenny put her arms around the trembling woman i know you wouldnt hurt me i did go with kevin she thought i did go no i dont believe that i cant believe that and clyde said it was his duty to tell erich and the sheriff rooney sobbed this morning i told clyde i made it up that i got all mixed up but clyde said he remembers he woke up that night and id just come in with the material under my arm and he was mad id gone out hes going to talk to erich and the sheriff jenny im going to lie for you i dont care but im causing trouble for you rooney jenny said carefully try to understand i think you are mistaken i was in bed that night i never asked kevin to come here you wouldnt be lying if you tell them you got confused i promise you that rooney sighed id like that coffee now i love you jenny sometimes when youre here i can start to believe that arden may never come back and that ill get over it someday it was later in the morning that they came into the house together the sheriff erich and mark why mark you know why were here mrs krueger she listened attentively they were talking about someone else someone she didnt know who had been seen getting into a car driving away erich didnt look angry anymore only sorrowful apparently rooney is trying to retract her statement but we couldnt keep this information from sheriff gunderson he came over to her now put his hands on her face smoothed her hair jenny wondered why she felt as though she were being stripped in public my darling erich said these are your friends tell the truth she reached up grasped his hands pulling them from her face otherwise she would suffocate i have told the truth as i know it she said you ever had spells of any kind mrs krueger the sheriffs voice was not unkind i did have a concussion once briefly she told them about the accident all the time she was aware of mark garretts eyes studying her he probably thinks im making this up she thought mrs krueger were you still in love with kevin macpartland what a terrible question to ask in front of erich jenny thought how humiliating this is for him if only she could go away take the girls leave him to his own life but she was carrying his child erich would love his son it would be a boy she was certain of that not in the way i presume you mean she said isnt it true that you showed public affection for him to the point where the waitress and two patrons of the groveland inn were shocked for a moment jenny thought she would laugh they shock easily kevin kissed me when i left i didnt kiss him perhaps i should ask it this way mrs krueger werent you pretty upset about your exhusband showing up wasnt he a threat to your marriage what do you mean initially you gave out to mr krueger that you were a widow mr kruegers a wealthy man hes adopting your kids macpartland coulda ruined your pretty setup jenny looked at erich she was about to say that the adoption papers would show that kevin had signed them that erich knew about kevin before their marriage but what point this was hard enough on erich without having his friends and neighbors know that he had deliberately lied to them she evaded the direct question my husband and i were in complete agreement we did not want kevin to come to the house and upset the children but the waitress heard him tell you that he wasnt giving up that he wasnt letting the adoption go through she heard you say i warn you kevin so he was a threat to your marriage wasnt he mrs krueger why didnt erich help her she looked at him and watched his face darken with anger sheriff i think this has gone far enough he said firmly nothing could ever upset our marriage certainly not kevin macpartland alive or dead we all know rooney is mentally ill my wife denies being in that car are you prepared to press charges if not i demand that you stop harassing her the sheriff nodded okay erich but i have to warn you theres a possibility the inquest will be reopened if it is well face it to a degree he had defended her jenny realized she was surprised at his matteroffact attitude was he becoming resigned to notoriety im not saying it will be whether or not rooneys testimony would change anything im not sure until mrs krueger starts remembering exactly what happened were not much further along than we were up till now i dont think there was much doubt in any jurors mind that she was in that car at some point erich walked the sheriff to his car they stood for a few minutes deep in conversation mark lingered behind them jenny id like to make an appointment for you with a doctor there was deep concern in his face was it for her or for erich a shrink i suppose no a good oldfashioned family doctor i know one in waverly you dont look well this certainly has been a strain for you ill hold off a bit i think but thanks she had to get out of the house the girls were playing in their room she went upstairs and got them lets go for a walk it was springlike outside can we ride tina asked not now beth said positively daddy said hell take us i want to give tinker bell sugar sure lets go to the stable jenny agreed for a moment she allowed herself to daydream wouldnt it be wonderful if erich were saddling baron and she were on fire maid and they could go riding together on a beautiful day like this theyd planned that looked forward to it a somberfaced joe was in the stable since shed become aware that erich was angry and jealous about her friendship with joe shed made it a point to avoid him as much as possible hows randy the second she asked hes fine he and i live in town now with my uncle weve got a place over the post office youll have to come and see him there you left your mother you bet i did joe tell me why did you move out of your mothers place because shes a troublemaker im just sick mrs krueger jenny about the things she said to you i told her if you say you didnt see that fellow kevin that night its because it was necessary for you to say it i told her you been so good to me id a lost my job when baron got away cept for you if mawd minded her business you wouldnt a had all that awful talk round here that aint the first time a car went off that road down the riverbank people woulda said thats a shame and somebody woulda said we need a better sign instead everybody in this county is snickering about you and mr krueger and saying shows what happens when you get your head turned by a gold digger from new york joe please jenny put her hand on his arm ive caused enough trouble here your mother must be upset joe please move back home no way and mrs krueger if you want a ride anywhere or if the girls want to see randy ill be happy to bring you on my own time you just say the word sshh joe that kind of talk doesnt help she gestured toward the open doors please someone might hear you i dont care who hears me the anger died from his face jenny id do anything to help you mommy lets go now beth pulled at her but what was it joe had said that was nagging at her she remembered joe whatever you said to your mother about it being necessary for me to say i wasnt in the car joe why did you put it that way his face flamed red awkwardly he thrust his hands in his pocket halfturned from her when he spoke his voice was a nearwhisper jenny you dont have to pretend with me i was there i was worried that maybe i hadnt locked barons stall door tight i was just cutting across the orchard when i saw rooney she was almost at the big house i stopped cause i didnt want to get stuck talking to her then the car pulled up that white buick and the front door opened and you ran out of the house i saw you get in the car jenny but i swear to god ill never tell anyone i i love you jenny tentatively he took his hand from his pocket and closed it over her arm erich came in just as the sun began to send slanting rays across the fields jenny had decided that no matter what it was time to tell him about the baby he made it unexpectedly easy he had brought canvases from the cabin the ones he was planning to exhibit in san francisco what do you think of them he asked her there was nothing in his voice or manner to suggest that the exchange with sheriff gunderson had taken place this morning theyre wonderful erich shall i tell him what joe said should i wait when i go to a doctor maybe i can find out if amnesia spells can happen to pregnant women erich was looking at her curiously do you want to come to san francisco with me jenny lets talk about it later he put his arms around her dont be afraid darling ill take care of you today when gunderson was badgering you i realized that no matter what happened that night youre my whole life i need you erich im so confused why is that darling erich i dont remember going out with kevin but rooney wouldnt lie dont worry shes not a reliable witness its a good thing gunderson told me that hed reopen the inquest in a shot if she were you mean if someone else came forward and claimed to have seen me get in that car theyd reopen the inquest and maybe charge me with a crime theres no need to talk about it theres no other witness oh yes there is jenny thought could anyone have overheard joe today his voice was loud joes mother was starting to worry that joe like his uncle had a tendency to drink suppose sometime in a bar he confided that hed seen her get in the car with kevin could i have forgotten that i went out she asked erich he put his arms around her his hands stroked her hair it would have been a shocking experience your coat was off he had the key in his hand when he was found maybe as i suggested to you kevin made a pass at you grabbed the key maybe you resisted him the car started to roll you got out before it went over the bank i dont know jenny said i cant believe it later when it was time to go upstairs erich said wear the aqua gown darling i cant cant why not its too small for me im going to have a baby kevin had responded with dismay the first time she told him she thought she was pregnant hell jen we cant afford it get rid of it now erich shouted with joy my darling oh jen thats the reason youve been looking so ill oh my sweet will it be a boy im sure it is jenny laughed savoring the momentary release from anxiety hes already given me a harder time in three months than both girls did in nine well have to get you right to a good doctor my son do you mind if we call him erich its the family tradition i want it that way with her wrapped in his arms on the couch all the mistrust between them was forgotten jen weve had a rotten break well put all this misery behind us well have a big party when i come back from san francisco you shouldnt travel now should you not if you havent been feeling well well face this community down well be a real family the adoption will be complete by the summer im sorry for macpartland but at least hes not a threat anymore oh jen not a threat jenny thought should she tell erich about joe no this was the babys night finally they went upstairs erich was already in bed when she came out of the bathroom ive missed sleeping with you jen he said ive been so lonely ive been so lonely too the intense physical relationship between them heightened and fired by separation helped her forget the weeks of suffering i love you jenny i love you so erich i thought id go crazy feeling so estranged from you i know jen yes darling im anxious to see whom the baby looks like mmm i hope like you just like you how much i hope that too his breathing became even she began to drift off to sleep then felt that shed been slapped with ice water oh god erich couldnt doubt that he was the babys father could he of course not it was just that her nerves were so shot everything upset her but it was the way hed put it in the morning he said i heard you crying in your sleep last night darling i wasnt aware of it i love you jenny love is trust erich please darling remember love and trust go hand in hand three days later he took her to an obstetrician in granite place when she met dr elmendorf she liked him instantly he was anywhere between fifty and sixtyfive small and bald with knowing eyes youve been spotting mrs krueger yes but that happened both times before and i was fine did you lose so much weight at the beginning of your first two pregnancies no were you always anemic no were there any complications about your own birth i dont know i was adopted my grandmother never mentioned anything i was born in new york city thats about all i know of my background i see weve got to build you up im aware youve been under a great strain what a delicate way of putting it jenny thought ill want to start you on vitamins also no lifting no pushing or hauling get a great deal of rest erich was sitting beside her he reached for her hand and stroked it ill take good care of her doctor the eyes rested on erich speculatively i think it would be well if you abstain from marital relations for the next month at least and possibly through the pregnancy if the spotting continues will that be too much of a problem nothing is too much of a problem if it means that jenny will have a healthy child the doctor nodded approvingly but it is a problem jenny thought dismayed you see doctor our marital relations give us the one area where we are simply two people who love and want each other and we manage to close the door on jealousy and suspicion and outside pressures the late spring was warm with afternoon showers and the rich abundant land became thick and green the tough heady alfalfa plants now decorated with blue blossoms were ready for the first cutting of the season cattle strayed far away from the polebarns happy with the grazing in the sloping fields that led to the riverbank tree branches rustled against each other dressed in the leaves that made a solid green wall of the edge of the woods deer sometimes ran through that wall paused listened then escaped back into the protective arms of the trees even the house brightened with the fair weather rigid as they were the heavy curtains could not withstand the delicate breezes that brought the scent of irises and violets and sunflowers and roses indoors for jenny the change was welcome the warmth of the spring sun seemed to penetrate the constant chill of her body the scent of flowers in the house almost overcame the pervasive hint of pine in the mornings she would get out of bed open the windows and lie back against the pillows enjoying the fresh delicate breeze the pills for morning sickness werent helping every morning she was racked by nausea erich insisted she stay in bed he brought her tea and saltines and after a while the feeling would subside he stayed in the house every night now i dont want you to be alone darling and im all ready for the san francisco exhibit he was leaving on the twentythird of may by then dr elmendorf said youll probably be feeling a lot better i hope so are you sure youre not interrupting your painting very sure its good to spend more time with the girls and face it jen between clyde on the farm and the manager at the limeworks and emilys father at the bank i can manage my time my way now it was erich who took the girls to the stable during the mornings and led them on their ponies rooney came over regularly the sweater jenny was knitting was going well and she was already starting jenny on a patchwork quilt jenny was still helpless to explain how her coat got in kevins car suppose kevin did come down and tried that door on the west porch it could have been unlocked suppose he came in the closet door was right there he might have panicked after all he didnt know whether or not a housekeeper slept in perhaps he took her coat planning to insinuate that hed seen her started driving away took the wrong turn put his hand in the pocket in the hope of finding money pulled out the key and with that the car went off the bank it still didnt explain the phone call after their nap the girls loved to roam in the fields jenny sat on the west porch watching them as her fingers knitted the rows of wool or made patchwork squares rooney had dug up material from the attic leftover goods that had been used for dresses long ago a bag of scraps a bolt of dark blue cotton john bought that blue material for me to make curtains for the back bedroom when he took it over i warned him theyd be too dark he hated to admit it but he had me take them down after a couple of months then i made the ones that are there now somehow jenny could not bring herself to sit in carolines swing instead she chose a wicker chair highbacked with comfortable cushions nevertheless caroline had sat on this porch sewing watching her child play in these fields she no longer felt the lack of company now she always refused erichs suggestions of dinner at one of the local restaurants not yet erich i dont even like the smell of food he began taking the children with him when he went out on errands they came back chatting about the people theyd met the places where theyd stopped to visit and stayed for cookies and milk now erich always slept in the back bedroom jen its easier this way i can stay away from you if im not too near you but i cant lie beside you night after night and not have my hands on you besides youre a restless sleeper youll probably sleep better alone she should be grateful but she wasnt the nightmares happened regularly over and over again shed had that sensation of touching flesh a face in the dark of feeling long hair against her cheek she didnt dare tell him that hed surely think she was mad the day before he was to leave for san francisco he suggested she go to the stable with him the morning nausea hadnt occurred for two days id rather you be there when the girls ride im getting pretty unhappy with joe a quick thrill of worry why ive heard rumors hes boozing it up every night with his uncle josh brothers is exactly the wrong influence on joe at this stage anyhow if you think he seems hung over i dont want the girls out with him i may have to get rid of him mark was in the stable his normally calm voice was raised and icy dont you know how dangerous it is to leave rat poison five feet from the oat supply suppose some of it got mixed in with the feed those horses would go crazy what the hell is the matter with you lately joe let me tell you if this happens again ill recommend that erich fire you those children ride the ponies every day erichs horse is hard enough to handle even for an experienced rider like him give baron a taste of the strychnine in that stuff and hed trample anyone who came near him erich dropped jennys arm whats all this about a redfaced joe who seemed on the verge of tears admitted i was going to put the poison in the traps i pulled the box in here when it started to rain and i forgot it youre fired erich said evenly joe looked at jenny was there something significant in his expression or simple pleading she wasnt sure she stepped forward took erichs hand please erich joes been wonderful with the children hes so patient teaching them to ride theyd miss him terribly erich studied her face if it means that much to you he said shortly then turned back to joe any mistake joe any mistake a stall door open a dog running around my property this sort of thing he glanced contemptuously at the box of rat poison thats it got it yes sir joe whispered thank you sir thank you mrs krueger and make sure its mrs krueger erich snapped jenny i dont want the girls riding till i come back is that clear yes she agreed with him joe looked ill there was a bruise on his forehead mark left the stable with them youve got a new calf in the dairy barn erich thats why im here keep an eye on joe he was in another fight last night what the hell is he fighting about erich asked irritably marks face closed give people not used to liquor a couple of boilermakers and you dont need much excuse come back to lunch with us erich suggested we havent seen much of you please come jenny murmured they walked up to the house together you two go on in erich suggested mark pour us a sherry will you i want to pick up the mail at the office sure thing he waited until erich was out of earshot then said quickly two things jenny i heard the good news about the baby congratulations how do you feel much better now jenny i have to warn you it was very good of you to save joes job for him but its a mistaken kindness the reason hes getting into fights is that hes too open about his feelings for you he worships you and the guys who hang around the bars at night are teasing him about it joe would be better off far away from this farm and from me bluntly yes when erich was leaving for san francisco he decided to drive the cadillac to the airport and leave it there unless you particularly want to use it darling was there an edge to the question the last time hed been away shed used the car to meet kevin i dont want it she said quietly elsa can pick up anything i need you have your vitamins plenty of them if you dont feel well clyde will drive you to the doctor they were at the door girls erich called come give daddy a kiss they ran to him bring me a present beth begged me too tina chimed in oh erich before you go tell the girls that you dont want them on the ponies until you get back daddy there were two wails of protest oh i dont know joe came to apologize to me says he knows hes been offbase hes even going to move back in with his mother i think its all right to let him take the girls out you just be sure to be with them every minute jen id rather not she said evenly any reason his eyebrows quirked she thought of what mark had told her but there was no way she could discuss that with erich if youre sure its safe his arms were around her ill miss you ill miss you too she walked with him to the car clyde had driven it out of the garage joe was polishing it with a soft cloth rooney was standing by it ready to come in and sew with jenny mark had come over to say goodbye ill call you as soon as i get to the hotel erich told jenny that will be ten your time that night she lay in bed waiting for the phone to ring this house is too large she thought anyone could come in the front door the west door the back door come up the back staircase and id never hear him or her the keys were hanging in the office they were locked up at night but often during the day the office was empty suppose someone took a house key made a copy and returned the first key to the office no one would ever know why am i worrying about that now she wondered it was just that dream that recurring dream of touching flesh of her fingers grazing a cheek an ear hair it was happening almost nightly now and always the same the heavy scent of pine the feeling of a presence the touching and then a faint sighing sound and always when she turned on the light the room was empty if only she could talk to someone about it but who dr elmendorf would suggest she see a psychiatrist she was sure of that thats all granite place would need she thought now that krueger woman is going to have her head examined it was not quite ten oclock the phone rang quickly she picked it up hello the line was dead no she could hear something not breathing but something hello she felt herself start to tremble jenny the voice was a whisper who is this jenny are you alone who is this have you got another boyfriend from new york with you yet jenny does he like to swim what are you talking about now the voice burst forth a shriek a scream halflaugh halfsob unrecognizable whore murderer get out of carolines bed get out of it now she slammed the phone down oh god help me she held her hands against her cheek feeling a tic under her eye oh god the phone rang i wont pick it up i wont four times five times six times it stopped it began to ring again erich she thought it was after ten oclock she grabbed the receiver jenny erichs voice was concerned whats the matter i called a few minutes ago and the line was busy then no answer are you all right who was on the phone i dont know it was just a voice her own voice was near hysteria you sound upset what did whoever called you say i i couldnt make out the words she couldnt tell him i see a long pause then in a resigned tone erich said we wont discuss it now what do you mean we wont discuss it shocked jenny heard the shriek in her own voice she sounded exactly like the caller i want to discuss it listen listen to what they said sobbing she told him who would accuse me like that who could hate me so much darling calm yourself please but erich who darling think it was rooney of course but why rooney likes me she may like you but she loved caroline she wants caroline back and when she gets upset she sees you as an intruder darling i warned you about her jenny please dont cry its going to be all right ill take care of you ill always take care of you sometime during the long sleepless night the cramps began first they were shooting pains in her abdomen then they settled into a steady offon pattern at eight she phoned dr elmendorf youd better come in he told her clyde had left early for a cattle auction and had taken rooney with him she didnt dare ask joe to drive her there were a halfdozen other men on the farm the daily help who came in the morning and went to their own homes at night she knew their names and faces but erich had always cautioned her not to get familiar she didnt want to ask one of them she called mark and explained by any chance his answer was prompt no problem if you dont mind waiting until after office hours for me to drive you back or better still my dad can do it he just got up from florida hell stay most of the summer with me marks father luke garrett jenny was anxious to meet him mark came for her at ninefifteen the morning was warm and hazy it would be a hot day jenny had gone to her closet for something to wear and realized that all the new clothes erich bought her when they were married were for cool weather shed had to rummage to find a summer cotton from last year in new york putting it on shed felt peculiarly herself again the twopiece pinkchecked dress was an albert capraro one shed bought at an endoftheseason sale the soft wide skirt was only a little tight at the waist the blouson top concealed her thinness marks car was a fouryearold chrysler station wagon his bag was tossed in the back a stack of books was scattered next to it on the seat the car had an air of comfortable untidiness it was the first time shed ever really been alone with mark ill bet even the animals know instinctively hell make things better when hes around she thought she told him that he glanced over at her id like to think so and i hope elmendorf is having the same effect on you hes a good doctor jenny you can trust him i do they drove down the dirt road that led past the farm into granite place acre on acre of krueger land she thought all those animals grazing on the fields krueger prize cattle and i really had visualized a pleasant farmhouse and some cornfields i never understood mark said i dont know whether you heard that joe is moving back in with his mother erich told me the best possible situation maude is a smart woman drink runs in that family shell keep a tight rein on joe i thought her brother started drinking because of the accident i wonder i heard my father and john krueger talk about it afterward john always said that josh brothers had been drinking that day maybe the accident was his excuse for coming out in the open with his boozing will erich ever forgive me for all this gossip its destroying our marriage she hadnt expected to ask the question she heard it come from her flat and lifeless did she dare tell mark about the phone call about erichs response to it jenny there was a long silence then mark began to speak shed already noticed that his voice had a tendency to deepen when he was particularly intent on what he was saying jenny i cant tell you what a different person erich is since the first day he came back here after meeting you hes always been a loner hes always spent a lot of time in that cabin now of course we understand why but even so picture it i doubt whether john krueger ever so much as kissed erich when he was a child caroline was the kind whod scoop you up hug you when you came in run her fingers through your hair when she talked to you people around here arent like that were not outwardly expressive caroline was halfitalian as you know i remember my father teasing her about that latin warmth in her can you imagine what it must have been like for erich to know she was planning to leave him no wonder he was so upset about your former husband just give him time the gossip will die down by next month people will have something else to chew on you make it sound so easy not easy but maybe not as bad as you think he dropped her at the doctors office ill just sit out here and catch up on some reading you shouldnt be too long the obstetrician did not mince words youve had false labor and i certainly dont like it at this stage you havent been exerting yourself no youve lost more weight i just cant eat for the sake of the baby youve got to try malted milks ice cream just get something down and stay off your feet as much as possible are you worried about anything yes doctor she wanted to say im worried because i dont know who calls me when my husband is away is rooney sicker than i realize how about maude she resents the kruegers particularly resents me who else knows so much about when erich is away are you worried about anything mrs krueger he repeated not really she told mark what the doctor had said his arm was slung around the back of the seat hes so big she thought so overpoweringly comfortably male she could not imagine him exploding in fury he had been reading now he tossed the book in the backseat and started the car jenny he suggested dont you have a friend or a cousin or someone who could come out and spend a couple of months with you you seem so alone here i think that might help to take your mind off things fran jenny thought with absolute longing she wanted fran to come and visit she thought of the amusing evenings they had spent together while fran expounded on her latest boyfriend but erich disliked fran intensely hed told her to make sure that fran didnt visit jenny thought of some of her other friends none of them could spend nearly four hundred dollars to fly out for a weekend visit they had jobs and families no she said i dont have anyone who can come the garrett farm was on the north end of granite place were small potatoes next to erich mark said we have a section six hundred and forty acres i have my clinic right on the property the farmhouse was like the one shed pictured erich would have large and white blackshuttered with a wide front porch the parlor was lined with bookshelves marks father was reading in an easy chair there he looked up when they came in jenny watched as a startled expression came over his face he was a big man too with rangy shoulders the thick hair was pure white but the part broke at the same place as his sons his reading glasses enhanced his bluegray eyes and his lashes were graywhite marks were dark but lukes eyes had that same quizzical expression you have to be jenny krueger yes i am jenny liked him at once no wonder erich he stopped ive been anxious to meet you id hoped to get the chance when i was here in late february you were here in february jenny turned to mark why didnt you bring your father over mark shrugged erich pretty well sent out signals you two were doing an athome honeymoon jenny ive got ten minutes before the clinic opens what would you like tea coffee mark disappeared into the kitchen and she was alone with luke garrett she felt as though she were being looked over by the school counselor as though any minute hed ask and how do you like your courses are you comfortable with your teachers she told him that he smiled maybe i am analyzing how is it going how much have you heard the accident the inquest youve heard she raised her hands as though pushing away a weight that was closing in on her i cant blame people for thinking the worst my coat was in the car a woman did call the guthrie theater from our telephone that afternoon i keep thinking theres a reasonable explanation and once i find it out everything will be all right again she hesitated then decided against discussing rooney with him if rooney had made that call last night in one of her spells shed probably have forgotten it by now and jenny did not want to repeat what the caller had said to her mark came in followed by a short stocky woman carrying a tray the warm enticing scent of coffee cake reminded jenny of nanas one great baking success a bisquick coffee cake a wave of nostalgia made her blink back tears youre not very happy here are you jenny luke asked i expected to be i could be she replied honestly thats exactly what caroline said luke commented softly remember mark when i was putting her bags in the car that last afternoon a few minutes later mark left for the clinic and luke drove her home he seemed quiet and distracted and after a few efforts at conversation jenny became quiet too luke steered the station wagon through the main gate they circled around to the west entrance she saw lukes eyes rest on the porch swing the problem he said suddenly is that this place doesnt change if you took a picture of this house and compared it to one that was thirty years old it would be the same nothing is added nothing is renovated nothing is moved maybe thats why everyone here has that same feeling of her presence as though the door might fling open and shed come running out always glad to see you always urging you to stay for dinner after marks mother and i were divorced she had mark here so much caroline was a second mother to him and to you jenny asked what was she to you luke looked at her through eyes that were suddenly anguished everything i ever wanted in a woman he cleared his throat abruptly as though fearing he had revealed too much of himself as she got out of the car jenny said when erich comes back promise youll come for dinner with mark id enjoy that jenny sure you have everything yes she started to walk toward the house jenny he called she turned lukes face was filled with pain forgive me its just that you resemble caroline so strongly its rather frightening jenny be careful be careful of accidents erich was due home on june third he called the night of the second jen ive been miserable darling id give anything not to have you so upset she felt the hard knot of tension ease it was as mark said eventually the gossip would blow over if only she could hang on to that thought its all right were going to get through all this how do you feel jen pretty good eating better trying to how did the exhibit go very very well the gramercy trust bought three oils stiff prices too the reviews were fine im so glad what time does your plane get in around eleven i should be home between two and three i love you so much jen that night the room seemed less threatening maybe it will be all right she promised herself for the first time in weeks she slept without dreaming she was sitting at the breakfast table with tina and beth when the screaming started a hideous cacophony of wild neighing and frantic sounds of human pain mommy beth jumped off her chair and ran for the door stay there jenny ordered she ran toward the sounds they were coming from the stable clyde was rushing from the office a rifle in his hand stay back miz krueger stay back she could not joe it was joe who was screaming he was in the stall crouched against the back wall trying frantically to dodge the flying hooves baron was rearing on his hind legs his eyes rolling in his head the sharp metalshod hoofs flailing the air joe was bleeding from the head one arm hung limply at his side as she watched he slumped onto the floor and barons front legs trampled his chest oh god oh god oh god she heard her own voice weeping praying entreating she was shoved aside get out of his way joe im gonna shoot clyde took aim as the hooves reared up again there was a sharp crack of the rifle followed by a screeching protesting neighing baron stood poised statuelike in midair then crumbled into the straw in the stall somehow joe managed to press against the wall to avoid the crushing weight of the falling animal joe lay still his breath coming in sharp gasps his eyes glazed with shock his arm twisted grotesquely clyde threw down the rifle and ran over to him dont move him jenny shouted call for an ambulance hurry trying to avoid barons body she kneeled beside joe her hand smoothing his forehead wiping the blood from his eyes pressing against the gaping tear near his hairline men came running from the fields she could hear the sounds of a woman sobbing maude ekers joey joey maw joey the ambulance arrived efficient whiteclad attendants ordered everyone back then joe was on the stretcher his eyes closed his face ashen an attendants low voice whispered i think hes going there was a shriek from maude ekers joes eyes opened fastening on jenny his voice was bewildered amazingly clear id never a told anyone i saw you get in the car that night honest i wouldnt he said maude turned on jenny as she climbed in the ambulance after her son if my boy dies its your fault jenny krueger she screamed i curse the day you came here god damn you krueger women for what youve done to my family god damn the baby youre carrying whoever it belongs to the ambulance sped away the wail of its siren shattering the peace of the summer morning erich arrived home a few hours later he chartered a plane to fly a chest surgeon down from the mayo clinic and phoned for private nurses then he walked into the stable and crouched beside baron his hand patting the sleek beautiful head of the dead animal mark had already analyzed the bucket of oats the report strychnine mixed with oats later sheriff gunderson showed up at the front door with his now familiar car mrs krueger a halfdozen people heard joe say he wouldnt have told that he saw you get in the car that night what did he mean by that i dont understand what he meant mrs krueger you were present a short time ago when dr garrett admonished joe for leaving the rat poison near the oats you knew what effect it would have on baron you heard dr garrett warn joe that strychnine would drive baron wild did dr garrett tell you that he told me that joe had been careless with the rat poison and that you and erich were present when he dressed joe down what are you trying to say nothing i can say mrs krueger joe claims he got the boxes mixed up i dont believe him no one does will joe live too soon to tell even if he does hell be a mighty sick boy for a long time if he makes it through the next three days theyre moving him up to mayo the sheriff turned to go like his maw said at least hell be safe up there caught up in the rhythm of her pregnancy jenny began counting days and weeks until the baby was due in twelve weeks in eleven weeks in ten weeks erich would have a son he would move back into their room she would be well again the talk in town would die out for lack of fresh fuel the baby would look exactly like erich the operation on joes chest had been successful though he would not leave mayo clinic until the end of august maude was staying in a furnished apartment near the hospital jenny knew that erich was paying all the bills now erich rode fire maid when he took the girls riding he never mentioned baron to her she did hear from mark that joe had persisted in his story that he must have mixed the poison in with the oats himself and that he had no idea what hed meant when he talked about seeing jenny that night she didnt need mark to tell her that no one believed him erich was working less at the cabin and more on the farm with clyde and the men when she asked him about that he said i cant quite get in the mood for painting he was kind to her but remote always she felt that he was watching her in the evenings theyd sit in the parlor and read he rarely spoke to her but when she glanced up shed see his eyes drop as though he didnt want to be caught studying her about once a week sheriff gunderson would drop by seemingly just to chat lets go over the night kevin macpartland came here mrs krueger or he would speculate joe has a real big crush on you dont he enough to make him pretty protective anything you feel like talking about mrs krueger the sensation of someone being in the room with her at night was constant always the pattern was the same she would start dreaming of being in the woods something would come toward her hover over her shed push out her hand and feel long hair a womans hair the sighing sound came next she would fumble for the light and when she turned it on shed be alone in the room finally she told dr elmendorf about the dream how do you explain it he asked i dont know she hesitated no thats not quite true i always think it has something to do with caroline she told him about caroline told him that everyone close to her seemed to have a sense of her presence id guess that your imagination is playing tricks on you would you like me to arrange counseling no im sure youre right she started to sleep with the light on in the room then determinedly snapped it off the bed was to the right of the door the massive headboard was against the north wall one side of the bed was close to the east wall of the room she wondered if erich would move the bed for her so that it was between the windows on the south wall there would be more moonlight there shed be able to look out when she wasnt sleeping the corner where the bed was placed was terribly dark she knew better than to make the request one morning beth asked mommy why didnt you talk to me when you came into my room last night i didnt come to you mouse yes you did was she sleepwalking the tiny flutters of life inside her seemed unlike the sturdy kicks shed known from beth and tina let the baby be healthy she pleaded in silent prayer let me give erich his son the hot august afternoons dissolved into cool evenings the woods held the first touches of gold it will be an early fall rooney commented and by the time the leaves are all turned your quilt will be finished you can hang it in the dining room too jenny avoided mark as much as possible staying in the house whenever she glimpsed his station wagon parked near the office did he too believe she might have deliberately put poison in barons feed she felt she could not stand it if she sensed accusation from him too in early september erich invited mark and luke garrett for dinner he told her about it casually lukes going back to florida until the holidays i havent seen enough of him emilys coming too i can have elsa stay and cook no thats the one thing i get to do around here the first dinner party since the night sheriff gunderson had come to tell her kevin was missing she found herself looking forward to seeing luke again she knew erich went over to the garrett farm regularly hed taken tina and beth with him he never cleared the outings with her anymore hed simply announce ill keep the girls out of your hair for the afternoon get a good rest jen it wasnt that she wanted to go she didnt want to run the risk of seeing any of the townspeople how would they treat her smile to her face and gossip about her as she passed when erich was away with the girls she would take long walks on the farm she would wander along the river and try not to think that kevins car plunged over the bank just around that bend she walked past the cemetery carolines grave was planted with summer flowers she found herself longing to slip into the woods to find erichs cabin once she went fifty yards into them the thick branches blotted out the sun a fox passed her brushing her legs in pursuit of a rabbit startled shed turned back birds nesting in the trees sent up a flutter of protest as she passed shed ordered some maternity clothes from a daytons catalog nearly seven months pregnant she thought and my own clothes arent that much too tight but the new blouses and slacks and skirts buoyed her spirits she remembered how carefully shed shopped when she was pregnant with beth shed worn those same clothes for tina for this baby erich had said order as much as you want the night of the dinner she wore an emeraldgreen twopiece silk dress with a white lace collar it was simple and wellcut she knew erich liked her to wear green it did something to her eyes like the aqua gown the garretts and emily came together jenny decided there seemed to be a new intimacy between mark and emily they sat side by side on the couch at one point emilys hand rested on marks arm maybe they are engaged she thought the possibility brought a queer stab of pain why emily was making a distinct effort to be pleasant but it was hard to find common ground she talked about the county fair corny as they are i always enjoy them and everyone was talking about how darling your girls are our girls erich smiled oh by the way youll all be glad to know the adoption is complete the girls are legally and bindingly kruegers jennyd expected that of course but how long had erich known a few weeks ago hed stopped asking her if she minded if he took the girls out was that the reason they were legally and bindingly kruegers luke garrett was very quiet he had chosen to sit in the wing chair after a while jenny understood why it gave the clearest view of carolines portrait his eyes seldom strayed from it what had he meant by that warning about accidents the dinner turned out well shed made tomato bisque from a recipe she found in an old cookbook in the kitchen luke raised his eyebrows erich if im not mistaken that must be the recipe your grandmother used when i was a boy excellent jenny as though to make up for his earlier silence luke began reminiscing about his youth your dad he said to erich was as close to me growing up as you and mark ever were at ten oclock they went home erich helped her to clear the table he seemed pleased at the way the evening had gone looks as though mark and emily are pretty close to an engagement he said luke would be glad hes been after mark to settle down i thought so too jenny agreed she tried to sound pleased but knew the effort was a failure in october it became sharply colder biting winds stripped the trees of their autumn finery frost dulled the grass to brown rain became icy the furnace hummed constantly now every morning erich started a fire in the kitchen stove beth and tina came to breakfast wrapped in warm robes eagerly anticipating the first snowfall jenny seldom left the house the long walks were too tiring and dr elmendorf advised against them her legs cramped frequently and she was afraid of falling rooney came to visit every afternoon between them theyd made a layette for the baby ill never sew properly jenny sighed but even so it was gratifying to make simple kimonos from the flowered cloth that rooney ordered from town it was rooney who showed jenny the corner of the attic where the krueger bassinette was covered with sheets ill make a new skirt for it rooney said the activity seemed to brighten her and for days at a time she was never confused ill put the bassinette in erichs old room she told rooney i dont want to move the girls and the other rooms are too far away id be afraid i wouldnt hear the baby at night thats what caroline said rooney volunteered you know erichs room used to be part of the master bedroom kind of an alcove of it caroline put the bassinette and baby dresser there john didnt like having the baby in his room said he didnt have a big house so hed have to tiptoe around an infant thats when they put the partition in the partition didnt erich ever tell you that your bed used to be on the south wall behind the headboard where it is now is the sliding wall show me rooney they went upstairs to erichs old room course you cant open it from your side with the headboard there rooney said but looksee she pushed the highback rocker aside and pointed to a recessed handle in the wallpaper just watch how easy it works noiselessly the panel slid open caroline had it made like that so when erich was bigger you could just close off the two rooms my clyde made the partition and josh brothers helped him didnt they do a good job would you ever guess it was there jenny stood in the opening she was behind the headboard of her bed she leaned over that was why she had felt a presence reached out touched a face she remembered the constant sensation of long hair rooneys hair removed from that tight bun was surely quite long rooney she tried to sound casual do you ever come into this room and open the partition at night maybe look in at me i dont think i do but jenny rooney put her lips to jennys ear i wouldnt tell clyde because hed think im crazy sometimes he scares me he talks about putting me away for my own good but jenny ive seen caroline walking around the farm at night these last few months once i followed her here to the house and she came up the back stairs thats why i keep thinking if caroline is able to come back maybe my arden will be here soon too this time it wasnt false labor quietly jenny lay in bed timing the contractions from ten minutes apart for two hours they suddenly accelerated to fiveminute intervals jenny patted the small mound in her abdomen weve made it young mr krueger she thought for a while i wasnt sure we would dr elmendorf had been cautiously pleased on her last visit the baby is about five pounds he said id wish it bigger but thats a comfortable weight frankly i was sure you were going to deliver prematurely hed done a scan youre right mrs krueger youre going to have a boy she went down the hall to call erich the door of his bedroom was closed she never went there hesitating she knocked erich she called softly there was no answer could he have gone to the cabin during the night hed started painting again but always came home for dinner even if he went back to the cabin for the evening he returned to the house at some point shed asked him about the panel that separated his old room from the master bedroom my god jen id forgotten all about it why do you get the idea someone has been opening it ill bet rooney is in and out of this place more than we realize i warned you against getting so cozy with her she hadnt dared tell him that rooney talked about seeing caroline now she pushed open the door to the room hed been using and reached for the light the bed was made erich wasnt here shed have to get to the hospital it was only four oclock there wouldnt be anyone up until seven unless padding softly on bare feet down the wide foyer jenny passed the closed doors of the other bedrooms erich would never use any of those except cautiously she opened the door of his old room the little league trophy on the dresser glistened in the moonlight the bassinette now frothy with a yellow silk skirt overlaid with white net was next to the bed the bedcovers were rumpled erich was asleep his body hunched in his favorite fetal position his hand was thrown over the bassinette as though hed fallen asleep holding it something rooney had said came back to her i can see caroline rocking that bassinette by the hour with erich fussing in it i used to tell him he was lucky to have had such a patient mother erich jenny whispered touching his shoulder his eyes flew open he jumped up jenny whats the matter i think id better get to the hospital he got out of bed quickly put his arms around her something told me to come in here tonight to be near you i fell asleep thinking how wonderful it will be when our little boy is in that bassinette it had been weeks since he had touched her she had not realized how starved she had been for the feeling of arms around her she reached up her hands to his face in the dark her fingers felt the curve of his face the softness of his eyelids she shivered what is it dear are you all right she sighed i dont know why but just for a minute i was so frightened youd think this was my first baby wouldnt you the overhead light in the delivery room was very bright it hurt her eyes she was slipping in and out of consciousness erich masked and coated like the doctors and nurses was watching her why did erich watch her all the time a last rush of pain now she thought now dr elmendorf held up a small limp body all of them bending over it oxygen the baby had to be all right give him to me but her lips didnt form the words she couldnt move her lips let me see him erich said he sounded anxious nervous then she heard his dismayed whisper he has hair like the girls dark red hair when she opened her eyes again the room was dark a nurse was sitting by the bed the baby hell be fine the nurse said soothingly he just gave us a little scare try to sleep my husband hes gone home what was it erich had said in the delivery room she couldnt remember she drifted in and out of sleep in the morning a pediatrician came in im dr bovitch the babys lungs arent fully developed hes in trouble but well pull him through mother i promise you that however since you gave your religion as roman catholic we thought it best to have him baptized last night is he that sick i want to see him you can walk down to the nursery in a little while we cant take him out of the oxygen yet kevins a beautiful little baby mrs krueger kevin yes before the priest baptized him he asked your husband what you planned to call him that is right isnt it kevin macpartland krueger erich came in with an armful of longstemmed red roses jenny jenny they say hell make it the baby will make it when i went home i spent the night crying i thought it was hopeless why did you tell them his name was kevin macpartland darling they said they didnt think hed survive more than a few hours i thought wed save the name erich for a son who would live it was the only other name that came to my mind i thought youd be pleased change it of course darling hell be erich krueger the fifth on his birth certificate the week she was in the hospital jenny forced herself to eat husbanded her strength pushed back the depression that sapped her energy after the fourth day they took the baby out of oxygen and let her hold him he was so frail her being ached with tenderness as his mouth reached for her breast she had not nursed beth or tina it had been too important to get back to work but to this child she could give all her time all her energy she was discharged from the hospital when the baby was five days old for the next three weeks she went back there every four hours during the day to nurse him sometimes erich drove her other times he gave her the car anything for the baby darling the girls got used to her leaving them at first they fussed then became resigned its all right beth told tina daddy will mind us and we have fun with him erich heard who do you like best mommy or me he tossed them in the air you daddy tina giggled jenny realized shed learned the answers erich wanted to hear beth hesitated glanced at jenny i like you both the same finally the day after thanksgiving she was allowed to bring the baby home tenderly she dressed the small body glad to hand back the coarse hospital shirt and replace it with a new one washed once to soften the cotton fibers a long flowered nightgown the blue woolen sacque and bonnet a receiving blanket the brushed wool bunting lined in satin it was bitterly cold out november had brought snow icetipped constant wind whispered through the trees stirring the naked branches into restless movement smoke wisped constantly from the chimneys in the house from the office blew over the ridge from clyde and rooneys home near the cemetery the girls were ecstatic over their little brother each pleading to hold him sitting beside them on the couch jenny let them have a turn gently gently hes so tiny mark and emily dropped by to see him hes beautiful emily declared erich is showing his picture to everyone thank you for your flowers jenny murmured and your father and mother sent a beautiful arrangement i phoned to thank your mother but apparently she wasnt home the apparently was a deliberate choice of words she was certain that mrs hanover was home when she called theyre so happy for you and for erich of course emily said hastily im just hoping im giving someone over here ideas she laughed in marks direction he smiled back at her you dont make remarks like that until youre pretty sure of yourself jenny thought she tried to make conversation well dr garrett how do you judge my son would he win a prize at the county fair a thoroughbred for sure mark replied what was there in his voice a worried tone pity did he see something as fragile in the baby as she did she was sure of it rooney was a born nurse she loved to give the baby the supplemental bottle after jenny breastfed him or she would read to the girls when the baby was sleeping jenny was grateful for the help the baby worried her he slept too much he was so pale his eyes began to focus they would be wide with the hint of almond shaping that erichs had they were china blue now but i swear i see some green lights in them i bet theyre like your mothers eyes erich youd like that id like that he moved the fourposter to the south wall of the master bedroom she left the partition open between that room and the small one the bassinette was kept there she could hear every sound the baby made erich still hadnt moved back into their room you need your rest a little longer jenny you can come in with me id like that not yet then she realized she was relieved the baby consumed her every thought at the end of the first month he had lost six ounces the pediatrician looked grave well increase the formula in the supplemental bottle im afraid your milk isnt rich enough for him are you eating properly is anything upsetting you remember a relaxed mother has a happier baby she forced herself to eat to nibble to drink milk shakes the baby would start to nurse eagerly then tire and fall asleep she told the doctor that wed better do some tests the baby was in the hospital three days she slept in a room near the nursery dont worry about my girls jenny ill take care of them i know you will erich she lived for the moments she could hold the baby one of the valves in the babys heart was defective hell need an operation later on but we cant risk it yet she thought of maude ekers curse god damn the baby youre carrying her arms tightened around the sleeping infant is the operation dangerous any operation has potential risk but most babies come through nicely again she brought the baby home the tiny birth fuzz started to fall out fine golden shades of down began to replace it hell have your hair erich i think hell stay red like the girls december came beth and tina made up long lists for santa claus erich set up a huge tree in the corner near the stove the girls helped him jenny held the baby as she watched she hated to put him down he sleeps better this way she told erich he always feels so cold his circulation is poor sometimes i dont think you care about anyone except him erich observed i have to tell you tina and beth and i are feeling pretty left out arent we he took the girls to see santa claus in a nearby shopping mall what a list he commented indulgently i had to write everything down that they were ordering the big things they seem to want are bassinettes and baby dolls luke had come back to minnesota for the holidays he mark and emily stopped in on christmas afternoon emily looked subdued she showed an exquisite leather pocketbook marks present isnt it lovely jenny wondered if she had been expecting an engagement ring luke asked to hold the baby hes a little beauty and hes put on eight ounces jenny announced joyfully didnt you pumpkin do you always call him pumpkin emily asked i suppose it sounds silly its just that erich sounds like too much name for such a tiny little scrap hell have to grow into it she looked up smiling erich looked impassive mark luke and emily were exchanging startled glances of course theyd probably seen the birth notice in the paper the day after the baby was born the notice that listed his name as kevin but hadnt erich explained emily rushed to fill the awkward silence bending over the baby again she said i think hell have the same coloring as the girls oh im sure hes going to be blond like erich jenny smiled again just give him six months well have a krueger towhead she took him from luke youll look just like your daddy wont you pumpkin thats what ive been saying right along erich commented jenny felt the smile freeze on her face did he mean what she thought he meant she looked searchingly from one face to the other emily looked acutely embarrassed luke stared straight ahead mark was stonyfaced she felt the anger in him erich was smiling warmly at the baby she knew with absolute certainty that erich had not changed the name on the birth certificate the baby began to whimper my poor little darling he said she stood up if youll excuse me i have to she paused then finished quietly i have to take care of kevin long after the baby fell asleep she sat by the bassinette she heard erich bring the girls upstairs his voice soft dont wake up the baby ill kiss mommy good night for you didnt we have a wonderful christmas jenny thought i cant live like this at last she went downstairs erich had closed the gift boxes and stacked them neatly around the tree he was wearing the new velvet jacket shed ordered from daytons for him the deep blue suited him all strong colors suit him she thought objectively jen im really happy with my present i hope youre as pleased with yours hed bought her a white mink jacket without waiting for a reply he continued to straighten the girls then said the girls really went for those bassinettes didnt they youd never guess they got anything else and the baby well hes a little too young to appreciate them but before long hell have fun with those stuffed animals erich where is the babys birth certificate its on file in the office dear why what name is on it the babys name kevin you told me youd changed that i realized it would have been a terrible mistake to change it why jenny hasnt there been enough talk about us what do you think the people around here would say if we corrected the babys name my god that would give them fuel for the next ten years dont forget we werent married quite nine months when he was born but kevin you called him kevin i explained the reason for that jenny already the talk is dying down when people talk about the accident they dont mention kevins name they talk about jenny kruegers first husband the guy who followed her to minnesota and somehow went over the riverbank but i can tell you this if we changed the babys name now theyd be trying to figure out why for the next fifty years and by god then theyd remember kevin macpartland erich she asked fearfully is there a better reason you didnt change the birth certificate is the baby sicker than i realize is it because youre saving your name for a child who will live tell me erich please are you and the doctor hiding anything from me no no no he came over to her his eyes tender jenny dont you see everything will be fine i want you to stop worrying the baby is getting stronger there was another question she had to ask him erich there was something you said in the delivery room that the baby had dark red hair like the girls kevin had dark red hair erich tell me promise me that youre not suggesting that kevin was the babys father you cant believe that jenny why would i believe that because of what you said about his hair she felt her voice quivering the babys going to be the image of you wait and see all his new hair is blond but when the others were here the way you picked me up when i said hell look just like his daddy the way you said thats what ive been saying right along erich surely you cant think kevin is the babys father she stared at him the blue velvet gave an almost burnished look to his blond hair shed never really appreciated how dark his lashes and brows were she was reminded of the paintings in the palace in venice where generations of leanfaced smolderingeyed doges looked disdainfully down on the tourists there was something of that contempt in erichs eyes now his facial muscles tightened jenny is there any end to the ways you misunderstand me ive been good to you i brought you and the children out of that miserable apartment to this beautiful home i gave you jewelry and clothes and furs you could have had anything you wanted and still you allowed kevin macpartland to contact you and cause a scandal im sure there isnt a house in this community that doesnt discuss us over the dinner table every night i forgive you but you have no right to be angry with me to question every word out of my mouth now lets go upstairs i think its time i moved back in with you his hands tightened on her arms his entire body was so rigid there was something frightening about him confused she looked away erich she said carefully were both very tired weve been under a strain for a long time i think what you should do is start painting again do you realize how few times youve gone to the cabin since the baby was born go to your own room tonight and get an early start in the morning but bundle up its probably very cold there now how do you know its cold when did you go there his voice was quick and suspicious erich you know ive never been there then how did you know sshh listen from upstairs they heard a wailing its the baby jenny turned and ran up the stairs erich behind her the babys arms and legs were flailing his face was damp as they watched he began to suck his clenched fist oh erich look hes crying real tears tenderly she bent over and picked him up there there pumpkin i know youre hungry my precious lamb erich he is getting stronger from behind her she heard the door close erich had left the room she dreamed of a pigeon somehow it seemed terribly ominous it was flying through the house and she had to catch it it mustnt be allowed in the house it sailed into the girls room and she followed it it flew frantically round and round the room it escaped her hands and fluttered past her into the babys room it settled on the bassinette she began to cry no no no she woke up with tears drenching her face and rushed in to the baby he was sleeping contentedly erich had left a note on the kitchen table taking your advice will be at cabin painting for a few days at breakfast tina paused over her cereal and said mommy why didnt you talk to me when you came into my room last night that afternoon rooney stopped in to visit and it was she who first realized that the baby had a fever she and clyde had had christmas dinner with maude and joe joes doing fine rooney informed jenny going down to florida right from the hospital did wonders for him and for maude too both of them that tanned and healthy joe gets rid of the brace next month im so glad course maude says shes happy to be home now she told me erich was real generous to them but i guess you know that he paid every cent of the medical bills and gave them a check for five thousand dollars beside he wrote maude that he felt responsible jenny was stitching the last of her quilt together she looked up responsible i dont know what he means but maude told me she feels real bad that the baby hasnt been well says she remembers saying awful things to you jenny remembered the awful things maude had said guess joe admitted that hed had a pretty good hangover that morning insists it was likely hed mixed up the poison and oats joe said that he did anyhow i think maude wanted me to give you her apologies i know when they got back last week joe went down and spoke to the sheriff himself joes real upset about all the rumors flying around his accident you know because of the wild thing he said about seeing you he said he dont know why he ever said anything like that poor joe jenny thought trying to undo irreparable harm and then making it worse by stirring it up again my jenny do you realize that your quilt is just about finished real lovely too that took patience i was glad to have it to do she said will you hang it in the dining room near carolines i havent thought about it she hadnt thought about very much today except the possibility that she was sleepwalking in her dream shed been trying to chase a pigeon out of the girls room but had she actually been in the room there were too many episodes like this now over the past few months the next time she went in to see dr elmendorf shed talk to him about them maybe she did need some counseling i am so afraid she thought she had begun to doubt whether erich would ever forgive her for the notoriety that she had caused no matter how hard they both tried it would never be right again and no matter what erich said she believed that subconsciously he was not sure that the baby was his son she couldnt live her life out with that between them but the baby was a krueger and deserved the best medical attention erichs wealth could obtain for him after the baby had the operation and was well if things hadnt gotten much better shed leave she tried to visualize living in new york working in the gallery the daycare center picking up the children hurrying home to start dinner it wouldnt be easy but nothing was easy and many women managed it and anything would be better than this terrible feeling of isolation this sense of losing touch with reality nightmares sleepwalking amnesia was even amnesia possible shed never had any trouble in the apartment in new york shed be bonetired at the end of the day but always slept she might not have had nearly enough time for the girls but now it seemed she had no time she was so worried about the baby and erich kept whisking tina and beth off on outings that she couldnt or wouldnt attend i want to go home she thought home wasnt a place maybe not even a house or apartment home was where you could close your door and be at peace this land even now the snow falling the wind blowing she liked the savageness of the winter she imagined the house as she had started to arrange it the heavy curtains down this table at the window the friends shed expected to make the parties she would have given over the holidays jenny you look so sad rooney said suddenly she tried to smile its just her voice trailed off this is the best christmas ive had since arden went just watching the children so happy and being able to help you with the baby jenny realized that rooney never called the baby by name she held up the quilt here it is rooney complete beth and tina were playing with their new picture puzzles beth looked up that is very pretty mommy youre a very good sewer tina volunteered i like it better than the one on the wall daddy said that yours wont be as nice as the one on the wall and i thought that was mean she bent her head over her book every line of her body suggested injury jenny could not help smiling oh tinker youre such an actress she went over knelt down and hugged her tina returned the hug fiercely oh mommy ive given them so little time since the baby came jenny thought tell you what she said were going to bring pumpkin down in a few minutes if you two wash your hands you can have a chance to hold him rooney interrupted their squeals of delight jenny may i get him of course ill fix his cereal rooney was back downstairs in a few minutes carefully holding the blanketed baby she looked concerned i think he has a fever at five oclock dr bovitch came wed better take him to the hospital no please jenny tried not to have her voice quiver the pediatrician hesitated we could give it till morning he said trouble iswith infants the fever can go high pretty fast on the other hand im not crazy about taking him out in the cold all right lets see how he is in the morning rooney stayed and prepared supper for them jenny gave the baby aspirin she was chilled herself was she catching cold or was she simply numb with anxiety rooney hand me my shawl please she wrapped it around her shoulders sheltered the baby in it as she held him oh dear rooneys face was ashen what is it rooney its just that the shawl i didnt realize when i made it that the color with your dark hair for just a minute it was like watching that painting of caroline made me feel kind of queer clyde was coming at seventhirty to walk rooney home he wont have me out of the house alone at night rooney confided says he doesnt like my wild talk after ive been out alone what kind of wild talk jenny asked absently the baby was sleeping his breathing sounded heavy you know rooney said her tone lowered to a whisper once in one of my spells when i just spill out words i told clyde ive been seeing caroline around an awful lot clyde got real mad jenny shivered rooney had seemed so well she hadnt talked about seeing caroline since before the baby was born there was a sharp knock at the door and clyde stepped into the kitchen foyer come on rooney he said lets get started i want my dinner rooney brought her lips up to jennys ear oh jenny you have to believe me shes here carolines come back i can understand cant you she just wants to see her grandchild for the next four nights jenny kept the bassinette by the side of her bed a vaporizer circulated warm moist air a dim nightlight made it possible for her between snatches of sleep to see that the baby was covered that he was breathing easily the doctor came every morning just have to watch for any signs of pneumonia he said in an infant a cold can go into the lungs in a few hours erich did not come back from the cabin during the day jenny brought the baby down and put him in the cradle near the stove that way she could watch him all the time and still be with beth and tina the possibility that she was sleepwalking haunted jenny dear god could she be wandering outside at night from a distance she would look like caroline especially if she had the shawl wrapped around her if she were sleepwalking it would explain rooneys claims of seeing caroline tinas why didnt you talk to me when you came into my room joes absolute certainty that he had watched her get in kevins car on new years eve the doctors smile was genuine i think hes just about over it youre a good nurse jenny now youve got to get some rest yourself put him back in his own room if he doesnt look for a feeding during the night dont wake him up after she nursed the baby at ten oclock jenny rolled the bassinette back im going to miss you as my bunky pumpkin she said but its awfully nice to have you over that cold the babys eyes deep midnight blue looked solemnly up at her from under long sooty lashes the incoming blond fuzz sent silky gold lights through his dark strands of birth hair do you know youre eight weeks old she asked what a great big boy she tied the drawstring on the long nightgown now kick all you want she smiled youre going to be covered in spite of yourself for a long minute she held him against her sniffing the faint scent of talcum you smell so good she whispered good night pumpkin she left the sliding panel open only a crack and got into bed the new year would begin in a few hours a year ago tonight fran and some of the other people in the brownstone had stopped in theyd known that she was bound to be feeling low the first new year that nana hadnt been with her fran had joked about nana shes probably up in heaven leaning out the window rattling a noisemaker theyd laughed together its going to be a good year for you jen fran had said i feel it in my bones good year when she finally got back to new york shed tell fran to get her bones checked they were sending out the wrong vibes but the baby he made everything else that had happened this year unimportant i take it back she thought quickly it was a good year when she awakened the sun was streaming in a clear cold light that warned of a frigid day outside the small porcelain clock on the night table said five minutes of eight the baby had slept through the night slept through his six oclock feeding she bolted out of bed shoved the panel aside and rushed to the bassinette the long lashes cast tranquil shadows on the pale cheeks a blue vein on the side of the tiny nose was dark against the translucent skin the babys arms were flung over his head his tiny hands were open the fingers spread so they resembled stars the baby was not breathing afterward she remembered screaming remembered running with the baby in her arms running out in her nightgown barefoot across the snow to the office erich clyde luke and mark were there mark grabbed the baby from her putting his mouth down to the tiny lips crib death mrs krueger dr bovitch said he was a very sick infant i dont know how he could have survived the operation this is so much easier for him rooney intoned over and over again oh no oh no our little boy erich wailed my little boy she thought fiercely you denied him your name why did god take our baby to heaven tina and beth asked why indeed id like to bury him with your mother erich jenny said somehow it would be less lonesome leaving him there her arms ached and felt empty im sorry jenny erich said firmly i cant disturb carolines grave after a mass of the angels kevin macpartland krueger was placed next to the three babies who had been lost in other generations dryeyed jenny watched as the small casket was lowered that first morning on this farm shed looked at those tombstones and wondered how anyone could bear the grief of losing a child now that grief was hers she began to weep erich put his arm around her she shook it off they filed back to the house mark luke clyde emily rooney erich herself it was so cold elsa was inside she had made sandwiches her eyes were red and swollen so elsa has feelings jenny thought bitterly and then was ashamed erich led them into the front parlor mark was beside her jenny drink this it will warm you up the brandy burned her throat she hadnt touched liquor from the moment she knew she was pregnant now it didnt matter numbly she sat down sipped the brandy it was so hard to swallow youre trembling mark said rooney heard him ill get your shawl not the green one jenny thought not the one i wrapped the baby in but rooney was laying it over her shoulders tucking it around her lukes eyes were riveted on her she knew why she tried to shrug off the shawl erich had allowed tina and beth to bring their bassinettes into the parlor so they could be with everyone they looked frightened beth said look mommy this is the way god will cover our baby in heaven lovingly she tucked the blanket under her dolls chin there was absolute silence in the room then tinas voice sweet and clear and this is the way that ladyshe pointed to the painting covered the baby the night god took him to heaven slowly deliberately she opened her palms and pressed them over her dolls face jenny heard a harsh drawnout gasp had it come from her own lips everyone was staring at the painting now and then in a single gesture every head turned and eyes that burned and questioned stared at her oh no no rooneys voice was singsong caroline would never hurt the baby love she rushed over to tina you see caroline always used to cup her hands on erichs face when he was little like this gently she placed her palms on the dolls cheeks and she would laugh and say caro caro that means dear one rooney straightened up and looked around now her pupils were enormous jenny its just like i told you she came back maybe she knew the baby was sick and wanted to help erichs voice was low get her out of here clyde clyde grasped rooneys arm come on and be quiet rooney pulled away jenny tell them how ive been seeing caroline tell them i told you that tell them im not crazy jenny tried to get up from the chair clyde was hurting rooney his fingers were digging into the thin arm but her legs wouldnt hold her up she tried to speak but no words came tinas small hands over the dolls mouth and nostrils it was luke who pried clydes fingers loose leave her alone man for god sake cant you see this has been too much for her his tone was soothing rooney why dont you go home and lie down its been a terrible day for you too rooney did not seem to hear ive been seeing her and seeing her sometimes at night i sneak out after clydes asleep because i want to talk to her i bet she knows where arden went and i see her coming into the house once i saw her at the window of the babys room the moonlight was shining on her just as clear as day i wish shed talk to me sometimes maybe she thinks im afraid of her but why would i be if caroline is here that means that even if arden is dead she might be able to come back isnt that right she pulled away from clyde and ran over to jenny sinking on her knees she put her arms around her that means maybe the baby will come back too wont that be nice jenny will you let me hold him when he comes back it was nearly two oclock her breasts were heavy with milk dr elmendorf had bound them to stop the lactation but at the hours shed fed the baby they still filled they hurt but she was glad to have the physical pain it balanced the agony of grief rooneys frail body was shaking jenny reached out put her arms around the thin shoulders he isnt coming back rooney she said neither is caroline or arden tina was dreaming of course she was mark said brusquely luke and clyde lifted rooney up she needs a sedative luke said ill drive with you to the hospital luke looked ill himself emily and mark stayed a little longer emily made halfhearted attempts to talk to erich about his painting i have an exhibit in houston in february erich told her ill take jenny and the girls with me the change will do us all good mark sat next to her there was something so quietly comforting about him she could feel his compassion and it helped after he and emily left jenny managed to prepare dinner for the girls and erich somehow she found the strength to get the children ready for bed tina splashed in the tub jenny thought about holding the baby in the crook of her arm while she bathed him she brushed beths long thick curls the baby was losing that dark hair his would have been golden she heard their prayers god bless nana and our baby in heaven she closed her eyes as waves of pain washed over her downstairs erich had brandy waiting drink this jenny it will help you relax he pulled her down beside him she did not resist his hands ran through her hair once that gesture had thrilled her jen you heard the doctor the baby wouldnt have made it through the surgery he really was much sicker than you knew she listened waiting for the numbness to wear off dont try to make it easier erich she thought nothing you can say matters jenny im worried ill take care of you but emily is a gossip by now what tina said is going to be all over town he put his arms around her thank god rooney is an unreliable witness and tina is so small otherwise she tried to pull away from him his hands held her fast his voice so soft so hypnotically gentle jenny im terribly afraid for you everyone has remarked how much you resemble caroline theyre going to hear what tina said oh my darling dont you see what theyre going to say soon she would wake up and be back in the apartment nana would be there now jen youre talking in your sleep again you must have had a nightmare youve got too much on your mind dear but she was not in the apartment she was in this cold overfurnished parlor listening to the incredible suggestion that people might think she had killed her own baby the trouble is jen you have been sleepwalking how many times have the girls asked why you dont speak to them when you go into their room at night its entirely possible you were in the babys room maybe patting the babys face tina didnt understand what she saw you yourself told dr elmendorf youve been hallucinating he called me about that he called you yes hes quite concerned he says youve refused to see a psychiatrist jenny stared past him at the curtains the lace seemed weblike once she had taken those curtains down blindly trying to change the stifling atmosphere of this house erich had put them back up now the curtains seemed to be closing in on her enmeshing her smothering her smothering she closed her eyes against the memory of tinas small hands covering her dolls face pressing down hallucinating had she imagined the face the feeling of hair hanging over the bed all those nights had she been imagining that erich im so confused i dont know what reality is anymore even before this but now ive got to get away ill take the girls impossible jenny youre much too upset for your sake for their sake you cant be alone and dont forget the girls are legally kruegers theyre just as much my children as yours im their mother their natural mother and guardian jenny please remember this in the eyes of the law i have every bit as much right to them as you and believe me if you ever tried to leave me id get custody do you think any court would award them to you with your reputation in this community but theyre mine the baby was yours and you wouldnt give him your name the girls are mine and you want them why because i want you no matter what youve done no matter how sick you are i want you caroline was willing to leave me but i know you jenny youd never leave your children thats why well be together always were going to start over as of right now im moving back in with you tonight no you have no choice well put the past behind ill never mention the baby again ill be there to help if you start to sleepwalk ill take care of you if they investigate the babys death ill hire a lawyer he was pulling her to her feet helplessly she allowed him to propel her up the stairs tomorrow well put the room back the old way he told her just pretend the baby never was born she had to humor him until she could plan they were in the bedroom he opened the bottom drawer of the large dresser she knew what he was reaching for the aqua gown wear it for me jen its been so long i cant she was so afraid his eyes were so strange she didnt know this man who could tell her that people believed she was a murderer tell her to forget the baby shed buried a few hours ago yes you can youre very thin now youre lovely she took it from him and went into the bathroom she changed and the nightgown did fit her again she stared into the mirror over the sink and understood why people thought she looked like caroline her eyes had the same sad haunted look as those of the woman in the painting in the morning erich slid out of bed quietly and began to tiptoe around the room im awake she told him it was six oclock it should have been time to feed the baby try to go back to sleep darling he pulled on a heavy ski sweater im going to the cabin ive got to finish the paintings for the houston exhibition well go together darling the two of us and the girls well have a wonderful time he sat down on the edge of the bed oh jen i love you so she stared up at him tell me you love me jen dutifully she said i love you erich it was a bleak morning even by the time the girls had had breakfast the sun was still hidden by patches of wintry clouds the air had a chilly dark feeling as before a storm she dressed tina and beth for a walk elsa was going to take down the christmas tree and jenny broke small branches from it what are you going to do with those mommy beth asked i thought wed put them on the babys grave the fresh dirt had frozen during the night the luminous pine needles softened the starkness of the little mound mommy dont look so sad beth begged ill try not to mouse they turned away if i could only feel something she thought i am so empty so terribly empty on the way back to the house she saw clyde drive into the farm road she waited for him to find out about rooney they wont let her come home for a while he said theyre doing all kinds of tests and they say maybe i should put her in a special hospital for a while i said no way shes been a lot better since you came here miz krueger i guess i never knew how lonesome rooney was shes always afraid to leave the farm for long just in case arden suddenly called or came back but then lately shes been worse again you saw he swallowed fiercely blinking back tears and miz krueger what tina said got out the sheriff hes been talking to rooney he had a doll out with him told her to show him the way caroline used to pat the babys face and how tina said the lady in the painting touched the baby i dont know what hes up to i do jenny thought erichs right emily couldnt wait to spill that story to the people in town sheriff gunderson came out three days later mrs krueger i have to warn you theres been talk i have an order to exhume your babys body the medical examiner wants to do an autopsy she stood and watched as sharp spades opened the newly frozen earth as the small casket was loaded onto the funeral car she felt someone standing beside her it was mark why torture yourself jenny you shouldnt be here what are they looking for they want to make sure there are no bruises or signs of pressure on the babys face she thought of long lashes throwing shadows on the pale cheeks the tiny mouth the blue vein on the side of his nose the blue vein shed never noticed it before that morning when shed found him did you notice any bruises on him she asked mark would have known the difference between a bruise and a vein when i tried the mouthtomouth resuscitation i held his face pretty hard there could be some you told them that yes she turned to him the wind wasnt strong but every stir of air sent fresh shivers through her you told them that to protect me it wasnt necessary i told them the truth he said the hearse drove onto the dirt road come back to the house mark urged she tried to analyze her feelings as she trudged by his side through the fresh fallen snow he was so tall shed never realized how used shed become to erichs relatively small stature kevin had been tall over six feet mark what would he be six four or five she had a headache her breasts were burning why didnt the milk stop flowing it wasnt needed she could feel her blouse getting damp if erich was in the house hed be mortified he hated untidiness he was so neat and so private if he hadnt married her the krueger name wouldnt have been dragged through the mud erich believed she had scandalized his name and still he claimed he loved her he liked her to look like his mother thats why he always asked her to wear the aqua gown maybe when she was sleepwalking she tried to look like his mother to please him i guess im trying she said her voice startled her she didnt know shed spoken aloud what did you say jenny jenny she was falling she could not stop herself from falling but something stopped her just as her hair brushed the snow jenny mark was holding her was carrying her she hoped she wasnt too heavy jenny youre burning up maybe that was why she couldnt keep her thoughts straight it wasnt just the house oh god how she hated the house she was riding in a car erich was holding her she remembered this car it was marks station wagon he had books in it shock milk fever dr elmendorf said well keep her here it was so nice to float away so nice to wear one of those rough hospital gowns she hated the aqua gown erich was in and out of her room beth and tina are fine they send their love finally mark brought the message she needed to have the baby is back in the cemetery they wont disturb him again thank you his fingers closing over her hands oh jenny that night she had two cups of tea a piece of toast good to see you feeling better mrs krueger the nurse was genuinely kind why was it that kindness made her want to weep she used to take for granted that people liked her the fever was lowgrade persistent i wont allow you to go home until weve licked it dr elmendorf insisted she cried a lot often when shed dozed off shed wake up to find her cheeks wet with tears dr elmendorf said while youre here id like dr philstrom to have a few talks with you dr philstrom was a psychiatrist he sat by her bed a tidy little man who looked like a bank clerk i understand you had a series of pretty bad nightmares they all wanted to prove that she was crazy i dont have them anymore and it was true in the hospital she was starting to sleep through the night each day she began to feel stronger more like herself she realized she was joking with the nurse in the morning the afternoon was the hardest she didnt want to see erich the sound of his footsteps in the hall made her hands clammy he brought the girls to see her they werent allowed inside the hospital but she stood at the window and waved to them somehow they seemed so forlorn waving back up at her that night she ate a full dinner she had to get her strength back there was nothing to hold her on krueger farm any longer there was no way she and erich could recapture what they once had she could plan to get away and she knew how she could manage it on the trip to houston somehow on that trip she and beth and tina would leave erich and get on a plane for new york erich might be able to get custody of the children in minnesota but new york would never give it to him she could sell nanas locket to get some money a jeweler had offered nana eleven hundred dollars for it a few years ago if she got anything like that it would be enough to buy airline tickets and tide her over until she got a job away from carolines house carolines portrait carolines bed carolines nightgown carolines son shed be herself againable to think calmly to try to capture all the awful thoughts that kept rising almost to the surface of her mind and then slipping away there were so many of themso many impressions that seemed to be eluding her jenny fell asleep the hint of a smile on her lips her cheeks pillowed in her hands the next day she phoned fran oh blessed blessed freedom knowing no one would pick up the extension in the office jenny you havent answered my letters i thought youd jettisoned me into outer space she didnt bother to explain that shed never received them fran i need you as quickly as possible she explained i have to get out of here frans usual matteroffact laughter disappeared its been bad jenny i can hear it in your voice later she could tell fran everything now she simply agreed its been bad trust me ill get back to you call after eight oclock thats when visiting hours end fran called at ten after seven the next night the minute the phone rang jenny knew what had happened fran had not allowed for the time difference it was ten after eight in new york erich was sitting by her bed his eyebrows raised as he handed her the receiver frans voice was vibrant carrying ive got great plans fran how good to hear from you turning to him erich its fran say hello fran caught on erich how are you so sorry to hear jenny hasnt been well after they hung up erichs question what plans jenny she went home on the last day in january beth and tina seemed like strangers curiously quiet curiously petulant youre always gone mommy shed spent more time with them in the evenings and weekends in new york than she had here this past year how much did erich suspect about frans calls shed been evasive i just realized i hadnt spoken to fran in ages and picked up the phone wasnt it dear of her to call me back shed called fran after erich left the hospital that night fran had exulted i have a friend who runs a nursery school near red bank new jersey its marvelous and goes right through kindergarten i told her you can teach music and art and she has a job for you if you want it shes looking for an apartment for you jenny bided her time erich was preparing for the houston exhibition he began bringing in paintings from the cabin i call this one the provider he said holding up an oil on canvas in tones of blue and green high on the branches of an elm a nest could be seen the mother bird was flying toward the tree a worm in its beak the leaves sheltered the nest so it was impossible to see the baby birds but somehow the viewer sensed their presence the idea for that painting came to me that first night on second avenue when i came on you carrying the girls erich said you had a purposeful look on your face and you could just tell you were anxious to get the kids home and fed his tone was affectionate he put his arm around her how do you like it its beautiful the one time she was not nervous with erich was when she studied his work this was the man with whom she had fallen in love the artist whose wondrous talent at once could capture the simplicity of daily life and the complicated emotions that attended that simplicity the trees in the background she recognized the line of norwegian pines that grew near the graveyard erich you just finished this painting yes darling she pointed but that tree is gone you had most of the elms near the cemetery taken down because of the dutch elm disease last spring i started a painting using that tree in the background but couldnt make it express what i wanted to say then one day i saw a bird flying with food for its young and thought of you you inspire everything i do jenny in the beginning a statement like that would have melted her heart now it only caused her fear invariably it was followed by a remark that would reduce her to trembling nerves for the rest of the day the remark wasnt long in coming erich covered the painting im sending thirty canvases the shippers will pick them up in the morning will you be here to make sure they take them all of course ill be here where else would i be dont be edgy jenny i thought mark might try to see you before he goes what do you mean luke had a heart attack just after he got back to florida but that doesnt give him the right to try to break up our marriage erich what are you talking about luke called me last thursday hes out of the hospital he suggested that you and the girls visit him in florida mark is leaving today to spend a week with him luke had the nerve to think id let you travel down there with mark how kind of him jenny knew the offer had been refused it wasnt kind of him luke just wanted to get you down there away from me i told him so erich dont be surprised jenny why do you think mark and emily have stopped seeing each other have they stopped jenny why are you always so blind mark told emily he realized he wasnt interested in getting married and that it wasnt fair to take her time i didnt know that a man doesnt do that unless he has some other woman in mind not necessarily marks crazy about you jenny if it werent for him the sheriff would have ordered an inquest into the babys death you know that dont you no i dont all the hardwon calm of the hospital was deserting her her mouth was dry her hands were sweaty she felt herself trembling erich what are you saying im saying that there was a bruise near the babys right nostril the coroner said that it probably preceded death mark insisted that he was rough when he was trying to resuscitate the baby the memory of mark holding the tiny form flashed through her mind erich was standing next to her now his lips against her ear mark knows you know i know the baby was bruised jenny what are you telling me nothing darling im just warning you we both know how delicate the babys skin was that last night the way he was flailing his fists he probably bruised himself but mark lied hes just like his father everyone knew the way luke felt about caroline even now whenever hes here he sits in the wing chair so he can see her portrait he was driving caroline to the airport that last day all she had to do was snap her fingers and he was there and now mark thinks he can pull the same thing well he cant i called lars ivanson the veterinarian from hennepin grove hell start caring for my animals mark garrett will never set foot on this farm again erich you cant mean that oh but i can i know you didnt mean it but you encouraged him jenny i saw it how many times did he come to the hospital he came twice once to tell me that the baby was back in his grave once to bring fruit luke had ordered for me from florida erich dont you see you read so much into the simplest most innocent situation where does it end she did not wait for a reply she walked out of the room and opened the door onto the west porch the last of the sun was slipping behind the woods the evening wind was making carolines swing rock no wonder caroline had sat out here she had been driven from the house too that night erich came into the bedroom shortly after her she held herself rigid not wanting to be close to him but he simply turned on his side and went to sleep she felt her body go limp with relief she would not see mark again by the time he returned from florida she would be in new jersey was erich right had she been sending out some kind of signal to mark or was it simply that he and emily had decided they werent right for each other and erich always suspicious was reading more into it for once she thought erich may be right the next morning she prepared a list of odds and ends she needed for the trip she expected erich to argue about her requesting the car but he was unexpectedly indifferent but leave the girls with elsa he told her after he left for the cabin she circled a jewelry store listed in the classified ad section that advertised highest prices paid for your gold it was in a shopping center two towns away she called and described nanas locket yes theyd be interested in buying it immediately she phoned fran fran wasnt home but her recorder was on she left a message well be in new york on the seventh or eighth dont phone here while the children napped she rushed to the jewelry store she was offered eight hundred dollars for the locket it wasnt enough but she had no choice she bought makeup and underwear and panty hose with the credit card erich had given her she made a point of showing the things to him their first wedding anniversary was february third why dont we celebrate in houston darling erich asked ill give you your present there that will be fine she wasnt a good enough actress to keep up the farce of celebrating this marriage but oh god soon soon it would be over the anticipation put a sparkle in her eye that had not been there in months tina and beth responded to it they had become so quiet now they brightened as she chatted with them do you remember when we were on the plane and had that lovely ride were going on a plane again to a big city erich came in what are you talking about im telling them about our trip to houston what fun it will be youre smiling jenny do you know how long its been since you looked happy too long tina beth come on with daddy to the store ill buy you ice cream beth put her hand on jennys arm i want to stay with mommy i do too tina said positively then i wont go erich said he seemed unwilling to leave her alone with the children on the night of the fifth she packed she only took what would appear reasonable for three days what fur should i take my coat or jacket she asked erich whats the weather like in houston the jacket would be enough i think why are you so nervous jenny im not nervous its just that im out of the habit of traveling will i need a long dress maybe one that taffeta skirt and blouse would do wear your locket with it was there an edge in his voice was he toying with her she tried to sound natural thats a good idea they had a two oclock flight from minneapolis ive asked joe to drive us to the airport erich said joe yes hes able to start working again im going to rehire him but erich after all that happened jenny weve put all that behind us erich after all the gossip you propose to rehire him she bit her lip what difference who was here rooney would be coming back from the hospital around the fourteenth they had persuaded clyde to let her stay a full six weeks jenny wished she could say goodbye to her maybe she could write and have fran mail the letter for her from some city on one of her flights there was nothing else she could do at last it was time to go the girls were dressed in their velvet coats and matching hats jennys heart surged im going to take them to the village for linguine the night we get to new york she decided from the bedroom window she could barely see a corner of the cemetery after breakfast shed slipped over to the babys grave to say goodbye erich had packed the car ill get joe he told her come with me girls give mommy a chance to finish dressing i am finished she said hold a minute ill go with you he seemed not to have heard hurry up mommy beth called as she and tina clattered down the stairs behind erich jenny shrugged just as well to have five minutes to be sure she had everything the locket money was in the inside jacket pocket of the suit she had packed on her way downstairs she glanced into the girls room elsa had made the beds and straightened the room now it seemed inordinately neat with a quality of emptiness as though it sensed that the girls would not be returning had erich sensed the same thing suddenly troubled jenny ran down the stairs pulling on her jacket erich should be back any minute ten minutes later she went out on the porch she was getting so warm surely hed be along any second now he always left so much time to get to the airport she stared at the road straining to see the first sign of the car coming at the end of half an hour she phoned the ekers her fingers fumbled with the dial twice she had to break the connection and start again maude answered what do you mean have they left yet i saw erich drive past here over forty minutes ago with the girls in the car joe joe wasnt driving them to the airport where did you get that idea erich had gone without her taken the girls and gone without her the money was in the luggage hed taken somehow he had guessed her plans she called the hotel in houston i want to leave a message for erich krueger tell him to call his wife as soon as he arrives the reservation clerks hearty texan voice there must be a misunderstanding those reservations were canceled nearly two weeks ago at two oclock elsa came in to her goodbye mrs krueger jenny was sitting in the parlor studying carolines painting she did not turn her head goodbye elsa elsa did not go at once her long frame hovered in the doorway im sorry to leave you leave me yanked from lethargy jenny jumped up what do you mean mr krueger said that he and the girls would be going away he said hed let me know when to come back when did he tell you that elsa this morning when he was getting in the car are you staying here alone there was a curious mixture of emotion in the stolid face ever since the babys death jenny had felt a compassion in elsa she would not have expected i guess i am she said quietly for hours after elsa left she sat in the parlor waiting waiting for what a phone call erich would phone she was certain of that how would she handle the call admit shed been planning to leave him he already knew that she was sure of it promise to stay with him he wouldnt trust the promise where had he taken the girls the room grew dark she should turn on some lamps but somehow the effort was too great the moon came up it shone in through the lace of the curtains throwing a weblike beam on the painting finally jenny went into the kitchen made coffee sat by the telephone at nine oclock it began to ring her hand trembled so she could barely pick up the receiver hello her voice was so low she wondered if it could be heard mommy beth sounded so far away why didnt you want to come with us today you promised bethie where are you the sound of the phone being moved beths voice changing to a protest i want to talk to mommy tina interrupted mommy we didnt go for a plane ride and you said we would tina where are you hello darling erichs voice was warmly solicitous tina and beth were wailing in the background erich where are you why did you do this why did i do what darling prevent you from taking my children from me keep them from danger danger what are you talking about jenny i told you id take care of you i mean it but ill never let you leave me and take my girls away i wont erich bring them home thats not good enough jenny go over to the desk get writing paper and a pen ill hold on the girls were still crying but she could hear something else road sounds a truck in gear he must be calling from a phone booth on a highway erich where are you i said get paper and pen ill dictate you write hurry up jenny the edwardian desk was held closed by a large gold key as she tried to turn it she pulled it out and dropped it awkwardly she bent down scooped it up the sudden rush of blood to her head made her dizzy tripping in her rush to return to the phone she had to steady herself against the wall im ready erich its a letter to me dear erich wedging the receiver between her shoulder and ear she scrawled the two words he spoke slowly i realize i am very ill i know i sleepwalk constantly i think i do terrible things that i cant remember i lied when i said i didnt get in the car with kevin i asked him to come down here so i could persuade him to leave us alone i didnt mean to hit him so hard mechanically she was writing anxious not to make him angry the meaning of the words filtered through erich i wont write that thats not true let me finish just listen he spoke rapidly now joe was threatening to tell that he saw me get in the car i couldnt let him talk i dreamed i mixed the poison with the oats but i know it wasnt a dream i thought you would accept the baby but you knew it wasnt yours i thought it would be better for our marriage if the baby didnt live he was taking all my attention tina saw me go in to the baby she saw me press my hands on his face erich promise you will never trust me alone with the children i am not responsible for what i do the pen dropped from her fingers no when you write and sign that statement jenny ill come back ill put it in the safe no one will ever know about it erich please you cant mean this jenny i can be gone months at a time years if necessary you know that ill call you in a week or two think it over i wont jenny i know what youve done his voice became warm we love each other jenny we both know it but i cant risk losing you and i cant risk the girls with you the phone clicked she stared into it stared at the crumbled paper in her hand oh god she said please help me i dont know what to do she called fran were not coming jenny why not whats wrong the connection was poor even frans normally strong voice sounded so remote erichs taken the girls on a trip im not sure when theyll be back jenny do you want me to come out ive got four days off erich would be furious if fran came it was the phone call from fran in the hospital that had alerted him to her plans no fran dont come dont even call just pray for me please she could not sleep in the master bedroom she could not sleep anywhere upstairs the long dark hallway the closed doors the girls room across from the master bedroom the room where the baby had slept those few short weeks instead she lay down on the couch by the iron stove and covered herself with the shawl rooney had made the heat automatically went off at ten she decided to make a fire in the stove the wood was in the cradle the cradle moved as she touched it oh pumpkin she mourned remembering the solemn eyes that had gazed steadily back at her the small fist that had curled around her finger she could not write that letter the next time erich had an outburst of jealousy he might give it to the sheriff how long would he stay away she heard the clock strike one two three sometime after that she dozed off a sound awakened her the house creaking and groaning as it settled no she was hearing footsteps someone was walking upstairs she had to know slowly step by step she made herself go up the stairs she clutched the shawl around her against the chill the hallway was empty she made herself go into the master bedroom switch on a lamp there was no one there erichs old room the door was open a crack hadnt it been closed she went into it flipped on the overhead light no one and yet there was something a feeling of presence what was it the pine scent was it stronger again she couldnt be sure she walked over to the window she needed to open it to breathe fresh air her hands on the sill she looked down a figure was standing outside in the yard the figure of a man gazing up at the house the moonlight flickered on his face it was clyde what was he doing there she waved to him he turned and ran for the rest of the night she lay on the couch listening sometimes she fancied she heard sounds footsteps a door closing imagination all of it at six oclock she got up and realized she hadnt undressed the printed silk suit shed planned to wear on the trip was hopelessly wrinkled no wonder i couldnt sleep she thought a long hot shower cleared some of the numbing fatigue with the heavy bath towel wrapped around her she went into the bedroom and opened the drawer a faded pair of jeans were there a pair she used to wear in new york she put them on and rummaged until she found one of her old sweaters erich had wanted her to give everything away but shed hung onto a few things it was important to wear something of her own now something shed bought herself she remembered how badly dressed shed felt that day she met erich shed been wearing that cheap sweater kevin gave her and nanas gold locket shed come here with that one piece of jewelery of her own and the girls now she didnt have nanas locket and erich had the girls jenny stared at the dark oak floor something was shining on it just outside the closet she bent down and picked it up it was a scrap of mink she yanked open the closet door the mink coat was half off the hanger one sleeve drooped raggedly round the hem what was the matter jenny went to adjust it then pulled back her fingers had slid through to the skin beneath the fur at the collar line bits of fur clung to her fingers the coat had been slashed to ribbons at ten oclock she went over to the office clyde was sitting at the large desk the one erich always used i always base here when erich is going to be gone for a spell makes it easier clyde looked older the heavy wrinkles around his eyes were more pronounced she waited for him to explain why hed been looking up at the house in the middle of the night but he said nothing how long is erich planning to be gone she asked he didnt say for sure miz krueger clyde why were you outside the house last night you saw me yes of course then you saw her too her clyde burst out miz krueger maybe rooney aint so crazy after all you know she keeps saying she sees caroline last night i couldnt sleep knowing they still dont want to let rooney home moren a few days at a time wondering if im doing the right thing by her anyhow i got up and you know miz krueger how you can see a piece of the cemetery from our window well i saw something moving there and i went out clydes face became unnaturally pale miz krueger i saw caroline just like rooneys been saying she was walking from the cemetery to the house i followed her that hair that cape she always wore she went in the back door i tried it after her but it was locked i wasnt carrying my keys i walked around and just waited in a little while i saw the light go on in the master bedroom then the light in erichs old room then she came to the window and looked out and waved at me clyde i was at the window i waved at you oh jesus clyde whispered rooneys been saying she sees caroline tina talks about the lady in the painting i think im following caroline oh jesus he stared at her horror in his faceand all the time just like erich said its you weve been seeing it wasnt me clyde she protested i went upstairs because i heard someone walking around she stopped repelled by the disbelief in his face she fled back to the house was clyde right had she been walking near the graveyard shed been dreaming about the baby and this morning shed been thinking how much she hated the clothes erich had bought her had she dreamed that too and then slashed the coat maybe she hadnt heard anyone after all maybe shed just been sleepwalking and woke up when she was upstairs she was the lady tina saw the lady in the painting she made coffee drank it scalding hot she had not eaten since yesterday morning she toasted an english muffin forced herself to nibble on it clyde would tell the doctors that hed seen the woman he thought was caroline hed say that he followed her to the house and i admitted i waved to him erich would come back and take care of her shed sign that statement and erich would take care of her for hours she sat at the kitchen table then went to the desk and got the box of writing paper carefully she wrote trying to remember erichs exact words shed tell about last night too she wrote and last night i must have been sleepwalking again clyde saw me i walked in from the cemetery i guess i went to the babys grave i woke up in the bedroom and saw clyde from the window i waved to him clyde had been standing out there standing in the icecrusted snow the snow shed been in her stocking feet if shed been outside her feet would have been wet the boots shed been planning to wear on the trip were by the couch still freshly polished they hadnt been worn outside she might have imagined the draft of cold air imagined the footsteps forgotten about sleepwalking but if shed been out by the cemetery her feet would have gotten wet her stockings would have been stained slowly she tore up the letter tore it till it scattered in tiny pieces dispassionately she watched the pieces scatter around the kitchen for the first time since erich had gone the sense of hopelessness began to lift she hadnt been outside but rooney had seen caroline tina had seen her clyde had seen her she jenny had heard her upstairs last night caroline had slashed the mink coat maybe she was angry with jenny for causing erich so much trouble maybe she was still upstairs she had come back jenny got up caroline she called caroline she could hear her voice getting higher maybe caroline couldnt hear her step by step she ascended the stairs the master bedroom was empty she detected the faint scent of pine that was always there maybe if she left some pine soap out caroline would feel more at home she reached into the crystal bowl brought out three small cakes left them on the pillow the attic perhaps she was in the attic thats where she might have gone last night caroline jenny called trying to sound coaxing dont be afraid of me please come you have to help me get the girls the attic was nearly dark she walked up and down it carolines vanity case with her ticket and appointment book where was the rest of her luggage why did caroline keep coming back to this house she had been so anxious to get away caroline jenny called softly please talk to me the bassinette was in the corner covered now with a sheet jenny walked over to it touched it tenderly began to rock it my little love she whispered oh little love something was sliding across the sheet something slipping toward her hand a delicate gold chain a heartshaped pendant the filigree workmanship like spungold thread the center diamond that flashed in the dusk jenny closed her hand over nanas locket nana saying the name aloud was like a drenching of cold water what would nana think of her standing here trying to talk to a dead woman the attic seemed intolerably confining clasping her hand over the locket she ran downstairs to the second floor down to the main floor into the kitchen i am going mad she thought aghast she remembered calling carolines name think about what nana would tell her to do everything looks better over a cup of tea jenny mechanically she put on the kettle what did you eat today jen its not good thisbusiness of skipping meals she went to the refrigerator pulled out sandwich makings a blt down she thought and managed a smile as she ate she tried to picture telling nana about last night clyde said he saw me but my feet werent wet could it have been caroline she could just hear nanas reaction there are no such things as ghosts jen when youre dead youre dead then how did the locket get upstairs find out the telephone book was in the drawer under the wall phone holding the sandwich jenny went over and got it she flipped the classified section to jewelry bought and sold the jeweler to whom shed sold the locket shed circled his ad with magic marker she dialed the number asked to speak to the manager quickly she explained im mrs krueger i sold a locket to you last week i think id like to buy it back mrs krueger i wish youd stop wasting my time your husband came in and told me you had no right to sell a family piece i let him buy it for just what i paid you my husband yes he came not twenty minutes after you sold it to me the line went dead jenny stared into the phone erich had suspected her he had followed her that afternoon probably in one of the farm vehicles but how had the locket gotten to the attic she went to the desk got out a pad of lined paper one hour ago shed planned to write the statement erich had demanded now there was something else she needed to see in black and white she settled at the kitchen table on the first line she wrote there are no ghosts on the second i could not have been outside last night one more she thought the next line she printed in caps i am not a violent person begin at the beginning she thought write everything down all the trouble began with that first phone call from kevin clyde did not come near the house the third day she went into the office it was the tenth of february clyde was on the phone talking to a dealer she sat watching him when erich was around clyde tended to fade into the background with erich gone his voice took on a new note of authority she listened as he arranged the sale of a twoyearold bull for over one hundred thousand dollars when he hung up he looked at her warily obviously he was remembering their last conversation clyde dont you have to consult with erich when you sell a bull for that kind of money miz krueger when erich is here he gets into the business as much as he wants but the fact is hes never been much interested in running this farm or the limeworks i see clyde ive been doing a lot of thinking tell me where was rooney wednesday night when you thought you saw caroline what do you mean where was rooney just that i called the hospital and spoke to dr philstrom hes the psychiatrist who came in to see me i know who he is hes rooneys doctor thats right you didnt tell me rooney had an overnight pass on wednesday night wednesday night rooney was in the hospital no she wasnt she was staying with maude ekers it was maudes birthday you were supposed to go to a cattle auction and youd given permission for maude to pick up rooney rooney thought you were in st cloud i was i got back home round midnight id forgotten rooney was going to maudes clyde isnt it possible rooney slipped out of maudes house and was walking around on the farm no it aint clyde she often walks around at night you know that isnt it possible you saw her with a blanket wrapped around her a blanket that might seem like a cape from a distance think of rooney with her hair down rooney aint worn her hair out of a bun for twenty years cept of course he hesitated except when cept at night clyde dont you see what im trying to tell you just one more question did erich put a gold locket in the safe or give it to you to put there he put it in himself he said you kept mislaying it and didnt want it lost did you tell rooney that i might a mentioned it just to talk just to pass the time of day clyde rooney knows the combination of this safe doesnt she he frowned a worried frown she might and shes home on passes more than youve admitted shes been home some and its possible she was wandering around here wednesday night clyde open the safe show me my locket silently he obeyed his fingers fumbled as he worked the combination the door swung open he reached in pulled out a small strongbox and opened it expectantly then he held it up as though hoping that a stronger light would reveal what he was seeking finally he said his voice unnaturally soft the locket aint here two nights later erich phoned jenny there was a singsong teasing quality in his voice erich erich where are you jen im downstairs on the couch she looked at the clock it was after eleven she had dozed off why its lonesome upstairs erich she wanted to tell him what she suspected about rooney jenny the anger in his voice bolted her awake i want you where you belong in our room in our bed i want you to wear the special nightgown do you hear me erich please tina beth how are they theyre fine read the letter to me erich i found out something maybe youve been wrong too late she tried to call back the words i mean erich maybe weve both just not understood you havent written the letter i started to but erich what you think isnt true im sure of that now the connection broke jenny rang the bell at maude ekers kitchen door how many months had it been since shed been here since maude told her to leave joe alone maude had been right to worry about joe she was about to ring the bell again when the door opened joe was there a much thinner joe the boyish face matured by tired lines around his eyes joe he held his hands out impulsively she grasped them with a rush of affection she kissed his cheek joe jenny i mean mrs krueger awkwardly he stood aside to let her pass is your mother here shes working im by myself im just as glad i have to talk to you ive wanted to talk to you so much but you know i know jenny ive caused you so much trouble id like to go down on my knees for what i said the morning of the accident i guess everyone thought i was saying that you well youd hurt me like i told the sheriff i didnt mean that at all i just meant i thought i was dying and i was worried about telling you id seen you that night she took the seat across the kitchen table from him joe do you mean you dont think you saw me that night just like i tried to explain to the sheriff and like i told mr krueger last week there was something always bothering me about that night bothering you its the way you move youre so graceful jenny you have such a quick light step like a deer whoever came down the porch that night walked different its hard to explain and she was sort of leaning forward so her hair was almost covering her face you always stand so straight joe do you think you might have seen rooney wearing my coat that night joe looked puzzled how could that be the reason i was standing there is because i saw rooney on the path leading to the house and i didnt want to bump into her rooney was there all right but somebody else got in that car jenny rubbed her hand over her forehead these last few days shed come to believe that rooney was the key to everything that had happened rooney could let herself in and out of the house so silently rooney could even have overheard erich and her talking about kevin rooney could have made the phone call rooney knew about the panel between the bedrooms everything fit into place if rooney wearing her coat had met kevin that night then who was wearing that coat who had arranged the meeting she didnt know but at least joe had verified that he believed she jenny was not that person she got up to go there was no point in being here when maude came home maude would be horrified she tried to make herself smile joe im so glad to have seen you weve missed you its good news that youll be working for us again i sure was glad when mr krueger offered me the job and like i say i told him what i just told you what did erich say he told me i should keep my mouth shut that id only start trouble raking up that story and i swore i wouldnt mention it again to a soul but of course he never meant i couldnt tell you she made a business of pulling on her gloves she mustnt let him see how shattered she was erich had demanded that she sign that statement saying she got in the car with kevin even after joe told him he was sure someone else was wearing her coat she had to think it through jenny i guess i had an awful crush on you i think i made it hard for you with mr krueger joe its all right but i have to tell you like i told maw its just that youre the kind of person i want to find when i get serious about a girl i explained that to maw she was so worried because she always said my uncle would have had such a different life if it wasnt for caroline but even thats working out my uncle hasnt had a drop since my accident and theyre getting together again whos getting together again my uncle was keeping company at the time of the accident when john krueger told everybody uncle josh had been so careless cause he was mooning around caroline his girl got so upset she broke the engagement and then my uncle began drinking but now after all these years theyre starting to see each other joe who is your uncle seeing the girl he used to go around with woman now of course you know jenny your housekeeper elsa elsa had been engaged to josh brothers she had never married how much bitterness might have built up over the years against the kruegers why had she taken the job at the farmhouse the way erich treated her was so belittling elsa could have taken the coat from the closet elsa could have overheard her and erich talking elsa might have pumped the girls about kevin but why she had to talk to someone she had to trust someone jenny stopped the wind slapped at her forehead there was one person she could trust someone whose face now filled her vision she could trust mark and he should be back from florida by now as soon as she reached the house she looked up the number of marks clinic and phoned dr garrett was expected any minute who was calling she did not want to leave her name what time would be good to reach him his clinic hours are between five and seven pm shed call him at home after that she walked over to the office clyde was just locking the desk there was a wariness a constraint between them now clyde hows rooney she asked im bringing her home for good tomorrow but miz krueger one thing id appreciate it if you stay away from rooney i mean dont ask her to your house dont visit her he looked unhappy dr philstrom says rooney getting into a stress situation could set her back and im that stress situation all i know miz krueger is that rooney aint seen caroline walking around the hospital clyde before you lock up that desk i wish youd give me some money erich left so suddenly that i only have a few dollars and i need to get some odds and ends oh yes may i borrow your car to go into town clyde turned the key and dropped it in his pocket erich was real plain about that miz krueger he dont want you borrowing cars and he told me anything you need till he gets back you should just tell me and ill see you get it but he said real emphatic that he dont want no money given to you he said itll cost me my job if i give you a dime from the farm funds or lend my own money to you something in her face made him adapt a friendlier tone miz krueger youre not to want for anything just tell me what you need i need jenny bit her lip turned and slammed out of the office she ran along the path tears of rage and humiliation blinding her the lateafternoon shadows were spreading like curtains on the pale brick of the farmhouse at the edge of the woods the tall norwegian pines were vividly lush against the stark nakedness of the maples and birches the sun hidden behind heavy charcoal clouds was sending diffused rays over the horizon streaking the sky with coldly beautiful shades of mauve and pink and cranberry a winter sky a winter place it had become her prison at eight minutes after seven jenny reached for the phone to call mark her hand was touching the receiver when the phone rang she grabbed it off the cradle hello jenny you must be sitting on top of the phone are you waiting for a call there was an edge to the teasing quality in erichs tone jenny felt her palms go damp instinctively she tightened her grasp on the receiver ive been hoping to hear from you did she sound natural did her nervousness show erich how are the girls theyre fine of course what have you been doing today jenny not much now that elsa doesnt come in im a bit busier in the house i rather like that closing her eyes trying to choose her words she added lightly oh i saw joe she hurried on not wanting to lie not wanting to admit that shed gone to the ekers home hes so pleased that you rehired him erich i suppose he told you the rest of the conversation i had with him what do you mean i mean that garbled story about seeing you get in the car and then deciding he hadnt seen you you never admitted to me that joe actually told you hed seen you in the car that night i always thought it was only rooney who saw you but joe said he told me that he told you hes positive it was someone else wearing my coat jen have you signed that statement erich dont you see we have a witness who swears what you mean is we have a witness who knows he saw you and who to ingratiate himself with me to get back his job is now willing to change his story jenny stop trying to avoid the truth either have that statement ready to read to me next time i call or forget about seeing the girls until theyre adults jennys control snapped you cant do this ill swear out a warrant theyre my children you cant run away with them jenny theyre just as much mine as yours ive only taken them on a vacation ive warned you theres no judge who would award them to you i have a townful of witnesses wholl swear im a wonderful father jenny i love you enough to give you a chance to live with them to be cared for yourself dont push me too hard goodbye jenny ill call you soon jenny stared at the dead receiver all the tenuous confidence she had started to build vanished give up something said to her write the confession read it to him be finished with it no biting her lips into a thin firm line she dialed marks number he answered on the first ring dr garrett mark why did that deep warm voice bring quick tears to her eyes jenny whats the matter where are you mark i could you i have to talk to you she paused then went on but i wouldnt want anyone to see you here if i cut through the west field would you pick me up unless i mean if you have plans dont bother wait near the millhouse ill be there in fifteen minutes jenny went up to the master bedroom and turned on the reading light by the bed she left a light on in the kitchen a smaller one in the parlor clyde might investigate if the house was completely dark shed have to take the chance that erich wouldnt phone again in the next few hours she left the house and walked in the shadow of the stable and polebarns behind the electric fences she could see the outlines of the cattle as they hunched near the barns there was no grazing on the snowcovered ground and they tended to stay near the buildings where they were fed less than ten minutes after she reached the mill she heard the faint sound of a car approaching mark was driving with his parking lights on she stood out in the clearing and waved he stopped leaned over and opened the door for her he seemed to understand that she wanted to get away quickly it wasnt until they reached the county road that he spoke i understood you were in houston with erich jenny we didnt go does erich know you called me erichs away he took the children he whistled thats what dad then he stopped she felt his glance was acutely aware of his windtanned skin his thick sandy hair the long capable fingers that gripped the steering wheel erich always made her uneasy his very presence charged the atmosphere marks presence had exactly the opposite effect it had been months since the one time shed been in his home at night it had the same welcoming atmosphere that she remembered the wing chair its velvet upholstery somewhat worn was drawn up to the fireplace an outsized oak coffee table in front of a lawson couch held newspapers and magazines the shelves on either side of the fireplace were crammed with books of every shape and size mark took her coat farm life certainly hasnt fattened you up he observed have you had dinner yet no i thought not he poured sherry for them my housekeeper was off today i was just about to cook a hamburger when you phoned ill be right back jenny sat on the couch then instinctively reached down pulled off her boots and curled up she and nana had had a lawson sofa when she was growing up she could remember wedging herself into a corner of it on rainy afternoons and happily reading the hours away in a few minutes mark returned with a tray minnesota plush he smiled hamburgers french fries lettuce and tomato the food smelled delicious jenny took a bite from hers and realized shed been famished she knew mark was taking his cue from her waiting for her to explain to him why she had called him how much should she tell would mark be horrified to know what erich believed about her he was sitting in the wing chair his long legs stretched toward her his eyes concerned his forehead creased in thought she realized she didnt mind being studied by him oddly it was comforting as though he would analyze what was wrong and make it right his father had much that same look luke she hadnt asked about him how is your father coming along but he gave me a real scare he wasnt feeling well even before he went back to florida then he had the attack but hes in his own place now and looks good he really wanted you to come visit him jenny he still does im glad hes better mark leaned forward tell me about it jenny she told him everything looking straight at him watching his eyes darken watching as tight lines formed around his eyes and mouth watching as his expression softened when she talked about the baby and her voice broke you see i can understand why erich believed ive done these terrible things but now i dont believe i did them so that means some woman is impersonating me i was so sure it was rooney but it cant be her now i wonder do you think elsa it seems so farfetched that shed hold a grudge for twentyfive years erich was only a child mark did not reply his face was troubled now grave you dont think i could do those things jenny burst out my god are you like erich do you think the nerve under her left eye began to jump she put her hand up to her face to stop it then felt her knees start to tremble throwing her head down on her lap she hugged her legs her whole body was shaking now out of control jenny jenny marks arms were around her holding her her head was against his throat his lips were on her hair i couldnt hurt anyone i cant sign and say that i could his arms tightened erich is in insecure oh jenny long minutes passed before the trembling stopped she made herself pull away she felt his arms release her wordlessly they looked at each other then jenny turned away there was an afghan draped over the back of the couch he tucked it around her i think we could both use coffee while he was in the kitchen she looked into the fireplace watched as the log split and broke and caved into glowing embers suddenly she felt exhausted but it was a different kind of fatigue not tense and numbing but relaxing the kind that came after a race had been run unburdening herself to mark she felt as though she had rolled a stone off her shoulders listening to the clink of the cups and saucers in the kitchen smelling the perking coffee hearing his footsteps as he walked between stove and cabinet remembering the feel of those arms when mark brought in the coffee she was able to make practical statements that helped dispel the emotionally charged atmosphere erich knows i wont stay with him the minute he brings the girls back ill leave youre sure youre going to leave him jenny as fast as i can but first i want to force him to bring the girls back theyre my children hes right that as their adoptive father legally theyre just as much his as yours and jenny erich is capable of staying away indefinitely let me talk to a few people i have a lawyer friend whos an expert in family law but until then when erich phones whatever you do dont antagonize him dont tell him youve been talking to me promise me that of course he drove her home stopping the car at the millhouse but he insisted on walking with her through the quiet fields to the house i want to be sure youre in he said go right upstairs and if everything is all right pull down the shades in your room what do you mean if everything is all right i mean that if by any chance erich decided to come back tonight and realized that you were out there might be trouble ill call you tomorrow after i speak to a few people no dont let me phone you clyde knows every call i get when they got to the dairy barn he said ill watch you from here try not to worry ill try the one thing i dont worry about is that erich does adore tina and beth hell be very good to them that at least is a consolation mark squeezed her hand but did not answer quickly she slipped along the side of the path through the west door into the kitchen and looked around the cup and saucer she had left draining on the sink were still there she smiled bitterly she could be sure erich hadnt come that cup and saucer would have been put away hurrying upstairs she went into the master bedroom and began to pull down the shades from one of the windows she watched as marks tall form disappeared into the darkness fifteen minutes later she was in bed this was the hardest time of all when she couldnt walk across the hall and tuck tina and beth in she tried to think of all the ways erich would find to amuse them they had loved going to the county fair with him last summer several times hed spent a whole day with them in the amusement park he was endlessly patient with the children but both girls had sounded so fretful when he let them speak to her that first night hed taken them away of course by now theyd be used to her absence just the way theyd gotten used to her being in the hospital as she had told mark there was the one consolation that she wasnt worried about the girls jenny remembered the way mark had squeezed her hand when she said that why all night she lay awake if not rooney if not elsa then who at dawn she got up she could not wait for erich to come to her she tried to close off the terrible nagging fears the awful possibilities that had occurred to her during the night the cabin she had to find it every instinct told her the place to begin was in the cabin she began looking for the cabin at dawn at four am shed turned on the radio and heard the weather report the temperature was dropping sharply it was now twelve degrees fahrenheit a strong cold wind from canada was driving it down a major snowstorm was predicted it should hit the granite place area by tomorrow evening she made a thermos of coffee to take with her put an extra sweater under her ski suit her breasts were so sore thinking of the baby so much during the night had been enough to start them throbbing she could not let herself think about tina and beth now she could only pray numb pleading words take care of them please let no harm come she knew the cabin must be about twenty minutes walk from the edge of the woods shed start at the spot where erich always disappeared into the trees and crisscross back and forth from that spot it didnt matter how long it took at eleven she returned to the house heated soup changed her socks and mittens found another scarf to tie around her face and set out again at five just as the shadows were lengthening to near darkness just as she was despairing that she would have to give up the search she skied over a hilly mound and came on the small barkroofed cabin that had been the first krueger home in minnesota it had a closedup unused look but what had she expected that the chimney would be capped with smoke lamps would be glowing that yes she dared to hope that beth and tina might be in here with erich she kicked off her skis and with the hammer broke a window then stepped over the low sill into the cabin it was frigidly cold with the deep chill of an unheated sunless place blinking to adjust her eyes to the gloom jenny went to the other windows pulled up the shades and looked around she saw a twentyfootsquare room a franklin stove a faded oriental rug a couch and paintings it seemed that every square inch of the walls was covered with erichs art even the dim light could not hide the exquisite power and beauty of his work as always the awareness of his genius calmed her the fears she had harbored during the night suddenly seemed ludicrous the tranquillity of the subjects he had chosen the polebarn in a winter storm the doe head poised about to flee into the woods the calf reaching up to its mother how could the person who could paint like this with so much sensitivity so much authority also be so hostile so suspicious she was standing in front of a rack filled with canvases something about the top one caught her eye not understanding she began to flip rapidly through the paintings in the rack the signature in the righthand corner not bold and scrawling like erichs but delicately lettered with fine brushstrokes a signature more in keeping with the peaceful themes in the paintings caroline bonardi every one of them she began to study the paintings on the wall those that were framed were signed erich krueger the unframed ones caroline bonardi but erich had said that caroline had very little talent her eyes raced back and forth between a framed painting with erichs signature an unframed one signed by caroline the same use of diffused light the same signature pine tree in the background the same blending of color erich was copying carolines work no the framed canvases those were the ones hed planned to exhibit next those were the ones hed signed he hadnt painted them the same artist had done all of these erich was forging his name to carolines art that was why hed been so flustered when she pointed out that the elm in one of his supposedly new paintings had been cut down months before a charcoal sketch caught her eye it was called selfportrait it was a miniature of memory of caroline probably the preliminary sketch caroline had done before she started the painting that was her masterpiece oh god everything every emotion that she had attributed to erich through his work was a lie then why was he here so much what did he do here she saw the staircase rushed up it the loft sloped with the pitch of the roof and she had to bend forward at the top stair before she stepped into the room as she straightened up a nightmarish blaze of color from the back wall assaulted her vision shocked she stared at her own image a mirror no the painted face did not move as she approached it the dusky light from the slitlike window played on the canvas shading it in streaks like a ghostly finger pointing a collage of scenes violent scenes painted in violent colors the center figure herself her mouth twisted in grief staring down at puppetlike bodies beth and tina slumped together on the floor their blue jumpers tangled their eyes bulging their tongues protruding blue corduroy belts wound around their throats far up on the wall behind her image a window with a dark blue curtain peering through the opening in the curtain erichs face triumphant sadistic and all through the canvas in shades of green and black a slithery figure halfwoman halfsnake a woman with carolines face the cape wrapped around her like the scaly skin of the snake carolines figure bending over a surrealistic bassinette a bassinette suspended from a hole in the sky the womans hands grotesque outsized like whale flippers covering the babys face the babys hands thrust over his head the fingers starlike spread on the pillow the caroline figure in the maroon coat reflected in the windshield of a car another face beside hers kevins face exaggerated staring grotesque frightened his bruised temple swelling into the windshield the caroline figure her cape flung around her holding the hooves of a wild horse guiding them to descend on the sandyhaired figure on the ground joe joe cringing away from the hooves jenny heard the sound from her throat the keening wail the screams of protest it wasnt caroline who was halfwoman halfsnake it was erichs face peering out from the tangled dark hair erichs eyes wildly staring at her from the canvas no no no these twisted tortured revelations this artevil incarnate brilliance beside which the pastel elegance of carolines talent faded into insignificance erich had not painted the canvases he claimed as his own but those he had painted were the genius of a twisted mind they were shocking awesome in their power eviland insane jenny stared at her own image at the faces of her children their pleading eyes as the cord tightened around the small white throats at last she forced herself to wrench the canvas from the wall her unwilling fingers grasping it as though they were closing around the fires of hell somehow she managed to snap on her skis start back through the woods night was descending darkness spreading the canvas caught the wind like a sail whipped her from her own vague path bruised her against trees the wind mocked the constant screams for help that she heard screeching from her throat help me help me help me she lost the path turned around in the darkness saw again the outline of the cabin no no she would freeze out here freeze and die out here before she could find anyone to stop erich if it werent already too late she lost track of time not knowing how long she stumbled and fell and picked herself up and began again how long she clutched the damning canvas to her how long she screamed she only knew that her voice was breaking into hoarse sobs when somehow she saw a glint through a clump of trees and realized she was at the edge of the woods the glint she had seen was the reflection of the moon on the granite stone of carolines grave with a last terrible effort she skied across the open fields the house was totally dark only the faint light of the crescent moon revealed its outlines but the windows of the office were bright she headed there the canvas flapping more wildly without the trees to break the sharp wind she could no longer scream there were no sounds left except the guttural moans she heard in her throat her lips still formed the words help me help me at the door of the office she tried to turn the handle with her frozen hands tried to kick off her skis but could not force the binders to release finally she banged at the door with her ski pole until it was flung open and she fell forward into marks arms jenny his voice broke jenny steady mrs krueger someone was pulling the skis off her feet she knew that burly body that thick blunt profile it was sheriff gunderson mark was trying to pry her fingers loose from the canvas jenny let me see that and then his awed voice oh my god her own voice was a witchs croak erich erich painted it he killed my baby he dresses like caroline beth tina maybe hes killed them too erich painted this this sheriffs voice incredulous she whirled on him have you found my girls why are you here are my girls dead jenny mark was holding her tightly his hand stopping the flow of words from her mouth jenny i called the sheriff because i couldnt reach you jenny where did you find this in the cabin so many paintings but not his caroline painted them mrs krueger on him she could vent her pain she mimicked his heavy voice anything you want to tell me mrs krueger anything you suddenly remembered she began to sob jenny mark implored its not the sheriffs fault i should have realized dad had begun to suspect the sheriff was studying the canvas his face suddenly deflated the skin folding into limp creases his eyes were riveted on the upperrighthand corner of the painting with the bassinette suspended from a hole in the sky and the grotesque carolinelike figure bending over it mrs krueger erich came to me he said he understood that thered been talk about the babys death he urged me to request an autopsy the door swung open erich jenny thought oh my god erich but it was clyde who rushed in his expression frightened and disapproving what in hell is going on around here he looked at the canvas jenny watched as his leathery face drained to the color of white suede clyde whos in there rooney called her footsteps approached crackling on the icy snow hide that thing clyde begged dont let her see it here he thrust it into the supply closet rooney appeared on the threshold of the office her face filled out a little her eyes wide and calm jenny felt the thin arms embracing her jenny ive missed you through stiff lips she managed to say ive missed you too she had begun to blame rooney for everything that had happened she had dismissed everything rooney told her as the imagination of a sick mind jenny where are the girls can i say hello to them the question was a slap across the face erichs away with the girls she knew her voice was trembling unnatural come on rooney you can visit tomorrow you better get home the doctor wanted you to go straight to bed clyde urged he took her arm propelled her forward looked over his shoulder be right back while they waited she managed to tell them about her search for the cabin it was you mark last night i said the children would be fine with erich and you didnt say anything later on in bed i knew you were worried about them and i began to thinkif not rooney if not elsa if not me and my mind kept saying mark is afraid for the children then i thought erich it has to be erich that first night he made me wear carolines nightgown he wanted me to be caroline he even went to sleep in his old bed and the pine soap he put on the girls pillows i knew hed done that and kevin he must have writtenor phonedto say he was coming to minnesota erich was always toying with me erich must have known i met kevin he talked about the extra mileage in the car he must have heard the gossip from the woman in church jenny no let me tell you he took me back to that restaurant when kevin threatened to stop the adoption he told kevin to come down thats why the call was on our phone erich and i are the same height when i wear heels with my coat and the black wighe could look enough like me until he got in the car he must have hit kevin and joe he was jealous of joe he could have come home earlier that day he knew about the rat poison but my baby he hated my baby maybe because of his red hair right from the beginning when he gave him kevins name he must have been planning to kill him were those dry harsh sobs coming from her she could not stop talking she had to let it out those times i thought i felt someone leaning over me he was opening the panel he must have been wearing the wig the night i went to have the baby woke him up i touched erichs eyelid thats what scared me that was what id feel when i reached up in the dark the soft eyelid and the thick lashes mark was rocking her in his arms he has my children he has my children mrs krueger can you find your way back to the cabin sheriff gundersons tone was urgent a chance to do something yes if we start at the cemetery jenny you cant mark protested well follow your tracks but she would not let them go without her somehow she led them back mark and the sheriff and clyde they turned on the oil lamps bathing the cabin in a mellow victorian glow that only accentuated the gnawing cold they stared at the delicate signature caroline bonardi then began to search the cupboards but there were no personal papers the cupboards were empty except for dishes and cutlery hes got to keep his painting supplies somewhere mark snapped but the loft is empty jenny said hopelessly there was nothing in it except the canvas and the place is so small it cant be that small clyde objected its the size of the house it might be partitioned off there was a storage area that was half again the size of the loft room accessible by a door in the righthand corner a door that jenny hadnt noticed in the shadowy room this area had stacks of file baskets dozens more of carolines paintings in them an easel a cabinet with painting supplies two suitcases jenny realized they matched the vanity case shed found in the attic a long green cape and dark wig were folded over one of the suitcases carolines cape mark said quietly jenny began rifling through the file cabinets but they only held painting supplies charcoals and umbras and turpentine and brushes and empty canvases nothing nothing that might indicate where erich had gone clyde began searching through a bin of canvases near the door look his cry was horrorfilled he had pulled out a canvas this one in the murky green tones of stagnant water a surrealistic collage of erich as a child and caroline scenes crowding overlapping erich with a hockey stick in his hand caroline bending over a calf erich pushing her her body sprawled in a tub no that was the stock tank her eyes staring up at him the tip of the hockey stick flipping the overhead lamp into the tank erichs childface demonic now laughing into the agonized figure in the water he killed caroline clyde moaned when he was ten years old he killed his own mother what did you say they all spun around rooney was in the doorway of the loft rooney with wide eyes no longer calm did you think i couldnt tell something was wrong she asked she was staring not at the canvas clyde was holding but beyond to the painting now revealed in the bin even with the distortions jenny recognized ardens face arden peering in the window of the cabin a caped figure with dark hair and erichs face behind her hands around ardens throat the fingers not attached to the hands arden lying in a grave on top of a casket dirt being shoveled over her bright blue skirt the name on the tombstone behind her head caroline bonardikrueger and in the corner the slashing signature erich krueger erich killed my little girl rooney moaned somehow they made their way back to the house marks hand held hers tightly a silent mark not attempting to offer useless words of comfort in the house sheriff gunderson got on the phone theres the chance that everything we believe hes done is the fantasy of a sick mind theres one way we can be sure and we cant waste a minute finding out the cemetery was once again violated floodlights bathed the tombstones in unnatural night brilliance drills bore into the frozen ground of carolines grave rooney watched surprisingly calm now as they looked down they saw bits of blue wool mixed with the earth a mans voice spoke from the grave shes here for gods sake get the mother away clyde hugged rooney forcing her to retreat at least we know he said back at the house the daylight was filtering in mark made coffee when had mark begun to suspect that the children were in danger with erich she asked him jenny after i left you home last night i called dad i knew hed been terribly upset about what tina said about how the lady in the painting had covered the baby he admitted to me that hed known erich was psychotic as a child caroline had confided in him about erichs obsession with her shed caught him watching her while she slept keeping her nightgown under his pillow wrapping himself in her cape she took him to a doctor but john krueger flatly refused to allow him to be treated john said that no krueger had emotional problems it was just caroline spoiling him spending so much time with him that was the problem caroline was on the verge of a breakdown by then she did the only thing she could she relinquished custody with the understanding that john would send erich to boarding school she hoped a different atmosphere would help him but after she died john broke his promise erich never did get help when dad heard what tina said about the lady in the painting heard what rooney said about seeing caroline he began to suspect what was happening i think the realization brought on his heart attack i only wish hed confided in me of course he had absolutely no proof but that was why he told me to urge erich to allow you and the girls to visit him mrs krueger sheriff gundersons voice was hesitant was he afraid she would keep blaming him dr philstrom from the hospital is here we had him look at whats in the cabin he has to talk to you jenny can you tell me exactly what erich said the last time he phoned you dr philstrom asked he was angry because i tried to tell him that maybe he was wrong about me did he mention the girls he said they were fine how long since he put them on to talk to you nine days i see jenny ill be honest it doesnt look good but it would seem that erich must have painted that last canvas before he disappeared with the girls theres quite a lot of detail in it even if hes been in the cabinand we know he hastheres a scissor there with bits of fur on it even so it would seem that he painted that picture before he left with the children a whisper of hope you mean they may not be dead i dont want to encourage you unfairly but think about it erich still fantasizes living with you having you under his total power once he has that confession signed he knows that without the children he cant hold you so until he perceives a reunion with you as being hopeless theres a chance just a chance jenny stood up tina beth if you were dead i would know it just the way i knew nana wouldnt live through that last night just the way i knew something was going to happen to the baby but rooney hadnt known for ten years now rooney had waited for arden to come home and all the time ardens body was buried within sight of rooneys windows how often had she seen rooney standing over carolines grave was it because something had compelled her to go there something deep in her subconscious that had told her she was visiting ardens grave too she asked dr philstrom about that asked him gravely heard her voice almost childlike is that possible doctor i dont know jenny i think rooney instinctively suspected that arden wouldnt deliberately run away she knew her child i want my children jenny said i want them now how could erich hate me so much that he would hurt them youre talking about a totally irrational man dr philstrom said a man who wanted you because you bear a startling resemblance to his mother yet hated you for replacing her who could not trust your love for him because he perceives himself as unlovable and who lived in mortal fear of losing you were going to make up flyers mrs krueger the sheriff said well have their pictures in every hamlet in minnesota and all the bordering states well get television coverage somebodys got to have seen them clyde is going through all erichs records of property holdings well search out any property he owns dont forget we know he was here at least once and that was only five hours after he phoned you were concentrating on a radius of five hours drive from here the ringing of the telephone made them all jump sheriff gunderson reached to pick it up some instinct made jenny push his hand away hello her voice so unsteady would it be erich oh god would it be erich hello mommy it was beth beth she closed her eyes jammed her knuckles against her mouth beth was still alive whatever he planned to do to them hadnt happened yet the memory of the painting beth and tina stiff little puppets the corduroy belts around their necks she could not blot it out she felt marks hands those strong hands on her shoulders steadying her she held out the receiver so he could try to listen too beth hello darling she tried to sound carefree and pleased it was so hard not to scream beth where are you are you having a good time with daddy mommy youre mean you came into our room last night and you wouldnt talk to us and you covered tina too tight beths plaintive voice was highpitched enough for mark to hear she saw the agony in his eyes knew it was reflected in her own covered tina too tight no no please god no the baby now tina tina cried so hard tina cried jenny tried to fight the waves of dizziness she mustnt faint let me talk to her bethie i love you mouse now beth began to cry i love you too mommy please come soon mommy tinas helpless sobbing you hurt me the blanket was in my face tina im sorry im sorry jenny tried not to let her voice break im sorry tina there was a clunk as the phone was moved then tinas wail jenny why are you so upset the girls were dreaming its just that they miss you as i do darling erich jenny knew she was shouting where are you erich please i promise you ill sign that confession ill sign anything but please i need my children she felt marks grip on her shoulder cautioning her i mean i need my family erich she forced her voice to calm bit her lips over the urge to plead with him not to hurt them erich we can be so happy i dont know why i do such strange things when im asleep but you promised to take care of me im sure ill get better you were going to leave me jenny you just pretended to love me erich come home and well talk or let me send the letter to you tell me where you are have you talked to anyone about us jenny looked at mark he shook his head warningly why would i tell anyone about us i tried to phone you three times yesterday afternoon you were out erich i hadnt heard from you for so long i needed to get some fresh air i skied for a while i want to be able to ski with you again we had such fun remember i tried to phone mark last evening he wasnt home were you with him erich i was here im always here waiting for you tina was screaming now from the background she could hear road sounds again like heavy trucks shifting gears on a grade could erich have been at the farm last night if so had he gone to the cabin no if he had been in the cabin and seen the broken window realized that people had been there he wouldnt be calling now jenny ill think about coming back you just stay in the house dont go out dont go skiing i want you right there and someday ill open the door and be there and well be a family again will you do that jenny yes erich yes yes i promise mommy i want to talk to mommy beths pleading please please there was a sharp clicking sound and the dial tone began to hum in her ear jenny listened while mark repeated the conversation she only interjected when the sheriff asked but why would the kids have thought it was you because he has my suitcases with him now jenny said he probably put one of my robes on maybe even that red one ive been missing he must have a dark wig with him when the children are very sleepy they see what they think theyre seeing dr philstrom what will he do now jenny anything is possible i cant deny that but i suspect that as long as he still holds the hope that youll stay with him the girls are fairly safe but tinalast night you have that answer he tried to phone you in the afternoon and you were gone he tried to phone mark in the evening and couldnt reach him its uncanny how some psychotics develop almost a sixth sense some instinct told him you were together in his frustration he came very near to harming tina jenny tried to swallow over the quiver in her voice he sounds so strange almost rambling suppose he does come soon he could conceivably decide to come back tonight he knows every inch of this property he could ski in he could drive a car we wouldnt recognize he could walk in from the riverbank if he sees anyone around here who doesnt belong here that will be the end youve all got to go away suppose oh god suppose he sees carolines grave has been disturbed hell know that ardens body was found dont you see you cant have any publicity you cant send out flyers you cant have strangers here the cabin if he goes to the cabin and sees the broken window those bits of cloth tacked on the trees sheriff gunderson looked from mark to dr philstrom obviously you both agree all right mark will you ask rooney and clyde to come in here ill get the people from the coroners office theyre still sifting the dirt in the cemetery rooney was surprisingly composed jenny knew that dr philstrom was studying her closely but rooneys concern seemed to be only for jenny she hugged her laid her cheek on jennys i know oh my dear i know clyde had aged ten years in the past hours im listing all the property erich owns he said ill have that for you soon the painting jenny said weve got to put that painting back it was on the long wall in the loft i left it in the supply closet in the office dr philstrom said but i think it might be better if mrs toomis would agree to come back and stay in the hospital until this is over i want to be with clyde rooney said i want to be with jenny im all right dont you see i know rooney stays with me clyde said flatly sheriff gunderson walked over to the window this place is a mess of footprints and tire tracks he said what we need is a good snowstorm to cover them keep your fingers crossed theres one due tonight the storm began in the early evening snowflakes fine and rapid bit at the house and barns and fields the wind blew and scattered the flying flakes eventually banking them in rapidly growing piles against the trees and buildings the next morning in prayerful gratitude jenny observed the glaring whiteness outside the violated grave would be quilted with snow the tracks to the cabin obliterated if erich came he would not be suspicious even erich who could instantly sense a book out of place a vase moved a quarter of an inch would have nothing to trigger his awareness of their presence in the cabin during the night pushing their way through the treacherous roads sheriff gunderson and two deputies had come back one had wired the phones to monitor incoming calls had given jenny a walkietalkie and taught her how to use it the other had made copies of the papers clyde pulled from the files the pages and pages of income tax forms showing the krueger holdings deeds rental contracts office buildings warehouses the originals were back in the files the copies taken to be pored over by investigators who would then begin to search possible hiding places jenny adamantly refused to allow a policeman to stay in the house erich could open the door and walk in suppose he realizes that someone else is here and he would you can count on it i wont risk it she began keeping track of days with the awareness of seconds turning into minutes minutes crawling to the quarter hour the half hour she had found the cabin on the fifteenth on the morning of the sixteenth the grave had been opened and erich had phoned the snowstorm ended on the eighteenth all through minnesota the cleanup began the phone lines were down all of the seventeenth and most of the eighteenth suppose erich tried to call would he realize that it wasnt her fault he couldnt get through the entire area of granite place where the farm was located was harder hit than the rest of the county dont let him get angry she prayed dont let him take it out on the girls on the morning of the nineteenth she saw clyde coming to the house the upright set of his head and chest was gone he bent forward as he walked the freshly plowed path his face puckered not so much against the wind as under an invisible burden he seemed to be carrying he stepped into the kitchen foyer stamping his feet to break the cold he just called erich clyde why didnt you ring through why didnt you let me talk to him he didnt want to talk to you he just wanted to know if the lines were down around here last night he asked me whether or not youve been out miz krueger jenny hes uncanny he told me i sounded funny i said i didnt know about that its been pretty busy trying to feed all the cattle in this storm that seemed to satisfy him then he said the other day remember when he called right after we found arden yes he said hed been thinking about it he said that i should have been in the office at that time that the call should have been picked up there first jenny its like hes right here watching us he seems to know every move we make what did you tell him i said that id gotten rooney out of the hospital that morning and hadnt been to the office yet so that it was still on the night setting where it rings in the house then he asked me if mark has been poking around here that was the way he put it poking around what did you say i told him dr ivanson had been checking the animals and should i have called mark instead he said no clyde did he mention the children no maam just said to tell you hed be phoning and he wanted you in the house waiting for the call jenny i tried to keep him on so they could maybe trace where he is but he talked so fast and got off so quick mark phoned every day jenny i want to see you mark clydes right he is uncanny he particularly asked about you please stay away on the afternoon of the twentyfifth joe came to the house mrs krueger is mr krueger all right what do you mean joe he phoned to see how i was feeling wanted to know if ive been seeing you i said just the one time i bumped into you i didnt say youd come to our place you know what i mean he said he wanted me to come back to work when im ready but if i ever came near you or if he ever heard me call you jenny hed shoot me with the same rifle he used to kill my dogs he said my dogs that means he did kill the other one too he sounds crazy i think it wont do no good for either you or me if im around here you tell me what to do he sounds crazy he was openly threatening joe now despair anesthetized jennys terror joe did you tell anyone about this did you tell your mother no maam i dont want to get her started joe i beg you dont tell anyone about that call and if erich phones back just be very calm and easy with him tell him the doctor wants you to wait a few weeks more but dont tell him you refuse to work and joe for god sake dont tell him youve seen me again jenny theres real bad trouble isnt there yes it was useless to deny it where is he with your girls i dont know i see jenny i swear to god you can trust me i know i can and if he phones you again let me know right away please i will and joe ifi mean he might come back here if you happen to see him or the car i need to know at once you will elsa was over at our place for dinner with uncle josh she was talking about you saying what a lovely person you were she never acted as though she liked me she was scared of mr krueger he told her to know her place to keep her mouth shut to make sure nothing was ever out of place or changed in the house i never could understand why she worked for us the way erich treated her the kind of money he paid elsa said that shed work for the devil for that big a salary joe put his hand on the doorknob sounds like she was working for the devil dont it jenny february is not the shortest month of the year jenny thought it seemed an eternity day after day minute after minute the nighttime madness of lying in bed watching the outline of the crystal bowl against the darkness she wore carolines nightgown every night kept a cake of pine soap under the pillow so the bed always held the faint scent of pine if erich came in some night quietly stealthily if he came into this room this nightgown this scent might lull him into security when she did sleep she dreamt incessantly of the children in sleep they were waiting for her they would call mommy mommy and tumble into the bed pressing small wiggly bodies against her and then as she tried to put her arms around them she awoke she never dreamt of the baby it was as though the same total involvement she had given to preserving the small flicker of life in that tiny body now belonged to tina and beth she had the confession memorized over and over it ran through her head i am not responsible during the day she was never far from the phone to pass the time she spent most mornings cleaning the house she dusted and waxed and mopped swept polished silver but she would not use the vacuum for fear of missing the first peal of the telephone most afternoons rooney came over a quiet different rooney for whom the waiting was over i was thinking we might start quilts for the girls beds she suggested as long as erich still thinks he can come here and find you and be a family with you and the girls he wont hurt them but in the meantime you gotta be busy at least with your hands otherwise youll go crazy so lets start quilts rooney went up to the attic to get the bag with the leftover scraps of material they began to sew jenny thought of the legend of the three sisters who spun measured and cut the threads of time but were only two of the three she thought erich is the third it is he who can cut the strand of life rooney sorted the pieces of material into neat piles on the kitchen table well want them bright and cheerful she said so we wont use dark colors she began whisking back into the bag the ones she was rejecting this was from a tablecloth old mrs krueger had thats johns mother caroline and i used to laugh that anyone would want such a dismallooking thing and that sailcloth was from a bolt she bought to make a cover for the picnic table that was the summer erich was five and oh i dont know why i dont just throw out the rest of this blue stuff remember i told you i made curtains for the big back room when they were up youd think you were in a cave the whole room was so dark oh well she pushed it into the sack you never know when you might want to put your hand on it they began to sew it seemed to jenny that the end of hope had robbed rooney of intensity everything she said was expressed in the same middle key once erich is found were going to have a real funeral for arden the hardest for me now is to think back and remember how erich encouraged me to think that arden was still alive clyde said all along that shed never run away i shoulda known that i guess i did know that but every time i started to say that i guess my arden is with god why then erich would say i dont believe that rooney he was so cruel getting up my hopes like that kind of like never letting the wound heal i tell you jenny he dont deserve to live rooney please dont talk like that im sorry jenny sheriff gunderson phoned her every night weve checked out the real estate weve given pictures to all the police in those areas with the understanding there be no publicity and if they see him or the car they dont apprehend him hes not at any of the places listed in his tax returns he tried to offer cautious comfort they say no news is good news mrs krueger right now the kids may be playing on a beach in florida getting a nice suntan pray god they were she didnt believe it mark phoned every night they stayed on only a minute or two nothing jen nothing all right i wont tie up the line hang in there jenny hang in there she tried to establish some sort of pattern to her days the nights either sleepless or wracked with torturing dreams drove her from bed at dawn for days she hadnt been outside the house an earlymorning television program featured a yoga exercise faithfully she sat in front of the set at sixthirty mechanically following the prescribed routine of the day at seven oclock good morning america came on she forced herself to listen to the news listen politely to the interviews one day as she watched pictures were flashed on the screen of children who had disappeared some of them had been missing for years amy roger tommy linda josé one after the other each representing heartbreak someday would they add elizabeth and christine nicknamed beth and tina to the list their adoptive father left with them on february sixth three years ago if anyone has knowledge the evenings had a ritual too she sat in the familyroom section of the kitchen and read or tried to watch television usually she would spin the dial and leave the set at where it stopped unseeingly she endured situation comedies hockey games old movies she tried to read but pages later shed realize her mind hadnt taken in a thing the last night in february she was particularly restless it seemed as though there was a stillness in the house that was particularly jarring the canned laughter during a program depicting a couple throwing bricabrac at each other made her snap off the set she sat staring ahead seeing nothing the phone rang by now without hope she picked it up hello jenny this is pastor barstrom from zion lutheran how have you been very well thank you i hope erich extended our sympathy at the loss of your baby i wanted to visit you but he suggested i defer seeing you is erich there no hes away im not sure when hell be back i see will you just remind him that our senior citizens center is almost complete as the largest donor i want to be sure he knows the dedication date is march tenth hes a very generous man jenny yes ill tell him you called good night pastor the phone rang at quarter of two she was lying in bed a pile of books beside her hoping that one of them would help her while away the night jenny yes was it erich he sounded different highpitched tense jenny who were you talking to on the phone around eight oclock you smiled while you were talking around eight she tried to sound thoughtful tried not to scream out the words where are beth and tina lets see she made a point of the delay sheriff gunderson mark she didnt dare mention either pastor barstrom erich pastor barstrom phoned he wanted to talk to you to invite you to the opening of the senior citizens hall her hands clammy her mouth trembling she waited for his comment keep him on the phone that way they might be able to trace the call are you sure it was pastor barstrom erich why would i say that she bit her lips how are the girls theyre fine let me talk to them theyre very tired i put them to bed you looked nice tonight jenny i looked nice tonight she felt herself begin to tremble yes i was there i was looking in the window you should have guessed i was there if you love me you would have guessed in the darkness jenny watched the crystal bowl eerie green why didnt you come in i didnt want to i just wanted to make sure you were still there waiting for me i am waiting for you erich and im waiting for the girls if you didnt want to be here let me come and be with you no not yet are you in bed now jenny yes of course what nightgown have you got on the one you like i wear it a lot maybe i should have stayed maybe you should i wish you would there was a pause in the background she could hear sounds of traffic he must always call from the same phone he had been outside the window you didnt tell pastor barstrom that im mad at you of course not he knows how much we love each other jenny i tried to phone mark but his line was busy were you talking to him no i wasnt you really were talking to pastor barstrom why dont you call and ask him no i believe you jenny ill keep trying to get mark i just remembered he has a book of mine i want it back it belongs on the third shelf of the library the fourth from the right end erichs voice was changing becoming whiny fretful there was something about it she was hearing it again the highpitched screaming that had nearly destroyed her with its accusations is mark your new boyfriend does he like to swim whore get out of carolines bed get out of it now there was a click then silence then the dial tone a mild impersonal buzz radiating from the receiver in her hand sheriff gunderson phoned twenty minutes later jenny the phone company partially traced the call we have the area he dialed from its around duluth duluth the northern part of the state nearly six hours driving from here that meant if he was staying in that area he had started down in the midafternoon in order to have been looking in the window at eight oclock who had been with the children all the hours hed been gone or had he left them alone or werent they alive anymore she hadnt spoken to them since the sixteenth almost two weeks ago hes coming apart she said tonelessly sheriff gunderson did not try to offer empty cheer yes i think he is what can you do do you want us to go public release the facts to television stations newspapers god no that would be signing the girls death certificates then well get a special squad combing the duluth area and we want to leave a detective in your house your own life may be in danger absolutely not hed know it was almost midnight february would become march jenny remembered the childhood superstition she had if you fell asleep saying hare hare on the last night of the month and woke up in the morning the first day of the new month saying rabbit rabbit you would get your wish nana and she used to make a game of it hare hare jenny said aloud into the quiet room she raised her voice hare hare shrieking she screamed hare hare i want my children i want my children sobbing she collapsed back on the pillow i want beth i want tina in the morning her eyes were so swollen she could barely see out of them somehow she got dressed went downstairs made coffee rinsed off her cup and saucer the thought of food sickened her and there was no use stacking the dishwasher with one lonely cup and saucer slipping on her ski jacket she hurried outside and walked around to the window on the southern side of the house that looked into the family area of the kitchen there were footsteps outlined in the snow below that window footsteps that had come out of the woods gone back to the woods while she sat in that room erich had stood out here his face pressed against the glass watching her the sheriff phoned again at noon jenny i played that tape for dr philstrom he thinks wed better take the chance of going public in search for the children but its your decision let me think on it she wanted to ask mark rooney came over at two want to sew a little i suppose so placidly rooney took a chair near the iron stove and got out the pieces she was working on well well be seeing him soon rooney commented him erich of course you know that promise caroline made that shed always be here on his birthday since she died twentysix years ago erich has been on this place on his birthday pretty much like you saw him last year just kind of wandering around as though hes looking for something and you believe hell be here this year he never missed yet rooney please help me dont remind anyone not clyde or anyone about that seemingly pleased to be treated as a conspirator rooney nodded eagerly well just wait for him wont we jen jenny could not trust even mark with the information when he phoned to urge her to let the sheriff get help from the media she declined finally she compromised give it one week more please mark the week would be up march and erichs birthday was march he would be here on the eighth she was sure of it if the sheriff and mark suspected he was coming they might insist on trying to hide some policemen around the farm but erich would know if the girls were still alive this was her last chance to get them back erich was losing whatever grip he had on reality in the next week jenny moved in a near trance her every thought a continuing prayer oh lord in mercy spare them she dug out the ivory case that held nanas rosary beads jenny closed her hand around the rosary she could not concentrate on formal prayer nana come on you say it for me the second the third the fourth the fifth the sixth dont let it snow again dont let the roads be impassable the seventh on the morning of the seventh the phone rang a persontoperson call from new york it was mr hartley jenny so long since i talked to you how are you the girls fine were fine jenny im sorry weve got a terrible problem the wellington trust remember they bought minnesota harvest and spring on the farm paid a lot of money jenny yes they were having the paintings cleaned and jenny im sorry to tell you this but erich forged his name to them theres another signature under his caroline bonardi im afraid theres going to be a terrible scandal jenny the wellington people are having an emergency board meeting tomorrow afternoon theyve called a news conference after it by tomorrow evening there will be a big news story stop them you have to stop them stop them jenny how can i art forgery is serious business when you pay six figures for a new artist when that artist wins the most prestigious awards in the field you cant keep quiet about a forger jenny im sorry its out of my hands right now theyre investigating to find out who caroline bonardi is in friendship i wanted you to know ill tell erich thank you mr hartley long after she put the phone down jenny sat staring at the receiver there was no way to stop the story reporters would be here looking to talk to erich it wouldnt take too much investigation to find that caroline bonardi was the daughter of the painter everett bonardi and the mother of erich krueger once they started examining the paintings carefully theyd be able to determine that all of them were over twentyfive years old she went to bed early in the hope that erich might be more likely to come in if the house was dark she bathed as she had that first night only this time she used a handful of pine crystals in the tub the fragrance of the pine filled the room she let her hair trail in the water so that it too absorbed the scent each morning she rinsed out the aqua gown now she put it on slipped a dry cake of soap under the pillow and looked around the bedroom nothing must be out of place nothing must disturb erichs sense of orderliness the closet doors were closed she moved the brush of the silver dressing set a halfinch nearer the nail buffer the shades were drawn exactly even she folded the cranberry brocade spread over the laceedged sheets at last she got into bed the walkietalkie the sheriff had given her that she carried in the pocket of her jeans made a outline under her pillow she slipped it in the nighttable drawer hour by hour she listened as the clock chimed the night away please erich come she thought she willed him to come surely if he were in the house if he crept down this hallway the scent of pine would draw him in but when the first light of the sun began to filter through the drawn shades there was still no sign of his presence jenny stayed in bed until eight oclock the coming of the day only increased her terror she had been so sure that during the night she would hear faint footsteps that the door would start to move that erich would be there looking for her looking for caroline now she had only the hours until the evening news broadcast the day was overcast but when she turned on the radio them was no forecast of snow she was not sure how to dress erich was so suspicious if he came upon her in anything other than slacks and a sweater he might accuse her of expecting another man she barely bothered to look in the mirror anymore this morning she studied herself saw with shock the prominent cheekbones the haunted staring look in her eyes the way her hair had grown past her shoulders with a clip she caught it at the nape of her neck she recalled the night she had looked in this mirror and as she wiped away the steam had seen erichs face erichs outstretched hands holding the aqua gown her instincts had warned her about him that night but she hadnt listened downstairs she scrutinized every detail of every room she washed the surfaces of the kitchen counters and appliances shed barely used the kitchen for more than a can of soup these past weeks but erich wanted everything mirrorbright in the library she ran a dustcloth over the bookshelves and noticed that the third shelf fourth from the end did have a vacancy as erich had said how odd that she had resisted truth so long refused to face the obvious lost the baby and maybe the girls because she didnt want to know what erich was clouds darkened the house at noon a wind began to blow at three sending a moaning sound through the chimneys but driving the clouds back so that the lateafternoon sun burst out shining on the snowcrusted fields making them glisten as though with warmth jenny walked from window to window watching the woods watching the road that led to the riverbank straining her eyes to see if anyone was lurking under the protective overhang of the barn at four she watched the hired men begin to leave men shed never really gotten to know erich never let them near the house she never went near them in the fields the experience with joe had been enough at five oclock she turned on the radio for the news the briskly crisp voice of the commentator reported on new budget cuts another summit meeting in geneva the attempted assassination of the new president of iran and now heres an item just in the wellington trust fund has just announced a stunning art forgery prominent minnesota artist erich krueger who has been hailed as the most important american painter since andrew wyeth has been forging his name to the work he has been representing as his own the true artist is caroline bonardi it has been determined that caroline bonardi was the daughter of the late wellknown portrait painter everett bonardi and the mother of erich krueger jenny turned off the radio any minute the phone would start to ring within hours reporters would be swarming here erich would see them would perhaps hear the broadcast would know it was over and he would take his final revenge on jenny if he hadnt already blindly she stumbled out of the kitchen what could she do what could she do without knowing where she was going she walked into the parlor the evening sun was streaming into the room illuminating carolines portrait a bleak pity for the woman who had known this same bewildering helplessness made her study the painting caroline sitting on the porch that dark green cape wrapped around her the tiny tendrils of hair brushing her forehead the sun setting the small figure of the boy erich running toward her the figure running toward her the sun rays were diffused throughout the room it would be a brilliant sunset reds and oranges and purples and charcoal clouds streaked with diamondtinted light the figure running toward her erich was out there somewhere in those woods jenny was sure of it and there was only one way to force him to leave them the shawl rooney had made for her no it wasnt large enough but if she wore something with it the army blanket that had been erichs fathers in the cedar chest that was almost the same color as carolines cape racing up the two flights of stairs to the attic she tore open the cedar chest reached down into it pushed aside the old world war two uniforms on the bottom was the army blanket khakicolored but not unlike the shade of the cape a scissor she had scissors in the sewing basket the sun was getting lower in a few minutes it would begin to sink downstairs with trembling hands she cut a hole in the middle of the blanket a hole just large enough for her head and drew it around her then she pulled the shawl over her shoulders the blanket fell around her draped capelike to the floor her hair it was longer than carolines now but in the painting caroline had it loosely drawn up into a psyche knot jenny stood in front of the kitchen mirror twisting her hair curling small tendrils over her fingers fastening it with the large barrette caroline inclined her head a little to one side she held her hands in her lap the right hand lying over the left jenny stood at the west door of the porch i am caroline she thought i will walk like caroline sit like her i am going to watch the sunset as she always did i am going to watch my little boy come running toward me she opened the door and unhurriedly stepped out into the sharp cold air closing the door she walked over to the swing adjusted it so it directly faced the sunset and sat down she remembered to shake the shawl so that it folded over the left arm of the swing as it had in the painting she tilted her head so that it was at a slight angle to the right she folded her hands in her lap until the right hand lay encased in the left palm then slowly very slowly she began to rock the swing the sun slipped out from behind the last cloud now it was a fiery ball low in the heavens about to slip over the horizon now it was going down down and the sky was diffused with color jenny continued to rock purples and pinks and crimsons and oranges and golds and the occasional clouds billowing like gossamer the wind just sharp enough to move the clouds rustle the pines at the edge of the woods rock back and forth study the sunset all that matters is the sunset the little boy will soon run out from the woods to join his mother come little boy come erich she heard a high wail a wail that grew louder and shriller aai yee devilll devilll from the grave go away go away a figure was stumbling from the woods a figure holding a rifle a figure draped in a dark green cape with long black hair that the wind blew in matted tangles a figure with staring eyes and a face caught in a grimace of fear jenny stood up the figure stopped lifted the gun and aimed it erich dont shoot she stumbled to the door turned the handle the door was locked it had snapped locked behind her lifting the army blanket trying not to stumble over its trailing ends she began to run zigzagging down the porch steps across the field while she heard the sound of shots following her a burning sensation bit into her shoulder warmth flooded her arm she staggered but there was no place to run the strange screaming was behind her devilll devilll the dairy barn loomed to the right erich had never gone in there not since caroline died frantically she wrenched the door open the door that led into the anteroom where the vats of milk were stored he was close behind her she rushed into the inner area the barn itself the cows were in from the pastures had already been milked they stood in their stalls watching with mild interest grazing at the straw in the troughs before them she could hear footsteps close behind her blindly she ran to the end of the barn as far as she could go the stock tank was there the pen for the new calves the tank was dry she turned to face erich he was only ten feet away he stopped and began to laugh he lifted the gun to his shoulder and took aim with the same precision he had shown when he shot joes puppy they stared at each other mirror images with the dark green capes the long dark hair his hair too had been clumsily pinned up in a knot his own blond curls escaping from under the wig gave the impression of tendrils on the forehead devilll devilll she closed her eyes oh god she heard the gun going off then a shriek that gurgled into a moan but not from her lips she opened her eyes it was erich who was sinking to the ground erich who was bleeding from the nose and mouth erich whose eyes were glazing whose wig was matted with blood behind him rooney lowered a shotgun thats for arden she said quietly jenny sank on her knees erich the girls are they alive his eyes were dim but he nodded yes is someone with them no alone erich where are they his lips tried to form words theyre he reached up for her hand twisted his fingers around her thumb im sorry mommy im sorry mommy i didnt mean to hurt you his eyes closed his body gave a last violent shudder and jenny felt the pressure on her hand released the house was crowded but she saw everyone as vague shadows on a screen sheriff gunderson the people from the coroners office who chalked the outline of erichs body and took it away the reporters who swarmed in after the news of the art forgery and stayed for the far bigger story theyd arrived in time to snap pictures of erich the cape draped around him the wig matted with blood the curiously peaceful face of death theyd been allowed to go to the cabin to photograph and film carolines beautiful paintings erichs tortured canvases the greater the sense of urgency we give to the search the more people will try to help wendell gunderson said mark was there it was he who cut away the blanket and her blouse bathed the wound disinfected it bandaged it that will hold it for the present its only a flesh wound thank god she shivered at the touch of those long gentle fingers through all the burning pain if there was help possible it would come through mark they found the car erich had driven found it hidden in one of the tractor paths on the farm hed rented the car in duluth six hours drive away hed left the children at least thirteen hours ago left them where all through the evening the driveway was filled with cars maude and joe ekers came maude her strong capable bulk bending over jenny im so sorry a few minutes later jenny heard her at the stove and then the smell of perking coffee pastor barstrom came john krueger worried so about erich but he never told me why and then it seemed as though erich was doing so well the weather report a storm is moving into minnesota and the dakotas a storm oh god are the girls warm enough clyde came to her jenny you gotta help me theyre talking about committing rooney to the hospital again at last she was startled out of her lethargy she saved my life if she hadnt shot erich he would have killed me she told one of them reporters that she did it for arden clyde said jenny help me if they lock her up rooney cant take it she needs me i need her jenny got up from the couch steadied herself against the wall went looking for the sheriff he was on the phone get more flyers tack them up in every supermarket every gas station go over the border into canada when he hung up she said sheriff why are you trying to put rooney in the hospital his voice was soothing jenny try to understand rooney intended to kill erich she was out there with a gun waiting for him she was trying to protect me she knew the danger i was in she saved my life all right jenny let me see what i can do wordlessly jenny put her arms around rooney rooney had loved erich from the moment hed been born no matter what she said she had not shot him because of arden she had shot him to save jennys life i couldnt have killed him in cold blood she thought and neither could she the night wore on all the properties were being searched again dozens of false reports were coming in snow was starting to fall swift biting flakes maude made sandwiches jenny could not swallow finally she sipped consommé at midnight clyde took rooney home maude and joe left the sheriff said ill be at my desk all night ill call you if we hear anything only mark remained you must be tired go on home he didnt answer her instead he went and got blankets and pillows he made her lie down on the couch by the stove he poked a new log on the fire he stretched out on the big chair in the dim light she stared at the cradle filled with wood beside the chair she had refused to pray after the baby died she didnt realize how bitter shed been now i accept his loss but please let me have my girls could you strike a bargain with god sometime during the night she began to doze but the throbbing in her shoulder kept her on the edge of wakefulness she felt herself stirring restlessly making soft hurting sounds and then it eased the pain and the restless tossing after a while when she opened her eyes she found herself leaning against mark his arm around her the quilt tucked over her something was teasing her something in her sub conscious that kept trying to surface something desperately important that was eluding her it was something to do with that last canvas and erich watching her his face peering through the window at her at seven oclock mark said ill fix some toast and coffee jenny went upstairs and showered wincing as the stream of water struck the adhesive on her shoulder rooney and clyde were in the house when she came back down they sipped coffee together as they watched the national news the girls pictures would be shown on the today show and on good morning america rooney had brought the patches do you want to sew jenny no i cant it helps me were making these for the girls beds she explained to mark the girls are going to be found rooney please clyde tried to quiet her but they are you see how nice and bright the colors are no dark stuff in my quilts oh look heres the story they watched as jane pauley began the report a forgery that rocked the art world yesterday turned out to be only a very small part of a far more dramatic tale erich krueger they watched as erichs face came on the screen the picture was the same as the one on the brochure in the gallery his bronzegold tightly curled hair his dark blue eyes the halfsmile they had films of the farm a shot of the body being carried away now tina and beth smiled from the screen and this morning those two little girls are still missing jane pauley said as he died erich krueger told his wife that her children are still alive but police are not certain he can be believed the last canvas he painted seems to suggest tina and beth are dead the entire screen was filled with that last painting jenny looked at the limp puppet figures her own tortured image staring erich looking in the window at them laughing as he held back the curtain mark jumped to turn off the set i told gunderson not to let them take photographs in the cabin rooney had jumped up too you should have showed me that painting she screamed you should have showed it to me dont you understand the curtains the blue curtains the curtains this was what had been gnawing at jennys memory rooney spilling the scraps onto the kitchen table that dark blue material the faint design visible in the painting rooney where did he put them they were all shouting the same thing where rooney totally aware of the precious knowledge she held tugged at mark excitedly crying mark you know your dads fishing lodge erich always used to go there with you you didnt have curtains in the guest room he said it was too bright i gave him those eight years ago mark could they be there jenny cried its possible dad and i havent been at the lodge in over a year erich has a key where is the lodge its in the duluth area on a small island it makes sense its just just what she could hear the sound of snow slapping against the windows the lodge doesnt have central heating clyde vocalized the fear that was now in all of them that place dont have central heating and you mean those kids may be alone in it now mark raced for the phone thirty minutes later the police chief from hathaway island returned their call weve got em agonized jenny listened to marks question are they all right she grabbed the phone to hear the answer yep but just barely krueger had threatened to punish them if they ever tried to set foot out of the house but hed been gone so long and the place was freezing so the older girl decided to take a chance she managed to unlock the door theyd just left the house to hunt for mommy when we found them they wouldnt a lasted half an hour in this storm wait a minute jenny heard the phone being moved and then two small voices were saying hello mommy marks arms held her tightly as she sobbed mouse tinker bell i love you i love you april broke over minnesota like a godhead of plenty the red haze haloed the trees as tiny buds began to form waiting to burst into bloom deer ran from the woods pheasants strutted on the roads cattle wandered far into the pastures the ground softened and snow melted down into the furrows nourishing the spring crops as they pushed their way to the surface beth and tina began to ride again beth straight and careful tina always ready to give her pony a kick and send him racing jenny rode on fire maid beside beth joe rode close to tina jenny could not get enough of being with the children of being able to kiss the soft cheeks hold the sturdy little hands hear the prayers answer the endless questions or listen to the frightened confidences daddy scared me so much he used to put his hands on my face like this he looked so funny for so long she had wanted to go back to new york to leave this place dr philstrom warned her against it those ponies are the best therapy for the children i cannot spend another night in this house mark had provided the answer the schoolhouse on the west end of his property that years before hed converted for himself when dad moved to florida i took over the farmhouse and rented this place but its been empty for six months it was charming with two bedrooms a roomy kitchen a quaint parlor small enough that when tina cried out in terrorfilled dreams jenny could be at her side instantly im here tinker bell go back to sleep she told luke of her plans to turn over krueger farm to the historical society be sure jenny he told her its worth a fortune and god knows you earned the right to have it theres plenty for me without it and i could never live there again she closed her eyes against the memory of the bassinette in the attic the panel behind the headboard the owl sculpture the portrait of caroline rooney visited frequently proudly driving the car clyde had bought her a contented rooney who no longer needed to wait home in case arden chose to return you can accept anything jenny if you have to not knowing is the worst torture the people of granite place came calling its about time we welcomed you here jenny most of them added were so sorry jenny they brought cuttings and seeds for her her fingers in the soft moist earth as she planted her garden the sound of the comfortably shabby station wagon in the driveway the
