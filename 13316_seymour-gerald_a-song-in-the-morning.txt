a song in the morning gerald seymour they were four they walked abreast dodging the lunchtime crowd they were unremarkable to the point of anonymity when their line broke it was to let a white through because even for these four that was ingrained instinct they all wore jogging shoes and loose shapeless trousers and long overcoats and their woollen caps were tight down on their skulls the whites passing between them ignoring them were still clothed for the remnants of the drought summer girls in light frocks and cotton skirts and blouses and the men in shirt sleeves but these four had started out on their journey to the city long before the whites had stirred in their suburban beds they had moved out of the township before the sun had glimmered onto the electricity pylons and over the horizon of galvanised tin roofs when they had caught their first bus the frost was still on the ground crystal lights on the dry dun veld they didnt speak a security policeman or an interrogator might have noticed the tightness at their mouths or the brightness in their eyes or a certain stiffness in their walk but the secretaries and the salesmen and the shop girls and the clerks saw nothing for each of them it was the first time that they had been given a mission into the very centre of the city a security policeman or an interrogator any man who was accustomed to the scent of fear might have noticed the way that one of the four held in two hands the strings of a duffel bag that was heavy and bulky he might have seen that two others each had a hand thrust deep into the side pocket of the overcoat as if to guard or hide something of importance but the city was at peace and at its lunch hour and the four young men aroused no attention as they made their way along pritchard going west for the whites who shared the pavement with these four young blacks the sun was high and the violence of the townships was beyond sight out of mind a relaxed and safe and comfortable warmth shimmered on the fast traffic flow and the rough pavement on pritchard there were queues at the sandwich bars there were men with their heads in the afternoon newspapers not searching for the statistics of the previous nights unrest but for the selections of the local rugby teams there were women eyeing the big plate glass windows of the department stores and the clothes that came by sea from london and paris and rome together at the same moment the young blacks saw the cream and grey combi van that was parked against the kerb on the junction of pritchard and delvers and they looked at each other and saw that they had all found the van a white man lounged behind the combis wheel the white couldnt have missed the four blacks as they hesitated on the pavement their faces split with nervous smiles and stared at him he couldnt have missed them but he gave no sign of having noticed them he looked ahead and sucked the wet filter of a cigarette the engine of the van was idling the four blacks went on and one turned and saw that the rear doors were marginally open it was all as they had been told it would be they waited for the green pedestrian light and crossed van wielligh each of the four would have wanted to run now to charge on the target but the discipline held and so they waited for the light and then walked across the wide street and past four rows of cars past the methodist church offices and the bookshop the one with the duffel bag stole a glance at the books in the window because he had been educated to grade at a church school and the books in the window were something familiar to him where nothing else was familiar the ones with their hands in their pockets and the one with nothing to carry in his tight clenched fists were of the townships round the city the one with the duffel bag was a country boy and a member of this cadre only because of his special training the pavement narrowed its width cut by high wooden boards filled with advertising that masked a building site they were jostled by whites and blacks alike hurrying against their flow the one with his hands clenched went first a ram against the tide he was followed by the one who held in his overcoat pocket a makharov automatic pistol next was the one whose fingers were coiled round the smooth metal of an rg fragmentation grenade last was the one with the duffel bag they were past the building site and the pavement opened out and in front of them were the tended lawns and the mock gothic mass of the rand supreme court they had all stopped one thing to walk past the court when they were clean carried nothing different now because three of them were the escort and the fourth carried a duffel bag that held a litre can of petrol that was strapped with adhesive tape to nine sticks of explosive each weighing grammes and taped to the can and wired to the explosive was a battery for the electrical timing device manufactured to provide a second fuse they all waited on one of the others to take a step forward the courthouse was an attractive building wide steps and a dominating portico entered through double doors the front part of the building housed the court rooms behind and towering was the eight storey administration block the work place for the clerks and their records two years earlier comrades of these four young blacks had smuggled a limpet mine into the administration it had been defused before it exploded but it remained something of a symbol not enough of a symbol for the men who had sent this cadre back for a second attack inside the courthouse the sentences were handed down on the comrades on the captured cadres in the broken cells one years imprisonment for playing a audio tape distributed by the african national congress one year and six months for engraving a tea break mug with the words mandela t h e peoples leader six years for singing in gaol s university a song in praise of mandela who was in gaol and aggett and biko who had died in police custody eight years for membership of the banned underground african national congress and being found in possession of tshirts with the logo viva mandela ten years for collecting political information for the african national congress fifteen years for possession of firearms and explosives twenty years for sabotage the sentence of death for the man who in the name of the african national congress executed a policeman on their way to the gaols the comrades had come in their tens and in their hundreds to the rand supreme court on pritchard street it was a good target they were beside the sweeping entrance road that went down the side of the court building and then turned sharply into the tunnel that burrowed under the tower it was the way the prisoners went and the informers who gave evidence against them the most secret of the states witnesses a white stood at the mouth of the entrance road blocking it short cut hair pressed slacks a club tie neatly knotted and his arms crossed and cradling a personal radio they had seen this policeman each time that they had come to look at the court they would have to run back past him after the bomb they had been told that everyone would be dazed after the bomb that the boer too would be confused and they had the makharov and the rg fragmentation grenade the bustle and swim of the city eddied around them the sun shone down on them the noises of the city drifted between them the one who carried the duffel bag closed his eyes seemed to look upwards and his lips moved in silence as if he repeated a single word again and again he was the country boy who was fearful of everything that was beyond the farm where he had been raised he was the country boy who had stifled that fear and travelled by aircraft two years before from tanzania to the great city of moscow who had gone to the camp outside kiev and who had flown back with his knowledge of explosives and his expertise in detonators and fuses the others huddled close to the country boy and they heard the whispered hiss on his lips the one word the word was amandla meaning freedom muscles strained under the overcoats veins swelling from under the woollen caps they were together they were as one the country boy took a great gulp of air into his lungs and his hand loosened the mouth of the duffel bag and slid down inside it they walked along the pavement beside the low wall that bordered the courts lawns they saw the blacks who lay on the grass on their backs servants of the court and outside because it was the lunchtime recess they saw a barrister trotting towards the doorway with his gown folded like a raincoat over his arm they saw the japanese cars parked at the kerb immediately in front of the doors and their high radio aerials which showed they were driven by the security police and the crime squad detectives they saw a white youngster kiss his white girl they saw a black man wobble and swerve on his bicycle when he was cut up by a shining mercedes they saw the dark open doorway of the court the country boy wondered if the white in the combi would really wait for them after the blast and the fire the country boy led on the skin strip between the collar of his overcoat and the wool of his cap he could feel the separate breath of the one with the makharov and the one with the rg he knew what the bomb would do at the training camp he had seen the scattering flame of the bomb he liked what he had seen what he did not like was the order that the timing of the attack should be for the lunch hour there had been a fierce argument between those who would carry the bomb and those who gave order for its use those who gave the order had said they wanted only damage to the buildings not casualties those who carried the bomb had insisted on damage to the buildings and also to the whites who were the apparatus of the state and the blacks who were the accomplices of the state the compromise had been the lunch hour he led up the path between the lawns his right forefinger rested on the switch inside the duffel bag when he pressed the switch they had half a minute the two doors were open the lunch hour so they said was the likeliest chance that the lobby of the court would be empty the country boy thought it was a wrong decision a heavy wooden bench was placed across the doorway leaving only a small entrance through which the courts visitors could be filtered by the police when the adjournment was over when the friends and relations of the accused would be admitted on the first floor judges were clustered round the table in the chamber of the most senior of them talking not of law but of bloodstock form in the whites canteen waitress service barristers briefed by the state sat with their poorer pro deo colleagues who would make the defence case seldom successfully for their clients and chewed over disinvestment and the slide of the rand and the collapse of residential property prices in the basement cells a white businessman charged with fraudulent conversion ate the fried chicken sent in by his mistress and in their separate cells there were blacks who squatted against the cold concrete walls and bowed their heads over bowls of porridge the country boy was on the the bottom step the doorway yawned in front of him his finger was rigid on the switch they were panting behind him he pressed the switch again the draught of air sank in his throat its closed the boers voice the enemys voice his hand snaked back out of the bag the arm that was to hurl the bag into the lobby of the court frozen useless you cant go in there for another eighteen minutes he spun his head he saw the one with the makharov and the one with the rg and the one who had nothing at all gawping back down onto the path the uniformed warrant officer stood in the centre of the pathway his arms were clasped behind his back on a short leathercoated swagger stick an immaculate police tunic knifeedge trousers shoes that a servant had polished seventeen minutes actually the warrant officer grinned cheerfully for now get yourselves away the country boy flexed his arm turned and threw the bag into and inside the doorway he ran he cannoned into the one with the makharov felt the bite of the barrel into his thigh and he ran across the grass jumping the wall all of them charging together none of them hearing the shout of the warrant officer none of them seeing him stagger from the shoulder charge of the one who had nothing and then go as if from instinctive duty through the doorway none of them seeing him grope for the duffel bag under a table deep in the lobby and take it in his arms and twist again for the bright sunlight of the doorway all of them sprinting none of them seeing the fast sweep of understanding chisel the face of the plain clothes policeman with the personal radio they were past the building site they were running swerving sidestepping jumping into the traffic on van wielligh going chicken with a bus driver and having him brake when the bomb exploded a bomb detonated in the centre of a safe city in the middle of a safe lunch hour a bomb that spewed fire showered glass ripped at plaster and concrete and brick work all four would dearly have loved to have seen the explosion only the country boy had an exact idea of the scale of the flame blown outwards in a blazing spray they would dearly have loved to have seen the warrant officer disintegrate when he was a yard from the door when he was at the moment of throwing the bomb away from him and onto the grass in the few seconds that the warrant officer had screamed of the danger of the bomb he had attracted enough attention for there to be seven civilians and two policemen in the court lobby they would dearly have loved to see those nine persons bowled over by the blast and the smoke cloud and the fire draught they saw nothing of the devastation and nothing of the policeman chasing after them the radio in one hand and a revolver in the other they reached the combi van they flung open the door and scrambled inside in a confusion of knees and elbows and shouts and the van was accelerating into the wide spaces of pritchard before theyd managed to close the doors the last thing the country boy saw before the doors were shut was the policeman on the pavement panting heaving yelling into his radio jeez drove like he hadnt a tomorrow and he didnt reckon he had a tomorrow shit and hed heard the explosion couldnt have missed it half choked on his cigarette and the windows around him had rattled fit to break and hed seen the heads on the pavement spinning to stare up the street hed been facing away from the explosion hed had only the shock wave none of the sights left into end up past the kerk junction left onto jeppe jeez going hard and with the frown slashed on the old weatherstained skin of his forehead he was going hard because hed heard the bang and a bang like that at midday in central joburg meant a bloody big show nobody had said anything other than that he was to be parked in a combi van on the corner of pritchard and delvers north side looking east back doors unfastened done as he was told because thats what they all did in the movement blacks and whites shit nobody had said it was a bloody headline grabber theyd be running from right off jeppe and into rissik he was burning the tyres hitting the turns way ahead up rissik was the railway station thats where hed been told he had to get four kids to catch a train thats all he had been told that if there was a police block then a white in a commercial van would sail through but this was an arsehole because of his initials james carew had always been jeez he rather fancied it he used that name on the telephone used it to anyone who knew him marginally hed had the name since the time he left school since he was in the army the name was his possession his style like kids who had a ring in their ear or a tattoo he was jeez had been for more than years he heard the siren shit jeez saw the traffic in front of him swerving for the slow lane and that told him that the bells and the whining were behind and his ears told him the bastards were closing nobody had told him who he would be driving hadnt said it was a getaway just that four kids who were a bit hot needed picking up on the corner of pritchard and delvers and needed dropping off at the station when hed seen them earlier hed thought bright lads these not piling into the van straight off theyd have been checking for a tail well now they had a tail all right hed been on the road of bells and sirens before more than twenty years before but the memory was still sharp not the sort of sound that any bugger ever forgets what was sharpest was the same dingy old thought that when he heard the sirens and saw the uniforms then there wasnt a hell of a lot of point in beating your guts out and running faster a bloody shambles the clowns had dropped him in shit up to his nose in the back was a babble of screaming for more speed he looked into the side mirror the unmarked car had the bell going and the yellow police wagon had the blue light going and the siren right up to his bloody nose and down his bloody nostrils when he looked again through his front windscreen he saw the police jeep that was slewed across the road a bit over a hundred yards ahead there were no side turnings between him and the police jeep back to the mirror the car and the wagon werent trying to get past him didnt have to were sitting on his arse shepherding him the poor bastards were frantic in the back spittle on his neck the way they were shouting through the close mesh grille you win some and most often you lose thats what jeez reckoned he eased his foot onto the brake pedal he changed down he could see that there were pistols aimed at him from behind the cover of the police jeep down again to second and his foot harder onto the brake and stamping sorry boys jeez said softly if they hadnt been making such a hell of a rumpus they might have heard the genuine sadness in his voice he brought the combi to a halt he took the keys out of the ignition and tossed them out of the window onto the roadway he looked into the side mirror the policemen were spilling out of the unmarked car and out of the wagon crouching and kneeling and all aiming their hand guns at the combi nobody had told jeez what the hell he was into silence in the van lets have a bit of dignity boys an english accent lets not give the bastards the pleasure of our fear jeez opened his door he stepped down onto the street he clasped his hands over the top of his head in front of him and behind him the policemen began to run warily forward johannesburg is a hard city it is a city where the whites carry guns and the blacks carry knives not a city where the pedestrians and shoppers cower on their faces because the police have drawn revolvers and have blocked off a combi and are handcuffing four kaffirs and a kaffir lover a crowd had gathered inside the minute that it took the police to hustle their five prisoners towards the wagon and to kick them up and slam the doors on them there was something to see the white guy was the something to see must have been more than forty could have been more than fifty and wearing decent slacks and a decent shirt the crowd wondered what the white guy was doing with those black bastards what the hell he was at four long blocks away a cloud of slow moving smoke was settling above pritchard street mr justice andries van zyl had passed the sentence of the supreme penalty on men of whom his clerk had told him recently had been executed it would have been beyond him to believe that an innocent man had ever been convicted in a court over which he had presided he attended church every sunday morning and sometimes went back in the evening when he retired in two years time he would devote his energies to a charitable society supporting children afflicted by the spina bifida disease privately in his room after passing the death sentence he would say a prayer for the condemned man not a prayer that the man should be reprieved but that he might go to his maker with true repentance in his heart on that late afternoon in the palace of justice on the north side of pretorias church square he dealt first with the four blacks deemed guilty by himself and his two lay assessors of murder there was no theatricality the black cap had long before been dispensed with in the republics courts and his sentencing voice was a racing monotone that of a bowls club secretary getting through the minutes of a previous meeting as happy and charlie and percy and tom stared back at him from the dock expressionless exhausted of hope he shuffled his papers then pressed his metalrimmed half moon spectacles tight onto the bridge of his nose he allowed the murmurs to subside in the public gallery he looked up at jeez carew mr justice van zyl saw a man only a few years younger than himself and well dressed in a dark grey suit and a white shirt and a silk tie he saw a face which seemed to say that there was nothing new to be learned he saw the way that the shoulders were pulled back and the way that the mans arms were held straight down to his sides he saw that the prisoners bearing was more militarily correct than that of the prison service guards at attention behind him mr justice van zyl had watched this white accused through seventeen days of court room business he thought he had detected an arrogance he disliked arrogance the previous day he had decided that when he passed sentence on the white he would make a fuller statement than was usual for him he would break that arrogance james carew you have been found guilty of murder without extenuating circumstances there is only one sentence that i may pass upon you it was your own decision that during your time in custody you refused to cooperate with the officers who have diligently investigated a quite appalling criminal act you chose to remain silent you have also rebuffed the efforts of a very able and conscientious counsel to present a defence on your behalf i understand that you chose not to brief him and also that you refused the opportunity offered you of going into the witness stand to give the court your own version of events on that horrific day in johannesburg by these actions i am forced to the conclusion that in your case extenuating circumstances do not exist which would mitigate your guilt i have heard in police evidence that you came from the united kingdom to the republic of south africa twelve years ago in the time you have resided here perhaps you have acquired the belief that different standards of justice obtain for our varied ethnic groups you may have believed that the colour of your skin offers you some protection from the consequences of your actions you would have deluded yourself mr carew if you believed that the crime of which you have been found guilty involved a quite dastardly act you acted together with terrorists of the outlawed african national congress one of whom had been trained in sabotage and murder in a communist state to set off a bomb inside the rand supreme court in johannesburg the bomb consisted of explosives and petrol to which had been added a quantity of household liquid detergent the effect of the latter being that the flaming petrol would fasten itself to any clothes or flesh it came into contact with the casualties would have been even more severe but for the devotion to duty and the personal sacrifice of warrant officer prinsloo in taking much of the blast of the bomb the warrant officer without doubt saved many others from the savagery that you intended as the driver of the getaway vehicle your guilt is equal to that of the man who made the bomb and the men who delivered it you were an essential member of a murderous conspiracy we live in a time when it is more than ever important that in our beloved country godfearing men and women should support the legitimate forces of law and of order no benefit to any person in the republic whatever his colour can come from an outrage such as you helped to perpetrate i truly hope that the sentence that i am about to pass on you will deter other foreigners from coming to our country taking our hospitality and repaying us with murder i believe mr carew in the efficacy of the deterrent a lew years ago a distinguished colleague of mine said the death penalty is like a warning just like a lighthouse throwing its beams out to sea we hear about shipwrecks but we do not hear about the ships the lighthouse guides safely on its way we do not have proof of the number of ships it saves but we do not tear the lighthouse down mr carew we will not permit our country to be used as a playground of mayhem by foreigners who conspire with such hateconsumed organisations as the african national congress james carew the sentence of the court is that you be taken from here to a lawful place of execution and that you there be hanged by the neck until you are dead there was no entreaty for the lord to have mercy on james carews soul had jeez slumped or even dropped his eyes from the judges face then there would have been mr justice van zyl was vexed by the prisoners composure he thrust his papers together propelled himself from his chair all rise the clerk intoned mr justice van zyl stamped out of his court room his assessors after him a guard tapped jeez on the shoulder jeez turned smartly and down the steps from the dock to the court room cells followed by happy and charlie and percy and tom in prison lore they were the condemns while they were driven under heavy escort to that part of pretoria central prison a mile and a half away that was reserved for these men who were condemned a police major sat in the emptied courtroom filling in with a ball point pen the specific details of the printed form that was the death warrant the form would go later to the sheriff of the capital city for his signature and in due course to the hangman as authority for his work an age later jeez sat on the end of his bed and stared down at the sheet of writing paper blank as yet that lay on the table that was fastened into the cell wall an endless time later countless days more than a year long enough for the rand supreme court and the ride up rissik street to be just a hated memory a smell that was everywhere in the mind but couldnt be located it was the first time that he had asked for writing paper and a pen what to write what to say he could hear the singing many many voices in a slow dirge couldnt escape from the bastard singing shit when it was his turn whod be singing for bloody jeez on the top right hand corner of the sheet of paper he wrote the date he let himself in through the front door and the atmosphere hit him before jack had his key out of the lock and the door closed behind him he could sense catastrophe the vacuum cleaner was in the middle of the hall rug his mother always did the carpets straight after sam and jack had gone to work and little will to school there were dirty clothes at the foot of the stairs she would have put the yesterday shirts and socks and pants into the machine straight after shed done the carpets down the hall the door into the kitchen was open the saucepans and the frying pan from last nights dinner and the mornings breakfast were in the sink had to be a catastrophe sam gone bankrupt will hurt but will was sitting glumly at the top of the stairs still in his school blazer and he too had his routine and always changed out of his blazer chucked it on the bedroom floor as soon as he came in and that would have been two hours back sam couldnt have gone bankrupt what recession business never brighter sam was forever saying the boy on the stairs shrugged dramatically like no one had bothered to tell him what was biting his mum and his dad jack heard sams voice through the closed living room door get it into your head its nothing to do with you he heard his mother crying not loud weeping not crying for sympathy real crying real misery whatever the bastards done hilda whatever hes going to get thats not your concern he turned to close the front door behind him was wretched normal churchill close nothing ever happened in the dead end road where the cherry trees were in blossom and the pavements were swept and the mowers had been out once or twice already on the front lawns and the rose beds were weeded tudor homes set back from the road where nothing ever went bad and sour you could get a funeral moving out of neoelizabethan churchill close with half the residents not knowing thered been a death jack dosed the door behind him hes gone out of your life he heard the anger in sams voice jack knocked and went into the living room his mother sat on the sofa beside the fireplace yesterdays ashes she had a crumpled handkerchief tight in her fist and her eyes were red and swollen she still wore the housecoat that was her early morning gear sam perry was at the window jack didnt think that they could have been rowing between themselves they hardly ever did and never when will could hear them jack was years old his quiet love for his mother was the same as it had been from the time he could first remember when there had only been the two of them whats happened mum sam replied for her theres been a letter who

prison damn it sam who wrote it your father sam turned to stare out of the window his wife jacks mother pointed wordlessly up to the mantelpiece fresh tears on her cheeks amongst the delicate china pieces next to the flower vase was a small brown paper envelope his mothers voice was muffled through the squeeze handkerchief you should read it jack theyre going to hang you father he went slowly across the room he stepped over th brimming ashtray in the middle of the carpet she had bee there all day with her cigarettes and her letter it was a envelope of flimsy paper with a blue airmail sticker and a cent stamp which showed the bulged bloom of a protea plant tight joined handwriting had addressed the letter to mrs hilda perry green walk coulsdon surrey great britain a different hand had crossed out that address and replaced it with foxhaven churchill close leatherhead surrey no one had seen a fox in churchill close for six years on the reverse side of the envelope was overstamped if undelivered return to commissioner of prisons pre toria and there was a post box number the envelope was featherlight for a moment he looked again at the mantel piece its inside jack his mother said they dont seem to give them much in the way of paper sam said tersely you dont have to read it not after what he did to your mother and you if its my father ill read it jack said quietly it wasnt

small soda and another and there was time for one more before hilda perry called them to dinner they talked loudly of business sams garage and showroom and jacks work they sat at the dining rooms mahogany table with candles lit the man who was in a cell fiftyfive hundred miles away was thought of but not spoken about when they were having their coffee will came in and sat on hildas knee and talked about the school soccer team and there were bellows of laughter jack pushed his chair back and stood up his lather was going to hang he thanked his mother for dinner he said he had some work

the man he didnt know was his father and his father was going to hang he went up the flowercarpeted staircase to his room it was a little under four miles to work across on the london side of the town jack curwen was employed by richard villiers and his son nicholas the office was an unlikely place for d amp c ltd demolition and clearance there was no yard for jcb diggers and bulldozers and heavy earthtransporting lorries there werent any cranes there werent any workmen villiers was a shrewd man which made him a good employer and hed long before decided that the way to the maximum profit and minimum outlay was to be in the art game of subcontracting out he hunted out the business and then pulled in the freelance operators that he needed a few local calls could bring in a million pounds worth of plant and transport whose maintenance and upkeep was some other buggers headache d amp c ltd liked to boast that nothing was too small nothing too large they could clear the foundations of a square yard warehouse in dockland they could take out the stump of an oak tree villiers came into the office in the morning to ferret into the balance sheets and retired with a huge handicap to the golf course for the afternoon nicholas villiers looked after the subcontracting side of the business and jack was there to sniff out new contracts there was a business manager who kept the books two secretaries and a receptionist nice and lean was how richard villiers described d amp c ltd no waste no fat he liked young jack because he didnt have to pay the lad that much and because the lad kept the cheques rolling when he retired there might be a directorship for the lad d amp c ltd were housed in the ground floor of a victorian building they shared with a solicitor an accountancy practice a chiropodist and two architects jack would have preferred to have just slipped in that morning shut himself away no chance villiers had an office where he could keep his clubs and his wet weather anoraks and leggings the business manager had his own territory nicholas villiers and jack and the two secretaries shared what had once been the ground floor drawing room the girls and nicholas villiers stared at him like he looked awful been on the piss have we villiers asked loudly janice giggled lucille dropped her head didnt have a very good night jack muttered hed had a tossing

load of craparse foreigners around him with no one of his own around him the girls were all eyes on him he was a good dresser took care of himself wasnt every day that jack curwen looked as though hed slept in a hedge he thought they both fancied him but they were too close to base no future in a typists pool relationship best keeping the ladies separate from work and he was on the rebound anyway last girl had been with him for four months good kid and good looker and occasionally good in the back seat of his motor till shed upped and offed with a doctor to canada she had looked him hard in the eye and said he was sweet and said her new fellow had more of a future with a medical degree than he had working at a nothing place like d amp c ltd it was a comfort to think that janice and lucille fancied him but he wasnt doing anything about it please yourself the pillbox on the downs they cant do that today the blaster isnt free before tomorrow too expensive keeping the plant hanging about going to go tomorrow afternoon does that mess you not particularly ive other places i can be it wasnt a lie theres a line of elm stumps im chasing near dorking a bit of chasingll fix it and afterwards try sleeping it off eh jack smiled weakly he was on his way back to the door nicholas villiers said anything i can do to help jack no janice watched through the window as jack walked to his car she typed two lines and looked up again she saw the car turn in the road and drive away hes not gone to dorking she announced proud of her keen observation hes taken the london road he had the wipers on shovelling the rain off the windscreen for the drive into the city by luck he found a parking space near the street market behind waterloo station he walked over the bridge with the rain lashing his face soaking his trousers and his shoes and he hadnt cared his father had never been mentioned since his mothers second marriage what he knew of his father was what he had been told when he was a child a bastard of a man had walked out of his mothers life told her that he would be away for a few days and had never come back jack had been two years old he had had it drilled into him that his father was a callous man who had opted out and left a young mother with a child that was little more than a baby there was nothing accidental about it because money had come to his mother all the time that she had been bringing up the child and had kept on coming right up to the week of her registry office marriage to sam perry jack knew that never a word from his father only the cruel mockery of a monthly stipend he had never asked about how the money was paid or where it had come from but it had arrived sufficient for the household bills food and electricity and heating oil and a caravan holiday each august right up to the time of the wedding it was as if his father had watched their lives from a safe distance and stopped the money when hed known it was no longer needed jack had kept his fathers name and it would have been hells complicated to change it to jack perry he had been jack curwen at grammar school and jack curwen at college but of jeez curwen there was never a word in sam perrys household he turned left onto the strand he knew where he was going he knew that he had first to go to trafalgar square he knew nothing of this man who was condemned to die in south africa but his name and his age and that he was his father he didnt know his face nor his habits he didnt know whether he drank or swore or whored he didnt know whether he laughed whether he cried whether he prayed he hadnt the least idea what he did for a living he had to fend off the spike of an umbrella tent and the woman who was powering out of simpsons didnt notice him so didnt apologise he came into the square weather too awful and season too early for the tourists the column and the lions and the statues were granite grey in the rain sam perry had been good to them good to his mother by marrying her kind to her son who had no blood with him but whom he had treated as his own sam had worked hard to make himself into jacks father jack could remember the days at the infant and primary schools before sum had showed up other kids dads helping with school projects shouting at the sports afternoons dropping them at school picking them up it didnt make sense to jack that a man who cared so little for his wife and kid that he could walk out on them should keep a watch to satisfy himself that their survival was assured jack didnt know a single detail about the man who was his father he crossed the strand the rain ran on his forehead dribbled into his eyes and his nose and his mouth there were six demonstrators outside the south african embassy and eight policemen standing on the steps of the building it was obvious enough that he should come here he knew the embassy everybody who travelled through central london knew that the embassy was in trafalgar square huge and powerful in its cleaned colonial yellow stone he had seen the demonstrators on television the week before when they started their vigil the embassy buildings solidity mocked the critics of south africa the orange and white and blue flag sodden but defiant on the high pole the policemen gathered close to the main double doors were able to take some protection from the rain the demonstrators had no shelter two were coloured four were white they were drenched the rain had run the paint of the slogans on their placards which they held against their knees freedom for the pritchard five no racist hangings in sa the rope for apartheid not for freedom fighters before last night jack would not have given a second glance to men and women who stood in the rain outside the embassy of the republic of south africa any more than the diplomats inside in the dry and the warm gave a shit for them or their slogans he saw the distaste on the police sergeants face as he walked to speak to the demonstrators the man he picked out was middle forties jack guessed because the hair that was lank on the back of his neck was streaked grey the man was shivering in a poplin sports top that was keeping out none of the rain he wore plastic badges for antiapartheid and the african national congress and the south west african peoples organisation his jogging shoes were holed and worn but he stood motionless in the streams of water on the pavement his placard was freedom for the pritchard five all six looked at him coldly mirroring the stares of the policemen good morning can you tell me about your protest pretty obvious isnt it you can read i thought youd want to tell me jack said we dont need your kind of interest what the hell does that mean just go up the steps and join the other fascists jack read the mans supercilious stare he had his hair cut short he wore a businessmans rain coat a charcoal suit he wore a tie he looked hard into the mans eyes listen i am not a policeman i am not a snooper i am a private citizen and i want to know something about the pritchard five there must have been something in jacks gaze and the lash of his voice the man shrugged you can sign the petition how many signatures one hundred and fourteen that all this is a racist society the man rolled his words as if they gave him a satisfaction theres not many who care that four heroic freedom fighters will go to heir deaths who are they jack asked happy zikala charlie schoba percy ngoye and tom mweshtu they took the battle into the middle of johannesburg in broad daylight it will be a crime against humanity if they hang your placard calls them the pritchard five he only drove the car and hes white jack yelled so he doesnt get to be a hero jack wanted to get the hell away but the man was tugging at his sleeve the issue is whether the white minority government and the white minority courts will dare to hang four black freedom fighters thats what its about jack wrenched himself clear he walked the length of the strand and on until he came to fleet street sam and hilda perry always took the daily telegraph at home the daily telegraph was as routine as shaving and brushing his teeth in the morning he asked at the reception if he could see someone from the library when the woman came he didnt spin a story just asked directly if he could see a file nine times out of ten he would have been told that visitors were not permitted access to files without prior arrangement but she looked at the rainswept young man and said what file is it you want everything on the pritchard five the ones who are condemned to hang in south africa everything you have please i can tell you now theres not much the unrest and the economic crisis and the sanctions issue thats what has taken up the space but she took him to the library she sat him at a table and brought him the file of newspaper clippings she shrugged she said that it was pretty thin that there would probably be a long story on the day before the execution she left him to read the file there was a clipping from the day of the bombing that just mentioned the arrest of an unidentified white nothing then until the trial and most of that detailed the prosecutions evidence against tom mweshtu that hed been trained by the soviets and had spent time in kiev james carew was described as a white south african taxi driver aged two paragraphs on the sentencing what they were accused of what their names were that they showed no emotion when they were told they would hang months of a hole in the story and then the dismissal of the appeal four paragraphs jack learned that the five had been in the maximum security compound of pretoria central gaol for thirteen months that the pope had urged the state president to exercise clemency that three eec foreign ministers had sent telegrams urging reprieves everything that he read had been in the paper pushed through the letter box every day at home and he hadnt bothered just as he hadnt stirred himself to take an interest in the shootings in the townships or in the detentions or the bombings and then there it was the photograph in last tuesdays paper it was probably still in the cupboard under the stairs might be lining a dustbin or it might have been crumpled up by his mother for cleaning the front room windows his mother always read the paper front to back jack didnt know how she could not have recognised the photograph of her first husband he had never before seen a photograph of his father it was a mug shot might have been a police picture might have been for a passport he peered down at the columnwide photograph at the man who only managed two paragraphs with four others who didnt rate as a hero who was a white south african taxi driver he saw a gaunt face staring ungiving eyes shadowed hollow cheeks sparse short hair the photograph was misting blurring jacks fists were white knuckled tight he felt the choking in his chest he saw the tears fall on the newsprint and be absorbed when the woman came back from her desk to look into the corner where the young man had been sitting she found the file neatly piled but open she saw the damp on the photograph and wondered what the silly man had managed to spill on it could have been the rain from his hair she noticed when she gathered up the file that the final clipping reported that within the next few days the state president would make his decision as to whether the sentences of death should be carried out jack drove to dorking and made sure of the contract for the removal of the thirtytwo elm stumps he rang his mother and said hed be late home then he set off to get himself drunk the drink hadnt hurt had been something of a blessing because his stupor sleep didnt let him nightmare first thing when he came down the stairs he hunted for the newspaper and his fathers photograph it was one from the top of the pile next to the fire lighters he tore out the picture and folded it into his wallet breakfast in the kitchen and not a word of his lurching up the stairs a little after midnight his mother didnt ask him why he had been out so late big boy wasnt he twentysix years old a grown man nothing had ever been said about his moving out not that sam would have complained if jack had announced one monday morning that he was off to look for a flat he couldnt have faulted sam for the way he had taken this other mans son into his household but kindness and patience couldnt have turned them into father and son sometimes they were friends sometimes he was a generously tolerated lodger jack could recognise there was more fault in him than in the attitudes of his stepfather he was close to himself rarely gave of his affections took his pleasures away from home pubs and squash club friends and the girls who were casually hooked into that scene he was aware of his own cold streak of independence natural enough for a boy who had never known the companionship of a true father and no mention made at the breakfast table of james carew didnt have to be talked about because he was there with them sam too loud his mother too quiet and jack behaving as if he had buried the whole matter and all of them hurrying through the bacon and the scrambled egg the sooner to escape to their work and the privacy of their thoughts jack didnt even call the office he drove into london and parked off the vauxhall bridge road behind the cathedral and walked through the park to whitehall yesterday had been wasted and now there was no more time to waste because time was short for james carew he stood in the courtyard outside the foreign and commonwealth office he made some rapid calculations and decided to advise richard villiers not to accept the contract it was just too damn foursquare big almost intimidat i ing he watched the civil servants arriving with their uniform e ii r briefcases most of them looking as though they had nothing but a morning paper in them and the leggy secretaries and the chauffeurs and the messengers he went up the steps and into the dark reception area there was a commissionaire blue uniform and medal ribbons an old regular army man there was a security man a yard or two back in the shadows there was a woman with grey hair drawn into a tight knot she wore a white blouse over what didnt look like regulation underwear he wasnt asked what his business was they waited on him to speak he was an ordinary citizen who was calling by because his father was going to be hanged in south africa he wondered how often the ordinary citizen came to announce themselves in the reception area they were all looking at him like it was an attempt to make him grovel probably not worth pointing out that he and a few other ordinary chaps off the street paid their salaries my name is curwen id like to see someone please who deals with south africa there was a very slight smile at the commissionaires mouth the security man looked as though he hadnt heard the woman said do you have an appointment if i had an appointment id have said so you have to have an appointment i dont have an appointment but i do insist on seeing someone who deals with south africa on a matter of urgency jack wondered what the word urgency might mean under this roof hed used it forcefully enough for her to hesitate whats it in connection with are you an expert on south africa no then it wont help you to know what its about a flush spilled through the makeup on her cheeks she turned her back on him and spoke into a telephone then told him to take a seat he sat on a hard chair away from the desk he reckoned hed spoiled her day he was more than half an hour on the chair and she began to look herself again he wondered what they would be doing upstairs that meant he had to sit for more than thirty minutes waiting for them getting the coffee machine working sharing out the sandwiches filling in the south african departments football pool coupon good morning mr curwen would you come this way please the man might have been in his late forties could have been the early fifties his suit didnt look good enough for him to be important but he had a kindly face that seemed worn thin with tiredness they went down a long and silent corridor then the man opened a door and waved jack inside it was an interview room four chairs and a table and an ashtray that hadnt been emptied of course they werent going to invite him into the working part of the building they were in the quarantine area im sandham im on the south africa desk the man apologised for keeping him waiting then he listened as jack told him about the letter from pretoria and of the little that he knew about his father and you want to know what were doing for him yes sandham asked him please to wait smiled ruefully as if jack knew all about waiting he was gone five minutes he came back with a buff file under his arm and a younger man mr sandham explained to me your business with us mr curwen i decided to come and see you myself my names furneaux assistant secretary i read everything that goes across the south africa desk furneaux took a chair sandham stood a short abrupt unlikeable little man not yet out of middle age with a maroon silk handkerchief flopping from his breast pocket furneaux reached for sandhams file this conversation is not for newspaper consumption furneaux said of course i understand that your father left your mother when you were two years old that makes it easier for me to talk frankly to you i am assuming you have no emotional attachment to your father because you have no memory of him but you want to know what we are doing to save your fathers life publicly we are doing nothing because it is our belief that by going public we would diminish what influence we have on the government of south africa privately we have done everything possible to urge clemency for the terrorists terrorists or freedom fighters jack held furneauxs eye until the assistant secretary dropped his face to the file terrorists mr curwen your government does not support the throwing of bombs in central johannesburg youve heard the prime minister on the subject i expect bombs in johannesburg are no different to bombs in belfast or in the west end of london it is not an area we can be selective over privately we have requested clemency because we do not feel the execution of these men will ease the present tension in south africa what sort of reply have you had what wed have expected officially and unofficially our request has been ignored i might add mr curwen that your father is only a british subject in technical terms for the last dozen or so years he has chosen to make his home in the republic so youve washed your hands of him furneaux said evenly theres something you should understand they execute a minimum of a hundred criminals a year there theres no capital punishment debate in the republic from our viewpoint your father received a fair trial although he declined to cooperate in any way with his defence advisors the supreme court heard his appeal at length im not interested in what he did i only care about saving his life your father was found guilty of murder my view is that nothing more can be done to save his life thats washing your hands wrong thats accepting the reality that in south africa people convicted of murder are hanged hes my father jack said his solicitors dont believe he has a chance of a reprieve i am sorry to have to tell you this how soon furneaux scanned the papers in the file flipped them over he fastened on a single sheet read it then closed the file it may have been discussed by the executive council last night but it might be next week theyre more preoccupied with the unrest three weeks a month maximum jack stood he looked at the table he looked at his hands so what am i supposed to do furneaux looked to the window baldly put mr curwen theres nothing you can do so youre just going to stand back while they hang my father jack spat the question he saw his spittle on furneauxs tie and on his chin furneaux looped his handkerchief from his pocket wiped himself mr curwen your father travelled quite voluntarily to south africa he chose to involve himself with a terrorist gang and it is and from the very beginning was more or less inevitable that he will pay a high price for his actions the file was gathered against furneauxs chest im sorry for wasting your valuable time jack said mr sandham would you show mr curwen to the front hull jack heard furneauxs heavy tread clatter away down the corridor he said i dont understand my father is a british citizen living in south africa for years suddenly turns up in a murder trial but your man has a pretty ancient looking file on him an inch thick hows that dont know sandham bounced his eyebrows sandham took jack to the front hall asked him for a card so that he could contact him if there were developments he saw the young fellow walk away threading between the official cars he noted the athleticism that couldnt be hidden by the disappointed droop of his shoulders he went back up the three floors to the south africa desk smoking too damned much and his chest was heaving when he made it to the open plan area where he worked he thought he knew the answer to the question that curwen didnt understand he was old enough and passed over often enough not to care too much what he said and to whom he said it he knocked at furneauxs door put his head round the corner that chap theyre going to hang mr furneaux is he a bit complicated too deep water for you jimmy i really dont want to talk about him i have to know about him mum everything about him you should be at work jack he was your husband hes my father sams right its nothing to do with us mum its killing us just thinking about him talking about him cant hurt worse hilda perry couldnt remember the last time that jack had come home in the middle of a working day he hadnt told her of his visit to the foreign office nor about the embassy nor about the visit to the newspapers library they were in the kitchen with mugs of instant mum hes in a death cell can you think of anywhere more alone than that hes sitting out the last days of his life in a gaol where hes going to hang she said distantly ive hated him for more than twenty years and since i had his letter i can only think of the good times there were good times dont make me cry jack tell me he brought her a drink two fingers of gin three cubes of ice four fingers of tonic she normally had her first of the day when sam came back from the office she drank deep your grandfather was stationed in paderborn thats in west germany he was a sergeant major i was seventeen just finished school i used to nanny for the officers wives jeez was on national service he was a cut above the rest not classy not like an officer but jeez was always correct treated me like a lady he always stood in a cinema for the national anthem stood properly we didnt go out much a lot of evenings i was tied with the officers kids and jeez was a sort of batman and driver to the colonel he was well in with the colonel after we were married we used to get a card from the colonel each christmas not after jeez went jeez went back to the uk demobbed we used to write a bit and then mum and dad were killed in the car accident it was in the papers jeez wrote by express gave his address i was staying with an aunt and he used to come and see me i suppose i loved him anyway we were married there was a cottage right down in the country that jeez got his hands on near alton in hampshire it was only a couple of bedrooms pretty primitive thats where we lived he once said the colonel had helped him find it fill me up again jack he took her glass to the drinks cabinet in the living room three cubes of ice six fingers of tonic she wouldnt notice he was born in and we married in and i was nineteen it was lovely down there cress beds trout streams nice pubs walks jeez didnt see much of it he was up in london when he wasnt away she stopped her hands fondled the cut glass tumbler he was very close didnt talk about his work only said that he was a clerk up in whitehall he called it a soupedup secretarys job she had never before talked calmly to her son about his father jeez used to take a train up to london most of the year before it was light and come home in the evenings most of the year when it was dark i didnt ask him where he went he didnt tell me he just said that what he did was pretty boring hed be away about half a dozen times a year most often for about a week sometimes as long as a month i never knew where he went because he never brought me anything back from where hed been just flowers from alton on his way home lovely flowers sometimes he looked as though hed been in the sun and it was winter at home its hard to explain now jack but jeez wasnt the sort of man you asked questions of and i had my own life i had the village friends i had my garden there wasnt much money but then nobody else round about had money then i had you what did he think about me same as with everything else you never really knew with feez he used to do his turns with you at weekends hed change you feed you walk your pram i honestly dont know what he felt and when i was two years old youre interrogating me jack in your own time its twentyfour years ago this month he packed always took the same small suitcase always took five shirts five pairs of socks five sets of underwear a second pair of trousers and a second jacket and his washing bag he went off on a monday morning said hed be gone two weeks two weeks was three three weeks was four i was busy with you so until it was four weeks i was reasonably happy jeez wasnt the sort of man you chased up on i cant explain that but its the way it was then at the end of four weeks there was money lodged in our account the same amount as he always gave me and i knew hed walked out on me on us i went through the whole house looking for something about his work there was nothing can you believe that not one single thing not one scrap of paper with so much as a london phone number on it no address book no diary not even a national insurance card it was so horrible to realise i knew nothing about him i rang the bank i asked them where the money had come from it had come from liechtenstein would you believe it i had them send me the name of the bank i wrote and i had a two line letter back regret not in a position to divulge divulge dear god she said and the tears were bright in her eyes after a time she went on i went to a solicitor he wrote and had the same answer jeez had gone from me the money was the only way i knew he was still alive each january the sums he sent would go up as if jeez was keeping abreast with the prices index the month i married sam they stopped but by then i was long past caring the only man i knew who knew jeez at all was his old colonel i wrote to him through his regiment and he wrote back to say he was sorry but he knew nothing of jeez there was just a wall everywhere i turned so you gave up youve no right to say that to me no im sorry i did not give up i carried on trying to be a mother to you trying to get the shame out of my system has it ever crossed your mind what its like to live in a small community a village when youre marked down as the woman whose husband walked out i did not give up i was building our new life i managed to shut jeez out for two years close him down two years and then i couldnt stand the ignorance any longer the solicitor had gone cold on me i did it myself one weekend i left you with a neighbour and i took the train to chippenham then a taxi to the address that had been on the colonels letter it was my last throw she stared once more into her glass was he there entertaining for lunch guests on the patio smart cars in the drive uniformed drivers they all looked at me very puzzled till the colonel came and took me inside to his study where the dogs were he was obviously embarrassed i suppose it wasnt easy for him he said that your father had been some sort of clerk up in london in a government office that his trips away had been couriering documents or working on lowlevel audits he said jeez was a deep close man without friends but the opinion was that hed just become restless things too quiet for him that hed just upped and away his advice was that i should try to put your father out of my mind and start again he asked after you and i can still see his sad smile when i showed him your photograph i think he was trying to be kind to me his wife brought me some sandwiches for the journey home when the colonel brought me out of the house all his guests stopped eating they were all staring at me the colonel told one of the drivers to take me to the station the next week i went to the solicitor and filed for divorce desertion thats when i gave up did he love you i thought so she said simply can you believe hed go along with murder and bombing or be associated with black south african terrorists no jack reached into his pocket took out his wallet he laid the newspaper photograph in front of his mother whos that thats jeez today he said thats my father jack was annoyed stamping about the field time wasted and this after he had broken off milking his mothers memories to get there punctually a small crowd waited on the blaster there was the farmer who was selling the field there were three from the development company which was buying the field there were the jcb drivers and the oxyacetaline cutting team and the lorry men there was a deputation from the housing estate three hundred yards from the pillbox rabbiting on to anyone who would listen about how all their windows would be broken the blaster was working quietly with his spade filling sandbags jack knew the blaster was slow he knew also that the blaster was good and he knew there was no use at all in offering to get anyone to help him it was the blasters way that he did his own work himself because as hed often told jack that way there wasnt any other bugger to get things wrong d amp c used george hawkins as often as he was available he was their regular they put up with the wizened little mans cussedness because the job was always done as it should have been but every time they had him they cursed the old sod and asked themselves why they went on using him and always had the same answer george would retire the day after they found another blaster who could do the job better a young man from the development company walked brusquely to them his shoes were caked in mud he had ripped his raincoat on barbed wire he had come for an arguument didnt they know they were running late george hawkins ignored him and jack tried to shut him up with a sharp glance time was money you know george hawkins spat to the ground and went on with his w o r k in fact your running late is causing us considerable inconvenience jack said and unless you get out of this gentlemans way and let him get on with the job that hes damn good at then youll be running even later the young mans moustache trembled on his lip jack thought it was shaved so thin that it might be touched up with eyeshadow what i meant was just make yourself scarce and quickly the young man backed away hed seen the bloodyminded crack on jacks face he decided this wasnt a man to fight with the pillbox was part of a line that had been built along the surrey uplands during the summer of if the germans had landed on any of the beaches around the resort towns of eastbourne or brighton and if they had broken out of the beachhead then the high ground thirty miles to the north would have been the last defensive barrier before the southern outskirts of london they might have been chaotic times but they had known how to build pillboxes it was squat hexagonal walls two feet thick with three machinegun slits giving a wide view down towards the surrey and sussex county border no one wanted the pillbox as a memento of the war the farmer was selling his field the developers were buying it for twelve houses to the acre and anyway it was a hangout for the local teenagers and their plastic bags and solvent sniffing the last sandbag was filled the top knotted do i have to carry em all myself there was a titter of laughter he had them all lifting his sandbags right down to the developers in their shined footwear and styled raincoats jack carried a sandbag beside george who carried two youre running bloody late its been there close on fifty years another fifteen minutes wont hurt they reached the pillbox george stopped his helpers a dozen yards short what are you going to use got time for a lesson have we only asking get that shower back and ill talk you through jack waved the drivers and the farmer and the developers away he watched george work all the time he worked he talked a thin nasal voice describing the skills that he loved ive drilled shot holes right through to the reinforcing net of wire got me reinforced concrete right so theres wire in the middle each wall ive got six shot holes a foot apart and ive six more in the roof drilled vertically for each hole theres three cartridges of pag thats polar ammon gelignite to you all in its close to pounds thats going to blow dont ever force the cartridges see dont mistreat the little fellows just slide them in like its a bloody good woman youre with jack enjoyed working with the old man for more than two years hed been with george once a week once every two weeks and he was always made to feel it was his first time out there hadnt been anything of a friendship between them until george had one day cried off a job and jack had been in his area and called by he had found him alone with a twisted ankle and an empty larder and gone down the local shops and stocked the cupboard and ignored all the moaning about not accepting charity hed called in a few more times till the old man was mended but though they marked the binding of an unlikely friendship his visits were never referred to again bastard stuff this reinforced concrete takes double what you need to knock over brickwork lack knew that hed known that from the first time hed worked with the old man he just nodded like hed been given a jewel of new information the detonators went in on the end of white cordtex linked with safety fuse detonator ends crimped to the cordtex safety fuse tied to the cordtex every shot hole had its own detonator and in minutes the pillbox was covered with a web of wire always run the cordtex and the safety fuse out carefully bastard if you get a kink in the stuff you get a bloody misfire what does a misfire mean means its bloody dangerous when you get to dismantling the whole shooting match and starting all over and another thing jack boy you look a right prick if youve a shower of shit like that lot watching you he was wiring his cables into the charger box george and jack were more than a hundred yards back down in a dip in the fields contours get that lot under cover and get your hat on one minute jack bellowed back to the watchers and heard a police sergeant repeat the instruction by megaphone youre a bloody vandal mr hawkins get your nose up sos you see twenty seconds jack had a hard hat rammed down on the top of his head he peered across the open ground to the pillbox you all right jack youre quiet today ten seconds fine he thought that if it had been put to the test the pillbox could have held up an infantry battalion for half a day graceless strong and seemingly indestructible here we go jack saw the flashes then the debris moving upwards and outwards then the smoke he heard the echoing rumble of the detonations he felt the blast of air on his face he ducked his head bloody good george growled jack looked up george was hunched beside him the fortification was a rubble of concrete loosely held together by twisted wire there was a long thirty minutes before the blaster would allow the men forward who would cut through the wire with their torches when they stood at the edge of the rubble jack marvelled at what hawkins had achieved that was pretty professional mr hawkins explosivesll get you through anything jack boy if you know how to use them on tuesday and thursday mornings frikkie de kok dressed in the bungalows living room his alarm warbled quietly at three on those mornings he dressed in the living room so as not to disturb hermione on those tuesday and thursday mornings he liked to dress well to be at his best his wife knew why frikkie rose early on those mornings his sons did not in a fashion she pretended that she did not know where he went and what he did as the dawn was rising on pretoria sometimes once a week sometimes once a month was never talked about between them she knew and in her own way she supported him there were only small ways that she could help him at those times she never troubled him with family difficulties or nagged at him to pay bills when she knew he had set the alarm for his early rising he was sure that the boys aged seventeen and fifteen knew nothing of their fathers work the boys were the apples of frikkie de koks eyes especially dawie the elder he dressed in a white shirt a tie that was the darkest blue shoulder holster a grey almost charcoal suit and black shoes he brushed his teeth brutally to try to erase the taste of yesterdays cigarettes he took a glass of orange juice from the fridge his wife wanted a new fridge and he could see from the packed shelves that the present one was inadequately small hermione had last mentioned the need for the new fridge on sunday she had not mentioned it on monday shed be back again he thought tomorrow from behind the sofa he picked up his small case he went to the front window drew back the curtain and looked out there were two cars waiting he left his home in the waterkloof suburb of pretoria at on those tuesday and thursday mornings he let the cars wait for two more minutes then emerged from his porch at the cars would be moving off at his was an exact science and he had nurtured exactness in most aspects of his life at the front door he paused he could hear the faint sounds of his sons asleep they shouldnt have had to share a room but all government salaries were falling behind the private sector costs were steepling and taxes too and there was no chance of a larger bungalow so that the boys could each have a room of their own great boys doing well at school and theyd do well when they went into the army the boys would be a credit to their father and mother because their parents had scrimped to give them an education that had not been possible for the young frikkie de kok the boys thought that he worked as an instructor in the carpentry shops time enough to tell them what he did when they had finished their schooling and perhaps not even then he closed the door gently behind him there was no tightness in his legs no nervousness as he walked if frikkie de kok showed either emotion or hesitation then the effect on the men around him would be catastrophic he saw the glow of two cigarettes in the second car on those mornings he always had an escort of two plain clothes policemen his work was classified as secret when he went to the prison before dawn he always had the armed men in support and he carried his own hand gun in the shoulder holster the first car was driven by his assistant a fine young man heavily built bullnecked hands that could pick up a blown football one in the right and one in the left the assistant had been a policeman and had served in the koevoet unit in the owambo area of south west africa the crowbar men were an elite inside the south african police confronting the s w a p o insurgency campaign the assistant was equally at home with the fn rifle the m greanade launcher omm mortars and cal machine guns there was nothing squeamish about the assistants attitude to his civilian work frikkie de kok thought him the best of young south africans if frikkie had had a daughter then hed have been pleased for her to become his assistants wife he climbed in beside his assistant and closed the door noiselessly the cars pulled away waterkloof was a fine suburb for hermione to live in they werent in one of the better avenues but it was a good district they lived alongside good cleanliving people just hellish expensive for a man who worked with his hands for the government the capital city of the republic slept they came fast down koningen wilhelminoweg and past the bird sanctuary frikkie loved birds all of them from the big predators to the little songsters when he retired he hoped to buy a small farm in the north east of the transvaal not that he would do much farming but he would be able to study the birds all dependent on bastard politics farms were already selling cheap if they were up in the north east of the transvaal because the farmers were quitting and those that were slaying were buying rifles and german shepherds and spending their thin profits on high wire fences just like rhodesia hut if he bought a farm hed take some shifting take a big big fire to burn out frikkie de kok if hed put his life savings into a farm house and some acres and some stock in the centre of the city they came on the first of the corporations street cleaners no other sign of life the city slept and it didnt know and didnt care that in the states name frikkie de kok and his assistant were going to work they drove through the empty streets past the great buildings of commerce and government power he had lived years in the capital he was proud to be a part of it no way that the communists and the terrorists and the agitators were going to undermine the authority of pretoria over frikkie de koks dead body they turned onto potgieterstraat nearly there he noticed that the breath came faster from his assistant hed learn frikkie de kok had been like that panting tightening when he was the assistant to his uncle and hed conquered it they went under the railway bridge the floodlights of pretoria central were in front of them the assistant was changing down slipping his clutch shaking the var before the right turn in front of local frikkie de kok never criticised his assistant on from local and past the high walls of the white politicals gaol they came to the checkpoint from his hut the armed prisons man stepped into the middle of the road the lowered bar was behind him the assistant dipped his lights the prisons man cradled an fn more than a hundred times a year this car and frikkie de kok and his assistant came up this side road soetdoringstraat to the road block they held their id cards up against the windscreen the prisons man had seen their faces good enough for him the car slid under the raised bar was inside the perimeter of the prison complex left now past the prison service store on wimbledon road past the prison service swimming pool past the prison service tennis courts past the rows of prison service houses and flats past the old gaol where he had worked his apprenticeship with his uncle a long lit wall rose in front of them they were high on the wooded hillside above the scattered lights of pretoria they were at beverly hills and in frikkie de koks opinion that was a hell of a silly name to be given to a section of a gaol but maximum security had always been beverly hills to both the prison staff who came in and out on their shift pattern and to the inmates on their one way visit beverly hills frikkie had heard was a flash hotel down in durban frikkie disliked durban too many english down there too many liberals not his place for a holiday but the new gaol opened eighteen years before the most modern in the country and the most secure was beverly hills to all who talked of it the most modern and the most secure the detectives parked the escort car they would wait outside for frikkie and his assistant until their work was clone the assistant drove to the gates the lights beamed down on them a television camera jutting from the wall followed them by a hidden hand the gates glided open the car drove inside the gates closed behind more gates in front an airlock close walls an iron grille for a roof through a glass panel a warrant officer looked down into the car from his control centre the assistant wound down his window showed their two cards perfunctorily then passed their hand guns up to the waiting hand it was two minutes to four oclock the gates ahead of them opened and they drove on the hangman and the hangmans assistant had reached their place of work all of the condemns who had been sentenced to death in courts throughout the republic were brought to beverly hills to while away the months before their appeal before the state president deliberated on the matter of clemency all of the condemns whose appeal failed whose plea for clemency was rejected died on the republics single gallows beam in beverly hills they were in a small parkland their headlights caught a startled antelope and a warthog in the white light frikkie thought it a good thing that a hanging gaol should harbour a small nature park between the perimeter walls and the cell blocks he liked to see the animals if he had been asked he would have said that he thought it unfortunate that the cells of the condemns did not have windows that looked out onto the animals the windows were set too high for the condemns to see out but frikkie was never asked what he thought and he would not have ventured an opinion of any matter that was not his business as soon as he was inside the administration with its cathedral steps he heard the singing the singing used to upset him when he first came to the old pretoria central with his uncle he had learned through his uncles indifference to accept it the whole of a section and b section singing all of the black condemns not a sound from c section the white condemns hardly ever sang frikkie de kok was a regular churchgoer he knew his hymns hed never heard singing the like of that in beverly hills on the mornings that he worked wonderful hymns that the blacks had learned in the mission schools and their own fine natural rhythm when the black condemns sang about jesus then they sang with feeling and with love best thing he had many times told his assistant the singing helped their work they were escorted to the duty officers room they were given coffee the singing helped because it calmed the condemns who were to be handled that morning the singing gave them strength seemed to drug them meant they didnt give any trouble creamy coffee and sugar only half a cup as frikkie had told his assistant he didnt want his bladder under strain when he was working there hadnt been any trouble for years but the trouble then had been so bad that frikkie de kok would never forget it so if the singing helped to quieten the boys then that was fine by him his last assistant had packed it in after that piece of trouble four condemns had barricaded themselves in a cell and they couldnt be forced out when the execution detail came for them theyd sent for the riot gas canisters and the whole block had been screaming and theyd kept frikkie de kok waiting once theyd opened the doors the execution detail had moved so fast that they hadnt stopped to get their masks off before they reached the gallows building the duty officer passed a remark about the weather he didnt think it would rain not from the forecast given the previous evening on the sabc it hadnt rained for three and a half months in pretoria so it was a fair bet that it wouldnt rain frikkie just acknowledged him the assistant didnt speak most of them went well most of them had a lot of guts the whites always went well especially after the blacks were gassed to the gallows the sort of white that he hanged was the sort of guy who wanted to show that he had more guts than a black at three minutes to five frikkie de kok levered himself up from the easy chair he nodded his thanks to the duty officer for the coffee they crossed the prison there was the slither of their shoes and the crack of the boots of their escort there were voices that warned of their approach so that doors could be opened ahead of them the singing was rising to its pitch they climbed the steps frikkie de kok pushed open the heavy double doors this was his preserve where his orders were not questioned he was in the preparation room a high room brilliantly lit by a fluorescent strip there were a dozen men waiting there all in the uniform of the prison service he recognised three of them they were three who were always there it was a job of work for frikkie de kok but he always marvelled that some made it their business to be present each and every time the other nine were youngsters five black and four white it was the law of beverly hills that every man who served there must attend a hanging none of these execution virgins caught his eye he opened the interior door he switched on the lights no official from the prison service would have presumed to go ahead of him the gallows room was a blaze of light along the far wall where the railed steps went below lay the shadows of the long beam and four nooses the four ropes above the nooses were coiled and fastened with cotton thread it was as he had left it the previous day when he had made his arrangements tested the lever and the trap measured each rope for the drop made his calculations based on height and weight the district surgeon came to him there was the first sheen of dawn in the skylight the district surgeon told him that the four men were in good shape and none of them had asked for sedation the district surgeon a palefaced gangling young man was the only person that frikkie de kok would speak to at this time that was privileged and valuable information he stood on the trap firm he wrapped his fist on the lever shining and oiled he looked at the cotton holding up the nooses to chest height correct he glanced at his watch three minutes before half past five he nodded to the duty officer waiting at the door of the preparation room the duty officer raised his personal radio to his mouth frikkie de kok knew of the crimes for which the four had been convicted one had stabbed to death a white housewife after they had disagreed on what he should be paid for sweeping her drive one had raped a sixyearold girl white and strangled her one had shot to death a petrol station attendant during an armed robbery in east london one had been sentenced to death for ritual witchcraft murder the killing of two men and the cutting out of their organs for mud to frikkie de koks mind execution by hanging was the correct penalty for such crimes he had stipulated in which order the four should be brought down the corridor and into the preparation room he had heard once of a mistake many years ago before his uncles time two men one heavy and tall one slim and small brought in the wrong order the small fellow had had the short rope and theyd had to pull on his legs under the trap the big fellow had been on the long drop and nearly lost his head with his life frikkie de kok had never made a mistake the singing approached him a tumult of harmony he liked it when they were brave because that made it easy for him and if it were easy for him then he could do better by them he waved the spectators into the gallows room and over to the far wall he saw that the governor had arrived in the preparation room they acknowledged each other frikkie straightened his tie a good hymn not four weeks before that hymn had been sung in his church in waterkloof sung in afrikaans of course good theme good words he had the four freshly laundered white cotton hoods in his hand they came fast into the preparation room the first man had a prison officer supporting one arm and the chaplain the other the three that followed had a prison officer on each side of them they were wideeyed they were shivering in the preparation room the words of the hymn died in their throats and the chaplain sang on alone lustily all the reading of the warrants all the formalities had been completed back in the cell block time now just to get the work finished frikkie de kok remembered each face from the view he had had of them in the exercise yard the previous afternoon they were in the right order he nodded his head no man spoke in the hanging shed only the chaplain sang the four whimpered and seemed to fight to find their voices they were moved inside moved onto the trap if it were one man or even two then the assistant would have pinioned the legs but with four it was necessary for the hangman to take two and his assistant to take two they moved quickly and quietly behind the men fastening the leather thongs the chaplain was in front of them the chaplain knew he was at gods will otherwise how could he have looked them in the face hoods on two of them were singing muffled indistinct quavering nooses round the necks frikkie did this himself tightened the knot under each of the left side jaw bones he saw the feet in line of the trap he flicked his hand the prison officers stepped back releasing their hold on the condemns with both hands he gripped the lever the explosion of the trap jeez lay rigid on his bunk his breath came in great pants the silence he had heard the feet stamping and shuffling on their way to the gallows he had heard the swell of the singing seeking out new heights of sympathy then the crash of the trap an awful sorrowing silence the singing was to support four men and the men were gone from where singing could boost them the singing had ceased with the fall of the trap cut in mid phrase the god awful silence around jeez like he was alone like he was the only man in the bloody place he always heard the trap go he heard it the day before when the hangman was practising his drops with the earthfilled sacks he heard it go on the morning of a hanging as the crow flies or the worm crawls jeez lay on his bed just yards from the gallows beam he heard everything in the hanging room and everything in the workshop and the washhouse underneath theyd be suspended now they let them hang for twenty minutes then there would be the water running in the washhouse as they cleared up the mess after the district surgeon had completed his postmortem then there would be the hammering in the workshop as the trusties nailed down the coffin lids last there would be the sounds of the revving of an engine and the sounds of the van pulling away running down the hill beverly hills wasnt a place for seeing what happened christ it was a place for hearing listen to a multiple execution singing trap silence water silence hammering van engine those were the sounds of four men getting to be stiffs god almighty jeez it was the route they had in mind for jeez while he had been at beverly hills he had heard the sounds of one hundred and twentyone guys getting stretched and now one hundred and twentyfive jeez had heard the trap go under each last one of the mothers he shouldnt have written the letter all the same the letter was weakness shouldnt have involved her but he had heard the trap go so many times shit and he had to to call for someone he felt so alone this was a civilised gaol not like the one a long time back there were no beatings here no malnutrition no rats no disease no forced labour here his cell door wouldnt be thrown open without warning for a kicking and a truncheon whipping no risk that he would be frog marched into a yard and kicked down and shot in the nape of the neck this was five star so bloody civilised that jeez had sat in a cell for more than a year a cell that measured six foot by nine foot while the lawyers debated his life three meals a day here a good medic here because they wanted him healthy on the day he had written his letter because he was losing hope what were the bastards doing why hadnt the bastards got him out he hated himself for believing theyd forgotten him theyd got him out the last time took the bastards long enough but theyd got him out they couldnt let a man one of their own couldnt let him never finished couldnt let him course they couldnt he hated himself when the hope went because that wasnt the jeez way he was one of a team a bloody good team a team that didnt forget the men out in the field he was fine on the days when he didnt hear the trap fall it was only on those sodding days that the doubts bit hed done them well hed kept his mouth shut through interrogation bloody weeks of it hed kept his mouth shut through the trial hed kept his mouth shut when the security police from johannesburg and the intelligence men from pretoria had come to talk to him in his cell he hadnt let the team down jeez heard the spurting of the water hose in the washhouse on the high ceiling of the cell the bulb brightened another day god almighty it just wasnt possible that the team had forgotten about jeez in an hour and after he had eaten his breakfast he would hear the hammering start it was difficult ground for the minister any byelection would be in these days but the orange free state was the heartland of the afrikaner world a dozen years before in petrusburg and jacobsdal and koffiefontein hed been cheered to the echo by the white farmers when he talked of the inviolability of the policy of separate development today he would have to speak to the same white farmers with the currency collapsed with further foreign sanctions in the air with unrest in the townships with taxes up with markets disappearing no easy matter up here to sell the ending of the homelands policy to uphold the repeal of the immorality act to defend their record in the collapse of law and order one thing for the state president and his ministers to talk in pretoria about dismantling separate development quite another out in the constituencies to explain to the faithful the reasons for the retreat they had a big enough majority in parliament the national parly but byelections counted the most recent byelections had shown the subsidence of the partys vote and the increase of the pulling power of the conservative right the state president was enjoying the greasepaint and the television lights and his broadcasts via satellite to the american networks where he spoke earnestly of reform the ministers the donkeys they were the ones who legged it down to the grass roots to explain that everything that was traditional and taught from the mothers knee was now subject to revision the minister of justice had a long day in front of him public meetings at breakfast midday and late afternoon the byelection was to be held in twentyseven days time the minister of justice had been preceded by water affairs forestry and environment conservation and by community development and state auxiliary services in this constituency alone he would be followed before polling day by state administration and statistics by transport affairs and by minerals and energy the minister had slept in the back of the car for most of the drive from bloemfontein to petrusburg he woke when they were three miles short of the town his secretary passed him a battery shaver the secretary sat in the front beside the police driver in the back of the mercedes with the minister was the local area chairman of the party a fellow broederbonder whatll they be like cool which means iced the minister strained his chin upwards to get the razors teeth against the skin of his jowl we all want to know what the future holds change you wont find this audience applauding talk about change they like the old ways they want reassurance that were running our country not american bankers ill get them laughing youd have to get your trousers off to get a laugh what do they want to know that our government is not abdicating its responsibilities in the face of overseas pressure and black pressure persuade them and we might just win its rubbish to talk of abdication the party man shrugged fine when you say that to me tell your audience that and theyll shout you out of the hall i promise you whatll satisfy them you know the name of prinsloo should i gerhardt prinsloo dont know him his parents live in petrusburg dont give me riddles man the minister snapped they were coming into the town one street on a main road low buildings a small shopping arcade a decent church his father runs a hardware store his mother teaches in the nursery school you should go to gerhardt prinsloos grave if i knew who he was everyone in petrusburg knows the name of gerhardt prinsloo hes the nearest thing they have to a genuine south african hero tell me man if the people here thought that you didnt know who gerhardt prinsloo was and what he did then i assure you our vote would be halved what did he do warrant officer gerhardt prinsloo gave his life to save others he smothered the terrorist bomb in the rand supreme c o u r t the minister bit his lip in anger you caught me cold early in the morning ive heard it said in this town that our government of today is so preoccupied with foreign opinion with the shouting of the liberals with appeasement that the men who murdered gerhardt prinsloo might receive the state presidents clemency the minister leaned forward tapped his secretarys shoulder give me my speech and your pen resting the speech on his knee he made a long addition to the back of the first page the car came to a stop there was desultory applause from a small group of the faithful out to greet the minister straight after my speech i will visit the grave i will lay some flowers there and i want a photographer a tiny cramped cell jeezs home for thirteen months in the top half of the heavy door was an aperture covered by close mesh too close to get the fingers through beside the door and looking out onto the corridor of c section was a window of reinforced glass against the far wall to the door was the flush toilet and beside that set in a cavity was a drinking water fountain if he sat on his bed at the far end of the pillow then his legs fitted comfortably underneath the work surface area that jutted out from the wall he had brought no personal mementos with him to beverly hills there were no decorations on the walls no mementoes of any previous condemns eight feet above the floor a heavy metal grille made a false ceiling the cell was sixteen feet high on the corridor wall above the grille were slatted windows and the guard who patrolled the catwalk above the corridor had a clear view down through these windows into the cell in the ceiling the light burned bright by day dimmed by night always burning no daylight could reach the cell natural light came from windows above the catwalk and then by proxy into the windows above jeez from his cell he could see no blue sky could never see the stars the windows onto the catwalk and into the cell were always open so the temper of the seasons reached him stinking hot in high summer frosty cold in winter now the cool of the autumn was coming he doubted that he would shiver again in the winter cold he had eaten his breakfast he had shaved under supervision he had swept out his cell he waited for his turn in the exercise yard other than his turn in the exercise yard this day would go by without him leaving his cell he was the celebrity the first white political to face death by hanging since john harris and that was more than twenty years before no one who worked in beverly hills had ever before handled a white political who was condemned many times in each day he would look up from his bed to the corridor window and see the flash of a pale face the face of a watcher they might have had a camera on jeez for all the time they watched him they watched him while he slept and while he ate and while he read and while he sat on the lavatory he knew why they watched him and why his shoes were slipons and without laces and why he had no belt and why there were adhesive tabs on his prison tunic in place of buttons when he had first arrived at beverly hills he had been told why they would watch him one guy a white had once stood on his bed and nosedived onto the concrete floor to try to cheat them out of his appointment no chance that they would provide jeez with an opportunity not to show for his appointment because jeez was a political he was allowed no association with the other two white condemns in c section they were new boys one had moved in three weeks before and one had been there for four months and three had gone because their sentences had been commuted to imprisonment the other white condemns were permitted to exercise together in the yard leading off c section but jeez was only taken out when they were back and locked in jeezs cell was at the far end of the section corridor the cells of the other two condemns were opposite each other and beside the door that led to the main c section corridor there were empty cells separating the white criminals from the white political he had never seen their faces he had heard their voices in the corridor he knew they called him the bleddy commie or the bleddy ter these two bastards wouldnt be singing for him not if it came to him keeping his appointment sergeant oosthuizen was the prison officer who had responsibility most days for jeez most days sergeant oosthuizen escorted jeez to the exercise yard each time he heard the slam of the door that separated the main c section corridor from the c section corridor and each time he heard the key slot into his cell door he hoped a short soaring hope that the governor was coming with the message that would tell jeez that the team had not abandoned him they always slammed the door between the main corridor and c section the team had been his life the team was names and faces clear as photographs no blurring with time the captain of the team was colonel basil big and bluff and with thin blue veins surfacing on apple red cheeks the men in the team were lennie who had a patter of whip crack jokes and adrian who flirted with the fresh new recruits and henry who on a friday evening at the end of the working office week played the piano in the saloon bar of the pub that the century men used colonel basil and lennie and adrian and henry were his team and his life he hadnt let them down neither a long time ago nor in johannesburg of course theyd be working for him moving bloody mountains for him probably old colonel basil would have set up a special task force desk to supervise the prising of jeez out of the hole he was in sergeant oosthuizen was smiling at him from the opened cell door they were cutting it rather fine hell of a good lime hed had on the team the real friendships home and away being on the team mattered because membership of the team was the guarantee shit the guarantee was important to a leg man it said that the team would never stop working their balls off for a leg man who was in trouble and christ was he in trouble jeez carew member of the team was going to hang and his faith in the team was slipping nice morning for a walk come on carew the solicitor had driven that morning from johannesburg because it was useless to telephone for information and worse than useless to write letters to the justice ministry he was not shown in to the civil servants office until after the lunch hour it was a brittle meeting the elderly afrikaner south african and the young english heritage south african the man on government pay and the man on private practice the solicitors questions were blunt enough had the decision been taken by the state president on whether james carew would hang the civil servant had parried the decision has been taken but the decision is not yet public could the solicitors client know of the decision of the state president hell know when he needs to know surely if he was going to get clemency then he should be told immediately if hes not going to get clemency then hes better not knowing couldnt the solicitor be given an indication of the state presidents thinking look im not going to tell you what is the state presidents opinion the way we do it is this the deputy sheriff will go to the gaol not more than four or five days before an execution and he will then inform a prisoner that the appeal to the state president has been turned down im not saying for certain that the sentence will stand in the case of your client but i can tell you that if it does stand you will know at the same time that carew knows it had been spelled out to him the young solicitor softened not for carew but for me to know youre asking me to read the mind of the state president a bit of guidance the minister was in petrusburg this morning he made an addition to his prepared speech he said there are people who say that your government is soft on the matter of law and order we are not there are people who say that our legal processes can be influenced by the threats of foreign governments they can not there are people who say that terrorists will get away with murder in our fine country they will not i warn people who seek to bring down our society that they will face the harshest penalties under our law whether they be white or black whether they be our citizens or jackals from outside its not me thats answering your questions it is my minister how long not long not a month its cut and dried listen at the moment we have a police strength of around in ten years we will have a force of more than right now we have to fight this unrest with an understrength force if any south african police line cracks then there is nothing to save us from anarchy we have to sustain the morale of the police or we go under and supporting the morale is not best served by reprieving police murderers i appreciate that youve spoken to me in confidence what can save my client the civil servant examined the file in front of him he was a long time turning the pages he looked up he gazed steadily at the solicitor if at this late stage your client were to give to the security police every detail of his knowledge of the african national congress then there might be grounds for clemency in his case alone the others would go we could handle one reprieve not more we have never understood why your client ever involved himself in terrorism and he hasnt helped us if we had names safe houses arms caches everything he knew then we could talk about clemency guaranteed fractionally the eyebrows of the civil servant lifted you should tell him to talk to the security police thats all that can save him sergeant oosthuizen stood by the locked door of the exercise yard and talked he talked of his daughter who was big in windsurfing down on the cape and of his son who owned a liquor store in louis trichardt sergeant oosthuizen had been years in the prison service the last eleven of them in beverly hills he was to retire in the next month and then hed be able to spend time with his daughter and his son sergeant oosthuizen didnt require jeez to have a conversation with him he just talked that was what he was happiest at it was more of a garden than an exercise yard against the walls was concrete paving each wall was nine paces long thirtysix paces for a circuit fortynine circuits was a miles walk the centre of the yard was jeezs garden the soil was twelve inches deep then concrete it was jeezs garden because none of the other condemns showed any interest in it the garden had not been looked after since a child killer had gone to the rope the month before jeez arrived at beverly hills last spring oosthuizen had brought jeez seed the geraniums had done well the marigolds had threatened to take over the chrysanthemums had failed jeez crouched on his haunches and picked discoloured leaves and old blooms off the geraniums the sunlight was latticed over the bed and the concrete by the shadow of the grid above him the garden was a cell the song birds could manage it through the grid and out again but nothing as large as a pigeon could have squeezed down to feed from the grubs that he turned up when he weeded his flowers in the exercise yard jeez could see the sky and he could feel a trapped slow breath of wind but he could see no trees and no buildings and no men other than sergeant oosthuizan and sometimes the guard at his catwalk window he could see the wall of c section and the outer wall and the wall of c section and the wall of the c section corridor if he stod with his back to the wall of c section and raised himself onto tiptoe he could look over the roof of c section amp onto the upper brickwork of the hanging room he wondered if sergeant oosthuizen would have retired before it was his turn jeezs turn to take the early walk he wondered if the sergeant would walk with him tha was stupid thinking because there was no way the team would let it happen burning the candle theyd be couldnt for the life of him think how the team would pull him out thought about it often enough but couldnt work it colonel basil wasnt the one for ideas nor lennie adrian was good with ideas better than henry have to be adrian who was going to crack it and then the team would all thrash it round wouldnt see their feet for dust once theyd settled on an idea clear memories faces clear in his mind colonel basil and lennie who had the limp from the ambush in cyprus and adrian whod bloody near lost his career in the gentlemens toilet at piccadilly underground and henry shit and wouldnt henry have been up for retirement gone to breed the bloody pigeons he always talked of what if theyd all gone couldnt have done all bloody older than jeez colonel basil was certain henry was bloody lennie looked older couldnt tell adrians age not with the hair rinse what if they werent there at century stupid thinking no way the team would let him hang carew im speaking to you jeez started up sorry sergeant you werent listening to me sorry sergeant i was far away you dont want to brood you know its where were all going you dont want to think too much no sergeant why i was talking to you was that id just seen your fingers first and second on your right hand how long is it since ive been with you its thirteen months sergeant and ive never noticed your fingers before just fingers sergeant ive never noticed them before and my wife says im the noticing kind what didnt you notice sergeant no nails on the first and second fingers of your right hand jeez looked down pink skin had grown over the old scars someone took them out sergeant ingrowing were they i once had an ingrowing big toe nail when i was serving at the old johannesburg fort gaol thats closed now they thought they might have to take it off but they cut it back and it grew again but not in hells painful someone took them out for fun sergeant can we go inside now please sergeant who took them out for fun thats a very serious allegation long ago sergeant long before south africa he could remember the pliers grasping at the nails of the first and second fingers of his right hand pain rivers in his whole body he could remember the smile of the bastard as he jerked the nails off he hadnt talked to the bastard who had ripped his nails off just as he hadnt talked to the security police in johannesburg and you get yourself washed up for the medic they went inside jeez going first and sergeant oosthuizen following and locking the door to the exercise yard the doctor saw jeez once a week and weighed him jeez knew why he was weighed each week sergeant oosthuizen stood by the door of jeezs cell that must have hurt when they took them out a long time ago sergeant hilda perry liked to see her family on its way in the morning sam had taken will to school and ten minutes later she was back at the front door holding jacks raincoat ready for him he came hurrying down the stairs if he ever managed to get himself married or get a flat of his own shed truly miss him she always thought it was because of the time they had been together the abandoned wife and the fatherless son that they had a special bond he wasnt sleeping properly she could see the eye bags she reckoned she looked the same today she hugged her boy she knew they were both thinking of the man half way round the world from them in a cell thinking of the man she wouldnt have recognised her jack couldnt have remembered he told her he would be home early he would have seen her gratitude theyd keep a sort of vigil in the house the two of them for however many days and weeks it took until jeez was just the two of them sam didnt know but shed started to take librium three days earlier just one tablet each night when she was getting into bed so that she wouldnt dream she shrugged him into his raincoat he managed a smile for her and was away down the front path to his car the telephone rang behind her she wanted to see jack go before answering the telephone but he had taken a chammy out of his car and was cleaning the windscreen she went back into the hall and lifted the telephone could i speak to mr curwen please she could see jack at the rear window finishing off who is it names jimmy sandham hed want to speak to me she ran awkwardly in her slippers down the path the engine was starting coughing she caught him just in time she saw the frown she heard him say ill be right with you he put the telephone down only work mum she knew when he lied she had always known he was away running down the path she thought she was losing him could no longer reach him in the way she had before he had changed when he had broken with that nice miriam she knew what had happened from miriams mother when a rain squall had driven them off the course into the lounge of the golf club something methodical and cheerless about his life two nights a week after work at the squash courts working himself out until he was near sick from exhaustion and the same with his studies again picking up the lost degree course working late into the nights she preferred him the way he had been before when he was with miriam she could never understand how he had lost the degree chance thrown it up four months from his finals seemed ridiculous to her and so trivial she watched him drive away he had been so matter of fact that evening he had come home from college and told her that his university days were finished hed told her the circumstances like they didnt matter a single student who was a paidup member of a fascist party being heckled by a group of trotskyites between chemical engineering and applied mathematics a point of principle hed said flatly didnt like bullies hed told the trots to leave it they hadnt and theyd jostled the lad and were spitting in his face remembered jack remarking that hed thrown a punch broken a boys jaw so matter of fact jack spelling it out that he had been up before the disciplinary court of the senate that morning and the provost had asked him for an apology and his reply that he would do it again because it was bullying and being told that he must give the assurance and refusing and being told that hed have to leave and leaving telling it like it wasnt important telling it just like jeez would have and here he was back at his books she closed the door she was alone with herself the librium didnt last into the morning she worked at speed with the hoover and the dusters and the brush and pan upstairs round the beds and downstairs through the kitchen the front door bell rang it was a cosy and predictable household it was her home that was being damaged by nightmares and sedation pills and lies the doorbell rang again she didnt want to answer it she didnt even want to go to the door and peer through the spy hole another long ringing the milkman had already been the post was on the sideboard in the hall beside the telephone the newspaper was on the kitchen table she looked through the fish eye spy hole it was a tall man still short of middle age she thought and he wore a light grey suit and his face was tanned and his moustache was clipped short into a crescent over his upper lip she tightened the belt on her housecoat the door chain was hanging loose unfastened she opened the door the man was smiling mrs perry mrs hilda perry a soft casual voice yes did you used to live mrs perry at green walk coulsdon in surrey another smile she couldnt place the accent there was a lilt in his speech that wasnt english yes could i come inside please mrs perry i dont buy anything at the front door its about a letter you had mrs perry what letter you had a letter from a mr james carew in pretoria central prison my names swart it would be easier to talk inside she recognised the accent as south african what if i did have such a letter im from the embassy consular section the letter mr carew wrote to you is the only letter hes written to anyone inside or outside our country were trying to help mr carew sometimes a mans background his personal history can help a prisoner in his situation it would be better if i was inside because jack had lied to her that morning she was fine tuned to a lie she knew this man lied the man was taller than her even though he stood on the step below the front door if you could help us with mr carews background his friends and his work and so on then there might be something you told us that could make a difference to his situation whatever he said he smiled she wondered if he had been on a course to learn how to smile she knew jeezs letter word by word each guarded sentence was in her mind jeez didnt want them to know that hilda perry was his wife that jack was his son ive nothing to say to you i dont think you understand me mrs perry james carew is going to hang what im trying to do is to find out something that might lead to a reprieve his foot was in the doorway jeez wouldnt have wanted him in her house she was sure of that i just want you to go away the smile oiled across his face and then he was inside the hall why dont we just sit down and talk mrs perry with a cup of tea she thought of the good years with jeez and the misery without him she thought of the way she had willed herself to hate him after he had gone she would have sworn that the man who had pushed himself into her home was jeezs enemy she picked up the telephone she dialled fast who are you ringing police please she said into the telephone thats a hell of a stupid thing to be doing mrs hilda perry ive an intruder in my house churchill close are you trying to put a rope round his neck please come straight away she put the telephone down she turned to face him theyre very good round here very quick why dont you come into the kitchen and sit down and then you can explain to the officer who you are and what you want cold anger no smile hell hang mrs perry he was gone through the door she saw him trotting down the path when he was outside the garden he started to run years of placid and sedate domestic life were disintegrating for a long long time she had loathed jeez for the last few short days she could remember only the times that she had loved him by the time the police car turned into churchill close major hannes swart was two miles away going fast and fuming it had taken him long enough to track hilda perry from the address used by the prisoner carew some good honest footslogging had translated green walk into churchill close and for nothing swart had been in the south african police for seventeen years but he hadnt done footslogging for more than a dozen security police officers were too precious to have their time wasted on doortodoor and sceneofcrime for some of his work he was a businessman promoting in the united kingdom the sale of stellenbosch wines at other times he was an accredited journalist at the foreign press association specialising in financial affairs most often he was a lowly member of the visa section of the embassys consular staff he worked to a police brigadier from the fifth floor of the embassy he was one of the bright stars amongst the detail of security police officers assigned abroad he had blown what ought to have been a simple task a dowdy housewife had seen him off by the time a bemused police officer was leaving churchill close having been told only that a south african male had tried to force entry into the house no explanations of why the temper of major swart had matured to controlled fury they should have jazzed the swine used the helicopter on him and the electrics when they had him in john vorster square too damn correct they had been with him in the interrogation cells and a hell of a damn good thing that he had taken the precaution of parking his car out of churchill close at least the cow didnt have the number plate to add to whatever bloody story she hatched to the local force sandham had said that this was an ah irregular meeting if you follow he sat with jack in a tea bar off victoria street some way from the foreign office its irregular because i havent cleared it with my superiors and because im giving you the gist of fo thinking that may turn out to be incorrect your fathers going to be hanged and neither the private nor the public shouting of our crowd is going to change that your fathers solicitor has told our people in south africa that theyll spare him if he turns state evidence up to now hes told them nothing he doesnt sound to me like a man about to splash through a sea change thats one pointer theres another a few days ago their justice minister made a speech that effectively shut out all prospect of clemency they want to show theyre strong they want blood what would happen if i went out to see him you wouldnt get a contact visit you wouldnt be able to touch him hold his hand youd have a glass plate between you youd speak down a voice tube my opinion it would be pretty distressing for you and for him what would they talk about jack shuddered the man would be a stranger god and small comfort hed be to his father whats your interest in his case mr sandham sandham shrugged something stinks meaning what ill tell you when ive found out when my fathers dead and buried i cant say what stinks sorry mr curwen but youll hear from me when i know i promise you that i dont know where to go except to you jack said simply thats the hell of it and times running out jack drove back to d amp c janice looked at him curiously then gave him the message that his mother had rung he telephoned her he cradled the telephone on his shoulder his elbows were on his desk top his hands in front of his mouth janice noted his attempt at privacy he heard about the visitor and the questions he told her that he had been to the foreign office that there wasnt any good news he rang off abruptly he was sagging over his desk why dont you go home he looked up he saw young villiers staring down at him why should i go home because you look knackered im fine youre not and you should go home jack was shouting if i say im fine then im bloody fine and i dont want any one bloody tiptoeing round me just concerned old boy well dont be fucking concerned janice and lucille studied their typewriters villiers flushed flexed his fingers his father had told him everything that he needed to know about jack curwen that he had been two years and one term at university and left on a disciplinary matter that a dropout added up to a cheap work horse for d amp c ltd that jack curwen was lucky to have his job however dedicated and able he might be nice to know that nothings wrong he said evenly because he had a good nose jimmy sandhams diplomatic career had long ago been stunted he said what he felt it right to say and then managed a quaint look of hurt when his superiors rewarded him with lack of advancement as a young man in teheran at a time when british factories were on overtime and weekend shifts to turn out chieftain tanks for the shahs army sandham had briefed a visiting journalist on the help with direct interrogation methods that british intelligence were giving to savak in amman he had filed a formal report to the ambassador stating that the representatives of british construction companies were buying their contract to build a hydro plant with back handers two of the representatives were at that time putting up at the ambassadors residence he couldnt be fired but he could be disliked and he could watch his promotion prospects going down the plug hole it was eight years since the industrious jimmy sandham had last been posted abroad he never complained never sought explanations as younger men leapfrogged him but the word was out if there was a bad smell in a section then keep sandhams nose at arms length the carew case was a thoroughly nasty smell to jimmy sandham and the error of peter furneaux assistant secretary had been to let him within a mile of it the friend sandham had telephoned had been his best man at the english church in bangkok the friend thought the day spiced with pleasure because the ambassador had been the guest of honour eleven days after receiving the query from the crown auditors concerning his wifes frequent and private use of the rolls jimmy sandhams bride had been his friends secretary that had been a long time ago but they had stayed as close as two men can who meet each other for a couple of meals a year and exchange cards at christmas the friend worked from a nondescript tower block on the south side of the thames home base of the secret intelligence service the friend loved sandham for his pigheaded obstinacy and made certain they were never seen together they sat on a bench in battersea park shielded by a towering shrub from the nearest path the fun fair hadnt opened for the summer season the kids were at school it was too short of pickings for the tramps too draughty for the lovers furneauxs a total arsehole the friend said i get this garbage from furneaux about deep water and we have a file with carews real name on it furneaux didnt put the file back into records its locked in his own safe to keep your prying eyes off it what would i have seen enough to whet your appetite sandham grinned what about your file enough for you to choke on sandham stared into his friends face is james carew one of ours fighting talk jimmy you should know theres a dnotice what else i reckon thered be official secrets act section i closed court ten years minimum could be fifteen you want cream on your raspberries theres a fair bit of bad blood in the service over carew desk men say its entirely his own fault leg men say that once a mans on the team then its marriage vows for ever trouble is that the service has changed since carew started out desk men count leg men are dinosaurs evaluation and interpretation is the name of the game and you need an oxbridge degree for that running around on the grounds out of fashion and the desk menll let him hang he had a fairy godmother but thats over they got him out the last time second times one too many the leg men say that carew wasnt asked to do what he did so you bastards are going to write him off come off it jimmy are we going to go to pretoria and tell them that a staffer a wallah on the pension scheme is driving the scoot car from a daylight bombing he was there to infiltrate provide the raw intelligence for assessments he wasnt there to lead the bloody charge down the johannesburg high street i tell you what we think happened we think he had infiltrated the anc just inserted himself under the skin we think the anc learned to trust him and one day bad luck for carew they trusted him enough to do a little job for them we think the poor creep probably didnt know what he was into sandham said bitterly i thought it was holy writ that you lot looked after your own the friend laughed out loud thats gone with the ark what sort of chap is carew brilliant you want to know what he said when he was lifted lets have a bit of dignity boys thats what he said to the four guys with him and theyd just knocked half joburg over hell keep his secret our secret the friend looked at sandham keenly you wont forget the ten years minimum and the dnotice jimmy its the nastiest story ive ever heard its real politik the politicians have backed this leaving him to hang who needs to tell them about the big bad world when he left his wife we got him back without ten years of his life four ones two fingernails and he never told them anything hut he had the old godmother working for him then right now hes noone rooting for him why not march of time jimmy comes to us all the godmother got retired a bit before jeez was lifted there was lennie abrams hes posted to djakarta for expenses trouble there was adrian mountjoy fairy hes in an open prison in the midlands groped a vicesquadder in a gay club once too often there was henry willcox took an early out and skipped with one of the library girls jeezs problem is that no ones shouting in his corner sandham shook his head as if the smell was suffocating him where was he the first time those ten years try a happy little holiday home called spac a stint of albanian hospitality its disgraceful keep in touch jimmy for what sos i know whether im going to have to traipse down to parkhurst for the next ten years of visit days a west indian woman pushed a pram past him and gave him a long sneering look like shed spied out a flasher or an addict his friend was gone vanished into the trees and shrubs for more than a quarter of an hour sandham sat bowed on the bench finally he stood and tried to pull the creases out of his raincoat on his way back to the foreign office he found a telephone kiosk rang jack and fixed to meet him the following day he was a man heavy with anxiety jack knew from sandhams voice that he was to be told something that was worse than he had been told before they met in a pub south of westminster bridge sandham found them a corner where neither could be seen from the door where he could not be seen from the bar jack told sandham that a south african had been to see his mother sandham said that the man would be either from security police or intelligence hed check it sandham said that they had to have been working on tracing hilda perry ever since jeezs letter had given them her previous address sandham said there was a civil war being fought in south africa and theyll play dirty if they have to how dirty four blacks from port elizabeth big guys in the opposition united democratic front get a telephone call from what calls itself the british embassy asking for a meeting they set off and they disappear on the road when theyre found theyve been burned and hacked to death we never made the call that was last year ill give you another one victoria mxenge a black lawyer representing some of the accused in the treason trial she was coming home after dark to her township outside durban shot dead on her doorstep no arrests this isnt bloody south africa jack said they have a keen idea of national security theyre a serious volk and they couldnt be caring too much about international frontiers these people in south africa the government murdered them i didnt say that i said they were opponents of government and theyre dead there might be a difference do you know what a dnotice is jack shrugged its when the government tells the newspapers they shouldnt print something do you know about the official secrets act section i the charge thats brought against foreign spies and our traitors what im going to tell you is covered by a dnotice and the official secrets act section i were going in up to our necks arent we sandham told jack what he knew he knew that james jeez carew was on the payroll of the secret intelligence service had been for a quarter of a century he knew that jeez had been in south africa for the last dozen years with the job of infiltrating the military wing of the african national congress he speculated that jeez had overstepped his brief and become involved in a guerrilla attack he knew that her majestys government were not prepared to go to pretoria and cough up that a white under sentence of death was in fact a legman in deep cover for sis and therefore should be spared the rope a gasp from jack i cant believe it youre on the horizon of a tough rough old world they always get their people back thats what you always read it might have been true once but isnt true any more and your father wasnt acting under orders and thats governments let out theres more to it technically south africa is a major trading partner weve billions invested there we may have as many as a quarter of a million jobs dependent on south african purchasing power and south african mineral resources governments dislike of apartheid comes a poor second to economics im just telling you what i know jack flared im going to blow this off the roof tops dont even try it the papers wont print it and telly wont broadcast it thats the dnotice youd be charged under the official secrets act and when you get to court itll be long after your fathers been executed and then itll be in camera the courtll be cleared the doors locked the press out so whos lifting a finger for him sandham picked up their glasses went to the bar jack sat slumped on the upholstered seat he was drained he could not absorb that this was happening to hilda perry and jack curwen worse than a nightmare sandham put two large scotches on the table and sat down jack asked if i blew it would you go to prison with me worse than that breach of official trust youve taken a chance on me it was the only decent course to take jack gripped sandhams hand held it tight his face was screwed into lines as if he agonised over the question is jeez carew worth crying over you know the answer you have to tell me gently sandham released jacks hand youre his son you dont have a choice and from what ive discovered id say that your father is a man you should be very very proud of sandham said he had set up a meeting at the foreign office for the following morning that was to discuss jeez he didnt elaborate he left jack grim and drawn he walked back to his car waves of outrage lapped over him outrage against the forces that had intruded into his life his mothers life his tongue twisted round obscenities sometimes silent in the spring evening wind sometimes out loud terrorism prisons and the sentence that a man should hang by the neck until he was dead had never before owned a corner of jack curwens mind many targets for his hatred he hated white south africa he hated the security policemen who had arrested jeez he hated their prisons and their gallows he hated the secret intelligence service of his own country he hated the men who had washed their hands of responsibility for jeezs life a long bitter walk a mile beyond his car when his mind was made when a certainty had slashed through the rage and bafflement he retraced his steps south africa was a place on a map he had no thoughts on the future of that country it was of no interest to him he had no black friends in a year he could have counted on his fingers the times he had spoken to black men and black women jack knew nothing of black britain or black south africa he knew nothing of the black dream of freedom and he cared less but his mind was made he went in search of duggie arkwright duggie arkwright was the best start jack could think of each new year jack transferred from his old diary to his new one the addresses and telephone numbers that he had consolidated over the years the previous new year when he had determined on retaking his degree as an external student he had searched out duggie to beg and borrow the library books from college that he knew duggie had squirreled away he had an address that was a squat off camden high street he thought they were all marxists or they might have been stalinists and there was a revolutionary socialist workers party poster sellotaped to the wallpaper in the hall he was given a second address duggie had nearly been a friend in the little more than two years they had shared at london university they had known each other first when they had adjoining rooms in the hall of residence when they shared coffee or were short of sugar or needed to borrow a book duggie was an idealist in his first term he had joined debsoc labsoc aasoc and dramsoc jack hadnt joined the debating society nor the labour society nor the antiapartheid society nor the dramatic society he had joined the rugby club jack would have been satisfied to end up with a nd lower in modern history he knew duggie had kicked himself for ending up with that grade jack had dogged application duggie had brains hed gone to duggie for the books because he was damned if he was going to go back to college and request library facilities he went gingerly down the dark basement steps in paddington when he rang a woman shouted at him from a window above she gave him a third address she said shed been chasing the bastard herself for his unpaid rent she may have been misled by jacks suit to supposing him another creditor because she wished him well they had drifted apart during the second year but it would not have been possible for jack to lose sight of duggie duggie arkwright was the darling of the lefts societies the regular lambaster of government and institutions he wrote in the student paper under a photograph and a byline he made principal speeches at debates he had twice been arrested in trafalgar square once on the antiapartheid ticket and once on a cnd demonstration he ended up in dalston quite a long way east over the tracks from tartedup islington it was the doorway beside a newsagent the newsagent was open he went inside and asked if next door was right for duggie arkwright he got a cold nod from the young pakistani at the cash till last year jack had seen duggies photograph second row in a demonstration in liverpool he couldnt think of anywhere else to start jack had rung the bell and a girl had opened the street door and led him upstairs it wasnt really a flat it was a room with a table and some chairs a baby asleep in one of them and a line of washing and a paraffin stove and a collapsible cot and an electric cooker for a bed there was a mattress on the floor with rumpled sheets and blankets posters on the wall and jack fancied they hid the damp they looked at each other and duggie beamed bloody hell its priggy curwen the refugee from modern history what in gods name nice to see you duggie i suppose you want my notes now and my essays no ditched it all have you come to tell me youve chucked it ill take my degree the year after next and pass god what a crass prig do i have to wait till then for my books back when ive finished with your books ill be sending them back to the library duggie was laughing out loud jack was grinning the student that jack had hit had been standing in front of duggie arkwright duggie had said at the time that it didnt matter the student having his jaw broken because he was unsound a revisionist come on in sit yourself down but there wasnt anywhere to sit down the baby was in the one comfortable chair and of the two chairs at the table one was deep in washing bags and the other was a book store bloody good to see you jack bloody curwen jack this is anthea the girl stared coldly at jack he could measure her dislike his suit and his raincoat wasnt it his hair that was cut every fortnight she turned away from him as if she was a bank managers daughter as if she detested a reminder of where she had once been thats joshua lenin arkwright sleeping thank god dont just stand there get your bloody coat off you look like a bloody bailiff jack grinned your last landlady spoke well of you remember that cow anthea should have had the rent tribunal on her and the health and sanitary youre bloody welcome if youre not after a loan i do need some help jack said simply duggies laughter pealed through the room his smile was huge and his teeth were awful you must be in desperate shit if you need my help anthea snapped that hed wake the baby duggie pulled a face come on if youve the price of two pints they went down the stairs and were in the street before jack realised that neither of them had said goodbye to the girl one glorious night behind a hedge when wed gone up to help the miners picket some hideous power station her daddy said hed cut her out of his will if we didnt marry high price to pay for coal if you ask me but hes seventyone next birthday jack plunged are you still involved in south africa you dont just lose interest because youve left college its important to you course it is most days im at antiapartheid do you know people at the anc conscience hasnt stricken priggy curwen has it you going to make a donation its not a joke duggie i have dealings with the anc ive been on liaison committees i know people there they have a military wing right theyve umkonto we sizwe spear of the nation thats the military wing jack stopped him outside the pub i want an introduction youre not a bloody spook are you i mean you wanting that its ridiculoushe tailed away he saw the seriousness on jacks face you have to trust me duggie trust me when i tell you that i intend nothing that will harm that organisation i have to have an introduction to this spear of the nation i have to know the man i am meeting is able to get things done theyd kill you if they found you were bent thats not what theyll find you didnt tell me what work you were in jack cracked a thin smile his mind was made he was on his road im to do with explosives duggie pulled an old envelope out of his pocket on it jack wrote his home number and his office number in the pub they had three pints each paid for by jack and they talked about college days and laughed too much they laughed too loud because jack had said he worked with explosives and duggie had heard him i see the worlds looking up on you nicholas villiers noted the change in jack sorry about the snap i was a bit under the weather the problems sorted out glad to hear it janice and lucille heard the satisfaction in villiers voice the girls liked jack for his apology jack told villiers that he was going straight out to do his elms that hed be back in after lunch he asked lucille to mind his telephone he said that a mr arkwright might phone him and to be sure to get the message exactly he drove down to dorking then came off the main road and took a winding treelined route to ockley he reached a remote farm far up a lane with post and rail fencing for the hunters hell of a backwoods place for thirty miles from london the owner had looked as though hed had a death in the family when hed first had jack down when the elms were toppled on their sides felled but waiting to be cut up and carted away taking out the stumps was small business to jack but hed had to work for the contract because the owner seemed hesitant to uproot his final memories of the elm avenue for once george had beaten jack to the site just the two of them the jcbs and the lorries would come in the owners own time jack had asked that the horses be kept well clear and there was no sign of them some beef bullocks watched them theyd take plenty to be frightened george had already dug neat holes at the side of each of the stumps by his small unmarked van was the wooden crate that held the nitroglycerine ammonium nitrate based dynamite and also the metal box in which he carried his no detonators and also a drum of cordtex and a drum of safety fuse are you going to sit on your arse or are you going to help id like to help mr hawkins they worked together jack at georges shoulder as the old blaster stowed the oz cartridges of explosive down under the arches of the roots jack didnt speak didnt interrupt he watched as george slid the aluminium tubed detonators into the cartridges he saw him crimp the cordtex to the open ends of the detonators he was learning he was watching a master at work set em off all together george muttered cordtex and safety fuse are cheaper than my time jack had many times witnessed the routine he had seen the laying of the explosive the insertion of the detonators the crimping in of the cordtex the linking of the cordtex to the safety fuse the unwinding of the safety fuse back to the van and the charger box youre bloody quiet this morning jack boy jack didnt answer just watched a long job with thirtytwo stumps to be taken out if sandham was nervous then he was good at hiding it a secretary had come up to the south africa desk to collect him furneaux had been in the open plan area he had seen sandham summoned and known who the secretary worked for and wondered what in hells name was going on sandham grade having an audience without it going through the assistant secretary running his desk sandham came into the hush of the outer office where the girls fingers whispered over the electric typewriters he thought a funeral parlour might have been more cheerful the permanent under secretary was waiting in front of the closed inner door ill at ease sandham understood when a grade man requests a personal meeting with the foreign secretary on a matter concerning national security then the fat cats would be wetting themselves one and all there had been some exquisite moments in jimmy sandhams life he reckoned this would knock spots off les affaires bangkok teheran and amman the pus opened the inner door waved sandham inside it was the first time that he had been inside the foreign secretarys office he was too far down the ladder to take part in the south africa policy meetings where strategy was hammered over he thought the foreign secretarys wife must have had a hand in the decor it was seven years since his own wife had left him shouting from the pile of suitcases at the front door that she couldnt endure one more day with a man so pompous and selfopinionated and nor had she but he still recognised a womans hand the foreign secretary tepid and small wouldnt have had the wit to choose the colours and the fabrics and the gentle hidden lighting the foreign secretary had his nose into a papercovered desk there was a second man in the room he sat in a low chair with his back to the door the bald crown of his head just visible over the chairs back the pus announced sandham he pointed to a plain upright chair and sandham went to it and sat sandham wondered if they had any inkling of what was about to drop into their laps the foreign secretary raised his head he had pale skin and owl spectacles ah sandham thank you for coming you wanted to alert us to a matter of national security i think i have asked the director general to sit in you know pus of course who will make any notes that may be r e q u i r e d the floor is yours the foreign secretary had his elbows on his papers his chin in his hands the pus lounged back on a short settee a pad on his knee the director general gazed with frank hostility into sandhams face because he had read the wretchs file j sandham grade man given the moment could be mischievous or impertinent but he needed a deep breath he had expected that the pus would sit in with the foreign secretary he had not expected that the director general would have been summoned across the thames from his century tower the director general as the man in place in the secret intelligence service had responsibility for jacks father the director general was the employer of jeez carew alias james curwen a hell of a deep breath before launching into his accusation thank you for seeing me sir i t h o u g h t there was a matter that you should be aware of it is a question of life and death and that is why i have requested this personal meeting with you the puss propelling pencil was poised in south africa in about three weeks time a man called james curwen but who goes under the name of james carew in that country is going to hang sandham saw the muscles tighten under the pug dog chin of the director general ill call him carew because thats the only name that the south africans have for him carew was convicted of driving the getaway car used by african national congress guerrillas in their escape from the supreme court bombing in johannesburg fourteen months ago at the time that carew drove the vehicle he was a fulltime operative of the secret intelligence service he saw the eyebrows of the pus flicker upwards he saw him begin to write a situation has arisen where a man working for his country is going to hang because the british government has not chosen to exercise its influence first to secure clemency and second to win mr carews release there was a cloud of surprise on the foreign secretarys face sandham wondered what had surprised him the allegation or the fact that a grade man knew the history if youll forgive me sir i think its unacceptable that a man doing his job should be abandoned the pus closed his notepad pocketed his gold pencil whats your source the director general beaded sandham with his eyes i saw a file that i was not entitled by rank to see sir have you passed on this allegation to any other person the foreign secretary spoke through closed teetth no sir it was sandhams second instinctive lie with it clear of his tongue he thought of the earnest sincere concerned face of young jack curwen and thats all that you wanted to tell the foreign secretary the pus seemed to make a trifle of sandhams statement yes sir the pus shone sandham an affectionate smile were very grateful to you for drawing this matter to our attention if its not inconvenient for you would you mind waiting a few minutes in my office the foreign secretary had twisted in his chair to look down from his window and into the park the director general stared at the tapestry screen that masked the open fireplace the pus ushered sandham towards the door they wanted him out they wanted to thrash it round it had been bloody good entertainment he would have liked to dance a bit and shout no problem sir sandham said easily ill get someone to take you down to my room you wont be kept long they watched him leave they waited for the door to close behind him the foreign secretary spoke with a squeaking nervous voice you knew about this director general i did not your department your man ill be making it my business to find out foreign secretary if this sandham is to be believed the pus swirled his hand above his knee cut the foreign secretary short hes to be believed our mr sandham is always to be believed more important hes a difficult man thats his history whats to be done with him the director general looked up he should go home foreign secretary thats best he should be at home where he can commit no damage ill have a man take him home if this allegation were to become public property it wont the director general said quietly you can guarantee that foreign secretary leave it in my hands you give me that authority whatever authority you want thank you foreign secretary just the authority to isolate him they had the hard hats on and they were crouched one hundred and fifty yards from the nearest stump and they were sheltered by the van george always crouched didnt matter what protection he had theyd done the checks together jack had watched each step he reckoned he could have gone through all the procedures himself well dont hang about all day lad jack thought hed die old waiting for a bit of politeness from george whats so bloody funny nothings funny mr hawkins get on with it jack rested the palm of his hand over the bar of the plunger dont stab it ease it he closed his fist on the bar he looked at george warts and wrinkles and thinned out hair protruding from under the garish orange rim of his helmet george winked jack pressed the charger bar slowly steadily down there was the clap thunder of the detonations there was the rich loam soil spurting up the shuddering climb of the tree stumps the thumping patter of earth and roots landing the furious croaking of rooks jack gazed fascinated at what they had achieved away beyond the line of uprooted stumps the bullocks were in flight george studied the scene his face was closed jack looked into georges face one thing to know a man and work with him another thing to trust him he thought he could trust george hawkins but what he thought didnt really matter because he had to trust the man get on with it jack george said tersely was it that obvious say what youve got to say he told george that his father had disappeared from his life when he was two years old before he could remember he told him that he had been brought up to believe that his father was cruelty incarnate he told him that there was not even a photograph of his father that had been kept by his mother when she had cleared out her husbands possessions he told george of the letter how the missing james curwen had been resurrected as james carew under sentence of death he told him that his father had been working for the government an agent in place that his life was not going to be pleaded for thats the history mr hawkins georges was a low gravel voice you could have spoken to your mp a journalist one of those lads on television why didnt you cry on their shoulders why do you talk to me a blaster had to be you you didnt have to come today and watch me lift a few moody tree stumps right you want some knowhow jack nodded george said softly where are the targets not here waste of time in london i know where the target is i dont know what itll take explosives has to be george was striding fast to his van hope youre not asking me for explosives every last cartridge of mine has to be accounted for youre going to south africa even if you could get them here you cant just put them in your bloody suitcase and fly out of london dont think the xrays and the sniffers would miss it you wouldnt get as far as the plane ill get the explosives there you got the right friends im finding them there was the obstinate thrust to jacks chin god he was racing ahead he hadnt the targets he hadnt the explosives he hadnt the friends so bloody innocent and talking as though he could just snap his fingers and achieve them george cuffed him come back to me when youve some answers major swart resented having any more of his time taken up with the carew affair the file was hardly worth the effort of couriering it from pretoria on the overnight of south african airways carew was a home desk problem and following up stray ends was unrewarding work for a major of security police the woman had seen him off hed have thought shed have spilled her heart out given the chance to save a man from the rope a week earlier he thought he had placed her in the game all by leg work and tracking back in the files of somerset house before her divorce mrs hilda perry had been mrs hilda curwen she had been married to a james curwen james curwen was his man until he had driven down to the hampshire village which was listed as the womans address at the time of her marriage hed had a photograph from pretoria taken in the gaol but especially so as not to look like a police shot he had found three men who remembered james curwen in a pub by the cress beds a retired postman the man who kept the village grocery store and the vicar he had said he was the london representative of a south african based legal firm he had said he was trying to trace this james curwen because there was money left to him he showed them all the photograph and he had seen each one of them shake his head and heard each one of them say the photograph was not that of james curwen wrong face wrong physique so he hadnt linked hilda perry to james carew and it didnt have a high priority from pretoria and there was a limit on his time a higher priority was the man who had come in from lusaka if there was a matter that could make major swart emotionally ill it was that the united kingdom on top of all its cant about the suppression of terrorism could allow african national congress murderers free rein to visit their chummies in the london office he thought he might get to see the bastard from lusaka that evening not certain but a good chance in the late afternoon jack came into the office janice was making up her face over the typewriter her mirror propped against the ribbon she waved to indicate the paper she had left on his desk too busy to speak nicholas villiers had gone home so had lucille he recognised most of the names and numbers that he was to call back the people with the chimney in streatham a good one for george and hed get his photo in the local rag the brewery who were pulling down the bunch of grapes in addington a ball and chain job the clearance of a small council house development at earlsfield where the precast concrete units were disintegrating and it was cheaper for the local authority to demolish than to repair duggie arkwright and a number were half way down the list and again at the bottom of the list it was duggies girl who picked up the phone anthea she sounded high she dropped the telephone and he heard duggie arkwright curse her jack introduced himself you meant what you said yes i want to open phone priggy jack swallowed hard and this was london he felt juvenile naked same place as we had a drink same time well go on jack wanted to ask who they would meet where they would be going but the line was dead he rang his mother he wouldnt be in for supper hed be back late the habit was catching no explanations next he called sandhams number at the foreign office he wanted to hear about sandhams meeting what the new information was he was told mr sandham had gone home there was no reply at the home number im dying for a drink janice told him theyre open now lack said its the nice thing about pubs these days that a girl can go in and have a drink on her own he settled back to his list the people with the spare chimney and the brewery and the local authority the chimney people had gone home so had the local authority but he had a good talk with the brewery the prime minister was obsessive about banana skins and over the years the secret intelligence service and the security service had had more than their share of disasters it had been only too often the prime ministers misfortune to get to the despatch box in a gloating house of commons and wriggle in the mess with this director general the prime minister felt secure the confidence was reciprocated with an allconsuming loyalty the director general was clean in the matter of james carew he had been transferred from a diplomatic career the previous year he had come in after carews arrest and trial the file on carew revealed ample evidence of an approach to intelligence gathering that was provenly dangerous the mans career was a joke a pathetic confidence trick colonel fordham should have been put up against a wall and shot for what he had done for carew at the very least carew should have been wound in the morning after fordhams retirement the file was horrifying reading colonel fordham had transferred from the regular army to the service he had recruited his batman for leg work a man without higher education in due course a small operation had been run into albania albania was the most irrelevant corner of mountains on the european continent colonel fordham had sent this devoted but secondrate individual into albania on a mission based on rotten information the soviet union scowling at yugoslavia might do a hungary or a czechoslovakia and then nato might deploy troops and armour in north west greece and if nato were up on the greek albanian border then they just might need to know what was on the far side of this most closed and guarded frontier colonel fordham had sent this man into albania for a bit of map reading and reconnaissance and to see which bridges would carry ton tanks as if he had never heard of satellite photography in the file were the minutes of the meeting where the mission was agreed it wouldnt have happened in the director generals day there was a brief paper on the aims of the mission there was a telex decoded from the missions forward headquarters in corfu reporting that radio contact had been lost and the poor bugger sat in prison there for ten years no record of a minute to downing street alec douglas home wilson heath none of them ever heard a whisper of it and of course the albanians had never known who they had right to the end because curwen had never confessed anything in ten years it had ended shabbily with the payment of from the service contingency fund into a venezuelan bank account colonel basil had brought his man home and about bloody time the director general came to four sheets of lined paper that might have been extracted from the centre of a school exercise book the writing was close joined up in ball point at the top in capitals and underlined was spac labour camp in the ruled margin written with a different pen but in the same handwriting he read col fordham i thought this might be important to you in case anyone else of our team ends up in the place respectfully jeez it was a factual account of life in the spac labour camp it was compiled without a trace of self pity it described the work of the camp the mining of pyrites from which copper is taken eight hours a day and six days a week and a seventh day if the weeks target had not been reached he read of foot high barbedwire fences and guards with searchlights and attack dogs unheated concrete barrack blocks where more than three hundred inmates would sleep on straw mattresses on three tier bunks of a diet that hardly ever included protein fresh vegetables or fruit of the beatings and the punishment cells of finger nails ripped off with plumbing pliers he read of strikes riots reprisal executions and every day of the ten years this poor bastard had nurtured the assumption that the secret intelligence service was working for his release it was a disgrace he tidied the faded sheets of paper anon the legman had been brought home privately feted as a hero but hed lost his wife lost his son lost the best ten years of his life so the agent had been given a warm berth in south africa controlled from london working for colonel fordham the telephone rang he thought the man who had done ten years of his life in spac was indeed second rate he thought also that the man must have a near limitless well of courage he picked up the telephone he said to send them in he put the curwencarew file to the side of his desk perhaps duggie believed him extraordinary that priggy curwen should have sought him out to set up a meeting with the african national congress not just any old joe there but the military wing and should have said he worked in the explosives racket explosives werent a joke explosives and detonators and time delay fuses were serious business they left the pub then went in jacks car north up the essex road it was dark and raining you scared no jack said not now perhaps you should be this isnt south africa yet its a war were fighting to destroy them and theyre fighting to survive point is were winning but that doesnt mean theyll stop fighting whats at stake is whether south africa is governed by the representatives of nearly thirty million people or whether its run by nearly five million who happen by accident of birth and breeding to have a different different pigmentation of skin jack if youre getting into south african resistance politics if youre into explosives then my opinion you ought to be a bit scared jack said curtly ive my own reasons for getting involved theyre good enough for me learn first that you dont talk on open phones learn fast that they can get a hell of a lot rougher than phone taps theres bombs in london and paris and zimbabwe and botswana and swazi and maputo big bombs down to letter bombs theyve got infiltrators they pay burglurs to turn over resistance offices right here in safe old london got it even as his father had he had known what was for real these people youre going to meet don t piss about not the sort of man youre going to meet fighting repression in south africa is their whole lives theyll trust me duggie noticed the assurance he gave me instructions right turn then a left then straight on over the lights another right they walked across the poorlylit playground of a junior school there were posters up on the playground fences to advertise the meeting big d e a l it wasnt the albert hall nor the royal festival hall it was a junior school in stoke newington there was music beating out through the open doors of the gymnasium through the door jack could see the lines of chairs they stopped at the door duggie turned hand out and jack gave him two pound coins it bought them admission and a photocopied sheet detailing the evenings programme ill start you off then youre on your own jack looked around him there were posters and flags fastened to the wall bars there were pictures of mandela and tambo there were the slogans of the antiapartheid campaign there were a hundred people he thought he must stand out a fly in a tea cup there were eyes watching him the uniform was jeans and sweaters and shawls and long skirts you said it duggie chuckled you said you knew what you were getting into now you find out the apple of major swarts attention was jacob thiroko the black lounged at the back of the hall away from the low stage and out of sight of the door he leaned against the gymnasiums vaulting horse his eyes drooped as if he was still exhausted from the long flight out of lusaka of course he would be cold after the central african heat around him were a clutch of his europeanbased comrades swart wore patched denim trousers he had not shaved that day his cheeks were rough below the tinted glasses his hair was brushed up before coming he had rubbed his hands in the earth of his office pot plants getting the stains into his palm and under his fingernails he sat in the lastbutone row unremarkable and unobserved there was a young man at the doorway in a suit staring round him he saw the man who was with him he recognised him douglas william arkwright years old unemployed unpaid worker at antiapartheid verbose and useless he saw arkwright speak in the young mans ear and then lead him the length of the hall to stand respectfully on the fringe of the group surrounding thiroko swart was interested he couldnt hear what was said but he saw the young man in the suit shake hands with jacob thiroko it was for jack to start there was casual amusement in thirokos expression jack saw a handsome man soft chocolate skinned mahogany eyed he couldnt tell the age anything between middle thirties and late forties he was jack curwen and he lived in churchill close and he paid into a private medical scheme and he voted to maintain the status quo he was jack curwen standing in a run down school shaking hands with a member of a revolutionary movement committed to the overthrow of a government half the world away preposterous enough to make him laugh but his father had three weeks to live i was brought here to meet someone from the african national congress there are many of us here comrade a soft swaying voice i wanted to meet someone from the military wing of the anc then you should be in south africa where they are fighting the freedom war i was told that if i came here i would meet someone from the umkonto we sizwe wing of the anc there is no war in london the war is in our homeland jack moved close to thiroko my name is jack curwen i am an expert in explosives i have to meet and urgently someone from the military wing perhaps in a month such a person i dont have until next month ive two days at most to meet someone from the military wing what sort of person thirokos face was a mask someone who can make decisions and see them through i doubt i am that person there is no one from the military wing at a meeting such as this i have to talk to you you said that you wanted the military jack cut in i told you i dont have time to be pissed about i can tell you how you are different from these creeps round you different face different eyes different hands how different different because they are a soldiers perhaps you are mistaken from behind jack there was a burst of applause he turned to see the stage filling in this room you are the only man who is a soldier who are you mr jack curwen my father is going to hang in south africa in three weeks my father is an activist of the anc the mask fell astonishment flooded thirokos face jeez carew is my father the applause grew the audience stamped their feet as they stood and clapped the principal speakers of the evening as they climbed onto the stage major swart could no longer look behind him he had seen the young man and thiroko deep in talk he had to stand with the rest and beat his palms together he heard the chairwoman of the meeting coo her gratitude that their meeting was honoured by the presence of a distinguished guest from the anc headquarters whose name for security reasons could not be given out he saw thiroko going forward the bastard didnt look a fit man when the audience settled down swart looked behind him there was no sign of the young stranger his eyes darted to the door he saw the back of douglas arkwrights duffel coat disappearing he sat with his mother in the living room sam was upstairs in bed before jack had returned he held cupped in his two hands the mug of coffee she had made for him his hands were rock still my minds made up im going to south africa to see your dad yes ive told you samll help you with the airfare not his business its mine what does he mean to you as much as if id known him all my life his mother held a square of lace dabbed it into her eyes will you have the strength when you go to see him when you have to say goodbye to him its not just to see him mum im going there to bring my father home janice and lucille stared at the open office door jack was on the phone he had spun his chair round so that he could rummage into his filing cabinet as he talked he didnt see duggie arkwright he was a disaster wearing his oldest patched jeans and a scarlet tshirt under a skimpy denim top he saw jack and whistled jack spun saw who it was and with a brisk apology finished his phone call jack stood and muttered something to the girls about being out for most of the day he took his coat he felt their questions on his back and ignored them they went out of the office and into the mild morning air when jack looked back from the pavement at the office window he saw that nicholas villiers and the girls had their noses pressed to the panes you said you were going to ring jack said the kiddie was crying in the night i got up i was holding the kiddie near the window and i saw this guy on the far side of the road covering our place the kiddie had a bad night i was up again a couple of hours later he was still there i didnt go back to bed i just stayed in a chair each time i went to the window he was there have you ever been under surveillance before not that ive known duggie had a brittle nervy laugh i went on the tube this morning travelled a few stops there was another guy in the carriage he got up when i got up i came right across london did two changes he was always in the same carriage i fixed him with the old onoff stay on till the doors are closing then you squeeze off he went on down the line he looked pretty pissed off he must have been a south african jack was sombre chewing at his thumb nail why not our police they dont have an underground railway in johannesburg onoff is the oldest one in the book any london copper would know that one have to be a boer not to know that one jack felt sick why follow you perhaps they were there last night saw us with the big fellow perhaps theyre wondering who you are perhaps they want a line into thiroko i dont know they were still watched from the window jack would have loved to have turned on his heel walked back into the offices of d amp c he would have loved to have remarked easily to nicholas villiers that the distractions of the last days were a thing of the past the sneer came to duggies mouth dont bloody whine you were the one whispering about explosives you were the one wanting to meet the military wing of the anc sorry i couldnt ring you i couldnt be sure you werent tapped here thanks duggie looked exhausted lets go meet the big boy they drove into london thiroko had come early he was not a frequent visitor to london but he was familiar enough with the british capital to be able to select his own rendezvous he had chosen lincolns inn fields a square of lawns and shrubs and tennis courts and flower beds and net ball courts he liked open air meeting places where there were exits at all corners he was intrigued by the young man he had met the previous evening and the young man was a distraction for his mind from the physicians message he was sufficiently interested in the young mans brief explanation to him to have agreed to the meeting and he knew of course of james carew he knew of the taxi driver who carried messages between dead letter drops transported weapons between arms caches could take photographs and draw maps a white had access to many target areas where it was not safe for a black to go he knew of the usefulness of the quiettongued taxi man thiroko was fortyeight years old he had been out of south africa since the military wing was formed since the banned african national congress had gone underground he had never been back his homes had been in moscow and dar in tanzania and luanda and maputo and gaberone and now lusaka some months he dreamed of a triumphant return with the war won and the apartheid regime humbled and beaten most years he doggedly refused himself horizons of hope and struggled on organising the infiltration of men and munitions into his former country thiroko straddled two generations of the movement he was neither a part of the old political hierarchy who wanted the military wing to attack only hard targets where the gesture mattered more than the mayhem nor was he among the ranks of the young hawks who demanded the right to hit the soft targets of the white supermarkets and railway carriages and resort hotels to his colleagues he was dedicated humourless and reliable to the south african police he was a murderous enemy one they would dearly love to have trapped when the recce commando went into maputo and maseru in lesotho and gaberone he had been out of maseru less than twentyfour hours when the recce commando stormed the anc base houses he hated the white war machine he knew of no sacrifice too great if the regime could be brought down he saw jack come into the square he watched him pass the office girls playing net ball in their morning break he saw him look around and pass the gardener laying out the first trays of the years bedding plants he knew of the boys hither the movement was peopled with men and women who could not keep their mouths tight shut carew had never been suspected of leaking information a dozen years was a long long time to have survived the resistance war in johannesburg it had been thiroko from his office in lusaka who had suggested that carew should drive the getaway he owed it to carew that he should meet his son he watched arkwright settle onto a bench close to the net ball pitch he disliked the foreign whites who lionised the movement from t h e comfort of their european cities he watched to satisfy himself that there was no tail on the young man the young man saw him and thiroko recognised the relief on jacks face the relief told him of the strain the strain told him of the genuineness of carews boy he presumed he was to be offered explosives that he would have to explain gently that the movement had all the explosives it could h a n d l e he would do it in a kindly fashion i am sympathetic to you as i am sympathetic to the families of happy zikala and charlie schoba and percy ngoye and tom mweshtu to all of the families goes the very sincere sympathy of the movement and what should those families do about it a harshness in jacks voice they will pray they will attend protest meetings in south africa they are going to make video cassettes that will be sent to every head of state represented at the general assembly of the united nations prayers and protests and petitions mr thiroko are a great waste of time tell me what is not a waste of time i am going to go to south africa to the gaol where my father is held i am going to blow a hole in the wall and i am going to take my father out should i laugh because you are so stupid should i cry because you are so sincere its not a joke to me thiroko was hissing back at him you know what the gaol is boy the gaol is the peak of a security system from every other gaol in the country men are escaping and no man has escaped from that gaol for ten years they are desperate men they are going to hang they are sitting in their cells for more than a year most of them they are thinking of escape and for more than ten years none of them has managed it jack on the offensive he had the man arguing not laughing that was good anywhere thats maximum security is vulnerable maximum security breeds complacency the gaol isnt up against the street the gaol is in the middle of a complex you would be shot hundreds of yards short of the walls if you are shot dead how does that help your father how does it help him if i sit on my arse and pray and shout outside their embassy and ask politicians to watch a video thats doing fuck all to help him you would be killed hes my father jack said flatly so be it thiroko leaned back against the arm of the bench he was trying to read jack you are a good boy you work here you have a family you have to exist through the next weeks then you have to resume your life after it has happened you have to forget your father im going to south africa do you listen to anybody jack couldnt help himself a snap grin hardly ever it is not my intention to help you to kill yourself im going to bring my father home impossible you understand that word give me the chance your failure would hurt us and it is impossible that you could succeed not if you helped me thioko shook his head as if he did not believe what he learned in the slate grey eyes of jack curwen i cant do it jacks hand covered thirokos fist a hard unyielding grip where were you when the court bomb went off where will you be when five men hang sitting on your arse and comfortable you take a chance with me young man the anger was brilliant on thirokos face lying in your pit and snoring i care about my men thiroko spat the answer your movement took a chance with the lives of five men you owe it to them to help me no one tells me my duty your duty is to help them not to sit on your bloody hands thiroko softened he had never been in combat in south africa he had never fired a kalashnikov assault rifle at the boer police or the boer troops he had never carried a bomb to a target and known the fear sweat in the fold of his stomach he thought of what the physician had told him what do you want jack felt the glow of success i cant take explosives with me i cant get them through the airport i want access to explosives in south africa and i want a team why should i trust you with a team when i get to johannesburg give me explosives thats all sit on your hands on your arse and wait and listen to the radio youll hear what your explosives have done the radioll tell you what ive done on my own and when youre satisfied then youll give me a team what is it you want exactly when i arrive i want a minimum of twenty pounds of explosive i want detonators and cordtex and safety fuse i will hit the target of my choice then youll know im worth the team all for your father to bring him back thiroko took a notepad from his pocket he wrote out an address he showed the address to jack told him to memorise it let his eyes linger on it then folded the paper and tore it into a hundred pieces that he threw to float away and disperse over the grass he told jack to meet him at the address the following morning youre going to help me i am going to think about helping you times very short i too learned to count i know how many days are available thiroko walked away from the bench he was soon gone from sight jack was trembling god the assurance and the bombast had fled him god and was he frightened he was an age finding a phone box that worked he rang jimmy sandham at work he wanted to meet with him had to talk to someone a brisk voice answering stating that he was through to the foreign office jack gave the extension number sandham had started him on his road jack wanted to meet him for a drink to listen to his quiet control could i speak to mr sandham please a personal call a womans voice not here im afraid will i get him later this afternoon hes taken a few days leave since when he left yesterday how long is he away who is it asking for him please lack put the phone down he tried the home number no reply he rang george hawkins and invited himself over he rang d amp c and said he wouldnt be back that day it hit him he had forgotten duggie arkwright after leaving lincolns inn fields he had walked into the west end and then he had spent another ten minutes looking for a phone that wasnt broken or occupied duggie had sat down at the entrance to the square when jack had gone forward to meet thiroko he hadnt been there when jack had left duggie had done the introduction and had himself a tail and jack had put him out of his mind hed ring him when he could hed ring him when he came back he looked into a shop window there were three layers of television sets cash sale and credit they all carried the same picture of high armoured personnel carriers driving through a south african township of tin roofs and brick walls and of gas plumes and of the blue uniforms blasting with their shot guns of running crowds of police chasing with the long whips held back to strike in anger the caption said they were old pictures had to be because the camera crews were banned from the riot areas he wasnt going there to take a side in a civil war he was going there to bring his father home and it wasnt real it was only old pictures on a bank of television screens he knew what was bloody real it was that his father was going to hang in three weeks that duggie had a tail that morning that a woman had said sandham had gone on leave he went to find his car then to georges to talk about explosives he was the moth the file was the lamp the director general had read word by word every page in the curwencarew file he had started to imagine that he knew the man there was a photograph in uniform early twenties from its date there was a portrait shot before the fiasco in albania there was another shot taken during the debrief and after the hospital checkup there was a blowup of a johannesburg newspaper photograph of carew being brought out of court the change was albania the flesh had been stripped off the man but he couldnt mistake the defiance in the features especially in those taken after the decade in spac he had read carews south african reports they were poorly written but they were dense with names and gossip there was no analysis no interpretation all as raw as sewage in a down flow it crossed his mind to wonder whether the security police in pretoria often had access to such quality information in the alexandra township three doors down fifteenth avenue from the north side junction with hofmeyer there were stored under the back room floor boards two rpg antitank rocket launchers and eight missiles for the launchers were in waste ground beside the church wall on second avenue a yearold street cleaner who lived on key in the jabulani district of soweto had for two years been umkonto we sizwe commander of the whole township seven kalashnikov rifles were buried in protective grease wrapping in dobsonville in the park that was bordered by mahlangati and matomela at a house number given on mhlaba in the chiawelo district military planning meetings were held when security conditions allowed movement in the night of the first tuesday of each month the fall back rendezvous was on pilane in the molapo district there was the house number in the mamelodi township of pretoria where a press printed anc literature there was the name of the school from which that literature was dispersed the identity of the schoolmaster who wrote the broadsheets lists of officials in south african laundry dry cleaning and dyeing workers union and in textile workers union transvaal and in south african chemical workers union who were either politically or militarily active in anc the names of couriers african names who carried lowlevel messages around the townships one white named van niekerk aged disabled student and a white girl named both addresses careful maps showing infiltration routes into south africa from botswana the numbers of bank accounts and the addresses of those hanks accounts and banks where the an cs money was lodged the director general read through lists of intended targets police stations power lines railway track a sewage filtration plant a military recruiting office a long list there was a sketch plan of the approach route to be used for the rocket attack on the sasolburg fuel storage tanks there were the operational orders for the strike on the voortrekkerhoogte army base there were verbatim arguments between cadre cells on the priorities of attacks damned hard material to come by no mistake the reports from years back had been worked over he could see the pencil and ink ticks and underlinings that showed him that once these reports had been valued not the reports of the year before carews arrest they were unmarked and he thought they had gone unread into the file he was fitting together his picture of his man he read that the sis officer attached to the british embassy in pretoria used to come once a month to johannesburg and go to a certain taxi rank at the south african airways terminal and take a certain licensed taxi and pay for his fare and receive the latest carew report with his change all as amateurish as if his service had been playing boy scout pranks carew had never come home an addendum note stated gone native a note in fordhams handwriting to the effect that curwen wouldnt trust himself too close to his former wife and his grownup son should he ever return to london all the time the poor devil was being paid last friday of every month a pay cheque rolling into a bank account in liechtenstein signatories to the account james curwen col b fordham statements from accounts at century concerning the amounts deducted from his salary to make allowance for monies earned from his taxi driving he had misjudged his man but he still believed he was past saving he rose from his desk silently he paced his carpet past saving he pondered the options he extended the forefinger of his right hand they could come clean to the south african government and make an apology and plead for clemency second finger they could scuffle around for sufficient leverage to ensure that pretoria would respond to negotiation and spare his man and hold silence third finger they could break the legman out from the hanging gaol he snapped his fist shut absolutely not on inconceivable in the time and fantasy past saving he had a meeting scheduled with the permanent under secretary for the late afternoon the pus outranked the director general for all that the director general was in a position to control the flow of information available to the pus in the matter of james sandham the flow would be dammed at once he had set aside minutes directly after lunch for himself and his principal officials to discuss the carew case it was a gesture the setting aside of senior mens time and unless someone came up with something right out of the ordinary it was the last gesture the service would and could make major swart had fretted through the morning he had sat in his office at the end of a corridor behind an automatic locking steelbarred door willing the telephone to shout for him the two warrant officers who did most of the footwork in his small empire had called earlier to report that they had lost arkwright been tricked by him on the underground their second call had told swart that they had picked him up again when he returned to his flat swart wanted badly to know the identity of the young man in the wellcut suit who had been huddled at the meeting with thiroko that young man was probably worth opening up and arkwright should have been the way to him there was a third call arkwright had just drawn the curtains to his room from his state of undress it was to be assumed he was taking his slut to bed they sat in the kitchen the sink and the stove needed three hours work from a strongwilled woman jack doubted there had ever been a woman in george hawkins life certainly no kids the blaster never talked about a woman talked mostly about his three cats big confident brutes they seemed to jack sleeping on the kitchen table or striding over the stove or licking at used plates in the sink bowl jack sat on an old explosive box upturned and covered by a grimed cushion george was scooping cat food from a tin jack thought the cats ate better than the old blaster was it just kiddies bullshit jack said ive found the right man probably for trusting i have to genuine guy hes on the military side the cats were chewing fiercely george put a page of newspaper over the tin left it on the window ledge above the sink the targets are in south africa yes do you have a bloody conscience i dont its explosives lad its not just a firework show where everyone has a good laugh and hears a big bang explosives get to hurt people i dont want to hurt people i just want to get my father out of that place thats a piss poor answer i dont know where yet the first target will be in johannesburg good and big where the whole city sees it ill rot in hell certain youre talking about an act of war its bloody harrods lad its the grand hotel its the bandstand in regents park its the household effing cavalry youre talking about have you got the guts for that i have to or hes going to hang there was a bomb in northern ireland the la mon house hotel george went to a drawer he excavated among cartridge boxes and pamphlets and books and old newspapers and older bills he took out a nearly clean sheet of blank paper he flicked his fingers for jack to pass him a pen he started to draw the diagram firm and bold strokes of the pen if they ever knew george hawkins drew this for you then id be bloody lucky jack boy if they just shot me my father hasnt told them anything im not intending to start you take that away with you and you learn it by heart and you flush it away dont take that on your bloody aeroplane whats the gaol the marmalade cat had eaten too fast it vomited on the linoleum george seemed not to notice jack told him that pretoria central was a complex of five gaols in the centre was the hanging gaol he didnt know the lay out didnt know where his fathers cell was didnt know the guard patterns he didnt know any bloody thing if i told you it was just daft id say you should mind your own business mr hawkins by helping you am i just getting you killed without you id help myself george turned over the sheet of paper is it an old gaol or a new one i think its newish itll have a wall round it if it were old it would be brick or stone if its less than twenty years then itll be reinforced concrete youd be better off just getting pissed every night til they hang him how do i knock a hole in reinforced concrete were not even talking about how youre going to get into a security area up against the bloody wall youre not going to be able to drill holes and use cartridges youre not going to be able to use layon charges because youd need a dumper load of earth to cover them or youd have to shift a ton of sandbags dont tell me what i cant do easy lad professor charles monroe columbia university way back before we were born its whats called the monroe effect its the principle of armour piercing what they use against tanks shaped or hollow charge its what its called jack theyll shoot you dead draw me the shaped charge it was dusk when jack left he was in his car the window wound down george was bent to talk to him ill miss you lad jack grinned i wont be gone more than three weeks im a bloody fool to have talked to you could it work mr hawkins course it can work if you remember everything ive told you and if you remember everything youve seen over the last two years and if you do everything like youve seen me do it then itll work forget one thing a little small thing and youre gone ill come on down and tell you how it worked george snorted he turned away quickly so jack shouldnt see his face he went back through his front door he didnt look over his shoulder as jack drove away when he was clear of the lane out of sight of the bungalow he stabbed the engine into life the excitement gripped him the same excitement as when his final school exam results had come through and his university admission and his first girl and his winning of the job at d amp c ltd brilliant flowing excitement like the first time george had let him do a blast if he remembered every last little thing then he could do it he could take his father out were to meet tomorrow with the prime minister to talk damage limitation i dont think therell be damage the director general said i have learnt many things from our mans records one of them is his tried and tested loyalty to the service he wont talk then hell hang with his secrets the pus rocked his glass slowly willing the juice from the slice of lemon into further circulation our secrets the prime minister would look unkindly on the least embarrassment it wont come to that id bet money on carews silence he paused the fact is i should like very much to save this man i quite accept that it is politically unacceptable to go cap in hand and ask for his freedom tell them who he is we have looked at the odds against a team of men lifting him out of this gaol and they are high too high i dont doubt and the prime minister wouldnt countenance the risk of failure for heavens sake dont lets have any oldfashioned stunts the saving of mr carews life just doesnt warrant the risking of anyone elses not when you add the political risk neither in london nor lusaka did jacob thiroko have to consult with colleagues that night alone he would take the decision on whether the military wing of the african national congress would back the venture proposed by jack curwen amongst the senior officers of the umkonto we sizwe there were some who saw whites even if they were prepared to make the same sacrifices as having no place in the movement those blacks of the military wing treated all whites associating themselves with the anc with suspicion they believed all of those whites were communists first true to the south african communist party and loyal to the african national congress second thiroko was not a communist he had been to moscow he believed the soviets for all their aid in weapons and money to be more racist than the italians or the english or the dutch or the swedes if he were to have admitted to those senior officers of the military wing that a white had come to him with a plan of action and that he had supported him without consulting them then there would be questions circulated about his fitness to lead nevertheless it would be his decision alone he sat in his room in the safe house in a quiet road in north finchley he drank coffee better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all sentimental rubbish revolutionary warfare was about victory he was no advocate of glorious failure martyrdom if a cadre of the umkonto we sizwe were to attack the maximum security section of pretoria central then they must succeed they must free their condemned comrades the agony of the decision lay in a particular area it was the area that had stuck with him caused him to drink his fourth and fifth and sixth cups of coffee stayed with him through half a packet of cigarettes the physician had told him to smoke as much as pleased him the pain was more frequent was the movement better served by saving happy zikala and charlie schoba and percy ngoye and tom mweshtu and james carew from the gallows did the movement gain more from the martyrdom of the pritchard five which better for the movement to have at freedom five men who had bungled an attack or better to have five heroes buried while the world screamed anger at pretoria which have you made your decision jack had come early to the safe house when the door had been opened to his ring he had smelled the aroma of sweet spices from the kitchen she had been a tall woman with the dark skin of the bengali and had two children clinging to her sari she had shown no surprise only taken him to the foot of the stairs and pointed upwards to the closed door so direct should you not give me time to offer you coffee to ask you to sit he thought jacob thiroko had slept less than he had the coffee mug stood amongst stain rings on the table beside it was an ashtray and the empty matchbox that had been used when the ashtray had spilled over thiroko sat at the table the haze of smoke filled a strata of the room morning mist over a damp meadow thiroko sat at the table there was no other chair only the unmade bed for jack i just need your decision i want explosives i want to prove myself to you then i want help jack saw the sadness on thirokos face he knew it was the sadness of a military commander who sent young men onto the dirty battleground of revolutionary warfare im going mr thiroko with your help or without it with your help ill make a better job of it thiroko stood and pulled out his shirt from his trousers he lifted the back shirt tail and then his vest up to his shoulders jack saw the thin welt of the scar pink on the dark skin running diagonally across the length of his back sjambok rhino hide whip it is the way the police break up demonstrations they use the sjambok when they do not think it necessary to shoot i was a politician before they whipped me i was a soldier afterwards jack had his answer his elation shone i take a gamble on you a small gamble a few pounds of explosive nothing more until you have proved yourself they clasped hands jack said he would fly within two days thiroko told him where he should stay to wait for a contact and thereafter since he would be travelling in his own name to keep on the move where will you be mr thiroko i will be in lusaka you wont have long to wait jack was smiling thirokos face clouded with anger you are all children you think it is a game last night i shamed myself with my thoughts i thought whether it was better for our movement if those five should hang i considered whether five men dead was of more advantage to us than those five men free i know the answer and i prayed for forgiveness on my knees what will be your target for your explosives jack could smell the sweat on the sheets i dont know thiroko laughed with amusement you are clever to be cautious i dont know what the target will be honestly thiroko seemed not to have heard him we say that we trust each other and we are strangers there are men and women whom i have worked with for many years and i do not know whether i can trust them it was sensible of you not to have gone to our offices i trust you mr thiroko it is a small building always full of people hurrying busy greeting each other telling each other of their commit ment to the movement but there are worms there rotting our cause they may have been purchased by the boers they may have been compromised by threats against their family still in south africa no way of knowing but you have my word that only those who must know will know of your journey thank you you will be foolish if you underestimate the forces you are up against if you are caught you will wish that you could die to escape the pain the boers will inflict on you they will put electric shocks on you keep you from sleeping they will spin the chambers of a service revolver beside your head they will starve you they will hang you upside down from the ceiling with a broomstick under your knees and spin you they will parade you naked in front of the men and women who work in the security police offices in john vorster square it is where your father was john vorster square trust nobody trust only yourself do you know my father i know of him he would know of me ill tell him about you thiroko asked quietly if it were not your father i wouldnt have known who the pritchard five were i like honesty mr curwen but honesty will not help you in south africa be the cheat cheat the boers out of the satisfaction of five hangings jack saw a fast grimace of pain on thirokos face momentary then wiped away perhaps we wont ever meet again but ill tell jeez that youre a good man jack was lucky to have caught dickie villiers in the afternoon a miracle that he wasnt hacking his way down the fairways villiers was at his desk a quizzical look upwards from his boss nicholas would have briefed him that in a bit over a week jack was a changed man out of the office without explanation effing and blinding in front of the girls hangovers an extraordinary creature coming in to collect him villiers had been steeling himself to call the lad in i gather there are some problems jack villiers fondled his polka dot bow tie chaffing at the awkwardness he thought jack curwen was one of the best one worth keeping i have to go away mr villiers jack said youre not leaving us the blurted question im sure we could find more money no its for three weeks only im going tomorrow thats damned short notice dickie villiers leaned forward his avuncular manner are you in some kind of trouble ive a problem ive three weeks to beat it its often better to talk something through i am afraid i cant do that where are you going sorry villiers patience was failing thats just impertinence i hope my job stays open to me mr villiers and i hope to be back in three weeks are you involved in anything criminal jack smiled at him shook his head lets not beat around youre very fortunate to have this job villiers recovered quickly therere enough graduates looking for work not to count those who never made it through we gave you a real break i made it my business to find out why you were sent down from university and ive never held it against you this is no way to be repaying my kindness ive worked hard for you mr villiers but im not begging any favours im going to be away because ive no choice if youve given my job to someone else when i get back ill just have to find another one goodbye mr villicrs and before the older man could answer him he was gone jack went to his desk and picked up the contracts pending file and took it to nicholas villiers desk dumped it he put on his coat he waved a kiss to janice and winked at lucille he went out of the door he walked out of the building he had turned his back on the world he knew lack heard it on the car radio he was driving across leatherhead towards churchill close he had just bought his ticket open return to johannesburg for the following evening the soldier who has not yet been named was a member of a foot patrol in the strongly republican creggan district of londonderry a junior diplomat has been found dead below the summit of carnedd llewelyn in the snowdonia range it is believed that he fell more than feet onto a ledge where his body was found by a mountain rescue team he has been named as james sandham mr sandham aged was on a walking holiday in north wales it is thought that he lost his way last night and fell to his death while trying in darkness to make his way down from the foot summit of the mountain which is described by local experts as treacherous for the inexperienced the chancellor of the exchequer said this morning at a news conference before leaving for numbly he switched off the radio he was living in britain he was living in the oldest democracy and he was frightened he was living where the governments agencies existed through the will of the people crap jimmy sandham didnt look like a man who would have climbed two flights of stairs if there was a lift he had taken jack into his confidence into the area of the official secrets act section i and into the area of the dnotice jimmy sandham hadnt died on a walking holiday for christs sake he had died because he thought hed found something rotten at the core of his countrys government and had had the guts to say so in deep controlled anger jack drove home since peter furneaux had made the announcement of sandhams death to the staff of south africa desk that office had been a sombre lacklustre place the staff had packed up gone home on the stroke of halfpast four turning their backs on the empty table beside the radiator and the window only peter furneaux stayed he knew sandham could be a cursed nuisance he had seen him called to a meeting by the secretary of the pus he had no idea what the meeting was about and he hadnt seen him again he had received a memorandum from personnel informing him that the grade officer was going on immediate and indefinite leave sandham hated physical exercise despised joggers sneered at the lunchtime keep fit fanatics with a straight face with a stolid voice he had told his colleagues that jimmy sandham had died in an accident while walking in snowdonia furneaux remembered the meeting when he and sandham had faced the son of a man who was to hang in south africa he knew a little of the history of james jeez carew enough to realise the sensitivity surrounding the man he deliberated and he decided he would make no mention to his superiors of the meeting with jack curwen he would not report it he had not put a minute of the encounter on the file and he wouldnt do so now to have reported the meeting would have been to involve himself to have put a spotlight on well the odds were that the meeting with the pus had nothing to do with carew furneauxs decision ensured that the operatives of the secret intelligence service the men of century had no line on james curwens son during the twentyfive hours that remained before the departure of his flight to south africa he had come by the back route into downing street the director general always came through the cabinet officer entrance in whitehall and the underground tunnel to the prime ministers office the pus had taken the same route the prime minister said director general you were appointed to suppress the type of clandestine nonsense you are now telling me about the pus said in fairness to the director general prime minister carew was sent to south africa long before his time the prime minister said i want to know exactly what was carews brief the pus nodded to the director general for him to answer carew was sent to south africa with the job of fastening himself to protest and terrorist organisations operating in t hat country the job was created by a colonel basil fordham for whom carew had previously worked it was the assumption of the service that in the years ahead it would be important to know the planning and capabilities of the revolutionary factions the director general paused relit his pipe he had the prime ministers attention he fancied the pus thought him a windbag some statistics prime minister south africa is our twelfth biggest export market we are the principal exporter into south africa we have the largest capital investment there we have the most to lose if the place goes down in anarchy we have jobs directly linked to south africa another indirectly dependent in that they are supplied by raw materials mined in south africa should the present regime collapse then we have to be sufficiently wellinformed to ensure that any administration born out of revolution would be friendly to our interests all of that seems to fall within the scope of conventional diplomatic observation the director general puffed his disagreement with respect prime minister in recent years south africa has attempted to shield itself from guerrilla incursions by agreements with mozambique angola botswana and zimbabwe this has led to the formation of cells cadres of anc activists inside the country they act autonomously general orders are given from outside specific actions are usually initiated from inside conventional diplomacy can monitor outside lusaka headquarters of the anc carews brief was to infiltrate and report on the men inside to report the pus mouthed softly not to take part the prime minister was hunched forward indeed not the director general stabbed his pipe stem for emphasis without being instructed to do so he engaged in terrorism so far as we know prime minister carews role was strictly on the periphery an act of quite shocking violence i dont think we can assume that carew who was only the driver of a getaway vehicle knew of the intended violence but in which a courthouse was bombed and a policeman was killed correct prime minister the prime minister leaned back then periphery or no he deserves the gallows what if he talks the pus asked mildly he wont a rasp in the director generals voice should he make a confession from the death cell then our position will be that this was a freelancer who supplied occasional and trivial information the prime minister shrugged a private individual whose terrorist actions we totally and unreservedly condemn i have to be back in the house they were in the corridor outside it was an afterthought from the prime minister this fellow what sort of man is he a very brave man and intensely loyal to our country the director general saw the prime minister turn towards him puzzled who will die the victim of one horrendous mistake a spark of annoyance and then the prime minister no longer listened the meeting had run a little late the black car was waiting for the drive to the house of commons the director general and the pus were left in the corridor abandoned because the circus was on the move why didnt you say that during the meeting the pus asked no point carews beyond our reach the pus touched the director generals arm there was a rare uncertainty in his eyes that fellow we met sandham happens to people who climb without the proper equipment a very silly man sam perry stood by the window he looked out over his tended garden his wife sat in her usual chair where she would have done her sewing or her knitting where she would have watched television jack paced he couldnt have been still he owed it to his mother to talk to her couldnt have avoided the talk she stared all the time at the airline ticket that was on the arm of her chair she said that she had thought it was just stupid talk when he had told her he was going to south africa to bring his father home she said that she had thought that he was just being emotional sam hadnt spoken jack couldnt remember a time when sam perry had had nothing to say you cant bring him home can you no reason to tell his mother about the man who was a military commander of the umkonto we sizwe wing of the african national congress nor about the man who was expert in his knowledge of shaped and hollow charges nor about the man who had fallen to his death down a mountain in snowdonia its just silliness tell me it is and no reason to tell her about the man who lived in a cramped bedsit in north london who had a tail on him and who had to play the onoff game on the underground to throw the tail ill see him youll give jeez my love sam strode to the dark wood cabinet he poured hildas sherry into a whisky tumbler he poured jack a beer itll be all right mum i promise you that jack said he doubted she believed him she had no reason to she liked to say that her jack was a bad liar she muttered about sams and jacks dinner they watched her go towards the kitchen nursing her drink is there a chance ive no choice but to try jack said itll break your mothers heart if anything happens to you i cant leave him there for them to hang the proxy father gazed at him in many ways he regarded jack as his own achievement he thought his influence had given the young man his work ethic his straightness and his honesty he thought he had the right to be proud of the way his stepson had grown but the quiet authority and the bloodyminded determination they werent sams since he had met hilda when she was a bitter introverted young woman he had thought of jeez curwen as a right bastard the authority and the determination werent sams and they werent hildas they could only be jeez curwens hand down to his son the man could not be a right bastard not if this was his boy he understood that he and hilda could douse the boy with affection love he understood that jack must go to find his true father he was ashamed because he felt envy come home safe sam said hoarsely theyd picked up the scum when he left the flat to go for his drink piet used the pay telephone in the lounge bar erik stayed in the public bar to watch they wouldnt be thrown again the business in the underground still smarted with erik and the yelling hed had from the major no chances taken when the scum had gone to the pub erik walking behind the scum and piet on the far side of the road in case the subject spotted the tail and dived into the traffic for a quick jump on a bus the scum had been two hours in the pub sitting on his own nursing his drinks to make them last near to closing time when piet had gone to the telephone the warrant officer did as their major told them independent action was not their right erik watched duggie arkwright scum was a good word for the subject what did the scum know of south africa what did he know of the melting pot of the ethnic minorities that made up the republics population scum arkwright would think of all nonwhites as being the same the scum wouldnt consider that there were asian muslims and asian hindus and coloureds and then the groupings of africans tswana and xhosa and tsonga and swazi and zulu all the others chuck power at these groupings and there would be anarchy if the zulu had power over the xhosa or the swazi over the tswana the state president knew what he was at when he kept the brakes on which was more than the morons knew who shouted in london about oppression erik was at the bar leaning back naturally overlooking the scum he could never read piets face had to wait to be told what were the majors instructions shake the creature a bit says he has to know who the creature took to meet thiroko erik looked down at arkwright all skin and bone and wind erik had played open side flanker for transvaal b the scum would have no muscle and no balls if they shook the scum hed rattle arkwright walked home he had drunk four pints of worthington it was social security day he was feeling low feeling used hed put his bloody best bloody foot forward for priggy curwen and priggy curwen had gone off into the wind no thanks no call no bloody decency from priggy curwen and anthea was pregnant again first vomiting that morning he was thinking of priggy curwen and of anthea heaving in the john and with the beer inside him it was hard thinking he never looked behind they took him fifty yards from his door one from the front one from behind he thought he was being mugged which was a laugh last bloody penny for the last bloody pint down an alley no lights he smelled day old aftershave and day old body lotion and he knew he wasnt being mugged a punch in the solar plexus to double him an uppercut to straighten him he went down for a moment he saw them he knew they were south africans knew they were boer pigs something of the width of the shoulders the breadth of the hips the hands were coming down out of the blackness to pull him up he saw the pale blur of the faces grinning they reckoned he was insufficiently shaken he was never asked to say who was the young man that he had introduced to thiroko it was piets hand that groped for duggies beard to pull him up to hit him again the fingers found the beard duggie bit him closed his jaw on the hand and bit and shook his head as a terrier will with a rat bit and chewed at the hand and heard the boer pig scream and felt the fingers loose his beard and clung on while his teeth were half wrenched from his head piet heaved backwards and blocked eriks chance to get his boot into the scums rib cage duggie staggered and ran he ran towards the lights and safety of the main road he thought only of flight he heard the pounding feet behind him he ran up the alley across the pavement and into the path of a london transport double decker bus at the end of the alley erik gripped piets arm stopped him from going forward he held him back in the shadow erik could see the whiteshock face of the conductor of the bus as he knelt beside his front wheel he could hear the screams of a woman who had bent to look under the bus you should get some medication for that hand the scum might have rabies erik said jacks flight was delayed for fifty minutes because of the late departure sitting in the lounge he read the evening paper front to back he read of the death of douglas arkwright it was said that douglas arkwright married and one child had been drinking that he had walked under a bus the story made the paper because the traffic jam that followed the fatal accident had held up a royal princess on her way to open an art exhibition in hertfordshire when the flight was called jack dropped the newspaper into a rubbish bin and walked briskly towards the boarding gate and his aircraft jeez sat on the end of his bed he had eaten his porridge breakfast and given back his bowl and kept his mug he was allowed to keep his mug and use it for drinking water during the day he had washed and shaved under supervision he had swept out his cell not that there was much to sweep away because he had swept the cell floor every morning for the thirteen months that he had been in beverly hills after he had swept the floor he had scrubbed it with a stiff brush and the bar of rock solid green soap that was for the floor and for his body sweeping the floor and scrubbing it were the only workloads demanded of him no other work was compulsory for the condemns there was no singing that morning he sat on his bed because it was the only place he could sit when the floor was damp later in the day he sometimes sat on the floor and leaned his back against the wall that faced the cell door beside the lavatory pedestal but only for variety most of the day he sat or lay on his bed he read sporadically books from the library he had never been a big reader at spac he had learned to be without books if he was not reading then there was nothing but the time for thinking to disturb the events of his day which were his meals and his exercise session the thinking was hell difficult ever to stop thinking thinking when his eyes were open and when they were closed and when he was washing and when he was eating and thinking through dreams when he was asleep he hadnt had much of an education but there was no stupidity in him not until hed been hooked into driving the getaway out of pritchard jeez knew the days were sliding he knew the legal processes had been exhausted he knew his life rested on the state presidents decision he knew that the state president refused commutation of the death penalty to the cadres convicted of murder he knew that in these days of unrest the state president would hardly waive the penalty just because jeez was white here we go altobloodytogether we go jeez didnt have to have a university degree to know he wondered how much notice they would give him he wondered whether it would be the governor who would tell him he wondered how hed be some thoughts took charge in the night some in the day the overwhelming thought was the fear of fear the fear of buckling knees the fear of his bowels and his bladder emptying the fear of screaming or crying his thoughts of the team were increasingly rare when he had first come to beverly hills he had thought every day of the team he had been a part of then there had been the favourite thought an indulgent memory he had been flown back from greece after the exchange with two guards down the steps of one military aircraft marched across eighty paces head back elbows stiff outpaced the guards somebody signing something the rest lost in a blur up the steps into the raf transport mugs of hot tea laced with something by lennie and then what seemed like two days sleep before he had been met at northolt by colonel basil hed had his hand pumped and hed been whisked into the big black car hed expected that he would be booked straight into a medical examination hadnt reckoned with bloody good old colonel basil directly into london over the bridge down the ramp to the underground car park up the lift onto the th floor of century into east european balkan all of the team there all of them sliding up from their chairs and then henry clapping his hands over his head getting adrian going and lennie following and all of them giving jeez the big hand and adrian kissing him on both cheeks and then on the lips and the back slapping so hard that they half blew him away and colonel basil smirking by the door and saying in his brigade of guards whisper the team never forgets a man in the field the team always gets its men back one of the girls scurrying off for beakers and the champagne corks rocketing into the ceiling and jeez grinning like a cheshire cat and much later the car to a private clinic his favourite thought the good thoughts had faded with the months the thought of how the team would be working for him came only infrequently now usually when he was dreaming and when he woke and felt the cold dawn air then the thoughts of the team were bloody smashed it wasnt that he doubted that the team was working for him he doubted now that the team had the power to take him out from pretoria central he yearned for quiet outside his cell but the c section corridor and the small corridor through c section were never quiet in the daylight hours there were always the voices of the prison officers as they told stories laughed talked about the papers and the television there was always the shout of a duty officer approaching a locked door and the door clattering open and the smack of it closing those were the noises that were on top of the singing no singing that morning and that meant no hammer of the trap being tested in the afternoon each time he heard the shout for the doors to be opened and then the clatter and then the smack he stiffened and the sweat sprang to his forehead and his armpits and his groin there would be a shout and a clatter and a smack when they came to tell jeez that it was commutation or when they came to tell jeez which day it would be which dawn for the short walk he often thought of the others he hadnt seen the others for thirteen months not since the passing of the sentence and the drive in the meshed police wagon across pretoria and up the hill to the gaol he hadnt seen them since the apartheid of the reception area at beverly hills they had gone right to b section he had gone left to c section that was separate development for you four for b section because they were black jeez for c section because he was white theyd been laughing that day thirteen months before walking loosely easily in their leg irons and handcuffs he wondered how theyd be now waiting to learn if theyd all go a bastard that if one or two of them were reprieved and the others were taken to the hanging room wouldnt be a bastard theyd all five go because it had been a policeman hed meet them again in the preparation room there theyd be together apartheid waived separate development nonoperable there was a shout there was the clatter of a door opening there was the smack of a door closing still and upright on his bed jeez waited he knew all the distances that sound carried through the unseen parts of the gaol he had heard the door that was the entrance to the c section corridor there was a murmur of voices another door opening the door into c section the unchanging ritual he wondered why they always shouted their approach to a locked door why the door was invariably slammed behind them he felt the wetness on his skin he saw the flash of a face at the grille he stood at attention he stood every time a prison officer entered his cell a key turned in the oiled lock sergeant oosthuizen smiling benignly morning carew you slept well did you man your rooms a picture wish my lady kept our house like you keep your room youre going to have your exercise early straight after your lunch jeez closed his eyes all the shouting all the clattering of the doors all the slamming to tell him that he was to be exercised an hour earlier than was routine yes sergeant theres a nice afternoon for you youve a visit he was very slight with his crash helmet on jan van niekerk seemed almost misshapen there was something grotesque about such small shoulders capped by the gleaming bulge of the helmet the suzuki cc was his pride and joy for insurance purposes it was a moped but in jans mind it was a fullypowered scramblerroad machine he passed only cyclists and joggers he was forever being buffeted in the slipstream of overtaking lorries and cars but the suzuki was his freedom in term time he came each morning from his parents home in rosebank down the long straight oxford onto victoria and empire and then along jan smuts to the university of witwatersrand he loved the moped whatever its lack of speed because the underpowered suzuki provided him with the first real independence of his year old life his club foot his right foot was a deformity from birth he had endured a childhood of splints and physiotherapy he had had to be ferried in his mothers car to and from school he had never played rugby or cricket the wedge that was built into the raised heel of his leather ankle boot gave him a rolling limp and prevented him from walking any great distance before the moped he had been dependent on others along with the moped came a black leather twopiece riding suit the combination of his stunted physique and his taste for bikers gear made jan a student apart in the huge university he was virtually friendless and that bothered him not at all his friends were far divorced from the wits campus his own comrades he had his own contact codes he enjoyed a secret area of life that was undreamed of by his colleagues on the social sciences course in this society dominated by muscle power and sports skills where he could play no part his suzuki and his comrades gave him the purpose he craved his parents marvelled at the difference in their sons attitude since they had bought him the moped they thought of him as a good serious boy and one who showed no inclination towards the radicalism that they detested and that seemed so rife on the campus at home jan gave no sign of interest in politics they knew from their circle of friends who had kids at wits that their jan had no links with the students mostly jewish who led the university demonstrations and protests who were whipped by the police savaged by the security staff dogs jan had described those activists to his parents as ridiculous middle class kids with a guilt complex they knew jan had left the campus early on the day that dr piet koornhof minister of cooperation and development had been pelted and heckled on another day he had walked away from the burning of the republics flag and the waving of that rag of the african national congress his parents thought the making of jan had been his moped and his studies there was a white girl doing ten years in the womens prison at pretoria central she had been active in radical politics before devoting herself to the collecting of information for the anc impossible to make the switch from overt to covert work jan had always been covert anyone who knew him his parents his sister his lecturers the students he sat with in lectures would have been thunderstruck to have discovered that jan van niekerk was a courier for the umkonto we sizwe a harmless little figure on his bumblebee of a moped jan pulled into the campus parked behind the senate house he limped past the portico and columns at the front of the building across the wide paved walkway and down over the lawns he preferred to walk on grass easier and less jarring on his right foot he walked around the amphitheatre ignored the swimming pool and slogged his way up the steps to the modern concrete of the students union he saw the posters advertising the evening meeting to protest against police brutality on the eastern cape went right past them his greatest contempt was for the students who shouted against the government from the safety of the campus he believed that when those students had graduated they would turn their backs on decency and honour that they would buy their homes in the white suburbs and live out their lives with privilege stowed in their hip pockets crippled and forever awkward jan van niekerk would be there on the day of reckoning he believed that absolutely a day of reckoning a day of fire his struggle with his disability had tempered his steel strength of purpose that purpose was the cause of umkonto we sizwe on the first floor of the students union he had a metal locker opened by his personal key he had depressed the top of the door at the centre where it was weakest a full quarter of an inch the locker was where he kept his biking leathers and it was his dead letter drop four other men only in the sprawling mass of the city of johannesburg knew of jan van niekerks locker in these days of the state of emergency of the regulations justifying widened police power to be cautious was to stay free to be exceedingly careful was to avoid the interrogation cells of john vorster square he stripped off his leathers he unlocked the door the note was a tiny folded scrap of paper the corridor holding the bank of lockers was always crowded a concourse for students and lecturers and administration personnel and cleaning staff good and secure for a dead letter drop hidden by the open door he read the note as he packed his leathers into the locker about once every two weeks he was contacted a small link in a long chain there was much that jan van niekerk was unaware of a message from thiroko had been telephoned from london in numbered code to lusaka part of that message had been relayed on from lusaka to gaberone in botswana a smaller part of the message had been handcarried towards the international frontier and on by bus to lichtenberg from lichtenberg that smaller part had been telephoned to johannesburg he read the message he had the paper in the palm of his hand as he closed the lockers door he went to a lavatory and flushed the message away he had to hurry he was late for the mornings first lecture the aircraft lurched the engine pitch changed the captain announced the start of the descent around jack the south african nationals were crowding to the windows to look down excited gods own country was unfolding below them jacks mind was a blank too tired to think the stewardess was collecting the blankets and the headsets he felt as a small boy does sent alone for the first time on a train journey the fear of the unknown the stewardess took his earphones that he hadnt used and his blanket that he hadnt unfolded he drew his seatbelt tighter round his waist the fear was new to him he did not know how it should be conquered frikkie de kok had slept in hed hardly heard hermione leave her bed when shed gone to get the boys up and dressed and fed for school he was allowed his peace she was in a fine mood fine enough for her to have allowed frikkie in the night out of his own bed and into hers fine enough for her to bring him his breakfast once he had grunted coughed a bit cleared his throat he thought she was in so fine a mood that she wouldnt bother him if he smeared his marmalade on his sheets well he had capitulated to her he had promised that she would have her new refrigerator imported of course and since the rand had gone down and the foreign bankers had sold the south african currency short the refrigerator would cost him a small fortune not so small because his mind was working better because he was waking counting the cost and the tax but she was a good woman and she needed the new refrigerator with his breakfast of juice and coffee and thicksliced toast there was his mail frikkie de kok always opened all the family post himself a postcard from his sister and a bill from the electricity and there was a familiar brown envelope carrying the official stamp of the ministry of justice and there was a letter bearing the crest of the boys school he read the postcard snarled at the bill he opened the schools envelope brilliant the principal writing to say that dawies progress was excellent he was working hard and could well be university material hell there had never been a graduate in frikkies family calculations in his mind could he afford the weights that dawie hankered for if he could afford the weights as well as the refrigerator then he would be helping dawie towards a place on the fifteen and a boy on the school fifteen with good marks would be more likely for a scholarship when the university time came but if he bought dawie the weights if he could afford them would that make young erasmus jealous no no problem because erasmus could share the weights he would have to work harder work harder that was good he opened the letter from the ministry of justice the ministry always posted first and then telephoned two days later to confirm the notification of another early rising the judder as the undercarriage was lowered jack could see the ground below as the boeing banked for final approach row upon row of small squares reflecting back the sun t h e tower blocks of johannesburg were on the horizon he realised the squares were the tin roofs of tiny homes endless straight lines of light flashes and then the patch of yellow driedout veld between the townships and the city the chief steward was hurrying along the aisle steadying himself against the seatbacks checking that the seatbelts had been fastened and the cigarettes extinguished jack read through his answers on the blue foolscap sheet for immigration questions in english on one side afrikaans on the reverse occupation manager purpose of visit holiday length of stay weeks if he hadnt managed it in three weeks then he might as well have stayed at home they liked her in the office they thought ros van niekerk was one of the most conscientious girls that they employed they thought her sensible levelheaded and able to take the limited responsibility that could be pushed her way in the insurance high rise tower on commissioner she was twentyfour years old she was plain because she didnt care to be otherwise she worked in the property insurance department on most household policies there was reassessment as the policy became renewable at the end of a years cover ros van niekerk could have told the minister of finance where the economics of south africa were going it was in front of her from in the morning to in the afternoon five days a week three years earlier when she had gone into the property department a good bungalow in the better johannesburg suburbs would have fetched rand and been insured for that value the market had gone from bad to worse a year ago that same property might have changed hands for rand and now it might fetch rand it was that great a change the home owner wasnt going to renew a rand policy if his home would only fetch rand but the rates of insurance were going up the political uncertainty the unrest the quagmire of black and white relations guaranteed that insurance rates would rise for very nearly every policy that ros renewed there was a correspondence she was busy she rarely took more than twenty minutes of her lunch hour she alone knew her way through the hillocks of files that covered her desktop she used no lipstick no eye shadow she washed her auburn hair herself combed and brushed it from a central parting she dressed functionally and without ambition the men in the office the married and the unmarried had long ago lost interest in her she was not taken out she had been asked when she was a new girl and she had invariably declined and the invitations were no longer offered the salesmen and the junior managers were polite to her but distant if her social isolation in the company disturbed her then she was successful at disguising the disappointment to those who worked alongside her she seemed happily selfsufficient they knew she came from a good home that her father was a professional man they knew she had a younger brother at wits they knew very little else about her in truth there was very little else they might have known at the end of each day she went directly home in her beetle vw she had her dinner with her mother and father and her brother if he was back from the campus she listened to music and she read they might have thought of her as a boring girl who was on the road to end up an old maid the young men in the office had decided she wasnt worth the trouble there was easier game her telephone warbled a pay box call a frown of irritation at the interruption her brother on the telephone the irritation was gone her young kid her jan her crippled brother always so close brother and sister since he was little more than a baby she had loved the young kid perhaps a reaction to time long ago when she had seen the poorlydisguised dismay of her father that his only son was handicapped could ros tell her mother that jan would not be home lor dinner jan couldnt call his mother direct of course their mother was out at whist to ros her brother was a more precious part of her life than anything she thought she would find in the hands of the young men in the office a radio news bulletin on the hour the correct english diction of the south african broadcasting corporation one person was killed in unrest at a black township on the western cape a spokesman at the police directorate in pretoria said the black teenager was shot dead when a policemans relative fired into a crowd that was trying to set light to a policemans home a total of blacks were arrested during unrest in the east rand following incidents during which administration board vehicles and municipal buses were stoned in another incident of unrest in the east rand a white woman driving an administration board car fired in selfdefence on a mob that had stoned her no injuries were reported a pretty quiet night but since the state of emergency had been declared by the state president and since the curbs had been slapped on press reporting fewer details of attacks and incidents and deaths were furnished by the police directorate a quiet night and the unrest was far down the order of the bulletin the unrest came after a speech by the foreign minister ahead of the results of the springbok mens gymnastic team on tour in europe the message of the bulletin to its white audience was polished clear difficulties of course there were difficulties crisis of course there was no crisis inside the laager of the old wagons the republic was holding firm holding firm and holding tight that was the message of the sabc as the boeing from far away europe taxied on the long jan smuts runway jack came down the steep open steps onto the tarmac around him the passengers blinked in the crisp sunlight jack was tired nervy had to be nervous because he was going to walk up to immigration and make the pretence that he was a tourist with his head full of sea and sunshine and safaris he was part of a shuffling crocodile that moved past four black policemen immaculate and starched and into the terminal a young white policeman was seated by the doorway he was lounging back on a tilted straight chair he wore short drill trousers long socks to the knee shoes to see his face in a tunic and a sam browne belt onto which was hooked a shined brown leather revolver holster jack caught his eye looked away he thought there was an arrogance about the bastard a contempt for these unshaven crumpled flotsam spilling in from europe he took his place in the foreigners line it was brief and it was correct all that anxiety had been for nothing passport examined immigration form looked over the belt of the stamp on the slip of paper that was stapled into his passport his passport returned they had given him six weeks he had to grin he would be out in three weeks or he would be dead or he would be staying as a guest for twenty years he collected his bag was waved through customs and took a taxi he was driven away on a sweeping multilane highway he flopped in the back seat the tiredness was aching in his shoulders and legs the driver was middle aged white overweight beside his speedometer there was sellotaped a photograph of his family an obese woman and two plump children youre from england eh what brings you to south africa eh the driver ignored jacks silence dont get me wrong man ive nothing against you but thats where our problem is foreigners specially english foreigners people telling us what to do people who dont live here dont know a thing about south africa and all they can think of is telling us how to get on with our lives the english tell us thats rich thats a real joke the english tell us how to treat our blacks and theyve riots in birmingham and london what more do i have to say on either side of the road jack could see the effects of the months of drought high dried out grass then modern industrial estates sprinkled with the for sale and to let signs eh man we know our blacks a sight better than they do weve had years of them you know that what a black man respects is strength if you pussyfoot to the black man then hell cut your throat if youre firm with him then he behaves himself you have to be firm with the black man and you have to remember not to trust him not an inch what i say about the black man is this if he cant steal it or screw it then hell break it my sister shes on a farm up in the north east transvaal shes got a neighbour whos come from rhodesia started again started from nothing building up a new farm you know what her neighbour told her as gods my witness he said winnie if theres trouble just a hint of trouble first thing to do is to slot the nanny good advice because you cant trust the blacks the road was lined now with small concrete bungalows white homes perhaps the homes of taxi drivers higher up on the hill on sites that were scraped from the ochrered soil were the speculators town houses what they dont understand those people in england preaching to us is that the violence isnt about blacks and whites its black against black you didnt know that ill bet you should see what they do to each other theyre savages they chop each other burn each other and people in england say we should give them the vote most of them cant read they dont want the vote most of them just want to live quietly have their beer work on a farm they dont want politics and they dont want violence the blames with the agitators and the commies winding them up all the encouragement theyre getting from liberal places england america its doing nothing for the blacks ive a nephew in the police great young man in the antiterrorist unit uniformed he tells me its all the fault of agitators and commies theyre too soft on those anc people thats my criticism of the state president they should hang the lot of them shouldnt just hang those they get for murder like those swine that did the court they should hang any of them they find with guns and bombs are they going to hang them jack asked you know about them do you in your newspapers was it it was on the radio last night no clemency not for any of them all the liberals in england will be shouting when we hang them but were a long way from england and we dont hear the shouting you a rugby man eh thats the ellis stadium jack saw the huge terraces of concrete the rows of red seating my idea of heaven up in the west stand with a few beers and the boks in their green jerseys and even that those radicals have managed to spoil i had tickets for the all blacks last year i thought they had more guts in new zealand i didnt think theyd cancel on us here you are man your hotel jack slid out of the taxi he was bathed in sweat he paid the driver gave him a tip before he realised how much he loathed the man thank you very kind ive really enjoyed our conver sation you have a good holiday sir and you take my advice get yourself to the ellis park when the transvaal are playing there were grinning faces around him smiling faces of the black doorman and the suitcase boy he was led across the ornate hotel lobby past the jewellery and curio shops to the front desk he wondered what they would have to say about the supreme penalty and the pritchard five he filled in the registration form he reckoned that he was thirty miles from pretoria central prison as soon as he walked into the room jeez recognised the colonel sergeant oosthuizen had brought jeez from his cell to the visit he had known there was something extraordinary when they had walked on past the line of doors for c sections visit rooms and on into the administration block he had not been back in that block since his first day at beverly hills jeez stared from the door into the colonels face jeez had been through the spac labour camp and before that through the investigation centre in tirana only the thought of being hanged frightened him the sight of the colonel did not make him afraid the colonels empire was the interrogation floor of john vorster square police station in johannesburg on the tenth floor where he ruled the gaze of the colonel was reckoned to buckle a mans knees a black mans or a white mans to make water of his bowels the colonel never hit a prisoner he was always out of the room by the time that a prisoner was stripped was gasping was screaming the colonel ordered what happened to the prisoners the servants of his empire were the captains and the lieutenants and the warrant officers of the security police jeez knew the colonel an old acquaintance jeez had never given him anything each time that the colonel had come back into the interrogation rooms of john vorster square after the beating when the torturers were panting from their work jeez had stayed silent i hate you all you white bastard commies i want to kill you white filth i want to shoot you with my own gun jeez could remember the straining red blotched face as the colonel had shouted at him early in the days of john vorster square the colonel with his retinue of phonetappers searchers tailers letter openers frighteners had screamed at him through the spittle jeez reckoned hed given up early jeez reckoned the colonel had given up on this one prisoner when he had realised he was fighting a losing battle and he hated to be close to failure the colonel was jeezs visit the colonel and his warrant officer jeez knew the wo he had done time on jeez at john vorster square hand slaps and punches and twice the boot he had started in on jeez as soon as the colonel had gone back to his office jeez had heard in the basement cells of the pretoria court house when he was locked in with happy and charlie and percy and tom that it was the wo who had got percy talking first and tom second and then charlie and happy they had all been softened by the wo and then made their voluntary statements to the colonel they were in a senior officers room there was a glasstopped desk and comfortable chairs and vase of flowers on a shelf over the radiator and a photograph of the state president on the wall and curtains jeez hadnt known that such a room existed inside beverly hills the door closed behind him jeez looked round oosthuizen had gone he was alone with the colonel in his slacks and his blazer and the wo in his lightweight suit both sitting relaxed as if theyd enjoyed a good lunch i am a convicted prisoner sir jeez said firmly i do not have to submit to further police interrogation the colonel smiled bending the line of his snipped brush moustache who said anything about interrogation carew sir i would like to go back to my cell youre jumping the gun man im not here to ask questions he would have seemed a slight frail figure to them jeez thought that the wo would have dearly liked him to raise a fist to the colonel would have enjoyed beating the hell out of him we wanted to have a talk with you carew we wanted to see if we could be of help to you an old trick that jeez had taught himself in spac with the real bastards among the interrogators take away the uniform strip off the shirt and vest and socks and boots see them only in their underpants see a menacing man in his underwear see his hanging white belly and his spindly legs see him without the uniform that makes for fear creates authority his mind gave him the picture of the colonel in his underpants he stared back at the colonel eyes meeting neither man turning away has the governor seen you today carew no sir you havent been told of the state presidents decision regarding clemency for you no sir the colonel turned slowly to his warrant officer youd have thought carew would have been told with it on the radio and all that too right colonel they were winding him up jeez knew that turning the screw he stood his ground he listened to the silence in the room there would have been a conspiracy between the colonel and the governor news to be kept from carew in order that the condemned man might prove more pliable to the colonel of security police im very surprised that you havent been told carew he bit on his lip when a mans been here thirteen months waiting to know whether hes going to hang youd have thought hed be told which way its going for him youd have thought that colonel the echo from the warrant officer jeez imagined the hot sweating hair on the gut of the colonel and the pigbladder bulge of his belly the milk white matchstick legs you want to know what the state president has decided carew there was an ache of pain in jeezs lips he thought the skin must be near to breaking the colonels voice hardened you are an impertinent little swine carew and not for much longer you are going to hang carew thats the state presidents decision jeez felt the skin open there was the warmth of the trickle of blood heading for the point of his chin youre going to hang carew hang by the neck until you are dead you are going to hang through the due process of law you can be impertinent for two more weeks and then you hang he tried to see the men at century the men on his team he tried to find the image in his mind of when he had come back from the clinic and they had taken him down to the pub behind victoria railway station and made him pieeyed and made him talk about the conditions in spac they couldnt have acted the way they hung on his words lennie and adrian and henry the way the eyes of the youngsters theyd brought along shone with admiration what was the length of centurys bloody arm couldnt be true that the team couldnt reach him you have been an enigma to me carew ill admit to you that we know very little about you but look at the way youre standing man youre standing like a soldier i dont know which army i dont know when but youve been a soldier and served your country look at you today man you stand your ground because youve got guts but where i s having gut staking you t o the rope and anmarked grave carew there is nothing about you that i know of that gives me an idea of why you should be associated with black terrorism but it is that association that is going to hang you do you think those blacks of the anc care about you they care shit all for you they used you and they dropped you right in it you know carew there have been some protests in europe about these death sentences pretty pitiful protests and y o u r names not mentioned you know that all the talk is of zikala and schoba and ngoye and mweshtu youll hang and nobody care can i go back to my cell sir whatever t h e torment misery always address the interrogators w i t h courtesy courtesy brought a small victory over the bastards t h e bigger victory was never to plead he wanted the loneliness of his cell he wanted the anguish to be private he wanted to cry alone within the walls of his cell for help from his team i dont w a n t to see you hang carew it would give me no pleasure to have you hanged by the neck until you are dead i come here today with the offer that can save you from the executioner are you listening carew dont play the mister with me man t h e blood rolled from his chin onto his buttonless tunic o n your behalf carew i had a meeting with the minister of justice this morning i have made a bargain with him it was the colonels moment he took a sheet of headed paper from his pocket he unfolded it he waved it at jeez he laid it on his knee if even at this late stage you agree to cooperate fully with me to make a detailed and verifiable statement concerning every dealing you have had with the anc then the minister will go to the state president and get an order of clemency for you he heard the singing and then the trap and then the spurt of water and then the hammering and then the cough of the van engine a detailed statement carew personalities safe houses arms caches give us those and you get clemency that is the bargain here in writing jeez was rocking on the balls of his feet swaying as a sapling in light wind moisture bursting all over his body tickling fear at the nape of his neck make it easy for yourself carew help us to help you theres a good chap the anc doesnt give a damn for you its martyrs they want photographs of martyrs to drape round europe and america you owe them nothing man you owe it to yourself to cooperate with me are you going to be a good chap he was burdened with his secret he had never reneged on that secret not during the years in spac nor during the weeks in john vorster square nor during the months in pretoria central to renege on the secret was to believe that the team had abandoned him better to hang than to believe century had ditched him still the small kernel of hope whittled down the kernel said the team at century would never believe that jeez carew would betray his secret he turned on his heel it was a parade ground swivel he was facing the door youre putting the rope round your neck carew the colonel snarled the warrant officer shouted for oosthuizen still in his clothes his shoes kicked off onto the carpet jack slept beside him on the wide bed was a copy of star open at the page that reported the decision of the state president that five convicted terrorists should hang from his eighth floor window in the landdrost hotel jack curwen stared out over the city and beyond to the open ground he looked past the office towers and away across the pale yellow pyramids of goldmine waste he saw a modern city where less than a century before there had been only flat veld he had read the books in his hotel room and had to smile an australian one george harrison had come here in search of gold and stumbled on the main seam and been given his discoverers certificate and sold it for ten pounds it was all down to george harrison from oz all the towers all the wealth all the unrest and poor george harrison had disappeared with his ten pounds into the eastern transvaal never to be heard of again all that jack saw was built upon the discovery of george harrison poor sod loser waste heaps stretching to the south into the early morning haze mist the towers to the east and north the concrete streets to the west wherever he was george harrison he must be crying in his box he took the lift down to the lobby he had wondered if he would be contacted on his first afternoon first evening in the hotel he had lain on his bed sometimes reading sometimes asleep and waited he hadnt taken breakfast couldnt face a meal time to find the target on which he would prove himself he was crossing the lobby he heard his name called the indian day porter was coming from behind his counter you want a taxi mr curwen no thank you he saw the frown pucker the indians plump forehead im going to walk jack said be careful where you walk mr curwen some very bad things happen to tourists definitely no walking after four oclock mr curwen please not sir im just going to walk around the main streets anywhere sir it is better by taxi he had seen the printed slip on the desk in his room you are warned pickpockets have been known to assault tourists in central johannesburg he walked outside into a bright sunshine once he had turned the corner from the front of the hotel he lost the sun buildings too tall for the width of their streets into shadow into the grey of concrete buildings and cracked litterstrewn pavings where the grass sprouted a dirty city he passed two paintpeeling dowdyfronted escort agencies then on to bree street clothes shops and dismal coffee shops the few whites went on their way and hesitated not at all and the blacks leaned in the doorways tilted themselves against the lamp posts a beggar pleaded to him black squatting over a crippled left leg and jack flushed and hurried on the blacks seemed to watch him size him weigh him back into the sunlight he had come off jeppe and onto van brandis a square opened in front of him he felt the warmth of the sunlight safety from the loiterers he came past a high tower that gave way to a mock gothic front to a building of tall rectangular windows and entrance steps leading to a wide portico he saw the street sign ahead of him pritchard he looked back across open lawns to the doorway and saw the spider web of scaffolding obscuring the black scorched stone work he gazed at the rand supreme court he thought there must be a terrorist trial at the court too many police too many yellow police wagons parked on pritchard he looked at the policemen white and black some in denim blue overalls and forage caps some in trousers and tunics and caps he saw the way their holsters were slung from their webbing belts slapping their thighs there were high fire stains around the doorway he wondered where his father had sat in the van he wondered from which direction the four had approached with their bomb he saw some flowers lying at the side of the steps leading up to the court he wondered who in south africa would want to put out flowers all those months later for his father if he hanged bullshit bullshit because jeez curwen wasnt going to hang he was standing on the pavement beside the path to the front entrance a mercedes pulled up beside him a policeman saluted the chauffeur sprang out to open the passengers door jack watched the small and unremarkable man go slowly up the path between the lawns shrunken by age his suit now a size too large for him a judge going to work a judge like another judge a judge like the judge who had sentenced his father not enough of a target he heard a faraway siren he saw the police stiffen to alert then move to cordon the pavement to shepherd the drifting blacks back from the kerb a policeman standing in the junction of van brandis and pritchard beside his motorcycle had his arm raised to halt the oncoming vehicles leaving the road clear for the siren two cars coming fast and sandwiched between them a yellow van with tight mesh over the side window jack saw the blur of a black face he thought he saw the momentary image of a clenched fist couldnt be sure a black a dozen yards from jack roared out loud the one word amandla jack thought he heard an answer shout from the speeding van the convoy turned along the front of the court down the far side of the building a policeman black truncheon drawn stalked the man who had shouted he walked away he had said that maximum security was the breeding place for complacency but there was no complacency at the rand supreme court strong enough for a target but not jacks because he would fail he looked at his map he cut across pritchard and president and market he had gone from the sunlight he had returned to the gaudy world of fashion clothes and patent shoes a black man at a bus stop eyed him head to toe then turned his head and spat into the rubbish filled gutter he walked onto commissioner he stopped to stare into a gun shop window in the window were targets not rabbits nor squirrels nor pheasants nor duck the silhouettes were of men the size of men black men white background jack could buy himself a lifesize target of a black man to pump away at and it would cost him cents there was a poster on the outside of the shop door omar or yousuf or moosa latib offered the dunduff shooting range along with the slogan defence with an unknown firearm is meaningless nothing about game learn how to shoot a black man he went inside he had no reason to explore this shop but it fascinated him he had never used a firearm not even an air pistol on an empty tin he went down into the basement the customers were two deep and stretched the length of a long counter men and women all whites were handling pistols and revolvers in the front rank while those behind waited for them to make their choice pay their money get the hell out of the way there were two young men behind the counter no big deal for them that men and women all whites were crowded in their shop to buy pistols and revolvers for personal protection to blow away blacks such difficult choices to make between smith amp wesson and browning and beretta and colt and heckler amp koch and steyr and walther the men wanted to know about range and the women wanted to see whether it would slip in their handbag the men argued about cost because up to rand was a hell of a sum to pay for stopping a black man the women wanted to be shown mother of pearl in the weapons handle the counter men said the supplies were short that they didnt know when theyd be topping up on stock that was what they had jack saw they wore waist holsters filled strapped in their trousers belts he saw that no customer wanted more time to think about a purchase everyone ended up producing a firearms licence and writing a cheque jack spoke to the man standing in front of him queuing is it easy to get a licence not the year before last pretty simple last year dead easy this year he was a soft spoken man could have been a schoolmaster just a formality now you a visitor here if youve got a good property if youre a city centre trader if youre living on your own if you have to put your takings in a bank night safe if you have to go home regularly after dark thats just about everyone youre english yes i came out eleven years ago from westonsupermare you know that place im getting a gun for my wife shes nervous on her own weve a doberman but my wife says its too easy on blacks perhaps you should have stayed in westonsupermare jack said mildly i pay my taxes every last rand of them i pay for the police but the police are all out in the townships he was still talking as jack turned away he went out of the shop he pocketed his map he went west down commissioner he saw the building ahead of him it seemed to block his path far ahead he was going towards john vorster square he had read in the first clipping in the newspaper office library that his father had been taken to john vorster square thiroko had told him about john vorster square not really a square a wedge of ground between commissioner and main curtailed at the far end by the raised de villiers graaf motor link john vorster square was nothing more than a police station jack grinned to himself the toughest most feared police station in the country named after a prime minister and state president john vorster square was their power where the guns were where the uniforms were where the interrogation rooms were where the cells were where jeez had been held he couldnt know what had been done to his father in john vorster square he could remember what thiroko had told him rivers of pain the helicopter the screams if his father had been there why should it have been different for him john vorster square was the place for the proving target it was out of sight of the offices of the multinational corporations it was far from the tourist routes he thought it was where the real business of the state was done there was a central block of brilliant sky blue panels topped by layers of plateglass windows there were three wings he walked past the door that led into the charge office and then past the security check and the heavy metal turnstile he saw the armed police guard languid bored he walked round the back of the buildings where there were tended gardens and the wide sweep of a driveway for staff cars he saw the ten foot high railing fence and at the commissioner street end a long brick wall set with small barred windows he retraced his steps went around the building again seeming to have lost his way he would come back in the afternoon when he came back in the afternoon he would wear different clothes jan van niekerk carried out his instructions to the letter it was his way it was why he was useful to the umkonto we sizwe he had been given those instructions the previous evening he disliked being given jobs for the daytime daytime jobs broke the routine of his studies and he believed that his routine at wits was his best defence against suspicion in common with most white comrades he found it hard to consider the possibility of arrest arrest was what happened to black comrades the whites graduates were too bright to be caught out by the boer security police he rode his suzuki towards the alexandra township but before reaching it he turned north into the industrial estates of wynberg he found the rubbish heap where he had been told it would be close to the corner of th street and nd avenue there was a dirty plastic bag on the edge of the rubbish heap noone was in sight he picked it up twenty pounds more it was an effort for jan van niekerk he carried it to his moped he put his face close to look into the bag and sneezed the irritation welled in his nostrils the sneezing convulsed him he knew then that he carried explosives pepper was always strewn over explosives and between the wrappings of foil and plastic to throw the police dogs he put the package into two new shopping bags from the checkers store group first one tied it with string and then into the second he strapped it to the back seat of his moped he rode carefully avoiding the pot holes he knew nothing of the volatility of explosives and he presumed that if there were explosives then there would also be detonators he came back into johannesburg making for the landdrost hotel jack lay on his bed it was the smartest hotel hed ever booked into overnighting for d amp c would never be the same a soft knock at his door he sat up come in he thought it might be the maid to turn down his bed there was a second knock he padded across the room in his socks he recognised the bellboy your shopping sir very heavy sir he had it on his tongue to say there was no shopping to be delivered the heavy parcel was bending the kids shoulder he bit off the denial he gave the bellboy a tip he closed the door he carried the checkers bag to his bed laid it down he lifted out the second bag that was inside that stank he carried a chair to the door and lodged it under the doorknob he opened the window wider he opened the second bag he sneezed his head rocked back couldnt help himself he lifted the shopping bag into the bathroom and spread out yesterdays star on the floor and gently opened the black plastic he stripped off a cooking foil wrap the explosive was in three piles layer upon layer of half inch thick quarter pound slabs he could tell it was fresh the greasepaper on each slab was firm he thought it would be plaster gelatine couldnt tell from the print on the wraps the writing was in cyrillic he had liked thiroko but he hadnt known how much he trusted him i love you jacob thiroko listen to your radio wherever you are keep your finger on the tuner button keep following the news bulletins keep your ear to the seat mr thiroko there was a small jiffy bag cut off and the top stapled down to half size gently he pulled it open he found four small pinched bundles of cottonwool with sellotape binding he prised one open he extracted the gleaming detonator there were lengths of wire one roll would be the russianmade equivalent of cordtex and the other their own safety fuse from the thickness he thought he could tell which he could smell the explosive the sickly scent of almond sweets like the marzipan under the icing on his mothers christmas cake and on the cakes she made for his birthdays when there was just the two of them when she had been without a husband and he without a father he replaced each layer of wrapping as neatly as he could then brought out his underarm deodorant canister he sprayed over the package then opened the bathroom windows to let in the sounds of the traffic below to let out the scent of his spray and the scent of almonds he put the package into his suitcase locked it returned it to the bottom of the hanging cupboard jack sat on his bed and drew up a shopping list a grip bag a tenlitre can a roll of heavy adhesive tape a pair of washingup gloves a packet of volt torch batteries electrical flex a watch a litre of two stroke oil nine litres of petrol he had tidied his room he had sprayed again with his deodorant he had made up his mind he was on the road far on the road jack curwen went shopping on a sunny johannesburg afternoon an everyday afternoon at john vorster square the army of prisoners whiled away the hours in the half basement cells of the east wing some under investigation some in detention some criminal and some political the hard everyday afternoons were reserved for the politicals the criminals were just tsotsis the hooligans the thieves of the townships the criminals made only a slight impact on the smooth running of the states apparatus the politicals needed breaking putting in court locking away the politicals threatened the states apparatus bars dominated the east wing cell blocks bars across the windows bars across the corridors bars across the light wells a filthy place where the prisoner is dehumanised where he cannot believe that anyone cares about his fate a place where the grime of years coats the cell floors and walls where the graffiti is of despair since the state of emergency on the east rand the prisoners had been brought in their hundreds to john vorster square many blacks and a few whites the elderly and the schoolchildren the community workers and the trade unionists the revolutionaries and those registered by computer error or an informers malice on the police records better to be a robber of banks than to have publicly denounced as mere tinkering with apartheid the state presidents package of reforms better to have mugged the migrant workers in the shadows outside their township hostels when they have wages and are drunk than to have protested on the streets the right to vote the politicals were the targets of the security police working on the upper floors of the south wing of john vorster square pleasant offices airy and light behind the plate glass windows but in their interrogation rooms the air and the light could be cut with the dropping of blinds the security police at john vorster square were good at their work a white methodist priest once held in john vorster square had written afterwards of the decrepit docility of despair that cowed the blacks in the townships the policemen exploited that despair in the interrogation rooms they found little resilience in those they questioned even the comrades of the umkonto we sizwe condemned themselves in their statements given on the ioth floor happy zikala and charlie schoba and percy ngoye and tom mweshtu had made their statements here gathered the noose closer to their necks here all the whites those who talked and those who stayed silent those with the privilege of third level education those who were active in the cadres would speak of the expertise of the security police on the ioth floor most cracked jeez hadnt he was a rare exception and jeez was now little more than a faded statistic in the handwritten ledgers of john vorster square remembered only by a very few the colonel was principal amongst the few the instruments of his power were the terrorism act no with a minimum sentence of five years and a maximum of death the general law amendment act no section also five years to death the internal security act no giving the power of preventive detention and banning orders there were not many prisoners politicals who did not feel the sliding bowel weakness and the tickle of terror when they stood in the presence of the colonel he would have described himself as a patriot he would have said that every action he undertook in john vorster square was for the benefit of his beloved south africa he would have said that he stood in the front line of the battle against the contagion of communism and the drift to anarchy on that everyday afternoon the colonel watched with grudging satisfaction as a full time clerk of fosatu made a voluntary statement small beer a coloured an insignificant creature admitting to handing out leaflets demanding the release of political prisoners with the vermins own guilt tied down the work might begin of extracting information from him on more senior members of the federation of south african trade unions he would be charged under the terrorism act they could do for the clerk under activities likely to endanger the maintenance of law and order or they could do for him under activities likely to cause embarrassment to the administration of the affairs of state they had him by the throat they had his confession and now they could bargain the length of his sentence against the incrimination of the leaders of fosatu it was the leaders that the colonel wanted not this rodent the clerk sat at the table and dictated a stuttering statement to a white corporal he was watched by the colonel who stood in the doorway the journey to pretoria was a sore in the colonels mind he did not comprehend how a white preferred to hang rather than to come clean about the blacks with whom he had collaborated the visit to beverly hills had been a failure he would happily have hanged james carew himself to have expurgated that failure he was no fool he could rationalise his failure he supposed that he had failed with carew because he was unaccustomed to interrogating white politicals one or two a year came into his domain on the top floors of john vorster square some he categorised as dedicated communists some were gripped with the martyr wish some he regarded as mentally deranged some were all three all of them he thought stupid to suffer in the cause of black freedom was idiotic carew was outside his categories a mystery he thought he hated the man which was why in this same room he had lost his temper shouted there was no further reason for the colonel to stay and watch the clerk he went back to his own office the sun was dipping between the mine waste mountains to the west far below him were the gaudy street lights and the ribbons of the headlamps of the homegoing traffic there was a sheaf of telex messages on his deak there was a photocopy of a report from major swart in london the colonel thought that pretoria overrated swart darkness was falling on the city he gutted swarts telex more failure buck passing and excuses failure to make the connection between mrs hilda perry and james carew failure to link one douglas arkwright deceased on a contact between a white male unidentified and jacob thiroko failure to maintain a tail on jacob thiroko categorised totally incompetent that swart the one and only link to carews earlier life and swart had failed to make anything of it the report was soon pushed aside categorised not useful back in the tray beneath less intractable problems the piece of paper that had failed that he had reckoned a guarantee of success the piece of paper that carried the ministers signature lay in the colonels personal safe he would shred it on the morning of the execution that failure would die with carew but failure it was at the heart of the failure was the void that was carews past exacerbated by the mans refusal to talk the bachelor apartment in hillbrow had been searched and searched again and revealed not a clue to the past the drivers on the taxi ranks had been quizzed interrogated even and found to know nothing significant about the man at all the bombing team had all said in their statements that they had never seen the man before he drove them away from pritchard the void spirited up the colonels suspicions no man could so effectively hide his past unless he had deliberately hidden it had a very good reason for hiding it he consumed the paperwork on his desk he had promised his wife that he would not be late home he had waited until the bus load of tourists filled the hotel lobby with their stacks of suitcases he had taken the lift down twice before holding the grip bag sagging close against his knee and each time the lobby had been almost empty and he would have been noticed by the night porter and the bellboy and the luggage boys and the doorman twice he had gone back to his room to while away the minutes before trying again very tense close in his thoughts all his concentration was on the hulk that was john vorster square and the fence around it and the lights and the armed police sentries and on his father and on suppressing his fear the plan called for him to expose himself to challenge and gunfire he knew of no other way he stepped into the lobby the lift doors shut behind him the bellboys and the luggage boys were marshalling a huge pile of suitcases the doorman was loudly supervising their distribution the reception was lost in a half moon of argument because there was a double booking problem the night porter was doling out keys to those who had been checked in and who had allocated rooms they were americans fresh f r o m safari jack crossed the lobby unnoticed unseen he went out through the swing doors behind him rose a tumult of angry voices dark streets streets given up by the whites the whites were powering home to the suburbs in their bmws and jaguars jack walked with a brisk purpose he stayed far out on the pavement close to the kerb and the cars lights avoiding the shadowed shop entrances from which spurted the flash of a match the glow of a drawn cigarette there was no reason that he should have attracted attention he was a young white who was late hurrying with a bag that might contain his sports kit whose weight he struggled to disguise he took the route that he knew down van brandis right onto commissioner above him the lights were flickering out in the towers the last workers leaving the security guards with their polished staves patrolled the wide entrances jack saw the lights in john vorster square an oasis of work as the rest of the city shut down for the night he took from the bag a rough stone picked from a street building site on commissioner the stone gripped in his left hand the size of a cricket ball at school in the team theyd played him for his fielding he could certainly throw the stone was now his weapon and his protection there was a constable guarding the back gate a presentable young man straightbacked cleanshaven and he wore his uniform and his sam browne well he was often given the pm to pm shift on the rear entrance because his sergeant thought him the right sort of constable to open and close the gates on the comings and goings of the top brass the constable sat in his box his service revolver was holstered the flap buttoned down because that was tidier in the box was a loaded fn rifle safety on a gas mask a telephone link to the operations room inside and his personal radio he saw the car approach he saw the lights flash and the indicator wink to him he saw the uniform of the driver and the uniforms of the passengers behind him he heard the revving of an engine outside the gates and he heard the shout for the gates to be opened the constable had a car to let in and a car to let out he went forward he slipped the bolt that was accessible only from the inside he swung the near gate back towards him pushed away the further gate he had to step back smartly to avoid the car coming from the outside from main street there was a moment when he was back at the edge of the driveway readying himself to salute and the gates were fully opened and the cars were jockeying to pass through there was a moment when he did not think to study the shadows across the road he only saw the blur of a man running he saw the figure coming fast across the road he saw the lowslung bag trailing from the figures arm he stepped forward picking at the flap of his holster he hesitated he turned back for his rifle whichever way he looked he was dazzled by the headlights the figure ran past him on the far side of the incoming car the constable was rooted to the concrete floor of his sentry box the figure charged to the main doorway pushed it swung the bag inside the constable saw the bag sailing into the rectangle of light and lost sight of it he was spinning trying to get the lights from his eyes he saw the figure for a moment more seeming to fill the doorway into the hallway area he reached again for his holster then for his rifle then for his radio then for his telephone link the constable had never before confronted an emergency and nothing had ever happened at the back gates of john vorster square and the bastards in the car hadnt reacted he saw the shadowy shape of the figure turn and run back from the doorway he hadnt the flap off his holster nor the rifle in his hand nor was he reaching for his radio nor had he lifted his telephone everything too fast for the constable the figure running to get by the car that was coming out the driver of the car that was entering seeing a figure no longer in shadow bright in the headlights swung the wheel to block the figure run the figure down the figure stumbling to a stop backing away into the courtyard trapped an anorak hood over the figures upper head and a handkerchief knotted over the figures lower face and a dark slash where the eyes would be so fast too fast the arm of the figure swinging back whipping forward the crack of the windscreen like a bullet snap the constable saw the windscreen freeze shatter to opaque the incoming car swerving the outgoing car turning away from collision he yelled not into his radio not into his telephone out into the night air bomb the presentable young constable ran from his box the outgoing car careered from a sideon collision towards him he was blinded by the lights he ran for his life and behind him his sentry box was taken down by the impact of the outgoing cars radiator and engine weight squashed away through the shrubs flattened against the low wall and the high railings there was the thud of running feet he saw the figure come down the driveway skip past the incoming car he had the flap off his holster now he had the pistol butt in his hand lifting the figure gone out into the street the pistol was in his hand his thumb had taken across the safety he had the running figure seen between the railings over the end of his barrel steady squeeze the constable was bowled over by the blast that erupted from behind the plate glass of the hallway area and with the driven wind came the glass shards and then the crimson and orange billowing of the flames before he lost conscious ness he was aware of the glass splinters fragmenting around him and of the heat of the spreading fire jack ran two hundred yards he had pulled the handkerchief off his face tugged the anorak hood down from his head up main cars overtaking him up market into the narrow side street off becker noone in sight off with the anorak dump it a distant siren along the lanes off diagonal two men sitting their backs against the wall neither moved past the closed stock exchange onto bree he was walking when he reached bree he controlled his speed harder to control his breathing he tried to window shop to appear to be strolling away the evening two police trucks racing sirens wailing and the whine in the streets around him of approaching fire engines from the far side of bree he looked back towards john vorster square a bloody lunatic plan he saw the orange glow reaching for the night sky he saw the dark climbing column of smoke can you see that mr thiroko he walked along bree towards the landdrost hotel he straightened his tie in a window he casually wiped the sweat off his forehead he knelt to wipe the earth from the gardens of john vorster square off his shoes the last hundred yards forcing himself not to look back he steadied himself and went inside he stood in the lift with his back to a cluster of tourists he went down his corridor into his room he went first to the cupboard he saw that the packaged pile of explosives was undisturbed of the three slabs that had been delivered in the checkers bags two were still inside his suitcase he might have failed but now he thought he had enough dynamite still to blow his way into the hanging gaol jack dived onto his bed his face was buried in his pillow his legs shook without control god what had he done for his father what had he done just before eight oclock jack joined the office workers and the labourers and the vagrants at the junction of market and main and commissioner to see the damage police with dogs and soldiers in full combat kit kept the watchers far back from the fire darkened building there was little to see but that was no discouragement to the crowd jack had already seen his morning citizen with the special colour front page the main photograph showed the orange flame ball alive inside the ground and first floor billowing up the stairwell he had read of the miraculous escape of the policeman on desk duty inside the door how the heavy steelpanelled furniture had protected him from the immediate force of the fire and explosive blast he had read that the offices above the hallway had been unoccupied that had they not been the officers who worked there would have been killed when the floor above the hallway caved in he had read that the steel and concrete construction of the block had prevented the spread of the fire and that within minutes the fire service had brought the blaze under control he had read that a single man was believed responsible that there were reports that the man was a white that the police were keeping an open mind the smell of a watersoaked fire is unlike any other it was a familiar odour for jack to sniff at as he stood with the crowd and he thought of george hawkins pictured him beside him remembered the demolition of a fire wrecked office in guildford and seemed to hear georges growl of approval the newspaper said it had been the most dramatic attack against the countrys security system since the car bombing of the air force headquarters in pretoria and the rocket firing at the voor trekkerhoogte base of the south african defence forces all down to you mr hawkins he listened to the talk around him mostly in english a little in the afrikaans language that he could not understand all of it angry he took a last look at his work and at the fire engines far up the street and the police wagons it was the controlled anger on the policemens faces that would stay with him you know what i heard a man with a loud voice said a florid face and a butchers apron i heard that last the bandiete in the cells over there were shouting and singing all the bastard politicals cheering they were pity the scum didnt roast john vorster square still stood foursquare but he had shown them he had singed its beard he walked down commissioner to the junction of harrison another thought as he walked there had been blacks among the sightseers and he had not heard them speak above a whisper he had heard the vengeful fury of the whites but he knew nothing of the blacks whether cheered his attack whether they feared the reprisals that would follow the violence he had directed against the principal police station in the city he thought that in the world of jack curwen the black mans opinion was irrelevanttheir fight was not his fight his fight was family he took a taxi to the railway station the colonel sat in on the conference he was not himself responsible for the direct gathering of intelligence many times intelligence knew of an impending attack not the exact location nor the timing but intelligence generally knew of a major infiltration of the movement of explosives of an order from gaberone or lusaka intelligence had sources there were covert watchers small teams of recce commando operating deep inside angola observing the umkonto we sizwe camps listening to their radios hooked into remote telephone lines that served those camps there were deep sleepers in the overseas offices of the african national congress there were traitors arrested in great secrecy interrogated frightened turned released there were men and women inside south africa who were under constant surveillance their names having been first revealed to intelligence by the sadf capture of documents from anc offices in gaberone a treasure chest intelligence had this time had no word the conference was boring the colonel for a while he endured in silence then intervened was it a white or was it not a white he could not be given an answer the vehicle drivers had said they had seen the shape of a man momentarily in the lights nothing else the gate sentry had been the only continuous eyewitness to the attack the gate sentry had been concussed was still sedated the colonel was told that the gate sentry had rambled a description between reviving from concussion and being given sedation a hood a mask eyes in shadow always moving too fast i think he was a white the colonel said if he had been black then there would have been a fire support team i think it was a white working alone he ran away there is no report of a pickup vehicle if this had been anc then there would most certainly have been a pickup this one man one white man is at best no more than on the fringe of the anc it is now more than thirteen hours since the explosion and lusaka has said nothing how many times do they wait thirteen hours by the news agencies they would have known of the explosion within thirteen minutes and they have still said nothing i believe they have made no claim because they do not know who is responsible i suggest this is the work of an individual not of a cadre of umkonto we sizwe gentlemen we have a white we have a male he ran forward fast he threw a bag or sack weighing perhaps five kilos he threw a fistsized stone accurately through a windscreen in my submission we have a white male who is athletic reasonable to assume that he is aged between years and years we should meet again when we have the forensics the fire service had moved back from the hallway of the building detectives and scientists moved amongst the sodden debris searching and picking what they had collected in this initial examination was placed in metal bins to be sifted and then carried to the laboratories a slow process one that no detective experienced in this work nor any scientist would rush jack went to the whites only ticket office he bought a day return ticket to pretoria he went down the whites only entrance to the whites only section of the platform alongside which would stop the whites only carriages once the train had cleared the industrial and mining areas of germiston and edenvale and kempton park it should have been a pleasant and picturesque journey past the factories and the gold waste mountains the train ran by the dry farm lands of the witwatersrand but jack curwen was not a tourist he was an unidentified terrorist he was on a journey to the city where his father was held condemned to die he thought it better to travel by train no driving licence to be produced no forms to be filled in at avis or hertz in a train he was a lone microbe swimming in the vein of the state he was in the heart kingdom of the afrikaner regime he was passing through the pretty satellite towns of irene and doornkloof and verwoerdburg rolling by the johannesburg highway and the fountain valley nature reserve and the massive modern university of south africa he was coming to pretoria he was coming to his father a moment of confusion when he stepped down from the train which way to go streams of men and women white and black crossing the platform around him confusion until he realised that the blacks went left the whites went straight ahead separate development for leaving a railway station he went through the whites only exit and out into the whites only hallway of the station his ticket had been clipped by a white official he knew the cause of his confusion his was a fear of going through the wrong exit sitting on the wrong seat urinating in the wrong lavatory and being shouted at called back by a man in uniform there were uniforms all around him in the hallway soldiers with the berets of the parabats and of armour and of artillery and of the medics scrubbed clean conscripts who were serving out their army time in administration in the capital city haggard young men changing trains on their way home for leave from the operational areas of south west africa and the fearsome close quarters of guerrilla war the airforce technicians of the mirage squadron at hoedspruit the bearded and confident elite of the recce commando jack eased his way through them he was so very close to his destination he went into the station magazine and sweet shop he bought a map of pretoria his finger nail searched for and found potgieterstraat he memorised the turns the roads he would follow he folded the map stowed it away in his hip pocket he would not be seen on potgieterstraat studying a map he went out of the station pretoria was higher on the veld than johannesburg cooler and the first frosts were not long away he ignored the taxis he would walk he could see more by walking he went past the booths where blacks could buy their railway tickets then out of the station yard he went past the combi vans that ferried blacks between the station and the townships of mamelodi or atteridgeville by the small street market where fruit and milk was sold and vegetables he could sense the difference to johannesburg he felt a little at ease walking here because there seemed no threat no scowling eyes gazing at him he walked past the big dairy and there the pavement ended as if whites territory was bounded by pavements he crossed coarse open ground potgieterstraat was ahead of him so very close to the road he had taken when his mind was made under the old railway bridge of darkened steel and cut stone potgieterstraat stretched away up the hill far in front of him across the road was a high slag yellow brick wall he was within sight of pretoria central of the local gaol of the pretoria central complex hell and his gut was tight and his legs were jellied he was the insect brought to a night light the wall was the colour of the mine mountains in johannesburg pristine dirty yellow and new he walked up the hill he was again on a pavement sometimes he looked to his left where there was nothing for him to see sometimes he looked straight ahead at the tilt of potgieterstraat he pleaded with himself for naturalness he was on foot alone and approaching one of the most security conscious square miles of the state if he were to be challenged he had no story jack curwen had sneered at jacob thiroko he had told his mother that he was going to bring his father home and he had planned bomb making with george hawkins and because of his hot headed nature and his arrogance sandham was dead and duggie arkwright was dead lunacy and arrogance had carried him on the wing to potgieterstraat and thank god that sandham and duggie couldnt see him with jelly legs and his tight gut as he flickered his eyes forward to the high yellow brick walls of local he looked right he had seen on the map that he would pass what was labelled as dhq couldnt believe i t dhq he was walking past the defence headquarters of the republic the bastards had built pretoria central up the hill same side of the road spitting distance rifle range distance from the defence headquarters of south africa throwback to the days of empire stone pillars holding the portico weathered red brick barred windows creeperdraped railings topped with coils of barbed wire eyes moving from the nothingness of scrub and railway sidings to his left on to potgieterstraat and the walls that grew in height as he came closer on back to the formal gardens of defence headquarters where the sentries patrolled with magazines fitted to their assault rifles duggie and sandham were dead and jack hadnt even known that dhq was right alongside his target all the sentries and all the backup that would be out of sight but there in support of defence headquarters the excitement seeped from him the building next to defence headquarters sandwiched between dhq and local was that of the south african airforce more wire more sentries thiroko had said it was impossible across the road from him was local he stopped and bent down to flick his shoe lace undone it took him several seconds to retie the lace he looked down the side street that ran under the wall of local he stared down soetdoringstraat while his fingers fumbled to make the knot immediately across potgieterstraat at the top of the angle of the local walls was a jutting fire position there were dark slits jack couldnt know whether he was observed the main gatehouse of local was down soetdoringstraat covered by another fire position at the end of the local wall on soetdoringstraat he saw the lowered barrier of a check point the walls of local were thirty feet high local was covered by enfilading gun positions and local was only the gaol for the shortterm black criminals further down soetdoringstraat past the checkpoint was the gaol for white politicals and away and hidden from the road were the old pretoria central and the womens gaol and further away and further hidden was pretoria maximum security at that moment jack curwen would have believed jacob thiroko he stood he tried to resume a casual walk and the walk was dragged and slow he went on up potgieterstraat over the height of the local wall he could see the top floor cell windows of five blocks there were clothes hanging from some of the windows underpants and socks and shirts and once he saw the face of a black who gazed out into the bright morning light a terrible quiet about the place difficult for him to realise that hundreds of men were held behind that wall that they made no sound at the end of the local wall the brickwork gave way to a mesh wire fence that stood between the road and tropical gardens and then the wildness of high trees climbing over a steep hillside he knew from his map that the hill was magasyn kopje he knew that beverly hills was set back on the slopes of magazine hill behind the trees out of sight were the walls of beverly hills a daft fantasy in jacks mind if he yelled his father would hear him he reckoned he must be within eight hundred yards of the cell blocks of beverly hills and he had seen high walls and gun positions and sentries with assault rifles the fantasy slumped he was eight hundred yards from his father but he might as well have been in churchill close and five and a half thousand miles away despair hurrying after the fantasy he thought there was nothing more for him to see on potgieterstraat despair because he thought the bomb in john vorster square was for nothing jack retraced his steps he came briskly down the hill he snatched one glance down soetdoringstraat he saw the checkpoint barrier rising and a car coming out leaving the cocoon of wire and walls and fields of fire he looked away on down the hill back towards the ordinariness of pretoria the car that had come through the checkpoint sped past him he went back towards the railway bridge he felt he had turned his back on his father because he had been intimidated by the walls of local that he had seen and the walls of beverly hills that the trees obscured he took the first train back to johannesburg jacob thiroko had heard the news of the john vorster square bomb on the radio in the morning he was astounded he had thought in terms of an unguarded civil administration building a noisy gesture simply john vorster square was something else he had heard on the radio that the attacker had picked his moment to charge through an opened gate hurl his bomb and then escape under the nose of an armed sentry an attack with the spontaneity of passion nothing that was cold and predetermined thiroko recognised the extent of the danger the most feared soldier was the man who was prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice thiroko thought that he had gambled hugely on carews son and the boy had repaid him by throwing a bomb into the most hated institution on the whole of the east transvaal the radio had said that long into the night there had been crowds on the streets of soweto cheering the success of the attack jeering at the police in their casspirs who had come to disperse them with gas and bird shot the indian owner of the safe house had long since gone about his business of selling motor car accessories when thiroko came down stairs in the kitchen he ate a slice of toast and drank strong coffee prepared for him by the indians wife he ate increasingly littje easier not to eat his suitcase was packed his room ready for another guest he said his goodbyes to the indians wife and left her home and walked slowly with his suitcase to the finchley central underground station for the first time since he had arrived in london he journeyed to the offices of the african national congress a terraced house in a side street off the pentonville road a heavy green door beside windows covered with close mesh that was proof against fire bombs he endured the back slapping greeting of the london comrades blacks and indians and whites he elbowed his way with little grace through the earnest congratulations of those who fought the regime from trenches that were separated from the battlefield by thirteen hours flying a small few he trusted a great many he regarded with contempt thiroko was a military man these were the pamphleteers and the speakers at fringe meetings and the dreamers who said that the total revolution was at hand and that power was at the corner to be grasped thiroko was at home in the training camps of northern angola or with the young people of the solomon mahlangu school in tanzania or with the fighters when they retired across the botswana border to rest up in black africa he thought they were all communists in the london office they were the men and women with whom he hardly cared to pass the day there was one man in the terraced house with whom he would have entrusted his life a man who was old a skinny tent pole with a pebble rolling accent of hungary a man they all called magyar and who had spent fourteen years in the regimes gaols and served his time to the last day without an hour of his sentence remitted before travelling to london and exile a pale pinchfaced man with a whispered voice who had never been heard to boast of his commitment to the movement a man who had made his sacrifice and expected no praise for himself this one man he would trust thiroko handed his plane ticket to lusaka to a young white who he thought was at heart a boer because he wore jogging shoes and a tracksuit and cut his hair as if he were a conscript in the sadf he asked to be booked on the evenings flight home he took magyar to a small room and when they had sat down amongst the cardboard cartons of anc literature that were expensively printed but not distributed he turned up the volume of a cassette radio thiroko took few chances he had no right to take chances not with the safety of a young man who was prepared to run inside the john vorster square perimeter with a homemade bomb magyar wouldnt ask him so thiroko gave the information the hungarian had been in the movement from the early days of the dive underground at the time of the banning of the african national congress he had stood in the same dock six years after it had held nelson mandela and sisulu and mbeki and mhlaba and motsoaledi and kathrada and denis goldberg and mlangeni and now in his th year he was hardly listened to by the members of the london office he pushed paper and he drafted press releases that would be rewritten he was the one for thiroko to talk with thiroko told magyar that the attack on john vorster square was the work of a single committed individual supplied by the agencies of umkonto we sizwe he saw the quiet pleasure on the wrinkled face thiroko knew what the security police had inflicted on the old man their voices were low against the barrage of the music you were in the maximum security section of pretoria central what we called beverly hills the hanging gaol yes for how long were you there there was a group of us white politicals we were there for two years and eight months from to we were there it was after jenkin and lee and moumbaris escaped from the white political section that all of the rest of us were taken up the hill while they rebuilt our former place such an escape is only possible once of course from the new gaol for politicals it would not be possible from beverly hills magyar smiled sadly his mind was taken far back nothing is possible from beverly hills before our time a white condemn franz von staden escaped he was at exercise and the wall of the exercise yard was not as high as it is now and in those days it had no grille he saw his chance took it and then he went to the station and a policeman who was not on duty saw him and remembered his face they took him back and they hanged him now nothing is possible from beverly hills from the outside magyar shrugged what is on the outside comrade jacob what do i know of the outside i was brought to the gaol in a closed van with slit windows i saw some trees i saw some houses for the prison staff i saw their selfservice store but i have no detail it is the same inside i lived in the gaol for months i was in c section i can tell you about each inch of the floor of c section not of c section not of c section i would have to imagine that c section and c section are the same as our section i can tell you nothing of b section nor of a section where the blacks are there are gardens inside the outer wall that come up to the sections i saw those gardens when i went inside and when i left you are there a long time and you know very little it was the same for all of us who were there it is not a place that i care to remember thiroko was hunched towards him for me i want you to try to remember for more than an hour the radio played light music and a disc jockey doodled away his time in a london studio the old man covered a dozen sheets of foolscap paper with his drawings at the moment of his arrest he had been an architects draughtsman in cape town he drew a plan as best he knew it of the square mile to the west of potgieterstraat a square mile that encompassed defence headquarters to pretoria central to magazine hill he drew a plan of the whole of beverly hills cursing the gaps in his knowledge he drew c section he drew c section i he drew an individual cell he drew a cell in relation to the catwalk above the linking corridor he drew the corridor of c section i and the catwalk he drew the exercise yard of c section i and after that he drew a top view plan to show the positioning of the metal grid over the yard and of the supporting beams he drew the visit rooms he drew the gallows shed as it had been described to him last he drew the airlock entry through the outer wall he said drily under the prisons act i could get ten years for drawing you such plans should i be returning to south africa thiroko accepted no time for banter firearms there is an armoury in the administration block where they keep hand guns machine guns grenade launchers there are guns available at all times in the gatehouse and at the reception at the entrance to administration there are guns on the watch tower that is set onto the highest wall on the hillside where the sentry can overlook the whole of the compound the men on the catwalks have fn s or lee enfields they are issued with six rounds for a duty no one carries a gun if they are in contact with prisoners what is the closest guard to the condemns i cannot tell you about b section and a section over c section there is the armed guard on the catwalk through the windows he can look down into each cell in addition there is one guard not armed who is locked for the night into the individual corridors of c section i and and each of those men has a telephone line to the control in the gatehouse magyar looked up to see the fighting concentration in thirokos eyes comrade i do not think you can go to any of the others of us who were there and find more one mans experience is the same as every mans i have forgotten nothing that i knew you cannot break out you cannot break in thiroko said last night a man broke into john vorster square again the sad smile as if it was a disappointment to the old man that he played the bearer of bad news john vorster square has public roads on all sides go east from beverly hills you have half a mile before you get to potgieterstraat all a control area go south and you are climbing magazine hill which is within the prison complex go west you have a rifle range for the military and then you have the police training college and then you have the police dog centre go north you are into defence headquarters and the air force command bunker there is not just a high railing you cannot break in nor out of beverly hills is it because five comrades will hang a defiance in thiroko an echo in his words from a park bench it is not right that we should do nothing sentiment from you comrade jacob there was one amongst the white politicals serving with me serving longer than i he used to say why dont they hurry up with their bloody revolution get us out of here i tell you every man in beverly hills political or criminal yearns by the candle of hope for freedom that is what i know comrade there are five of our men in there who are going to hang and they have no hope thiroko put the drawings into his briefcase if you hold the candle of hope for them then that is wonderful the old man said their farewells were curtly made thiroko switched off the radio he went out of the room he was given his ticket it had been taken to the zambian airlines office in piccadilly and endorsed for that nights flight he was photographed when he left the green painted front door as he had been when he had entered the cameraman freelanced for the special branch and operated from the metropolitan police offices on the opposite side of the street thiroko would have expected to be photographed he didnt care he had curtailed his visit to london he was going home with the pain in his stomach and when he got there he was going to provide the support that an extraordinary young man had asked of him jeez knew of the bomb the sentries changing duty on the catwalk would have been disciplined up before the governor if it had been known that they had let slip such a nugget of information jeez had heard them talking it seemed a small matter what seemed a big matter was that sergeant oosthuizen had informed him that his solicitor was driving from johannesburg the next day to see him he thought the days were sliding fast each day shorter he thought his time was bloody racing george hawkins was driving to inspect a chimney when he heard the one oclock news he was preoccupied with the chimney because he was certain it would be difficult the chimney was feet high and to bring it down he required an additional feet of clearance on the fall line it was a builtup area of hackney and the oaf who had telephoned him hadnt known whether there was feet clear he was going to see for himself and he was going to charge them for his time whether or not he agreed to do the demolition johannesburgs central police station stone the bleeding crows he knew it was his boy the fire told him that the blue print for the bomb had been his own diagram of the la mon hotel device christ and he hadnt told the kid much hadnt told him much because he hadnt thought the kid was getting far beyond having his arse shot off hed given the boy nothing but the barest and the briefest the boy must have followed to the letter what he had been told must have memorised every bloody word and what hed told him for the hotel job was sweet bugger all of what hed need to know to blow a hollow charge job against a prison wall hadnt even told him of the safety procedures to go through in the loading of a hollow charge job with polar ammon he thought that if jack curwen died that he george hawkins would never forgive his bloody old miserable self for allowing the boy to stuff such nonsense in his head hard for the student to concentrate on his afternoon lecture the subject matter was the role of the state in support of the single parent family hard for jan van niekerk to concentrate on anything all the talk in the cafeteria and over the whole campus was of the bomb in john vorster square he had read that there was a theory that the bomber was white jan van niekerk had carried a package to the landdrost hotel a few blacks got to stay at the landdrost token blacks but he thought that the mr curwen to whom the package had been carried on by the bellboy must be white a white name he was involved certain of that he was guilty under the terms of the sabotage act years to death always since he had begun they could have manufactured a case against him there would be no need to manufacture anything when he had carried explosives when those explosives had been used in something so super fucking fantastic as the bomb inside john vorster square after the lecture managing almost a bounce in his crippled stride he made for his locker there was no message for him frikkie de kok liked a drink and he liked to talk there were few men he could drink with because his working life was his secret a matter that put him apart from other men his assistant was his natural drinking partner on wednesdays in the late afternoon and early evening if they did not have to be out of their beds while it was still dark on the following morning frikkie de kok liked the harlequin club for his drinking and the chance to watch a rugby match from the old dark wood long bar he had a small circle of acquaintances amongst the solicitors and barristers and government servants and accountants who patronised the bar on their way home from work his place was a corner table against the wall and the window where he could talk to the man who would succeed him on his retirement where also he could watch the match he gave all he knew to his assistant he thought that was the least he could do for this young man who was so keen to learn he had decided when the time would be very soon that he would allow his assistant to take over the full role of judging the length of the rope to be used of fitting the pinions and the hood of handling the lever he reckoned that an assistant had to be given a chance to learn for himself not for a multiple of course but for a single execution and as long as they had no reason to think that the man would not go quietly probably be best if it were a coloured thats what he thought because in frikkie de koks experience the coloureds were usually no trouble frikkie de kok checked his watch the players should have been out of the dressing room by now he carried on talking you see theres a great irony about the method of execution hanging we now support the method of hanging over firing squad or gas chamber or electrocution because we say it is the most effective and the most humane it didnt start like that look where it started hanging they wanted the most degrading way of death and they wanted it to be slow and painful because that was good deterrent what they were looking for was something that shocked and terrified the people who came to watch a public execution the slower the better because that way the spectators were most frightened thats the irony we have taken the most inefficient method and changed it into the most efficient i like to think that in pretoria we have the very most efficient and the very most humane system you can go anywhere in the world you wont find anything that is better organised than our situation its something that we in south africa can feel genuinely proud of i think theyre stupid not coming out earlier thats the way you get to pull a hamstring when youre not properly loosened there was a ripple of applause from the touchline and shouts from members in the bar the players ran onto the pitch there was one thing that concerned me the first time i was an assistant that was the heart of the man the heart kept beating for a full twenty minutes after hed dropped id been told all the things that i told you when you first started fracture dislocation of the cervical vertebrae with crushing of the spinal cord immediate unconsciousness no possibility of recovering consciousness because there is no chance of breathing but that heart was still going i put my ear against his chest while he was hanging and i could hear the heart it took me several minutes to get accustomed to that heart keeping going they want to watch the new boy at out half fine boy off last years high school side he could go all the way id like to think my boy could get to play for harlequins hes on the school team mr de kok but the schools filling his head with university not with rugby hes in his books thats why hes not on the line watching there was the question that the assistant had waited two years to ask the question that fascinated him for two years he had waited for the opportunity to appear he thought it was the moment does he know know what there was the roar as the harlequins kicked off know what his father does he wished he hadnt asked he saw frikkie de kok hesitate ive never told them not dawie not erasmus you could say its like telling them about the sexual functions theres never a right time and anyway theyll learn it all at school theres never been a right time to tell dawie what i do and if i tell him then do i tell erasmus and hes two years younger i suppose ill wait until theyre adults they might not understand funny things are young boys minds he thinks i run the carpentry courses at central if my poppa had done such work id have been proud of him who knows what they might think the assistant was hunched forward mr de kok what would happen to us if the political situation were to change change how frikkie de kok was entranced by the game nose close to the glass if the present government were to fall frikkie de kok chuckled no chance and well survive our job isnt political every government needs us let me tell you an anecdote from history there was an executioner down in the cape and he hanged and he quartered and he severed limbs and he was paid by each item then the british came were nearly two hundred years back the british said that he should just do hanging the poor man saw his livelihood going so what did he do he went and hanged h i m s e l f they were both laughing a little bit of change never hurts anyone i wont be hanging myself not even if they abolish maximum security too damned fast ill be off to buy a farm you wont see me for dust that man hes offside me too mr de kok i would have said he was offside frikkie de kok said from the side of his mouth casual next thursday tomorrow week thats the pritchard five all together they killed together they were convicted together look at that that referees a disgrace mr de kok jack still dressed slept on his bed exhausted harrowed by the high walls he had seen he had turned his back on magazine hill he had walked away from the green tree slopes where his father was held the minibus driver kept the stops short just enough time for the tourists to take their photographs and for the guide to give her spiel to a german couple four americans and jack the guide was an attractive girl might have been thirty years old but she wore her hair young in the blonde diana style she had sensible shoes and perhaps that was the giveaway that the girl who had the job of introducing tourists to soweto was not a child she talked well she had to talk well because the material for her to talk about was pathetic in the uniform dreariness of the streets and the homes they had come through the orlando area of the township city they were on high ground and looking down over the corrugated roofing and the straight roads and across the railway yards and away over further hills that were blistered with roofs the guide said we dont really know what the population of soweto is its very difficult to get these people to fill in a census form and they have their relations come to stay with them they arent the sort of people who are good with forms so it could be anything between one and two million people we really dont know the first reason for jack to come to soweto was that he must behave as a tourist yesterday he had gone to pretoria today he was waiting for his contact and he needed desperately to be out of the hotel was fearful of every footfall in the corridor dreaded having to go back wondering whether his room would be staked out the explosives discovered the day porter had made the telephone call placed the hooking the rand development board tour was back on schedule he said because soweto had been quiet for a week you can see with your own eyes that this is a community into which a great deal of government money has been placed millions of rand have been spent on making the living conditions of our black people more acceptable most of soweto now has electricity most of it has running water all of the main roads now have tarmac and later you will see that we have started to build shops the supermarket type of shops the amount of money that we are spending is a very great drain on the countrys resources but we are spending it the second reason for jack to have made the journey into soweto was vaguer he felt that he had joined a war that he had become a part of the armed struggle of the people who lived in this and other vagabond townships he wondered how many of the one or two millions who eked out an existence in soweto acknowledged the legitimacy of the tactic of bombs and bullets to change the conditions of their existence how many of them knew the name of jacob thiroko not one of them would have heard of duggie arkwright he thought of his journey into soweto in part as a tribute to duggie he had thought that he might learn something of the people in whose cause duggie had laboured driving past the stunning repetition of the homes of one million or two million people gave him not an iota of an idea of what their notion of a political future might be why are there high lights in the middle of open ground illuminating nothing the german man waved airily in the direction of hugely tall arc light stands that were dispersed over an open area of rubbish and building debris and raw earth the german woman looked at her husband sheepishly as if she thought it impolite to ask a question the ready answer they are there to make it safer for the residents unfortunately soweto is a very lawless place on average every weekend there are thirty murders in the township boundaries the gangsters prey on the wage earners rob them and kill them when they are coming back from the beer halls we call the gangsters tsotsis they are just hoodlums sometimes they are ordinary criminals sometimes they are agitators trying to intimidate the peace loving people i was told the german said that they put the electricity in so that the africans would buy televisions and radios and all the electrical appliances that are sold in the white owned shops i was told it was just to expand the market that they put the electricity in whoever told you that was lying the guide withered the german she had a fixed smile when she was talking to the tourists but in the front seat beside the driver her smile dropped when the tourists were muttering amongst themselves or trying to photograph from the moving bus then jack saw the reality of her face he saw the frowns on her neat forehead as she talked with the driver discussed where it was safe to go the driver would pause at each cross roads and the white guide and the black driver would stare and hesitate jack couldnt help but see the reasons for the hesitation slogans aerosoled on walls kill all whites be kind to animals adopt a policeman death to traitors and informers and collaborators children of the african heroes do not be afraid of whites jack thought it was lunatic to be running a scenic drive round friendly soweto the germans and the americans didnt seem concerned the germans were preoccupied with their focal lengths the americans were so busy in a denunciation of their own media and edward kennedy and all the liberal east coasters who gave them the picture of south africa in flames that jack wondered if they had even seen the armoured personnel carriers parked at the side of the petrol station and the second group that were parked close to the big school complex he wondered if the black polite were local what it was like for them to be on law enforcement in their own community he kept his peace jack thought the rows of small brick homes match boxes and the pitted streets and the piled rubbish and the pitifully few shops were pathetic he couldnt understand how the authorities could put a bus on with a pretty girl as guide to boast about how much had been achieved and drive tourists round so that they could see with their own eyes how bloody awful the place was the impression you get back home back in the state of washington is that the whole place is aflame looks pretty peaceful to me what i reckon is that all these folks want is work and to be left in peace the bus jerked to the right jack saw the guide pointing to a group of young blacks standing on waste ground a hundred yards ahead the driver had turned down a holed track they went fast past a fireblackened house he saw the drivers face when he turned to the guide for instructions there was a sweat sheen on the drivers skin jack wondered how it would be to go back to the township each night when your job was driving white tourists round your backyard by day they came back onto a main road there was no commentary from the guide he could sense the mood between the driver and the guide that they had been around too long there were school children streaming along the sides of the road an american woman said that the kids looked cute in their white shirts and black trousers or skirts the german woman was complaining that the minibus was going too fast for her to take photographs through the window they went along two streets where the houses were larger black middle class homes the guide started to talk about the owner of a taxi fleet and the owner of a black football team jack thought the houses belonged to white clones because there were leaping german shepherds in the front gardens there was smoke rising ahead the german man was tapping the guides back then pointing to a bungalow that was larger than the others once the queen of the street a smoke charred bungalow with fire scorched beams littering a front lawn what happened there the guide turned to speak to the german wasnt looking ahead hadnt seen the smoke rising from tyres in the road that was the home of the mayor of soweto that is the work of the agitators his home was burned down it was an attempt by the agitators to intimidate those who are trying to better the life of the blacks in soweto the driver was slowing but he was black he couldnt tell the guide to shut her mouth and concentrate on what was going on in front of them and tell him what the hell to do over the guides shoulder jack saw the schoolchildren cute running forward from the tyre barricade towards the bus it would be quite wrong to think that the majority of blacks are hostile to the reforms that we are making only a very few try to sabotage the sincere efforts that the state president is making to involve blacks in local government cut off in her speech the guide looked irritably at the driver the bus was stopped he was wrenching through his gears looking for reverse and panicking spinning his wheel she was about to snap her impatience at the driver when she saw the sprinting children jack saw the fury on their faces the faces were blurred in the dustdirty windows of the bus but the rage was unmistakable ecstatic loathing arms raised stones held up boys and girls running together shouting together the bus was across the road the engine racing the guide was shouting highpitched at the driver and covering her face with her arm she shouldnt have screamed at him she should have let him get on with taking them clear he stalled the engine stones rained on the minibus the windscreen cascaded into the drivers face across the guides lap was a shower of diamond glass jack was rigid in fear couldnt move didnt know how to help himself everyone inside the bus shouting and one of the americans starting a prayer and the german pulling his wife back from the side window and replacing her head with his wideangle lens black faces against the window a hand with a knife fists with stones muscles to rock the bus almost a darkness inside because the window light was blocked by the black faces black bodies black fists it was over very suddenly jack hadnt heard the crack of the gas grenade guns nor the patter of the shotguns nor the roaring power of the casspir apc when he was aware of the silence he lifted his head the screaming had stopped there was a whimpering from one of the american women the one whose husband had said that the blacks just wanted work and to be left in peace the guide was shivering but upright and was painstakingly starting to pick the windscreen fragments from her sweater the casspir had gone past them the schoolchildren had scattered the casspir bumped on the body of a kid who had been shot in the legs and was writhing and who was still when he emerged to view again from under the wide heavy tread of the tyres a police jeep pulled up alongside the minibus jack saw the savage expression on the officers face as he climbed out he couldnt follow the detail of the language as the officer tonguelashed the guide in afrikaans the message was clear enough they were bloody fools to have been there they should get the hell out subdued they drove back to johannesburg the german had damaged his wideangled lens but by god hed have a picture or two the american from wash ington state announced that hed be making a donation to the south african police the guide looked straight ahead hugging herself against the wind through the jagged edges of the windscreen jack had learned something of the war he had seen twenty kids who would have stoned him to death because he was white he had seen a kid minutes out of the classroom become a statistic in death because he was black at the carlton hotel where the bus dropped them off there were no goodbyes no tips for the driver the guide had nothing to say to them not even about communists and agitators he went back towards the landdrost he approached it as calmly as he could from three angles no sign of a police presence and eventually just a friendly greeting from the day porter infinite regrets that sir had not had the best impression from his tour there was no message the solicitor looked again at his watch in four and a half minutes it was the third time he had looked at the gold face on his wrist the prison officer stood behind him ignoring him he sat on the hard wooden chair and looked through the plate glass at the mirror of the room that was opposite him the room he looked into was the same in each detail to the one in which he sat there were no decorations in the visit rooms a room divided by a wall and a window of plate glass an identically placed door in each section identical tables below the plate glass a single chair on each side of the glass and a voice pipe that was like an inverted elephants trunk for speaking into and for listening through he hated this little room had hated it each time that he had come to visit his client his one aim was to get his work done to get back to his car to drive with his escort to the airlock gate in the outer wall to get himself through the identity check point on soetdoringstraat to get himself out onto potgieterstraat as soon as it was marginally decent for him to do so they had treated him like dirt when he had come in through the checks and searches and delays they seemed to despise him as they had walked him across the lawn to the visit room no small talk as if the presence of a solicitor a man trying to cheat them from their work was an irrelevance to their way of work he had the job because he had once represented james carew in a case involving a minor traffic accident in john vorster square carew had given the name of the young solicitor and a damned black day that had been he wished to god he had never been involved because he was frightened being so close to the hanging shed and to the man who was to walk into that shed he felt resentment against carew he had been telephoned by the colonel of the security police he had endured a lecture from the boer policeman he knew what had happened he was a lawyer and he was a citizen of the republic of south africa he had done his damned best to represent carew at committal at trial and since sentence he had not considered it possible that his client would reject the colonels deal not when the rope was the irrevocable alternative he had done his best for his client and he had hoped to god that his client would do the best thing for himself and talk to the security police about the anc the solicitors parents lived in durban that city had been the target of a bomb at christmas of all times the anc were foul murderers from all he had seen of his client he could not place him in the same category but then carew for all the sessions they had had together remained an enigma to the young solicitor the man had a past he was certain the nature of the past his ignorance of it burned as resentment he had done as much as he could for carew and carew had done nothing for him nothing for himself he was quite justified in his resentment he heard the approach of footsteps down the corridor sounds distorted through the tube that was the link between his outside world and carews inside world in the hanging place he had prepared what he would say to carew he would tell carew that he had done all that was possible to save his life he would tell his client that rejecting the colonels offer had been an act of egregious folly he was going to tell his client that it would be a waste of time to attempt another clemency petition that in his view it was so damned unnecessary the door was opened jeez was led in through the glass the solicitor stared at jeez he thought his man was frailer than when he had last seen him as if he had lost weight as if the skin on his cheeks had been peeled back and the flesh underneath scalpelled away and then the skin rolled back again to sag over the hollowness jeez sat down opposite him god how to be sharp with a man who was going to walk to the gallows there was a small smile on jeezs face the solicitor understood the bastard knew the obstinate bastard had known what he had done when he had walked out on the colonel the solicitor could not consider how a man voluntarily turned his back on life not when the choice was his good of you to call round young man did you have a pleasant drive over the solicitor swallowed hard the resentment died in him in a torrent flow he told jeez that the legal options were exhausted it was all because of a series of coincidences because an assessor had been called back into the army for reserve service and another assessor had been at home with his wife and newlyborn baby and her supervisor had thought it would be good experience for her to be out of the office ros van niekerk had gone to a fire damaged home in sandton the cookmaid had left the electric chip frier on all night the chip frier had finally caught fire in the small hours gutting an expensive kitchen she had gone to work that morning in a pure white skirt and that skirt had been dirtied as she had moved about the kitchen assessing the damage and agreeing the size of the claim ros went home to change after the call because her father was at work and her mother was at morning bridge she let herself into the house that she expected to be deserted except for their maid the maid had been a young nanny once but with ros and jan grown up the nannys role was gone she could hear the maid in the back washhouse ros didnt announce herself went up the stairs to her room because the radio was playing in jans room she went to the slightly opened door it surprised her to hear the radio she thought her brother must have left it on when he had gone to wits always late she eased the door open the room was empty the bed was made the radio was playing there was a sprawl of papers on the small teak wood desk where he did his studying because ros sometimes wished that she had gone to university and not straight to work when she had left school because she always took an interest in what jan read and what he wrote in his essays she glanced down at the papers on the table because of that short series of coincidences ros van niekerk found herself staring down at the drawn plans made by the old hungarian for jacob thiroko she was no fool she understood immediately the content of the map drawn on the uppermost sheet of paper the broad strokes of the roads were marked potgieterstraat soetdoringstraat wimbledonstraat there were rectangular blocks drawn beside the roads local white political pretoria old central new womens beverly hills she knew what she looked at mechanically as if she sleepwalked she lifted the piece of paper the second sheet was drawn to a larger scale a rectangular block enclosing another block and a part of the inner block was drawn in detail she read gate house and radio control wooden gates steps light watchtower she read measurements the longest of the outer lines was marked as metres what she took to be an inner wall was marked at metres she heard the toilet flush down the landing her eyes didnt leave the detail she read corridor c section exercise yard visit r o o m she heard jans trailing footstep shuffle towards his room she read workshop washhouse preparation room she read the one word she heard him stumbling from the door towards her she read gallows jans hand caught at her spun her away from the papers what the hell are you doing she faced up to him he was the boy but he was no taller than her she could look straight into his eyes you bloody ask yourself what youre doing she had never before seen such violence on jans face she said this is bloody treason he shouldered past her he was snatching at the papers she caught his arm she said you cant undo what ive seen ive read the word gallows that maps treason he shook her hand off him there was a high livid flush on his face he was vulnerable in her eyes always had been you shouldnt have come snooping in here i come in here i find a map of pretoria prison i find a map of the place where they hang people you have to do better than tell me im snooping he thrust the papers into his desk drawer he locked the drawer with the key on his waist chain he turned to her defiant cornered so what are you going to do what the hell does that mean are you going to inform on me im your sister jan your bloody sister where did you learn that sort of bloody talk sister got it are you going to father are you going to the security police for gods sake im your sister i love you youre my brother they clung to each other ros said softly how long have you been living a lie jan i swore an oath of secrecy im your sister im not your enemy it was an oath ros we never had secrets you wouldnt understand that my brother is involved in treason perhaps i wouldnt understand that treason is their word it isnt mine jan i love you but you are involved in something that is against the law thats important he shouted at her its only important because its against the law dont play the bourgeois cretin ros the evil in this country is ending its times up were on the march going forward its over for the boers and the racists the boers make the laws her voice raised against his if you go against the law then you go to prison i swore the oath ros for what a snap of contempt to be able to look in the eye the men and women of our country to have my pride you have to fight something that is wrong not like those bastard businessmen fight it mealy statements about concern plane trips to lusaka to plead with the freedom movement not to give all their shares and their stocks to the people when the revolution comes not like those crappy liberals at wits all piss all wind i fight the evil with the language the system understands she snorted at him what do you do i do my part she couldnt help herself there was the sneer of the elder sister whats your part running messages on your little moped my part how can little jan van niekerk hurry the revolution i do my part the blacks wouldnt trust you they trust me how do they trust you he turned away from her he went to his bed flopped down his head was in his hands i swore an oath of secrecy how do they trust you she knew he would tell her she had always had the power to take anything from him even the things that were most precious he was always weak in her hands is it the terrorists of the african national congress how do they trust you he spoke through his fingers she had to lean forward to hear him the bomb in john vorster square i delivered it to the man who placed it what incredulity widening her mouth they trust me that much i moved that bomb you could go to prison for the rest of your life thats a godawful reason for backing off the fight against evil rubbish he looked up at her clear faced you go to the police ros she hissed say that again just go to the police ros turn me in she took the step towards him she raised her hand he didnt flinch she slapped his face his head rocked she saw the smile that was beaming up at her what are you going to do she stared out of the window she saw the maid hanging the washing on the rope line she saw her fathers good quality shirts and her mothers good quality underwear and she saw jans tshirts and her blouses she saw neat gardens ablaze with shrubs and flowers she saw a black man collecting grass cuttings she saw their world that was comfortable and familiar and now threatened im going to fight to keep you out of prison what does that mean it means that on your own youll rot the rest of your life in prison the words were music to jan van niekerk quietly he told her that he was under instruction to go to a certain place and deliver a message for a man to make a rendezvous he knew the name of the man he said it was the man who had taken the bomb into john vorster square police station he told her that he had to meet the man and give him the plans of the pretoria central prison complex left to yourself little brother youll rot for the rest of your life ros said the man was white he had been born in latvia he was a colonel in the kgb he was marked for assassination by the security police and national intelligence service in pretoria he was the chief planner of umkonto we sizwe operations inside south africa more than a year before he had authorised the fire bomb attack on the rand supreme court that attack was one of a long list of projects that had crossed his desk he had approved the bombing of the air force headquarters in pretoria and the attacks on the sasol synthetic petrol refinery and on the koeburg nuclear power plant and on the voortrekkerhoogte military base more recently he had sanctioned the laying of mines in the far north east of the transvaal on roads that would be used by civilians and the detonating of a shrapnel bomb in a durban shopping mall crowded with christmas custom the long retaliatory arm of the security police and nis had swiped close to him his former wife had died mutilated by a letter bomb in her office at the centre for african studies in the mozambique capital the meeting was in a small airconditioned office at the back of the anc compound on the outskirts of lusaka jacob thiroko was not interrupted he stated his plan five men kalashnikovs grenades one hundred kilos of explosives four cars for the run to the botswana frontier the skill of the white explosives expert now loose in south africa thiroko had spoken of john vorster square he had sung of the pedigree of the expert he had been heard out he kept his high card for the end i will lead the cadre nothing astonished this white man his eyebrows flickered a trace of surprise he stayed silent i will go back myself into south africa into my motherland i have not been there since i was a young man perhaps it is a hallucination perhaps it is my duty to the men who otherwise will hang i have a responsibility for them five times of responsibility you gave the authorisation i prepared the plan i cannot escape my responsibility the young man in johannesburg is the son of james carew the driver the son taught me about sacrifice when i thought i had nothing to learn for his father he is prepared to sacrifice his life i should be prepared to make the same sacrifice they are sons to me happy charlie percy and tom what did we do when benjamin moloise walked to the gallows we issued statements i dont want to issue a statement this time tell me about london comrade in london i went to see a physician what were you told comrade jacob to live each day of my life to the full to enjoy each minute of each day is there pain the pain will be nothing to the joy if i can give life to my children is it possible to bring them out i would have said it was impossible for a stranger to carry a bomb into john vorster square i no longer know what is impossible the pain was deep in the lower bowel of thirokos stomach he winced as he stood as he shook hands with the man from riga he had chosen the four men who would go with him who would return with him to south africa the physician had not been specific he had spoken only of the few months that remained jack came back into his room closed the door behind him slipped on the security chain checked the suitcase in the afternoon after the experience in soweto he had had to force himself to go out into the city to walk on the streets amongst blacks be a tourist be a tourist and also make some enquiries he had gone to a small engineering firm in the back streets down from marshall he had asked about the availability of a short length of iron piping when he crossed the room he saw lying on his dressing table left there by the bellboy a sealed envelope he saw the bold handwriting he thought the envelope had been addressed by a girl when the colonel left the meeting he brought back to his office a copy of the initial forensic report embedded in the walls of the hallway of john vorster square had been found the synthetic fibres of a cheap bag blown clear through the doorway and into a flowerbed had been a piece of a metal can this first examination stated that the fibres came from a littleused bag and the fifty cent sized piece of metal from a clean painted can without corrosion or rust the colonel had given it as his opinion that both items had been bought specifically for the bombing for the making up of the explosive device for carrying it im truly sorry carew thank you sir theres not a decent man i know who can get pleasure out of this moment im sure there isnt sir for what we do in life we have to take the consequences of our actions just so sir i take no delight in seeing a man go to his punishment whatever hes done i appreciate that sir the governor stood ramrod straight in the doorway of the cell behind him his message read the deputy sheriff of pretoria waited his arms hanging his hands clasped in front of his trouser flies jeez had the centre of the floor space he was at attention his thumbs on the seams of his trousers he thought the sympathy was genuine he thought the governor was an honest man the governor didnt frighten jeez not so that he had to imagine him out of his tailored uniform shorn of his medal ribbons stripped to his underpants the governor was nothing like the bastard who had run spac who had been jeezs gaoler way back for so many long years i like a man to go proudly i like a man to behave like a man i can tell you this carew go like a man and it will be easier for you a prisoner who makes difficulties hurts himself not us thank you sir id bet money on you carew that youll go like a man who is proud yes sir i always tell a man at this time that he should think through his life think about his affairs and stay with the good times we dont want any melancholy no sir carew you wrote a letter a few weeks ago i checked with records and youve had no letter back im sorry of course you are permitted to write as many letters as you wish there wont be any more letters sir is there anyone we should contact anyone you would like to be offered facilities for a visit no sir theres no one who should visit i tell you frankly ive never met a man who has been here white who has been as private as you nor of your bearing if i may say so yes sir theres a point i would like to make to you carew the state president has refused you clemency he has named the date of your execution there have come from abroad several representations to the state president urging him to think again from his holiness the pope the secretarygeneral of the united nations many others carew you should know that in these matters the state president will not alter his decision i tell you that man to man because it is better that you prepare yourself without the distraction of false hope yes sir the decision that you hang next thursday is irreversible i know that sir the colonel from the security police he will come back and see you carew if you care to reconsider his proposal i have nothing to say to the colonel sir he took a taxi from the hotel to the zoo gardens jack had memorised his instructions and flushed the sheet of paper away down the lavatory the driver hissed against the wooden toothpick that was clamped in his teeth through each detail of the bland police statement of unrest overnight in the cape and the east rand on the early morning news two shot dead by the police in the cape and a black woman burned to death in an east rand township seems to be getting worse jack said the taxi driver looked over his shoulder youd need to be smiling from your cheeks to your backside to think its getting better what has to happen for it to get better the taxi driver settled comfortably in his seat like the question was a box of chocolates to be enjoyed my opinion take a tougher line with the blacks thats not what were doing at the moment right the state presidents put the military and the police into the townships wrong each time he makes a speech hes talking about reform result they think theyre winning they reckon if they keep up the murder and the arson that theyre on their way to government on the one hand the state president is trying to intimidate the blacks into ending the violence on the other hand hes trying to buy them off with promises the two dont sleep in the same bed jack slid out of reach of the drivers eyes in the rearview mirror took a fast deep breath and asked did you know the taxi man the one theyre going to hang carew that bastard did you know him i didnt myself ive a friend who did what sort of fellow was he mystery man thats what my friend says when the name was in the papers he just didnt believe it says he was a very private fellow a recklessness in jack where did he live he had a flat behind berea furnished thats what my friend says when he was arrested he gave instructions to his lawyer man that everything in the flat should be sold went to a childrens home charity my friend says there wasnt much bits and pieces and his clothes but theyve all gone like he knew he was never coming out my friend says that he used to talk quite a bit with this carew but he never knew anything about him i mean they didnt talk about family just used to talk about the motor that sort of thing long time ago he wrote to ask whether carew would like a visit and the letter came back from the authorities that carew didnt want any visit whats your interest jack said i read about it in the english papers he was dropped at the main entrance he must have been one of the first customers that morning because the wide sloping grounds with the autumn in the trees were neardeserted he walked over the dun yellow parched lawns he did exactly as he had been instructed he went to ihe cafeteria where they were still putting out the tables and he ordered a cup of coffee when he had drunk it he walked away past the big wingspan vulture in a tall cage and past the compound where a young gorilla gambolled and past the green water pool of the sea lions he understood why the instructions had demanded that he followed a set route he was being watched and checked to see that he had no tail he climbed the hill and strolled slowly past the big cat enclosures well before the heat of the day and the leopards and the jaguar and the lions were pacing he sat on a bench in front of the bengali tigers he didnt look around he made no attempt to identify the people he assumed to be watching him up again and past the stink of the elephant and the rhino past a bee swarm of tiny black children out with their teacher past a party of shambling mencaps with their nurses he followed the instructions he went up the long hill towards a huge memorial to british victory in the boer war of nearly a century ago he drifted into the military museum more schoolchildren but middle teens and white and with a pretty young teacher who had a strident voice as she quizzed her pupils on bren gun carriers churchill tanks pounders an mm recoilless antitank theyd be needing that knowledge the little sods their country was going into automatic rifles and armoured personnel carriers and white conscripts in the townships and by the time these kids were fattened up then it might have come down to tanks and artillery it was a bad image for jack his thoughts ran fast to potgieterstraat and defence headquarters and the guns of the sentries and the fire slits on the walls of local a bad awful bloody express train of thought because he had never believed that beverly hills could be so well protected if he had known it would be that well protected then jimmy sandham would be alive and duggie would be alive and jack curwen would be in his office at his desk on the north side of leatherhead bit bloody late jack he sat on a bench he waited jan and ros had argued half the night away they had argued in the car on the way to the zoo the argument had continued as they tracked the englishman violence doesnt change anything the boers listen to violence they dont listen to debate blowing people up killing and maiming people wont change the government change will only come when control of the townships is lost the state is committed to real change all thats needed is a breathing space for the moderates on all sides to come forward and negotiate the moderates what do they want to talk about about opening up whites beaches for nonsegregated bathing do you think they care in the townships where theyre queuing up for charity food parcels about a nice little swim on a whites only beach the moderates arent relevant might have been twenty years ago not now its about power not about which beach youre allowed to swim on anyone who has power will never hand it over voluntarily the boersll have to be burned out of power your way jan only slows the pace of change theyre playing with reform ros they want to get the americans off their backs so they can go back to living the way theyve always lived the white boot on the black throat are you ashamed of being white ive no shame because im fighting against a white evil i didnt ask you to spy in my room you can get out of my life im stuck with your bloody life im your sister on your own youre dead or youre locked up i wont turn away from you i wish i could and i cant for half an hour they watched the englishman move through the zoos gardens at the sea lions and the compound for the big cats they had split and gone in opposite ways so that each of them could be sure they were free of a tail jan thought that his sister learned fast if there had been a tail he believed they would have seen it for jan there was the fascination of seeing the clean shouldered back of the man who had achieved the remarkable and carried a bomb into john vorster square for ros there was the fascination of seeing the man who had come as an activist to their country who was capable of murder for what he had achieved jan thought the stranger was a hero for involving her brother ros thought him an enemy they came into the military museum through the heads and shoulders of the schoolchildren between the snub barrels of the artillery pieces they saw him they were a boy and a girl out walking there was nothing about them to excite suspicion they looked at the man who sat hunched on the bench ros said once youve spoken to him then youre more deeply involved than ever before you could turn round you could go home father would get you a ticket you could fly out of the country tonight you could be safe jan said i dont run away you dont run away because you cant run she hated herself they dont listen to reason last year when they hanged ben moloise they had petitions from all over the world they didnt give a shit they strung him up because what the rest of the world says doesnt c o u n t he was convicted of killing a policeman now theyre going to hang five men and again the rest of the worlds pleading for mercy they dont give a shit this man knows it fight force with force fight the force of john vorster square with the force of a fire bomb and pretoria central i dont know jan said he had the diagrams of the gaol in the inner pocket of his windcheater jacket youre getting to be a real creep jan they went forward jan limping and ahead and ros trailing him he turned when he heard the voice the voice spoke his name jack saw the boy he saw the shallow body and the thin face he saw the way the shoulder drooped he saw that the boy was crippled the boy was behind the bench trying to smile a greeting he looked the other way the girl was standing back two more paces than the boy a nice looking girl and older than the boy and she wore a summer skirt and a blouse buttoned to the throat he could see the lines at her mouth tension lines im jack curwen i was ordered to contact you you followed the instructions thank you they stared at each other as if neither had quite believed the ordinariness of the other jack smiled the boy grinned jack wondered why the girl didnt smile im jan this is my sister you dont need any more names strangely formal jack shook hands with them a shyness in jans voice what you did at john vorster square was incredible again the silence none of them knowing what to say out of earshot the schoolchildren were spidering over the hulk of the museums largest tank jan drew the envelope from his pocket he passed it to jack jack ripped open the fold he saw the diagrams he leafed quickly through the sheets of paper the frown settling sharp cut on his forehead he knew the girls eyes never left his the school teachers voice carried gently to him she had raised her voice because she was describing to her class the cyclic rate of fire of a heavy machine gun from the great war he saw that the diagrams were detail of pretoria central he saw the positioning of beverly hills he understood why he had not seen the walls when he had walked on potgieterstraat what happens now jan said i have to take you into the north of the transvaal there is a rendezvous there for you close to a town called warmbaths it is a spa town about a hundred kilometres from pretoria you should go back to your hotel and you should check out of your hotel then we drive to warmbaths do you know why i have come to south africa no ros snapped and he doesnt need to know jack saw the anger on the boys face jan said im just a courier i am ordered to deliver you to a rendezvous i do what i am told just as i brought you the envelope today just as i brought you the package of explosives you dont know why we are hitting the gaol as he said hes just a courier ros twisted away swirled her skirt jack stood up and walked behind her and jan hobbled after them jack caught up with her youre not a part of it she said bitterly her eyes were on her sandals striding out jack bored on im not a part of it its true in england my home im not an activist im not political i dont give a damn for this war i have to be here probably like you have to be here she tossed her head back rippled her hair gestured at her brother behind her she said its lunatic for him to be involved lunatic for all of us so why did you honour us with your presence a week today theyre going to hang my father she looked away he saw her close her eyes squeeze them tight shut they stood together and waited for jan to catch them there were eighteen detectives from the plain clothes branch of the security police who had taken the desks and tables in the large room set aside for the investigation the detectives worked with their telephones and notebooks eight floors above the back hall of john vorster square ten of the detectives worked on tracing the grip bag eight worked on finding the source of the petrol can in front of each man was a commercial telephone directory of the greater johannesburg area by the middle of the morning it was believed that a manufacturer had been identified for the bag a factory employing similar synthetic fibres to those retrieved by forensic the detectives then took sections of the directories to ring each and every number where the bag could have been sold the information given to the detectives pointed towards a white attacker it was therefore probable that the bag and the petrol can if bought in johannesburg had been bought either in the city centre or in a white suburb the outlets through which the bag might have been sold were fewer than the outlets for petrol cans it was thought that the bag rather than the can would prove decisive twice that morning the colonel had come down the two flights of stairs to the incident room he was not directly involved not yet his involvement was two stages away in the process of the investigation first the source of the sales must be identified second the purchaser must be described jacob thiroko and his group travelled apart but on the same aircraft he carried a tanzanian passport he had never used that passport before it described him as an engineer he carried letters of introduction from the botswana enterprises development unit and also from the botswana meat corporation for whom he could tell immigration he was designing a new abattoir the younger men were on a variety of black african passports and each was equipped with the cover to talk his way through immigration at the international airport at gaberone with more time for planning and for taking advice he might have attempted to travel overland from angola or overland from mozambique both difficult but both possible the fast way to south africa was through gaberone not the safe way it was eighteen months since the recce commando squads had been helicoptered into gaberone at night to kill twelve of thirokos comrades to blow up their offices to bring home what was described as a treasure trove of intelligence material since the raid the botswana government had ceded areas of their sovereign independence to permit covert members of the national intelligence service to operate in various guises from their territory thiroko walked from the aircraft across the tarmac towards the single storey building housing lounges and offices he walked almost in the shadow of the squat square built air traffic control tower he was concerned with the immigration officers he should have been concerned with a white air traffic control supervisor his photograph was taken it would not be a good likeness but it would serve as confirmation of this supervisors opinion made instantly that he had sighted jacob thiroko by the time that thiroko and his four men had collected their baggage queued for immigration gathered together to be met by their contact driver there were two vehicles waiting to follow them out of the airport car park there was a land rover with the markings of a locally based safari holiday company driven by a white with a black passenger and there was a peugeot estate carrying three blacks inside the car when it was speeding on the palapye road thiroko told his companions that they would cross the border that night in the wide area between martins drift and oranjefontein that they would be moved south by lorry that they would meet with a sixth man at a place where weapons and explosives were stored he saw they were cool to what he said not excited they were all in their middle twenties they had all left south africa as children they were coming home as men the peugeot was eight hundred metres behind it did not have to be closer if the car ahead turned off the metalled road it would have to give up tarmac for dirt a billowing grit storm would telegraph a detour from the palaype road jack paid cash for the two lengths of steel tube hells expensive for just a metre in length apiece but the steel was as thick as the width of nail on his little finger and the diameter was nine inches it was what he wanted a white in the front hall of the engineering works tried to strike up a conversation with jack while a black was sent to the rear yard to bring out the tubing jack didnt respond gave no explanation for buying the tubing he refused the whites offer that the black carry the tubing to his car if he had been a south african if hed stopped to think he would have allowed the black to take it to the car but he didnt want any one to be able to link him to jan who sat in the back seat of the beetle nor to ros who was behind the wheel two blocks away down on anderson jack again paid cash for a set of heavy wire cutters the tubing was on the back seat of the car jacks case was in the boot they took the pretoria road they would by pass the capital on their way to warmbaths the chaplain could have sat on the lavatory seat or on the bed beside jeez or on the table that might have come away from the wall under his sixteen stones he said he spent too much time sitting and he stood jeez sat on the bed the chaplain wore uniform identical to the other officers but for the purple shoulder flashes a big man with a big gut and mane of white hair and a voice that barked even when he tried to be kind are you a child of christ carew jeez hardly knew the chaplain he didnt go to the chaplains sunday services religion was not compulsory at beverly hills when you were a condemn you could take god or you could leave him religion like work and exercise was voluntary jeez took only exercise im not a praying man sir many times the chaplain brought his chess set or his draughts board into a condemns cell and talked and whiled away afternoon hours he had never played chess or draughts with jeez duty had brought him that day to c section and the prodding of the governor you dont help yourself carew my problem sir you should place yourself before god in a state of humble repentance in daylight hours there were fifteen prison officers administering the white condemns all bored out of their skulls and reading picture magazines and polishing their kit and kicking footballs in the exercise yard and laughing too loud and joking too much jeez wondered if for variety theyd come on their toes to the door of his cell to listen to the chaplain you know carew many of the blacks that go they thank me just before they thank me because they say they have found repentance they say they are at peace with god they say i have guided them to god jeez said i reckon you enjoy working here youre a hard man carew without contrition my lifes going to end the hard way sir the chaplain smiled avuncular ill be with you when you go wouldnt miss it would you sir to offer you comfort do you go and have your breakfast afterwards i dont get provoked that easily carew weve not much to talk about sir jeez thought the chaplain loathed him in the eyes of the man there was a watery gleam as though the chaplain thought this man would crack at the last cry for help he thought the chaplain wanted nothing more in life than to walk the corridors of beverly hills with young blacks on their way to their maker with mission hymns in their throats do you want me to ask the surgeon to give you a sedative what for we sometimes give a white a sedative i want nothing from you sir others they ask for a drink a big whisky or a brandy i want nothing sir carew the blacks sing for each other you know that when you go then you will have the men with you those that were arrested with you and they will be singing the penny rhymes of the african national congress i cannot believe you want that i could get in a church choir to sing for you it has been done before why should i want that damn you to give you comfort man jeez thought the man might have been organising a confirmation service and did he want some flowers and did he want his hair cut and did he want a clean shirt and if he said that he wanted a choir then they could settle down for a cosy chat to decide what the choir should sing and then whether the choice would be suitable for bass voices as they might be a bit short on contralto and soprano im not dragging anyone else in here im not dirtying anyone elses day the chaplain sighed you can always send for me i am always available the chaplain rapped on the closed door of the cell thank you sir the door clattered shut on the chaplains back jeez lay on his bed he was dry eyed for ten years in spac he had believed known that the team was working for him and after ten years in spac there had been the feting and the restaurant meals and the debriefs for the balkan desk and the weekends down at colonel basils home he had to believe in the team or his cheeks would have been wetted facing another shortening day jack talked softly ros drove well she kept her attention on the road but she listened in the back curled round the metal tubes jan was quiet right through the time when i was a kid my father was held up to me as being just about the most rotten man that ever lived had to be rotten because he walked out on his wife and son left them for dead with an impersonal financial arrangement to make sure they didnt starve but i found out why hed gone missing and who was responsible for him and how hed been ditched but that was only confirmation material for me id have come here anyway whatever hed done when he left my mother i have to see him and talk to him and bring him through nothing else seems important hes the fall guy hes the expendable legman you know what i want to do more than anything else i just want to walk him through whitehall thats where all our government sits on its backsides and i want to walk him into the fat cats rooms and i want to say that i did what none of them had the guts to do and after that im not going to give a shit about their security and their official secrets act im going to blow it all open i dont care who the bloody casualties are and i dont care if im one of them there are people in london who are going to pay a bloody great price for whats happened theyll have to kill me to keep me quiet you know since i started out on this ive never even thought that it might not work right there are times when i dont know what the next stage is how were going to crack the next barricade but its going to happen when i went up to pretoria then it looked impossible like everyone had told me it would be after id seen local and defence hq i could have packed it in gone off for the airport i sorted myself out doesnt matter how difficult it is it has to be done i mean there isnt any way out of it not for me my fathers going to hang thats the beginning and the middle and the end of it and something has to be done even if it is actually impossible her gaze was straight ahead has to be tried because hes my father jan shouted roadblock jack hadnt seen it nor ros they were on the n i a little past the turn off for rand jiesfontein there were two police vans primrose yellow drawn across the road there was a short queue of cars ros was going down through her gears jack winced only he knew of the explosives in his suitcase hadnt told jan nor his sister that he had squirrelled away fifteen pounds of explosives and the prison plans the pain was immediate and then gone none of the cars was being searched they were the seventh car in the line a police sergeant came towards them stopping by each driver he wondered how ros would be couldnt tell noone spoke in the car as the sergeant approached beyond the vans was parked a high armoured personnel carrier off the road jack saw policemen standing and sitting in the open top displaying automatic shot guns and fn rifles were running escorted convoys down the next ten kilometres miss whats happened ros asked small voice a gang of blacks stoned a car a kilometre down white woman elderly car went off the road the bastards got to her dragged her out they had rocks and knives miss they set light to her she was an old lady weve a big search op in there but its a wilderness supposed to be a helicopter coming she wouldnt have had a chance jack saw the pallor on ross face there was a klaxon blast from the apc and exhaust fumes fanned from its tail more cars were behind them the sergeant had moved on the apc set off down the road they followed in a twenty mile an hour crawl ros didnt speak jack didnt have to scratch his mind to remember the crowd coming down the shabby street in soweto and the din of the stones on the coachwork and the rocking of the vehicle and the screaming of the woman from washington state not hard to imagine the last moments in an elderly womans life as the stones started to fly and the windows were caving in and the mob was materialising out of the long grass that flanked the road not hard to see the fingers ripping at the doors of a crashed car and the fists raised and the clawing nails and the knives and the sharp edged rocks he shuddered he prayed that she had been unconscious when they had poured the petrol on her thrown the match they passed the burned car there were skid marks on the tarmac then the wheel tracks through the grass and then the blackened surround where the earth had been scorched near the car and under the body of the woman ros retched jack looked away jan was breathing hard she snarled great bloody day for the freedom fighters jan rose to her of course theyre brutalised what else could they be given the regime they live under thats xhe work of the people youre so bloody fond of i dont condone that and the anc doesnt condone that but when you treat people like filth then theyll behave like filth pathetic excuses its the price the whites are going to have to pay for half a century of naked racism childish slogans think of all the black children that have been shot by the police she let him have the last word ros drove on towards pretoria all her life she had let her brother have the last word it was why she was driving her car north it was why she had entered a state of madness the tie of family had captured her she understood the young man sitting bowed in the front seat beside her she believed herself to be as captured by her brother as he was by his father the white from the safari land rover watched as the blacks kicked the resistance out of the driver of the pick up car they had tracked the pick up car after it had turned off the palapye road when it had headed south towards the border hamlets of sherwood ranch and selika through field glasses they had watched jacob thiroko and the four other men get out and unload their bags when the car had come back up the road it had been blocked the driver was a loyal member of the movement but the beating and the kicking were ferocious the driver told his captors that the older man in his car had been addressed as comrade jacob he told them that this comrade jacob had spoken of striking a great blow for the movement he told them that the old man had spoken of warmbaths when he had nothing more that he could tell them the driver was kicked to death boots in the stomach and the head killed him the kicking was without mercy when he was dead he was dragged to his own car and thrown inside it was intended that he should be found it surprised the white that the blacks under his command kicked the victim of their own colour with such enthusiasm the white worked to trail out fifty feet of radio aerial from the short wave transmitter in the land rover to a branch high in a thorn tree his coded broadcast was picked up in the offices of the security police at potgietersrus kilometres away jacob thiroko and his cadre were to hike across country to a road junction outside monte christo ten kilometres at midnight they were to be met at the road junction and driven by lorry to a rendezvous north of warmbaths he believed they could cover that distance before the breaking of the morning light at the rendezvous they would find a cache of weapons and explosives buried there more than two years before they moved by compass bearing it was difficult for thiroko to keep his attention on the animal track in front of him and on the dried grass that cracked under foot and on the wind scattered branches that snapped under his tread he had come home he was back in his own place the scent of the scrub as familiar to him as his mothers body had been when he was a child the smells of home and the whirr of the insects and the fear of snakes and the bright light of a clear sun shining on his homeland nowhere else in africa had he tasted the same smells sounds shining sun as he found on the hike towards monte christo going back inside his country his fighting ground inside the operations room at the hoedspruit base home of squadron helicopters they followed a familiar routine the puma was tasked to take off in the late afternoon and to reach the point of the border incursion before dusk the quarry was to be given time to move away from the frontier and so to be unaware of the military movement behind them the puma was a good old workhorse with improvised replacement parts it had flown for eighteen years in south africas colours in the thrash of the rotors it took off into the low slanted sun behind the two pilots were eight white soldiers of the recce commando a dog handler with his golden labrador and a skeletal bushman the bushman wore only shorts his shock of black hair was ringed by a green tennis sweat band he spoke his own language only that of the kavango region of south west africa the officer commanding the hunting team had been given an exact reference for the border incursion as they were coming in to land as they looked ahead into botswana the pilots could see a car parked on a dirt track and pulling away from it were a land rover and an estate car it took the bushman only a few minutes to be sure of his starting point when it became too dark for him the dog would take over the tracking it was not a difficult trail to follow ros drove into the poorly lit one street of warmbaths they checked into a hotel they took single rooms at the reception desk as they wrote false names and false addresses in the book ros remarked to the owner that they were breaking the journey north west to the ebenezer dam where her brother and his friend would be fishing if they knew what jan was into my mom and my dad theyd die i told my mother that i was coming here to bring my father home it must have sounded so daft that she didnt bother to argue with me being daft isnt being a traitor you have to live your own life for yourself you cant live your life for your parents try telling them ros laughed jan was at the hotel jack and ros walked along the pavement of the street that sliced through warmbaths a desultory conversation and blotted out when the big lorries and their trailers passed the road through warmbaths was the principal route from johannesburg and pretoria to potgietersrus and pietersburg and louis trichardt and on to the zimbabwe border the road rumbled under the lorries jack liked this small town it was an escape from the threat of the cities agricultural country he had met the farmers the previous evening with jan and ros he had eaten a quiet meal in the hotels dining room hed gone for a stringy tbone and shared what he couldnt eat with the hotel cat it had been a quiet meal because the brother and sister had been arguing in her room and they hadnt anything to say to each other in front of jack he thought she might have been crying before shed come down to dinner her eyes had been reddened and her upper cheeks puffed out it could have just been the strain of the drive but he thought shed been crying hed left them after the meal and gone into the bar one of those god awful entrances the talking had stopped a warble of noise when he had opened the door silence when he had come forward to be served as he was looked at and stripped for information they would have known he was english from the moment he opened his mouth to ask for a castle hed been lucky because the old soak who propped himself in the corner of the bar had a grandson in england at an agricultural college in the west jack had listened and laughed aloud at the alcoholics jokes and hed been included in a round and stood his own for half the bar they were huge lads the young farmers he knew they thought he was all right because each one of them through the long evening had come to him to try out their english there wasnt much politics talked a bit towards the end jack had thought they were all as confused as hell what the hell was their government doing what was all this crap talk about reform was the state president in the business of giving the country over to the kaffirs funny for jack because back home the state president was seen as the high priest of conservatism in the bar at browns the state president was the missionary of liberalism he quite liked the young farmers and it was a good evening and it cost him three visits to the lavatory along the open veranda from his room jack and ros turned off the main road ros pointed out to him the weather worn red stones of trekkers nineteenth century graves they walked into a network of straight avenues bounded by bungalows and glorious gardens flowering shrubs cut lawns beds in bloom and the drone of mowers and the hiss of stand pipes jans right jack said hes taken sides and hes right because it cant last whats he right about that it cant last that its going to collapse its beautiful and its doomed because nobody outside white south africa cares a damn for you not the europeans not the americans not the australians nobodys going to lift a finger for you when it all goes wrong she looked at him she had a small and pretty mouth a strand of hair was across her face i dont want a lecture jack and i know what i want from my country but my way of getting there doesnt include old ladies being pulled out of their cars and being knifed and being burned he thought she walked beautifully he thought there was a sweet loose swing in her hips she had her arms folded across her chest her breasts were lifted to push hard against the crumpled cotton of her blouse she wore the same clothes as the day before do people care about hanging here jack asked he saw a frown puckering and her eyebrows rising they were a couple walking in a flower filled suburb with a blue mountain ridge in distant sight and he had asked her to talk about a court sentence that man should hang by the neck until he was dead its not an issue its accepted that the penalty for murder is death by hanging youve seen what theyre like our blacks hanging protects us the whites theres overwhelming support for hanging if it wasnt my father and if it wasnt my brother then id probably think the same if it wasnt my brother thats involved then i wouldnt cross the road for you not if you were bleeding in the gutter he ducked his head he walked faster as surely as he had involved her brother he had involved her just as he had involved sandham and duggie what would you do for your brother ros id do for him what youre doing for your father and after today we drop you this afternoon we turn round we drive like hell back to johannesburg i give jan my ultimatum big word for a big speech i tell him that he quits or i inform on him i dont have to go to the security police i tell my father hell do as my father tells him or my father will turn him in thats whats happening today and after today im not going to spend the next weeks and months wondering how close some pigeyed policeman is inching to jan and im damned if im going to spend the next few years traipsing to white political at pretoria central they turned back he couldnt think of anything to say to her he ought to have been able to talk to her because she wasnt an activist neither was he they were near to the hotel when she stopped dead swung to face him they were in the glare of the sun on a wide pavement they were dusted by the lorries passing on the road please if youre trapped then get yourself killed jack squinted at her great if youre held theyll make you talk if you talk jans implicated and youre implicated if i talk so just get yourself killed she was angry because he laughed im in deadly earnest the decent thing for you to do if youre trapped is to get yourself killed jack straightened there was a mock solemnity in his voice goodbye miss van niekerk it has been a most pleasurable acquaintance youre pretty ordinary you know that meaning what so ordinary that youre quite interesting if you were a mercenary or if you had some political hangup about fighting racism god youd be boring youre an ordinary person ordinary attitudes ordinary life as i read you theres nothing that ever happened in your life that wasnt just ordinary then you took a plane then you burned the back off a police station then you planned to explode your way into a hanging gaol but that doesnt change you doesnt stop you being just ordinary he took her hand she didnt try to pull away thank you for what you have done for me god damn you if you get yourself captured they went into the hotel they went upstairs to pack their bags later they would pay the bill check out and drive together to the rendezvous that jan had been given jack could picture it the car would stop he would get out the car would drive away he would be met at the rendezvous he would never see the car again nor the boy with the crippled foot nor the pretty girl who couldnt be bothered to make herself beautiful in his room before throwing yesterdays socks and yesterdays shirt into his case he looked over the plans of pretoria central by the time they met later that day he would have the germ of a strategy to put to thiroko the bushman and the dog had led the troops to the road junction outside monte christo through night binoculars they had observed the five men who waited for their pick up they had seen them eat and urinate they had heard the murmur of their voices they had called in by radio for the necessary support it had been a fine moonlit night an ideal night for the operation they had seen the collection of thiroko and his comrades over the radio link had been passed a description of the vehicle and its registration plate a motorcycle travelling without lights had picked up the vehicle at ellisrus south of monte christo it was the only route the vehicle could have taken moving behind the motorcycle was an unmarked saloon car carrying four more members of recce commando the vehicle had been trailed through the night as it came south through the waterberge mountains towards warmbaths the puma had come again and made a night landing in the play area of the school at monte christo and roused the village as it picked up the troops by a relayed radio link the pilot was able to keep in contact with the car that followed the motorcycle that followed thirokos vehicle the puma with its range of kilometres had had no difficulty in holding the contact before the last message was passed to the cockpit from some four kilometres north of warmbaths a morning of rare excitement for the colonel the fire bomb investigation in the hallway ten floors below was no longer priority his plan personally to interrogate the methodist priest white and elderly and stitched for subversion was shelved set aside too was the case file that would convict two and possibly three of the fosatu leadership one file on the colonels desk the heavily stencilled title was jacob thiroko at the top of the file was a wire print of the photograph taken at gaberone airport the picture showed a slight insignificant man walking on the tarmac and there was something in his expression that told the colonel of pain as if the wind were caught in his bowels the file was three quarters of an inch thick intelligence material collected over the years from gaberone maputo luanda lusaka and london and for embellishment there were the statements of the men from the suicide squads who had allowed themselves to be captured it always amused the colonel that the anc cadres liked to call themselves suicide squads and then chuck away their weapons and emerge from their bolt holes with their hands held high he knew jacob thiroko well as well as he knew an old friend he thought he had evidence enough to put him away for twentyfive years he was less certain that he would be able to stick upon thiroko a charge of murder without extenuating circumstances it would be good to hang the man it would be a disappointment only to lock him away whether thiroko hanged or whether he was imprisoned would depend on what information the bastard gave his interrogators if he talked he would hang clear cut the colonel would be responsible for the interrogation responsible for making him talk the photograph pleased the colonel if thiroko was in pain if he had pain in his gut then that would make easier the job of lifting the bastard onto the gallows trap the latest report was that thiroko and four other black males had crossed the border and were now resting up that his resting place was surrounded by the recce commando the soldiers were ordered to hold off until it was clear whether a further rendezvous was to take place he had been told that the military would move in by midafternoon that directly after his arrest thiroko would be flown by helicopter to johannesburg the colonel was wondering at the risk of it why a man of thirokos prominence in umkonto we sizwe would dare to travel back inside south africa when his telephone rang it was the direct line with the unlisted number he reached for it he heard his wifes voice had he read the morning paper about aunt annie no my dear he had not so he did not know that yesterday afternoon aunt annie his brotherinlaws sister had been killed by a black mob on the pretoria road to his wife and himself she was always aunt annie though only a few years older than they were a dour old lady and she had given them as a wedding present a silver tea pot which they always used in the afternoons when he was at home he consoled his sobbing wife he said he would not be able to come home before the small hours persuaded her to go at once and spend the day with her brother probably best to stay overnight too he rang off land mines bombs murders riots and the hacking and burning of aunt annie and the statistics of revolt spiralling as if a roof had sprung leaks and as fast as a leak was blocked there were more water springs soaking through it was the bastards like thiroko who pickaxed the roof made the leaks slaughtered old aunt annie who came to tea on each of their wedding anniversaries and who poured from the silver pot thiroko lay on his back his bed was loose straw wrenched from a string tied bale he was the only one awake the boys were sleeping snoring at the roof of the cow shed they had arrived in the dark and stumbled from the road across rough ground to the cow shed the place stank of the animals the shed was used by the farmer for storage and for when he had a difficult calving and the cow needed attention they had dug against the back wall of the shed to uncover the weapons cache each of the ak assault rifles was well sealed in plastic bags each was dry and oiled they had taken five of the rifles stored in the shed they had taken also kilos of plastic explosive and detonators and firing wire what they had not needed they had buried again under the soil and manure when it was first light he had crawled to a place where the overlapping metal walls of the shed had been prised apart by the winter storms the cow shed was on rising ground he could see where the road ran close by where they had been dropped after the drive down from monte christo and he could see in the far distance the grain silos of warmbaths he had tried to sleep the pain ate inside him it might have been the long flight from london and then the flight from lusaka to gaberone that had welled the pain it might have been the boneshaking drive from monte christo it might have been the twentyfour hours without food it might have been fear the pain was sharp in his stomach travelling with the boys he had learned much each of them had looked good enough in the training camps and the instructors from the german democratic republic had said they were as good as any and thiroko had thought they were good until he had walked with them now he thought they were crap because they had talked rubbish to him of a welcoming uprising no inkling of the danger of coming as a stranger into their own land they were going to have to shape up and learn fast and much between here and the gaol he lay on his back in his pain and he thought of the englishman an anxiety simmered in him of business not yet talked through happy and charlie and percy and tom were held in cells on the opposite side of beverly hills to jeez carew and they would have to be reached before the assault on c section he thought jack curwen would understand that four men must come before one thiroko pushed himself awkwardly to his feet the motion hurt him he went out through the open door he breathed in the cool clean air of his mother country down from this height was the sprawled town and beyond it the hazed flat veld it was right that he should have come back that before he died he should smell the air of his home he squatted beside a bush his bowels were water and he had no paper to wipe himself when he stood and pulled up his trousers he saw that there was blood mucous in his mess he saw no movement except the birds skimming the long grass he heard no sounds except their shrill calling the soldiers who watched the cow shed were the elite of the south african defence force they were used to sterner tasks than this in total and motionless silence they lay up in cover at the nearest point a hundred metres from the rusted metal building watching the four walls from behind machine guns and automatic rifles they had seen thiroko come out of the shed it had been noted that he had no paper six hundred metres away where the road curved hidden by a coppice of eucalyptus and scrub was parked the car that had travelled after thiroko from ellisrus the four men who sat in the car or squatted outside it wore civilian clothes slacks and sweaters their hair was not cut short in the style of the military two were bearded they were unremarkable crouched down in the coppice were the dog handler his labrador and the bushman all watching until midafternoon to see if there would be a contact ros drove away from the hotel it was just past one oclock but they hadnt bothered to eat they were not hungry and jan cracked a thin joke about jack wanting to wait till he could have maize porridge with his friends jack said that browns was like something from the cowboy pictures the open veranda the swing slat doors from the street into the bar posters for saturday night live music and dancing the carving in the dining room that was an fn rifle in relief jack said that as long as he lived hed remember the springs in his bed ros didnt speak they went right down the main road then turned off towards the mountains past the huge modern angles of the roof of the dutch reformed church up along the straight tarmac strips that bisected the bungalow land past the white school where the small boys were having rugby coaching and the girls were playing hockey jack thought warmbaths was an oasis abruptly they were out of the towns limits lawns and residences giving way to grazing lands there was another three kilometres to go before the pale dust road ahead began to climb for the foothills and then the mountains the high ground was grey hazed cool and without threat jan spoke to ros in afrikaans she nodded jack sensed they were close to the drop point jan switched to english were hardly stopping for you you can see the place from the road thats what my message said its a place where they can keep cattle if the weathers bad youll have to carry it all yourself your bag and the tube things thats fine the sun was high the light bathed them through the car windows ros wound her window down jack followed her there was the rush of air on his face her hair streamed across her cheeks and nose and mouth there it is jan was leaning forward between their shoulders he pointed ahead through the windscreen under the central mirror for a moment the sun had caught the roof of a building that was set back from the road beyond the place was a clump of tall trees for only a moment the light hit at that particular angle and reflected from the tin roof well put you down by those trees wait until we are gone ten minutes before you move goodbye and again thank you jack said softiy good luck jack i hope you pull it off a fierceness from jan ill put you down in those trees ros said jack grinned not a chance that we wont the last of the big boasts they had lost sight of the shed the big boasts were all right for his mother and fine for george hawkins great for duggie brilliant for these kids ros was braking the big boasts would stop when he joined thirokos men jack thought they were familiar trees peeled bark trunks but he couldnt put a name to them there was a car parked off the road and in the shade of the trees jack saw two in the front and two in the back of the saloon car i cant put you down next to them ros said they were passing the car as a flash jack saw the front seat passenger hunched forward something in his hand and his hand close to his ear as a flash jack heard the distorted snatch of a radio transmission just a flash he had heard a radio transmission he swung to ros his voice was a whisper just keep going she turned to him mouth sagging open no sudden movements dont slow dont accelerate her face was washed with questions just drive as if its normal like nothings important to us here jack could hear her breath spurting dont turn round dont look back god and he wanted to look back he wanted to look back and into the parked green saloon car and see whether the attention of the men inside was on the beetle that had sidled past just drive on as if its natural past the trees he saw a cattle track leading from an iron gate away across a crudely fenced field uphill towards a cow shed he could see no movement at the shed above the engine were the crisp calls of the birds he felt jans fingers on his shoulder dont stop drive on jack snapped at ros christ the girl was good didnt argue didnt talk back keep driving a rasp in jacks voice they went on up the slow incline jack pulled the map from the glove compartment he unfolded it over his knees his finger was searching for warmbaths the girl was great the girl was driving with her eyes on the road like it was a sunday outing when we went past the parked car as we passed it did you hear anything i hardly saw the car it was taking a radio message so what jan spoke before he had thought theres not going to be a taxi out here it was taking a radio message which means its a police car cop on kid christ which means that the drop is under observation shit ros was expressionless jan sagged back into his narrow space alongside the metal tubes jack went back to the map he was a long time poring over it he traced a route on to mabula and then a secondary road to rooiberg and then on until the turn off to rankins pass through the mountains and a crossing of the mogol river and back to nylstroom that was twenty miles north of warmbaths without measuring the distance with his finger he thought that the whole journey was more than a hundred and fifty kilometres and that was the most direct route to warmbaths without going again down the road past the cow shed and past the parked green saloon car if theyre there in the shed and the police move in on them what would they do with them jack asked a dulled reponse from jan theyd take them to the police station at warmbaths from there theyd probably helicopter them out to pretoria or johannesburg i have to know what happens to them jan flared it wasnt us that was followed pretty bloody irrelevant right now i have to see what happens he gave ros the route that he wanted her to take she nodded she was impassive is that all right jack asked im just your chauffeur ros said you know whats there carew and you know its something that i never thought youd let me see too right whats there sergeant oosthuizen cant you see whats there for yourself carew sergeant oosthuizen liked a little game he liked a childs riddle mostly jeez humoured him most times in the last thirteen months jeez had played along with him buggered if he wanted a joke that afternoon i cant see that anythings there sergeant jeez was pacing the concrete of the exercise yard sometimes the yard seemed large enough for him to stroll in that afternoon he was constricted within the walls caged by the roof grill shadows on the ground oosthuizen stood beside the locked door that led into the corridor and jeezs cell his arms were folded the great jowls of his chin were spread with his smile now come on carew youre not trying for me jeez thought oosthuizen so thickskinned and yet so innately kind that he could rarely be sharp with the man truthfully jeez thought it would be cheap to squash oosthuizen nothing to do with the disciplinary measures that queued up behind oosthuizen not many privileges they could take away from a man when they were scheduled to take away his life within a week he would hate himself if he put down sergeant oosthuizen but buggered if that day he wanted to play a game and buggered if he knew how to tell the old fool to shut his mouth perhaps oosthuizen knew of jeezs wish for quiet perhaps he was determined to deny it youve got to try for me carew like a good man jeez surrendered as he usually did where am i supposed to be looking sergeant im giving you a good hint youre supposed to be looking at the flower bed carew jeez stared down at the flower bed most of the geranium blooms were over should have been pinched off the lobelia was straggling should have been pulled im looking at the flower bed sergeant and theres something in the flower bed that i never thought youd let me see i dont know what it is sergeant youre not trying for me carew please sergeant what is it thats in the flower bed oosthuizen tugged at his moustache he stood at his full height and dragged in his belly so that his belt buckle sagged he was hugely satisfied theres a weed a fucking what watch your language carew youve allowed a dandelion to grow in your flower bed jeez saw the dandelion it had no flower it was half concealed by a geranium plant yes you can see it now but you hadnt noticed it before id never have thought you would let me find a weed in your garden carew jeez wondered what would happen if he smashed oosthuizen with his fist he thought the man might burst jeez knelt on the concrete the concrete was not warmed by the sun the grilled shadows kept the heat off the concrete he hadnt noticed the weed because he hadnt watered his garden for two days he could see that the geranium leaves were dropping and that the lobelia was parched he pushed his fingers into the earth he tugged at the dandelion root he felt the root snap under the earth the weed would grow again he smoothed the earth over the weed would grow again but not surface before the following thursday morning he carried the dandelion to the plastic bag in the corner of the yard where the dirt sweepings were left for a trustie to take away doesnt do to let it get the better of you carew oosthuizen said quietly no sergeant believe me man you have to keep your standards up from the first day you come here right up to the last day thank you sergeant thats solid advice you have to find something to think about whatevers going to happen to you you have to keep going keep those standards have you got no visits coming no all those other fellows you were with theyve all got their families coming no ones coming i never saw a man who was so really alone carew no one oosthuizen looked once almost furtively over his shoulder and up to the empty catwalk window he dropped his voice im only supposed to make little talk with you im out of order but theres something i should like you to know carew im retiring next week wednesdays my birthday i should have retired on the coming tuesday evening they have a party all lined for me will they give you a gold watch i dont think so i think itll be a decanter and some crystal glasses but ive said to the governor that i dont want the party on tuesday nor on wednesday our governors a real gentleman he said that i could have the party on thursday you understand me carew youre going to be here on thursday morning thank you sergeant jeez looked up he followed the flight of a grey wagtail to the catwalk window oosthuizen said simply its because you dont have any visits carew he saw the wagtail start away from the narrow ledge below the window there was a face at the window a pale face against the darkness behind he saw the collar of a suit jacket and the brilliance of a white shirt he knew who he had seen he knew who would wish to look over him while he was at exercise their nerves were raw because the rendezvous had not been kept it was two hours past the time of the rendezvous thiroko had started to ponder what he should do if jack curwen had not arrived within an hour when the next transport was due to pick them up he could think of many reasons why jack should be delayed but as the minutes slipped to hours each reason had grown less credible he knew the boys were on edge strained because they talked more because it was harder for him each time to quiet them jacob thiroko you are surrounded by units of the south african defence force it came as an amplified bellow the noise of the magnified voice swept through the half opened door of the shed and coursed round the four walls they were all frozen they were all rigid they were held in their postures of sitting lying squatting crouching standing you should surrender immediately you should throw your weapons o u t through the door then you should come out with your hands on your heads movements now each mans hand moving stutteringly towards the stock of his kalashnikov frightened little movements as if the voice that overwhelmed them had an eye to see them you have one minute to come out if you come out within the one minute t h e n you will not be harmed in any way the four boys looking at him broken hope in their faces he saw the accusation of betrayal he could have cried they all looked to him he was their commander he had told them of a great strike against the boer regime and they were in a cow shed and amongst cow dirt and they were surrounded by their enemy we are starting the one minute from now thiroko crawled to the doorway he hugged the shadow he looked out he could hear the drone of insects and the cry of birds and the whispering of the afternoon wind in the dry loose grass he could not see his enemy are we the heroes of our revolution or are we the frightened children that the boers think us none of the boys had voices in their throats they nodded dumbly to thiroko their promise of no harm is twenty years in their gaols one boy cocked his rifle the chain was started the rattling of the weapons being armed rung inside the shed i have to win time time for a young friend who is braver than i he saw the chins jut and the eyes blaze and the hands were steady on the rifles he saw the trembling pass thirty seconds you throw your weapons out you come out with your hands on your heads you have a guaran tee o f safety they shouted together the four boys and jacob thiroko the word in their shout was amandla the word ballooned inside the tin walls he waved them to the sides of the shed each to a firing position he stripped from his rucksack a khaki pouch he tore a wad of papers from the pouch and ripped at them and made a cairn of them he lit the heap of papers his boys began to shoot the smoke eddied through the shed and with the smell of the burning paper was the stench of the cordite incoming fire punching ricocheting into the shed he lay on the straw and the manure and he drew the air down into his lungs and breathed so that he could fan the small flames licking into the papers he saw his notes curling he saw names blackening the coded plans flaking so little time and the boy against the back wall was whimpering hit in the buttocks and the stomach he blew again on the papers and prayed in anger for the fire to be fiercer the boy close to the front door was coughing mouthfuls of blood onto his chest he shouted for the two boys at the side walls to keep firing no reply he could see the clumsy postures in which they had died the boy at the back wall no longer whimpered the boy at the door toppled suddenly out of the door frame into the sunlight and was hit and hit before he fell into the dry hard dirt jacob thiroko summoned a prayer for the comrades around him and reached for his rifle they stood in the crowd outside the police station in warmbaths the men of the recce commando had come and gone they had come by police truck and then run to a helicopter with their arms held over their faces to save their features from snapping cameras the crowd could hardly have seen them but had cheered their every stride it was an all white crowd outside the single storey brick police station a crowd grimly satisfied ros never showed her emotions jack didnt know what she felt they stood jand they watched as the bodies were lifted from a van and laid out in the forecourt between two low sandbagged emplacements for the police photographer there were four young blacks they were laid on the dirt their clothing and the bodies torn shredded last to come was the corpse of jacob thiroko his face was intact recognisable to jack he blinked felt a sickness in his gut the back of thirokos head was gone a mushy wet crater he thought thiroko must have put the barrel of his weapon into his mouth his talk had brought thiroko back to south africa and killed him they dropped the body like it was a meat carcase jan was cold faced jack short punched him in the kidneys jan had tried to look as though he enjoyed what he saw and made a piss poor job of it the green saloon car drove to the police station steps jack half remembered the front passenger of the car who had worn a red shirt when he was parked off the road against the trees a man in a red shirt carried from the car five ak rifles each sealed in a separate cellophane bag he watched a detective wash his stained hands in a fire bucket he saw the driver of the green saloon car walk to the doorway tight in his fist was a clear plastic sack jack saw that it was filled with charred paper he felt the weakness sinking through his knees into his legs the light was going over johannesburg the colonel hadnt lowered his blinds hadnt switched on his strip light he had sat unmoving nursing his frustration since the news had been relayed to him from warmbaths his aides had abandoned him now in the outer office they warned the detective of his mood the detective had shrugged knocked and gone in i thought you should know sir of the developments in connection with the bomb investigation a youngish man english accent purchased a similar bag and a similar can of petrol in the city centre on the day of the bomb the description given by the two sales points is pretty much the same were working on a photofit likeness sir ill have a copy of the full statements for you first thing ros took charge someone had to her brother couldnt speak was utterly drained jack was black in his mood brooding while her brother and jack floundered ros assumed the decision taking into the car away down the long road and back towards pretoria and johannesburg she wondered whether they were already compromised all three of them she anticipated that the security police would be waiting for the van niekerk kids when they reached their home city the beetle having been traced she didnt air her fears she asked clipped questions of jack she ignored her brother do you want to fly out tonight no theres a british airways every night after the saa flight theres lufthansa and alitalia whats the point in staying im not flying you dont have a group youre one person do you have any other contacts to get help i dont its idiocy to think of anything but getting yourself out dont you see that ive no choice then youve got a death wish he told her about sandham he told her about duggie ive debts that have to be paid off they helped me and they were both killed they were murdered because i involved them do you think because its getting hot i can just pack up and go home sorry you got chopped chaps but its getting too difficult for me im not going to risk my skin ros it cant be done suicide ill tell you about suicide the old one amongst the bodies was called jacob thiroko i dont know what was in his mind about coming here but he hadnt been in south africa for more than twenty years and inside his own country the last thing he did was to blow his own brains away that was suicide that was so he couldnt be made to talk and before he blew his mind out he burned his papers he stayed alive long enough to burn his papers and then he killed himself he cant tell them my name or any name or what was the target thats a hell of a debt to be paid off i cant walk away not from them and not from my father on your own you wont even get to see the gaol then in beverly hills theyll all hear the gunfire the plans told me that theyll hear it they have high windows into the catwalks and up in the catwalk space there are more windows that look down into the cells those windows are always open my father will hear the gunfire everyone in that bastard place will know that someone came someone tried she couldnt look at him she didnt dare to see his face its madness if i walked away id have to live with next thursday morning i could be back in london i could be sitting and filling my gut with booze and i could take all the tablets that get you to sleep wouldnt matter id be in that cell wondering whether he was scared what he was thinking id hear them come for him id see them walk him along the corridors what do you want me to bloody well do ros go to sleep set the alarm for five in the morning wake up to know that my fathers being pitched off a trap what do i do then turn over and go back to sleep jan had leaned forward pushing his head between the high seat backs its to break out one person jack said yes it is to save one of them yes there are five that are going to hang the one is my father and you dont give a shit for the other four jack dropped his head jan believe me im not interested in five im going to break out one hes like every other white jan shouted hes a racist ros snapped grow up for christs sake he doesnt give a fuck for your grubby little movement to leave four blacks to hang and to try to save one white thats racism theyre killers those four murdering swine youre a racist too ros they were both yelling jacks hands went up palms open on either side of his head im not proud of what ive decided but its my decision alone its all horseshit about you being alone jan said if you were alone you wouldnt be in my bloody car ros said jack leaned across and kissed her on the cheek and she didnt pull away he took jans hand and shook it fervently christ what a bloody awful army ros said she was going to hillbrow she said there was a studio flat there that belonged to a friend from school her friend always gave her the keys when she took her small son back to durban and her parents ros said that there wasnt a husband nor a livein man ros said that her friend liked to know that someone came to keep an eye on the flat when she was away ros said that hillbrow was the home of the drifters in johannesburg where blacks and asians and coloureds and whites lived alongside each other in tower blocks without being constantly harrassed by the police for violating the residential codes ros said he wouldnt be noticed in hillbrow it was dark when they reached johannesburg and he needed to think because the days were slipping away thursday was rushing to him the studio flat fifth floor was an untidy mess theyd come in the back way the car parked at the rear so that they could all climb the five flights of the concrete steps of the fire escape heavy going for jan and ros and jack had their hands full ros had the key took a bit of finding in her handbag just one dismal room for living all there bed cooker shelves cupboards prints on the wall of views of the english lakes he went to the one window he reckoned he was less than a mile from the landdrost but this was a different world a crowded pavement below him he could see blacks and whites strolling and there was a cafe opposite with chairs and tables in the open where he could see the colour mix music from radio stations and records merged deafening from the street from alongside from above a prefabricated block and he thought he heard the bed springs going upstairs and he didnt like to look at ros a fight below same side of the street as the block and he had to crane to see two guys white kicking hell out of a third guy white and a girl watching black or coloured or some mix people walking round them letting them get on with it jan told him that they had to go home ros nodding jack understood the risks they took he had the airport they had nowhere to run for ros had her mouth clenched as jan said that he would ring at eight and at ten and at midnight jack should let the phone ring but not pick it up if there were a trace on their home telephone then it would only operate when the phone was lifted at the receivers end the ringing phone would tell jack that all was well with jan and ros jack didnt ask what he should do if the phone didnt ring it was for jack curwen to make decisions not to ask what he should do his responsibility all on his shoulders jan said he would come back to the flat in the morning ros didnt say when she might see him again he thought he was alone because he could not imagine how a crippled student and an insurance office desk worker could help him work the break out from the maximum security cells of beverly hills hard put to see how he could help himself he hadnt eaten since breakfast he looked in the fridge there was yoghurt and some cream cheese and the remains of a bowl of salad and some salami slices he reckoned the girl who lived in the studio flat must be a virtual skeleton he cleaned out the fridge he quartered the large room it was a compulsion to see how the single parent lived what she read what she wore he couldnt have answered for this violation of her privacy other than by saying it was a symptom of his aloneness he found the building bricks they were the same as he had had when he was a kid they were the same as will had back at churchill close lego bricks product of denmark there was a bread bin of them jack sat on the floor and laid out his plans of beverly hills and built the gaol in plastic bricks of blue and red and yellow and white he built technicolor perimeter walls he made c section from red bricks and administration in yellow and a and b sections in white he made the exercise yard of c section in blue he made a watchtower behind the gallows block and he built towers where the flood light stanchions were set he was a child at play there were no roofs for his buildings he could look down into each cubicle he made into the cells into the corridors into the exercise yards he put a door between c sections corridor and c section s corridor he put a door on a cell he could count the number of the doors he could count the number of the walls with the bricks that remained he located pretoria local and pretoria central and the white politicals and the womens he scattered the prison staff homes and the self service store and the recreation and swimming areas all on the north slope below beverly hills level with the gaol on the west side he put the commissioner of prisons residence he laid out a sheet of paper for the rifle range on the east side he made a broken line with the last of the bricks to make the outer ring of wire fences on magazine hill to the south he sat crosslegged his back against the bed and gazed down at the gaol a long time he sat unmoving searching for the plan worrying for the route he sat in the half light only the light beside the bed on searching and worrying jack stood he went to the kitchenette area of the room and rifled the drawers and cupboards until he found a set of cooking scales from his suitcase he lifted out the package of explosives he didnt think the wrapping would weigh much not enough to confuse his calculations he weighed the explosives he had fifteen pounds and four ounces of plaster gelignite he replaced the gelignite in the suitcase laid it beside the wrapped detonators and the firing wire there was a telephone beside the bed it was an impulse born of aloneness it was eight minutes to three in the morning sunday morning below the flat hillbrow slept the streets had at last quietened he wondered if his father slept jack knew that if he did not make the call then he might just as well take a taxi to the airport in a dozen hours time and book a flight and fly out he found a book with the code and dialled he had made up his mind the ringing of the telephone scattered the cats the bell drove them from the newspaper covering the kitchen table and from the cushioned chair beside the stove sent them scurrying to the dark corners george hawkins blundered into the kitchen groping for the light switch reaching for the telephone he heard the distant voice no rambling small talk no crap about the weather nor about the time in the morning the wall was twenty feet high it was eighteen inches thick what was the minimum explosive required with a conical shaped charge of nine inches in diameter to knock a mansized hole at ground level bugger george needed paper and pencil couldnt find them didnt know where hed last put them had to do the calculation in his head and he was half asleep shit and the boy was talking about minimums if he was on about minimums then the boy was in trouble deep bloody trouble twelve pounds is absolute bloody minimum problem with the minimum is that the concrete on the far side of the reinforcing mesh may not be broken clear ideal would be fifteen to eighteen the minimum thats twelve pounds how could the reverse end of the firing tube be blocked concrete mix could the conical shaping be lightweight aluminium not important that its heavy its good if its lightweight how much stand off should there be from the firing end of the metal tubing to the wall for a mansized hole you should have six to nine inches twelve pounds of explosive thats the absolute bloody bottom line the telephone purred in his ear for a full minute george hawkins held the receiver against his face shivered in his pyjamas he put the telephone down and went and sat in his chair and he called for the cats and rubbed the warmth into his bare skinny feet george hawkins shook his head slowly sadly he had been asked for the minimum he had answered the question twelve pounds was the bloody border line the boy was in trouble he sat for an hour with his cats on his lap before he eased them off and went back to his cold bed as the city slept late on sunday the colonel worked at his desk he had excused himself from taking tea with aunt annies relations after church he had told his wife to offer his apologies to the minister he read the reports that had come in late the previous evening he couldnt have waited for them the previous evening because the loss of thiroko had been too great a blow it should never have been left in the hands of recce commando that he was certain of he had been sure of it all through the late hours at home as he had listened to his wife sniffling and talking of aunt annie another day another opportunity he gutted the reports a white male age between middle twenties and thirty years grey trousers and a green sports shirt and a mauve sweater common to both sales an english accent the reports were specific not an english accent that was south african not the accent of a long term english immigrant and they were pigs who should never have been let into the country hanging on to their british passports shovelling money out of the country sending their kids away to avoid army service sneering at the afrikaners who had made the country the accent of an english englishman the purchases had been made within one hour of each other on the day the bomb exploded under the reports he had two photofit portraits they had been built as mosaics from the descriptions of the two shopkeepers the hair style the deep set eyes the strong nose the jutting chin it was the colonels belief that he stared at the two faces of one man they were the faces of the man who had destroyed the back hallway of john vorster square and his mind could wander if he had been consulted he would have argued strongly against the use of recce commando in the tracking and failed capture of jacob thiroko he had not been consulted and as a result he had been denied the chance of extracting information from one of the best sources hed ever been close to he had scarcely slept for rage he went down the stairs to the incident room he let it be known that in his opinion from the weight of his experience the bomb was not the work of umkonto we sizwe i believe it was thrown by an individual who arrived recently from england otherwise more care would have been taken in the purchase of the materials it should be assumed that he came to south africa very shortly before the attack the airports should be checked you should look for a flight from europe because the shop men have given him a pale complexion he hasnt been in the sun you should also check every one of the citys hotels that is my suggestion he knew his suggestion would be taken as an order youslept on it jan asked my decision yes no flight no jack said a pointless question jan could see beside the unmade bed the toy building that was pretoria central i dont want to jack cut in you dont want to get shot i dont want to start something that is impossible its an overused word you dont have explosives and you dont have weapons jack waved him quiet he told jan about the fifteen pounds of gelignite saved from the john vorster square bomb he told him about the detonators and the firing fuse he saw the surprise growing on the boys face didnt you trust us nor myself each one of us the activists of umkonto we sizwe each of us has an implicit trust in our movement it was sensible to be careful its nothing to do with trust jan i have to have more explosives or grenades and i have to have firearms i have to have them im just a courier the boy said and the nerves showed i have to have them jan by when tonight thats impossible overused word jan jack started to make the bed jan paced the floor there was the rhythm of the shuffle and the thud of his feet jack smoothed down the coverlet he thought he would never understand this boy he could understand a man such as thiroko and the young men who had died with thiroko blacks fighting for what blacks thought was theirs couldnt place this crippled boy in the game a white fighting for what blacks thought was theirs he thought it was all to do with the foot he thought the misshapen foot had alienated the boy from the white society around him he thought the boy must find a satisfaction from his hidden betrayal of his own people the boy stopped turned he faced jack squarely ill be back in an hour for you after jan had gone jack sat again on the floor beside the model he was drawn to an approach to beverly hills from the south side over magazine hill he knew why that approach appealed to him defence hq was to the north the east approach was through pretoria local and pretoria central from the west he would have to cross beside the police dog training school and the secure mental hospital he did not know what was on magazine hill and ignorance was a comfort his only ally youre not usually here on a sunday morning sergeant overtime carew i get time and a half on a sunday morning i need the money what with retirement coming you can always get overtime on a sunday the young fellows dont want it they want to be with their families get outside the city get away from here jeez had eaten his breakfast his breakfast on a sunday morning was the same as on any other morning jeez had eaten porridge made from maize with milk and two slices of brown bread with thinly smeared margarine and jam the same as on every morning that he had been in beverly hills he had three more breakfasts to eat he would be gone before breakfast was served on thursday he had drunk his mug of coffee he knew that he would get one meal that was different to all the other meals inside beverly hills on wednesday afternoon he would have a whole chicken for his dinner cooked by the chef in the staff canteen for the last meals there was always a whole chicken for the condemns who were white he couldnt remember where he had heard that whether it had been from way back when he was on remand or whether he had read it in the newspapers before his arrest it was a part of the lore of the condemns that they were given a whole chicken the dinner before they were hanged just as it was part of the lore that the blacks only had half a chicken jeez couldnt believe that that the pigmentation of the skin made the difference between two legs and two wings and two breasts and one leg and one wing and one chicken breast and he wouldnt get to know because he was buggered if he was going to beg an answer from sergeant oosthuizen jeez wasnt sharp that sunday morning so dull that he didnt even question oosthuizens claim that he was only at work to get time and a half for his nest egg there was a weakness in jeezs legs and in his belly it was with him more frequently as if he had a cold coming on and the microbe was fear couldnt rid himself of the fear not when he was locked in his cell not when he was alone particularly not when the high ceiling light about the wire grille was dimmed when he was alone with his thoughts of thursday morning and the rambling night sounds of the gaol the sounds carried into the upper areas of the cells and through the open windows to the catwalks and from the catwalks they eddied to the next window and floated down from there to the next cell and the cell beyond that the young white the one who hadnt been there for more than a few weeks always cried on a sunday morning in the small hours oosthuizen had told jeez that he had been an altar boy was a roman catholic and cried because when he had been a teenager he was out of bed early on a sunday morning and away to his local church for first mass oosthuizen had confided that the young white was getting to be a pain with his crying the old white charged with killing his wife for the insurance he coughed and spat each morning to clear the nicotine mucus from his throat oosthuizen said that the old white smoked sixty cigarettes a day oosthuizen had once said in his innocence that the old white would kill himself by so much smoking there was the crying and the coughing and the slither tread of the guard on the catwalk and there was the sound of a lavatory flushing there was laughter from out in the corridor where the prison officers played cards to pass away the day faintly he heard the singing just a murmur at first the edges and clarity were knocked off the singing by the many windows and the yards of the catwalk that it passed through the singing was from right across the far side of beverly hills from a section or b section jeez saw oosthuizen fidget whos it for im not allowed to tell you that sergeant jeez held oosthuizen with his eyes oosthuizen pulled at his moustache then shrugged and dropped his voice for the boy whos going on tuesday who is he sergeant just a coloured the whole place was mad there was a worry that a man smoked too much and might harm his health before it was time for him to have his neck stretched which might just do his health a bit more harm there was worry that a prison officer who was retiring on thursday might get into trouble for a quiet conversation on his last sunday morning whats he like the fellow who does it you trying to get me on a charge sheet carew whats he like the voice was a whisper hes damned good doesnt help you to think about it forget what i told you hes as good as anywhere in the whole world hes fast and hes kind a real professional he wont hurt you jeez so get a grip on it jeez because old sergeant oosthuizen says the executioners a hell of a good operator great news jeez ill walk with you on thursday morning carew ill hold your arm jeez nodded he couldnt speak he didnt think oosthuizen had attended a hanging in years he thought that oosthuizen had made him a bloody great gesture of love im going to do the rosters sos i get monday in here for the day shift and then ill have tuesday off and then ill come on again for tuesday night and then ill have wednesday off and ill be back on again for wednesday night and ill stay on through why sergeant the words came in a flood flow because you arent the same as the others because youre here by some sort of accident i dont know what the accident is because youre covering for something i dont know what it is because you shouldnt be here because youre not a terrorist whatever youve done because you had the way to save yourself i dont know why you didnt take it its not my place to say that but its what i think jeez smiled not your place sergeant he watched the cell door close on oosthuizen a hell of a week to look forward to clean clothes on monday and fresh sheets library on wednesday early call on thursday jan had been home spoken to her and gone ros waited for her father to leave for his sunday morning round of golf he played every sunday morning then came home for his cold lunch in the afternoon he would do the household bills and write letters her father didnt take a drink on sundays not even at the golf club she waited for her father to leave the house then went to their bedroom her father always brought her mother breakfast before he left to play golf the maid had all of sunday off the family fended for itself without her for one day a week every saturday night and every sunday night the maid took the long train journey to and from mabopane in bophutatswana where her husband was out of work and where her mother looked after her five children the maid was her familys breadwinner and when she was away the van niekerks let the dust accumulate and filled the sink with dishes and were content in the knowledge that it would all be taken care of on the monday morning ros told her mother a little of the truth a fraction ros said that she and her brother had met a pleasant young englishman she said that she was sorry that she had stayed out for a whole night the previous week and offered no explanation she said that she was owed time from work and she was going away with the englishman and her brother for monday and monday night and all of tuesday shed laughed and said shed be chaperoned by jan when she was her daughters age her mother had used to drive with her father through the night to cape town for the weekend more than kilometres each way and sleep together in a fleapit before they were even engaged she wondered why her daughter bothered to tell her what she was doing and couldnt for the life of her fathom why the girl was taking that awkward intense brother with her she thought it would do her daughter the world of good to be bedded by a strong young man half the daughters of her friends were married at ross age and some of them already divorced she thought there was something peculiar about her own girls plain dressing and shunning of make up she slipped out of bed she slung a cotton dressing gown across her shoulders she took ros to her dressing table and sat her on the stool she did what she had not been allowed to do for ten years she took the girl in charge she changed ross hair lifted it swept it back and gathered it into a red ribbon she put on for ros her own eye makeup and cheek highlight and a gentle pink lipstick she didnt dare to stop she could hardly believe she was permitted to make the transformation she let ros gaze at herself in the mirror above the dressing table she said this young man hes an immigrant just a visitor hes hoping to go back to england on wednesday or thursday ros saw the flush of her mothers disappointment later when her mother had gone back to bed ros went to her fathers desk and took from the bottom drawer the key to the gun cabinet that was bolted to the wall of the spare bedroom gingerly she took out a pump action shot gun a box of cartridges and her fathers two revolvers along with a second box of ammunition she returned the key before hiding the weapons and ammunition in her bed the road was straight and the ground on either side of it was barren waste jan talked too bloody much he turned his head and shouted through the visor of his crash helmet and jack had to lean towards him to hear anything through the thickness of his own helmet for jack it was little short of a miracle that the suzuki moped was able to carry the two of them he felt a complete conspicuous idiot perched on the pillion squashed into jans spare helmet towering above the kid as they dribbled along at thirty five miles an hour they were heading for duduza some fifty kilometres southeast of johannesburg staccato bursts of explanation from jan past mine workings through small industrial towns past a row of empty bungalows deserted because the white staff had left when the mine was exhausted and the homes had been left to the weather and to disintegrate alongside a shanty town for blacks they were on a straight stretch high grass beside the road jan leaned back to shout a white woman was driving past here couple of years back before the state of emergency she was pulled out of her car killed it was kids from duduza did it just about here jack remembered what he had seen on the pretoria road the picture was clear in his mind at that time the whites had killed hundreds of blacks and blacks had killed two whites but the fascist law and order lobby went to work it was vicious what the army and police did in duduza most of the mothers tried to get their boys out in girls clothes get them away and over the border just like the class of in soweto there is a class of out of duduza those kids now theyre in anc schools in zambia or tanzania theyll come back when theyre trained theres no escape for the boers i dont want a bloody debate jack yelled youll be in a debate when we get to duduza then itll keep until we get there why should anyone help jack curwen why should anyone in duduza lift a finger for jack curwen he didnt give a damn for any of their slogans his only commitment was to his father you know that racism is endemic among whites not my business jan warm air blowing past jans helmet dust skimming from the tinted screen of jacks visor take the courts take the difference between what they do for anc fighters and what they do for the right wing scum of the kappiecommando or the afrikaner weerstand beweging thats awb pigs are you listening jack jan shut up for christs sake jack heard jan laugh out loud like he was high jack listen if a black throws a petrol bomb its terrorism if its the white backlash then its arson a black explosion is treason a white explosion is a damage to property charge a black arms cache is plotting to overthrow the state but if hes white hes done for possession of unlicensed weapons isnt that racism im not listening to you jan you better make the right noises when we get to duduza if you dont want a necklace jack wondered what the hell the kid was shouting of he didnt ask right now he thought the kid was a pain he thought that if he hadnt needed the kid he would happily have jumped walked away from him but he had involved jan van niekerk and he had involved ros van niekerk he was leading the crippled boy and the office worker girl towards the walls and the guns of pretoria central im sorry jan you have to forgive me jan turned his head jack saw the wide grin behind the visor screen and the moped swerved and they nearly went off the road nothing to forgive youre giving me the best damned time of my life youre kicking the boers in their nuts and thats nothing to forgive the shouting died over jans shoulder jack saw the dark line of the edge of the township red and black brick walls behind a fence of rusting cattle wire low smudges of dull colour nothing for the sun to brighten jan had told jack before they had started out that duduza was the only place where they had the smallest chance of raising his munitions he was too junior in the movement to be able to contact senior men at short notice part of the protective cover screen in place to maintain the command chains security meant that a junior a jan van niekerk only responded to anonymous orders in his dead letter drop jan had said there was a black he had once met at a meeting in kwa thema township a lively happy faced young man with a soft chocolate au lait complexion who had said his name and said where he lived and been too relaxed and too confident to stay with the ritual of numbered code indentifications jan had said that the young blacks name was henry kenge they saw the block on the road into the township four hundred metres ahead of them two casspirs and a yellow police van jan had been very definite that he hadnt any way of promising that he would find henry kenge couldnt say whether he was one of the thousand detainees whether he had fled the country whether he was dead jan had said that trying to trace the man was the only chance he knew of getting weapons by that evening he had told jack that it would be many days until he was contacted through the dead letter drop the movement would wait with extreme caution to see whether the death of jacob thiroko had compromised that part of the johannesburg structure that had known of the incursion towards warmbaths jan had said that every person who had known of the incursion would be isolated for their own safety for the safety of those who dealt with them and they would all sit very tight for a while anyway until it was discovered how thiroko was betrayed jan said he would have to be under suspicion himself having known of the rendezvous the moped slowed not for jack to give advice for the boy to make his own mind jacks frustration that he was a stranger without experience unable to contribute the jerk off the tarmac jan revved all the power he could drag from the engine they surged and bumped away across the dirt away from the road and the police block jack clung to jans waist the boy shouted carry yourself well and for gods sake dont look scared scared is guilt to these people if you see me move follow me if we have to get out itll happen fast the mood changes like bloody lightning and this is a hell of a scary place were going into jack punched the boy in the ribs away to the right there was the bellow of a loudspeaker from the police block jack couldnt hear the words he thought they were beyond rifle range as they slipped the cordon there were holes in the fence jan searched for one that was wide enough for the suzuki and jolted through it jan cut the engine a terrible quiet around them and then a dog barking no people jan pushed his moped jack was close behind him they went forward down a wide street of beaten dirt jack thought that soweto was chic in comparison he saw overturned and burned cars he saw a firegutted house he saw the dog tied by string to a doorpost angry and straining to get at them straight roads make it easier for the police and military to dominate they havent electricity here the waters off street taps but theyve good straight roads for the casspirs jack hissed as if frightened of his own voice where the hell is everybody a funerals the only thing that gets everyone out theyve had enough funerals here in the last eighteen months its a tough place its hot theres not a black policeman can live here any more and the black quisling councillors are gone shit jan pointed it was a small thing and without having it pointed to him jack wouldnt have noticed jan was pointing to a galvanised bucket filled with water in front of a house jack thought of it as a house but it was more of a brick and tin shack he saw the bucket when he looked up the street he saw there were buckets filled with water in front of each house each shack in the wide street means bad trouble the water is for the kids to wash the gas out of their faces if theres going to be trouble everybody leaves water on the street if you dont put the water out jack asked then they would be thought of as collaborators and they get the necklace hands tied behind their backs a tyre hung on their shoulders thats the necklace they set light to the tyre bloody nice revolution youve started its hard for these people to touch the police they havent a cat in hells chance of hurting the state what are they left with just the chance to hurt the black servants of the state so what do we do scratch our backsides then what we just have to wait it was a huge funeral the gathering was illegal under the amendment regulations following the state of emergency it was prohibited that mourners should march in formation to open air funeral services it would have required a battalion of infantry to have prevented the column reaching the grave that had been prepared for the body of a thirteenyearold girl knocked over ten days before by a speeding casspir sometimes the regulations were enforced sometimes not enforcement depended on the will of the senior police officer for the area and the size of the forces available to him on this sunday the military were not present the police seemed to have stayed back and watched from a distance as the migrant ant mass of men and women and children took the small white wood coffin to the cemetery an orderly march to the grave hating faces but controlled the young men who had charge let the priest have his say and they allowed the bereaved family to get clear in an old morris car and they gave time for the old men and the women and the small children to start back towards the township there was organisation of a sort in what happened afterwards a single police jeep was out in front of the main force there to overlook and photograph a shambling charge at the jeep and the driver had lost his gears and lost time and the men who guarded the photographer and his long lens had fired volleys of bird shot and gas to keep the running stoning crowd at a distance the driver of the jeep never found his gears the crowd surged on vengeance within reach the police ditched the jeep left it with the engine howling ran for their lives good and fit the policemen and running hard because they knew the alternative to running fast knew what happened to policemen who were caught by a funeral mob the photographer didnt run fast not as fast as he had to run the lens bouncing awkwardly from his stomach and the camera bag on his shoulder and none of the policemen with guns taking the time to cover him the officers commanding the police were still shouting their orders when the fleetest of the mob caught up with the photographer the photographer was white and a year and a half short of his fiftieth birthday a growl in the mob the breath intake of a mad dog the hacking crack of rifle fire aimed at random into the crowd at four hundred metres the crowd of youths not caring because the photographer was caught the casspirs came forward and the kids fled before them back towards the township the photographer was naked but for one shoe and his socks and the camera with the long lens that lay on his belly his clothes had been taken from him as vultures take meat from bones he was dead an autopsy would in due course state how many knife wounds he had received how many stone bruises the start of a routine township battle an hour of unrest shotguns and rifles and tear gas grenades from behind the armour plate of the high built casspirs petrol bombs and rocks from the kids pretty unremarkable happenings for the east rand the police saw the kids back into the warren streets of duduza and left them to their destruction eighteen months after the start of the petrol bombing and the rock throwing against the black policemens homes and councillors homes there was little left for the crowd that was worth burning two shops were destroyed by fire the days were long since gone when the elderly would try to prevent the kids burning a shop out to have tried to have saved a shop from the fire was to have invited the accusation of collaborator two shops burned four kids died eighteen kids were treated for buck shot injuries in duduzas unregistered clinic no chance of them going to hospital a thirteenyearold girl had been successfully buried sunday afternoon in duduza and time to bring the buckets indoors his eyes were red rimmed he sat on a wooden chair in a small room faces peered at him through the cracked glass of the window jack looked straight ahead looked all the time at the man who had been introduced as henry kenge and at jan he dabbed his eyes with his watersoaked handkerchief and each time he did it he heard the pitter patter of laughter from all around him he had made his speech he had asked for help he had been heard out he had been vague and unspecific until jan had waved him quiet taken over and whispered urgently a statement of intent in the ear of the one identified as kenge he was filthy from the ditch he had lain in as the casspirs had rumbled down the main street with jan in the bottom of a ditch that doubled as a street sewer he thought that if the youngsters he had seen that afternoon had been black kids on the streets of london or birmingham or liverpool then he would have rated them as mindless and vicious hooligans he thought the kids of duduza were the bravest he had ever known so what was the morality of that fuck the morality jack thought kenge brought jan a holdall jan passed the bag to jack he counted five rg grenades jack tugged at jans sleeve this shouldnt be in bloody public the necklace has made ashes of informers theyre scrubbed out of duduza the eyes of the security police have been put out with fire thats why theyre losing they have a song about you they dont know who you are but they have a song in praise of you they made a song about the man who carried the bomb into john vorster square jack shook his head like hed been slapped you told them about that youve been given half of this townships armoury you grovel your thanks to them when they left they could see the lights of the road block vehicles jan kept his own headlight off and drove crosscountry in a loop taking them well clear of the block for a short time a searchlight tried to find the source of the engine sound in the darkness and they stopped in shadow until it lit upon some other threat and then rode on jack thought he was pretty damn fortunate to have the grenades he appreciated that after thiroko was killed jan would be isolated from the movement thats what any movement would do he pounded jans back in gratitude in relief to be out of duduza ros was at the flat in hillbrow she showed jack what she had brought only after he had seen and handled the pump action shotgun and the two revolvers and the ammunition did jack realise that she had changed herself he thought ros van niekerk was quite lovely he had fifteen pounds of explosives and detonators and firing fuse and five grenades and a shotgun and two revolvers and he had a crippled student to help him and a girl who worked in an insurance office and who was lovely no going back but then there had never been a time for going back a crisp bright autumn morning over the flat veld the diamond frost going with the sunlight monday morning another week one more used up jack had dismantled the model he had returned the pieces to the bread bin in a corner of the yard at the back of the block of flats he discarded one of the two metal tubes he had explosive enough for one tube only he had to go out the way that he went in jan carried the suitcase to the car ros had the shotgun broken and carried under an overcoat and the two revolvers jack brought the tube jack had told them he needed a stop on the way for a bag of readymix concrete he said that he would sit in the back of the car that he needed to think he sat in the back of the car and concentrated on an approach from the south side over magazine hill and diversions on the north side near the guarded perimeters of defence headquarters they could rent a service flat in pretoria ros said it wouldnt be difficult to find one but it would be expensive jack passed her a wad of rand notes he slipped back to his thinking how much could he ask of them of jan and ros the principal hotels were tried first two detectives with the two original photofits and also with a third photofit that was an amalgam of the shopkeepers opinions were briefed to visit the citys four and five star hotels other teams were directed towards the two and three star hotels the booking offices of south african airways of the european airlines and to jan smuts every one of them worked from john vorster square had been violated by the bomb the two with the four and five star list appreciated that the hotels worked shift systems of reception and porter staff they knew that if they drew blanks with this visit that they must come back to interview those staff who were not on duty that monday morning at the landdrost first visit the detective found the indian day porter on duty he left his colleague with the brunette on reception poring over the composite photofit she had known the face the detective showed the day porter the photofits the day porter recalled the features he had quite liked the man hed had a good tip for arranging the visit to soweto and another tip when the man had checked out he nodded his head he understood that the detective was from the security police and if it was the security police then it was not pilfering or the fraudulent use of a credit card it was sedition or terrorism heavily the day porter nodded he wrote a room number on a slip of paper and pushed it across his desk to the detective he was asked whether he knew the mans name his name was mr curwen was the middle of last week he left sir the day porter was in work not big pay but the tips were good hed remembered this man for courtesy and for a warm word of thanks when the man had gone carrying his own suitcase out he hadnt forgotten that it hurt the day porter to implicate the young englishman the detective went to the cashiers desk with the name and the room number it took only half a minute for him to be given a copy of the bill and the dates of the guests stay soon afterwards a watch salesman from port elizabeth sleeping in late with a coloured call girl was disturbed in his room they were given two minutes to get their clothes on the salesman was in the corridor zipping his trousers his rand companion was beside him buttoning her blouse as the dog was unleashed in the room the salesman in increasing desperation tried without success to discover why his room was being searched the detectives stayed in the corridor and gave him no satisfaction just the handler and his small black labrador dog in the room the dog explored the bed and the drawers of the bedside tables no reaction it covered the desk beside the window and the drawers there it went past the television set the cold nose flitted over the dressing table the dog and the handler had made a slow circuit of the room when they reached the wardrobe in the corner opposite the bathroom door the dog snorted it had been trained over months to recognise the scent of minute traces of explosive the dog had no skill at tracking a man nor at finding hard or soft drugs in luggage it was an explosive sniffer dog the dog pawed at the wardrobe door scratched at the varnish finish the handler slid open the door the dog sniffed hard into the bottom corner of the wardrobe then up to the inside of the door the dog barked the tail going then came out of the wardrobe and sat and the handler gave it a biscuit there were explosives in this cupboard the handler told the detectives my guess would be that the suspect had traces on his hands from handling the explosives when he closed the cupboard door the dog has found the traces inside only but the outside would have been cleaned by the maid staff but theres no doubt there were explosives very recently in this room he had the name of jack curwen he had an address in the surrey town of leatherhead he had a date of arrival in south africa the colonel dictated his telex he had forensic confirmation that the explosive traces found on the inside of the wardrobe door matched the types of plaster gelignite most generally issued by the soviets to the military wing of the anc by choice he was an overworked man he drew to his own desk as many strands of investigation as it was possible for him to gather in he missed a link he did not marry the information he now possessed with the report sent from london by major swart before the john vorster square bomb which had been circulated to the colonel by pretoria the colonel had so much to concern himself with it was understandable only human that he missed the link the telex had been transformed from a jumble of numbers to a demand for immediate information the telex lay on the desk of major swart major swarts office was deserted the telex was placed on the untenanted desk halfway through that monday morning there had been a short hail shower the forecast was for rain later major swart thought it a dismal occasion a burial service without dignity but then arkwright had been a pathetic creature it was an hours drive out of london for major swart piet had brought him down the m to the village beyond reading they were dressed for the part the major and his warrant officer the major was unshaven and in jeans with an old donkey coat on his shoulders the warrant officer had chosen denims with a campaign for nuclear disarmament logo on the back of his jacket the major had thought there would be a better turn out it was the last chance perhaps to get a tail on the young man introduced by arkwright to jacob thiroko and the bastard hadnt shown he could have saved his time he recognised faces from antiapartheid no one that was special a few kids out of the secretaries pool a man who made speeches at the really bum meetings when the seniors didnt want to know he saw arkwrights parents country people and they looked as embarrassed at the contingent from london as they were by the attendance of arkwrights wifes people whose jaguar was a flashy intrusion in the lane outside the church the group was around the open grave he could hear the vicars voice as sonorous as the clouds he and piet were standing back amongst the old head stones pleasant surprise to see you here major swart he turned fast he didnt know the man who had come silently over the wet grass to stand behind him a big man wearing a good overcoat detective inspector cooper major swart didnt expect youd be out and about to offer your condolences at the death of an antiapartheid activist the anger was crimson on the majors cheeks id have thought the embassy could have done better on the clothing allowance major swart swart saw the amusement on the detective inspectors face there is no regulation restricting the travel of south african diplomats inside the united kingdom the detective inspector looked him over with mocking enjoyment none at all major going on afterwards to the family for a drink and a sandwich are we go and fuck yourself major swart said nice language for a cemetery major very choice i doubt youll tell me why youre here but ill tell you why im here our investigations tell us that douglas arkwright was followed out of a public house on the night of his death it is our belief that he was attacked as he walked home some of his injuries were consistent with a kicking stroke of luck for us really but when he went under the bus only his head and shoulders were hit by the tyres thats how we can say for sure what were other injuries he had very recently sustained it is our belief that arkwright was running away from his assailants when he fell under the bus wouldnt be murder of course manslaughter would be the charge youd know about that major swart you being a policeman back home any ideas on who would be interested in roughing up a creep like douglas arkwright any time you want advice on how to police your inner cities just telephone me inspector the national theatre could give you a hand with your costume major and you warrant officer it is warrant officer piet kaiser isnt it i thought so ask for the wardrobe mistress at the stage door very helpful folk the major walked away his warrant officer close behind him he didnt look back he presumed the man was special branch they drove off crashing through the gears causing the vicar to pause in mid flow major swart and warrant officer kaiser stopped at a pub on the thames and didnt leave before closing time it would be late afternoon before he found the telex on his desk that required immediate attention the funeral of james sandham held by coincidence that same monday morning was an altogether grander affair the foreign and commonwealth office saw to the arrangements the personnel department had booked a chapel of rest and the official fleet of cars and the crematorium and enough flowers to make sandham seem to have been a loved and respected colleague his former wife had married again and successfully and was able to afford a clinging black frock that set her off well against the men from the fco she was allocated the front row in the crematorium chapel never whimpered never produced a handkerchief the pus was behind her and sitting alongside him was peter furneaux head of the late jimmy sandhams section they didnt speak the pus and peter furneaux until after the curtains had closed on the coffin and the taped organ music had come to a stop as the mourners scraped to their feet and followed the former mrs sandham to the door and into a light shower of rain furneaux said i wonder if i could have a word with you sir ive lunch out of town i am afraid then the cabinet office so i havent a lot of time its quite pressing sir lets walk a bit there was a garden around the crematorium trimmed lawns with staked trees and ordered borders well peter lets have it this fellow carew sir thats going to hang in south africa thursday right i know that carew is an alias i know that his true name is curwen classified peter in the interests of national security shortly before james sandham died a young man came to fco his name was jack curwen he said that james carew was his father i saw him and jimmy sandham was with me was he now the pus mouthed softly then sandham disappeared then he was dead so we move on i have regular reports coming in from pretoria the run of the mill embassy material and i have a note on carew last friday i get a confirmation that carew will definitely hang this thursday no more speculation finish hes going to hang this jack curwen he was a stroppy fellow but he was decent he told me to my face that i was washing my hands of his father and i wasnt pleased at being told that but in his position i reckon id have said the same so i thought he deserved a call hed left his numbers on friday evening i rang the home number furneaux saw a thoughtful concerned face he saw a gathering frown behind them the cars were pulling away another line of vehicles waited at the gates for the next cremation i rang the home number i think the phone was answered by curwens mother who was first married to carew i told her what i knew delicately and then asked for her son she put the phone down on me i wanted to speak to the boy himself so this morning before coming down here i rang the office number that hed left with us he wasnt there young curwen had taken abrupt leave i spoke to his employer i was told it was a very sudden departure youre taking peter a long time getting to the point i asked the nature of young curwens employment the firm he works for is called demolition and clearance curwen drums up business for the sort of work that required demolition by explosives the point please peter its conjecture of c o u r s e i would hazard that curwen has flown to south africa that blast at police headquarters in johannesburg our people report that the rumour in security circles is that a white with an english accent planted the bomb i would further hazard that curwen having launched one attack is going to make something of a noise at around the time his father hangs thank you peter youre going by train ill drop you at the station they walked to the puss official car the doors were opened for them by the chauffeur there wasnt anything strange about sandhams death was there sir what sort of strange peter hed no more go mountain climbing than i would sir you never can tell can you with people the pus asked the chauffeur to find the nearest underground station they drove away its my duty to tell you sir furneaux was muttering difficult ground theres been a fair amount of disquiet on the desk so far out of character that he should be mountain climbing he spoke to no one about taking leave its caused quite a bit of anxiety on the desk and i thought you should know that sir as head of department youll want to discourage idle speculation yes sir lighting a cigarette the pus said thank you peter for your guessing game about carews boy if it needs to be taken further ill handle it you dont have to concern yourself with the matter by the by peter you probably heard that theres going to be a gap in nairobi needs a most responsible and sensitive man to fill it quite a posting for a youngish man dont you think eh peter they shook hands the pus smiled a watery smile furneaux went down into the underground and bought a ticket he shrugged every man had a price and he was not much of a mountaineer himself the director general scraped with a match at the mess in the stem of his pipe and listened let me give you a scenario young curwen has gone to south africa unconfirmed but possible and you will check it at once through his work he is familiar with explosives that we know a bomb goes off in johannesburg and is rumoured to have been planted by a white for the sake of our scenario let us assume that james carew is to hang on thursday at the moment intending to take his secret to his grave and let us assume that young curwen is arrested in the hours remaining before the execution what chance then if they put the screws on him so to say that carew would remain silent the pus had cut short his lunch and driven to century house for the meeting still the director general said nothing or the related scenario carew hangs and curwen is subsequently arrested how much does the boy know he met sandham sandham knew only so much and probably hadnt told him would the boy talk probably i believe it is back to downing street director general for what earthly reason the director general filled his pipe it was a mechanical action his eyes were never on the bowl but none of the tobacco fibres fell to the polished surface of his desk i dont intend to finish my career in an expose on the front page of sundays newspapers never forget director general our job is to advise and to execute the politicians are paid to make decisions whatever a hamfisted job they make of it keep this one in the dark and i reckon well get swamped by homeflying chickens lay it all before them and we safeguard ourselves and possibly them too ill fix an appointment for early evening if the prime ministers schedule permits no problem any prime minister ive worked with would meet one in a dressing gown at four in the morning if the matter under consideration involves an intelligence foulup when the pus had gone the director general called in his personal assistant and named a man who was to be called to his office immediately major swart read the telex theyd had to stop once at a service station on the way back to london heavy stuff english beer he read the telex then went back to his private lavatory and back again to the telex shit and he was half cut he was never at his best after he had drunk at lunchtime he knew the name of curwen checked it out hadnt he days before checked and found that mrs hilda perry had been married to a james curwen thought hed cracked the connection between james carew and hilda perry had it all sewn up until he had taken the photograph of james carew to the village in hampshire and been told four times that the photograph was not that of james curwen from somerset house he knew there was a son of the marriage between hilda perry and james curwen he knew from those same records that the son had been christened jack johannesburg wanted information on a jack curwen they wanted background and they wanted confirmation of a photofit likeness major swart could have sent off an answer straight away but he wanted to piss again he reckoned he could have established the link between jack curwen and hilda perry and a letter written from pretoria central by james carew with too much beer inside him and a foul temper still from the encounter at the funeral he chose a different course he would first stitch the matter then he would send his message he would stitch it so tight that there were no call backs no demands for follow up information he rang erik yes the bloody man had replaced his bloody television set yes erik would be at the embassy within fortyfive minutes he shouted down the corridor to piet that if he had plans life or death for the late evening then he should bloody well forget them and then hastily back to his private lavatory fumbling with his private key to leak he came heavily down the staircase a beautiful staircase oak probably jacobean he thought the hostility swarmed from the short slight woman the hostility was in the wrinkle lines at her throat and in the flash of her eyes and the curl of a tired mouth i hope youre satisfied i hope you understand why he couldnt come to london to see you mrs fordham had told the director general over the telephone that the colonel was ill and could not take a train to london he hadnt believed her they stood in the panelled hallway he thought the house and its interior were magnificent perhaps she read him it was all my money my familys money the colonel wasnt interested in material reward all he cared about was the service the service was his life and how did the service repay his dedication there wasnt even a party for him more than two decades of work and the service simply discarded him weve had just one visit from the service since he was thrown out and that was some grubby little man who came here to see that there werent any classified documents in the house the director general was still shaken by the sight of the shell of the man he had just seen in the large bedroom colonel fordham curled in a wheelchair near the window unable to move and unable to speak had kicked the fight from the director general its a great shame mrs fordham that you didnt feel able to alert us i wouldnt have had your people in the house they moved towards the front door no way he was going to be offered a cup of tea of course they had retired the crass old fool and years too late at that a dinosaur really who believed the service was still packing off agents to suborn the bolshevik revolution or to run around the hillsides of afghanistan i came to ask for specific information then you wasted your journey there was one man who was very close to your husband im not a part of the service and at this time of the afternoon i have to bath basil she dared him to stay the director general smiled he fell back on his rarely used reservoir of charm outside his chauffeur and his bodyguard would be waiting for him enjoying the thermos and a smoke god and hed be glad to be back with them the man who was close to your husband was called james curwen i understand he went by the nickname of jeez i need your help mrs fordham he saw the same short slight woman but hurt he saw her fingers make a tight fist loosen grip again thats what did it to him her voice quavered it wasnt long after hed been dismissed he read of the arrest in the papers hed read the times he didnt finish his breakfast that morning he walked out into the garden it was about twenty minutes later that i went looking for him hed just collapsed the dogs were with him what youve just seen hes been like that ever since you didnt tell us after what youd done to him you knew curwen she shrugged he lived here when he came back from albania before he went to south africa he was a sort of batman to basil and he did jobs in the house and he drove the car and did things outside the director general had to mask his disgust the man had done ten years in an albanian prison camp and had come back to be patronised as a loyal serf lost his marriage and lost ten years of his life but the kindly old colonel and his lady let him drive the car and change the fuses and make a rockery in the garden a desperation in her face why havent you brought jeez out i am afraid it may not be in our power to save him but youre trying certainly were trying the director general said tell me about him hes a wonderful man he came back here after the awfulness of what hed been through and he just seemed to put it behind him id known him before when he was a well built strong man and when he came back he was a skeleton unrecognisable never a complaint not in any way bitter his attitude seemed to be that since hed been sent into albania by the service his mission must have been justified that it was simply the rub of the green that he had been caught he had a marvellous stoicism i think that kept him going sometimes not often he would talk about the bad times in the camp when men from his hut were taken out and shot when his companions died of malnutrition when the camp guards were particularly brutal when it was cold and there was no heating when he talked about it there was always his humour very dry he was honoured to be a part of the service just as basil was the service was jeezs life just as it was basils is that what you want to hear how resolute would he be in his present situation youd want to know whether hed betray you to save his neck thats very bluntly put mrs fordham it is insulting to jeez that you even think of asking me the question i just pray to god and thank him that basil cannot know what jeez is going through now it must be a very painful time for you mrs fordham his wife came here god im going back more than twenty years ago we were entertaining a weekend lunch party the poor woman came here to try and find out something about where jeez was what hed done he said afterwards to me that it was one of the worst days of his life having to lie to her telling her to put her husband out of her mind jeez understood when he was down here basil was very frank with him he had to tell him that the marriage was just a casualty of life with the service he told jeez that his wife had got a divorce and remarried that it would be wrong of him to disturb her that he should try not to make contact with his son however hard that was going to be jeez always did what basil said just before he went to south africa jeez went up to london and he must have gone out to where his wife and his son were living in their new home i think he saw her bringing the boy home from school jeez was quite bouncy at supper that evening as if his mind was at rest the service did all that to the man and now youre going to let him hang now all you care about it is whether hell talk whether youll be sacked as a consequence you disgust me the director general turned to the door i hope he talks i hope he shouts his head off and destroys the lot of you just as you destroyed basil he let himself out he left her to bath her husband the man who had been a friend of jimmy sandham found a telephone kiosk in the centre of leatherhead and rang in to century villiers had been helpful he reported he had posed as a policeman he had said it often enough that curwen wasnt in trouble he carried identification as a policeman he rarely used the polaroid card but it was always with him he had been told by the director general that he must call in as soon as he had completed his interview he knew on the grapevine that the big man was for downing street that evening when he had dictated his preliminary report he mentioned to the personal assistant that he had been given the name of a fellow that curwen often worked with and the address he said hed get himself down there he said that hed telephone back in if anything worthwhile came up major swart drove an old fiesta out of london it was one of four cars available to him for clandestine work and the least prepossessing of them in terms of the bodywork but the engine was finely tuned it was a slow journey appalling traffic erik sat beside the major piet shared the back seat with the canvas bag into which had been put the tools for the evenings work in the bag along with the jemmy bar and the screwdrivers were two balaclavas and two pairs of plastic gloves i wont tell you anything hawkins said then you lose your licence as a blaster pity that threats wont change me not a threat mr hawkins a promise and i always keep promises anyway youve told me plenty ive told you nothing he thought the place stank he thought it was pitiful that a man should live in such conditions everything he saw was filthy every surface was grimed there was a cat mess under his chair but he believed the old blaster threats wouldnt change him i know hes your friend if he wasnt your friend then you wouldnt be covering for him i know hes in south africa he watched the old man closely hawkins looked away picked his nose but his eyes didnt come back that was good enough curwen was in south africa confirmation i know that you told him how to build the bomb that he carried into john vorster square police station in the trade i gather its called the la mon mark one i dont think curwen could have made that bomb without expert help i wont tell you nothing but he didnt go there just to blow a hole in a police station what did he go there for george nothing if john vorster square which is the most important police station in the country was just for starters then hes aiming to follow it with something thats hells big you following me george bugger off ive just been cremating a friend of mine today george he was an awkward sod but he was my friend i told my friend about jacks father my friend told jack ill deny i ever told you t h a t it was my friend that told jack the truth about his father i expect jack told you what the truth was no denial let me get back to where i was before if its something big then it stands to reason that its dangerous you with me george hawkins was with him the old blaster was on the edge of his chair hanging on the words he must have been pretty lucky not to have got himself killed at john vorster square hawkins bit your friend that died what happened to him murdered but thats not what im here for i have to know the boys next target if im to help him i have to know how can you help him where i work were like the priests confessional were not interested in names we dont care where the information comes from this isnt a conversation that ever happened i cant tell you how we can help him you have to believe me that it makes it easier for us to help the boy if we know what hes at youre too late in the day to come bellyaching about help youre talking shit its your lot that pissed on jacks father whats he going to do george what would you do if it was your father the gamble the big throw take him out hawkins gazed down at the torn linoleum over his yellowed teeth his lips were tight closed id try to take him out of pretoria central gaol and id think i might know how to set about that because id talked to an explosives expert called george hawkins hes on the minimum hes no chance what sort of minimum george gelignite he hasnt an ounce of margin thats tough on the boy hawkins said if you betray him then itll go with you for the rest of your life therell be the time the hour before your death when youll be bloody sorry you betrayed him youll cry for his forgiveness so help me christ and you wont deserve to be heard thats well put george im thought to be a hard mean bugger i cried when the lad went because hes going to try to blow his way into pretoria central and take his father out id be proud to call jack curwen my son the light was gone the room in shadow the man left hawkins sitting in his chair he could no longer clearly see the old blasters face he understood how curwen had won over jimmy sandham just as he had won over a hard mean bugger who was an expert in explosives there was a light on in the hall of sam perrys house the rest of the house was darkened erik and piet listened a long time at the back door before they were certain the house was empty the major had told them there was no dog he was sure of that from when hed called no alarm box on the outside walls they taped adhesive paper over the glass panel of the kitchen door broke it were able to reach inside and turn the key it was better going in the back always gave one a head start if the householder returned to the front door and could be heard messing for the key the major had said they should take their time so long as they werent disturbed it was a great bonus that they hadnt had to wait until the small hours to break in hadnt had to wait until the householders were in bed and asleep erik and piet were experienced burglars theyd seen the real thing frequently enough when they were young policemen before their transfers to security they knew what they were looking for three streets away major swart dozed in his car head back snoring the friend of the late jimmy sandham stopped his car at the barrier across the entrance to downing street he showed his identification he was waved forward to park inside the hushed welllit hallway he asked to see his director general i the prime minister was irritable the prime minister had that day coped with hospital funding the price per barrel of crude oil diplomatic manoeuvres on falklands sovereignty unemployment statistics and security at the gchq far east listening post he had had lunch with the venezuelan ambassador finally questions in the house when the carew meeting was over there was scheduled a key note policy speech that would be carried on the late evening news broadcasts it is purely conjecture that the son of james carew has carried out a criminal and terrorist attack on the territory of south africa the prime minister said and im not going to give you a decision based on conjecture rather more than conjecture the pus remarked quietly and conjecture or no we still have to finalise a position in view of what can be regarded as changed circumstances carew hangs on thursday what has changed the director general said prime minister we believe that carews son is aware of his fathers true position that his father was an employee of the service that is what has changed further we believe that if he were arrested by the south african security police he would very probably give them that information we also believe that if carew were to know before his execution that his son had been killed or arrested then he might divulge what he has so far withheld on two fronts we confront a new danger very well what do you recommend i do the pus ducked his shoulders the director general was reaching for his pipe silence all around me the prime minister smiled mocked them not normally so reticent gentlemen its surely clear that we find ourselves with two choices of action both unacceptable i suggest we hold onto our seats and trust that nothing happens shifting ground is a poor foundation for trust prime minister the pus said this afternoon prime minister we confirmed that jack curwen did indeed fly to south africa shortly before the police station bombing took place the director general said also that in his work for a demolition company he had acquired a knowledge of explosives in my opinion something will happen this young man can he be stopped by calling in the ambassador and putting all our cards on the table t h e director general said in the present state of our relations with the government of south africa that would be intolerable then as you put it prime minister we hold onto our seats and hope that we have anticipated only the blacker prospects there was a light tap at the door the prime minister shifted in annoyance at the interruption a secretary came in glided past the prime minister with a grimace of apology the secretary spoke in the director generals ear he gestured his excuses and followed her from the room the prime minister reached for a worn leather case as if to indicate that the meeting was concluded if only a few small bombs are thrown at police stations we can weather that i believe i thought youd like to be kept fully informed prime minister the pus pushed himself up from his chair the director general stood in the doorway there was a man behind him a creased raincoat hair that hadnt been combed the director general ushered him into the room just tell the prime minister what youve told me what you understand to be jack curwens objective the man who had been a friend to jimmy sandham looked around him it was a moment to savour he spoke drably without expression flat monotone it is mr curwens intention apparently without anyone elses help to blast his way using a homemade device through the walls of the hanging section of pretoria central prison to his fathers cell this with a view to taking his father out there was an aching silence in the room the director general nudged his man away through the door and closed it the pus whistled his astonishment the director general was stonyfaced the prime ministers head swayed right to left left to right slow movement bemused god help us director general lets call the meeting to a halt before you spring any more surprises on us im going to camp in the airraid shelter for the next five nights and pray either that he makes it out safely with his father or that theyre both killed with their lips sealed given the choice which do you think the good lord would wish me to pray for sam perry had thought it a good notion to take his wife to the golf club social shed lost nearly a stone in weight in the days since jack had left for south africa she was gaunt and moping through the house each day she knew most of the wives at the club and hed thought it would be best for her to be out not sitting in the house and knitting and unpicking what shed knitted hed taken to coming home for his lunch because then they had a chance to talk it through without young will being there they made a show for the youngster when he came rattling in from school in the late afternoon but the child must have known from his mothers appearance that crisis touched his family they talked in the middle of the day but there was nothing to talk about her first husband was going to hang her son was in danger and beyond her reach and sam perry could only say that they had to live with it live in hope on any other evening at the golf club she would have sailed into the drinking shouting crowd confident happy among friends not on this evening she was by his side from the moment they went through the doors and into the bar as if she were frightened to be more than a yard from him while he put away four gins she sipped at two tomato juices and every ten minutes she looked at her watch it hadnt worked out he wondered if it would be better when it was over when jeez was dead and buried when jack had been when jack had come home he thought it would be a bloody long convalescence it was a swine of a thought for sam perry that she might never recover might never regain her fun and the gaiety that he loved in her he knew she had made an effort to come out with him he realised she couldnt last long that evening he saw the pleading in her eyes he started to make their excuses and shake hands as soon as was decently possible he thought of the tittletattle that would follow their backs out of the room thered be a few of them whod get a laugh out of speculating on the problems of sam and hilda perry it was still too early to pick up will from scouts theyd go home first he heard the strong sigh of relief from hilda when they were in the car park and clear of the raucous celebration of the bar a mile to their home sam perry drove slowly he let his left hand rest on her arm moved it only to change gear he turned into churchill close he could hear her crying very faintly dont hurt yourself love he said you couldnt have stopped jack going he looked at her he was going to kiss her cheek he saw her startled staring eyes she was peering through the windscreen and at their home at the end of the cul de sac he saw what she had seen they always drew shut their front bedroom curtains when they went out in the evening nice curtains but not heavy curtains he saw the traverse of the torch beam sam perry braked he backed away to the end of the road he drove fast to the police station to the two constables the ford fiesta was an obvious target of interest it was far from commonplace for an old car to be parked in the shadows between the extremities of the street lights in this sedate suburb via their radio link the constables had heard that two men had been arrested following a forcible entry to a property in churchill close they had heard that four officers had used truncheons to subdue the intruders they had heard that no getaway vehicle had been found in churchill close they had heard that the arrested mens accents were thought to be south african two streets away the fiesta and the man sleeping behind the wheel were worth a check it was smoothly done door opened keys out of the ignition before the man had tumbled awake major swart was escorted to the police station twice in one day major swart extraordinary detective inspector cooper thought the sullen silence of the south african amply repaid the hassle of being called out from home of having to drive from north london into surrey theres ways for foreigners to behave in our country major swart and there are ways that are outside the tramlines sitting in the getaway while your muckers are managing a spot of larceny is right outside the lines three south africans held while in pursuance of a crime was sufficient reason for a call to be made from surrey constabulary hq to the scotland yard duty desk the detective inspector was a member of special branch im here major swart because when we searched your two muckers we found their embassy id cards now major swart im sure youll agree with me that the libyans wouldnt stop short of a spot of larceny or the nigerians perhaps or the eastern bloc chappies but the representatives of the south african government thats going to raise an eyebrow or two is it because they dont pay you much major swart is it a bit of burglary to supplement the overseas allowance he sat on the plastictopped table in the interview room swinging his feet casually swart was on a chair rigidly straightbacked as though he was at attention it amused the detective inspector to think of the turmoil in the mind of the south african exposure disgrace expulsion i have to wonder why half the diplomatic mission from pretoria should have travelled out of london to burgle a home in this nothing town very puzzling major swart because next door i have laid out on a table the items that your muckers were intending to take away with them all pretty peculiar but not so peculiar that i cant hold you and charge you he saw the south african stiffen oh yes therell be charges conspiracy to rob in your case your friends are in deeper trouble of course theft assaulting police officers in the execution of their duty you might get away with eighteen months three or four years theyll get youd thought of that i expect you knew youd be gaoled if you were caught surely you did not nice gaols like yours youll probably all get pentonville thats where they send the short termers pentonville isnt segregated like those nice gaols of yours major swart youll have a bunch of kaffirs on your landing for company he thought the young constable by the door would be having a field day listening to this heap of crap he would tell the constable that if a word of this interview got out then the boy could kiss his promotion up his arse i claim diplomatic immunity bollocks i am major hannes swart i am an accredited diplomat youre a burglar and whats more you dress up in funny clothes and make a spectacle of yourself at funerals i am second secretary in the consular section of the embassy of the republic of south africa you are a security police agent who has engaged in criminal activities i demand the right to telephone my embassy refused the chief inspector grinned in order that my embassy can verify my credentials no chance he turned and he walked out he left the constable with major swart he went into the adjoining interview room and collected off the table the plastic bags inside which were the items collected by the men arrested in churchill close he carried them back for the major to see he laid them on the table in front of him there was a letter in an opened envelope there was a booklet offering south african holidays there was a pamphlet entitled blasting practice nobels explosive co ltd and another blasting explosives and accessories nobels explosive co ltd there was a sales brochure issued by explosives and chemical products ltd of alfreton in derbyshire he saw the south africans eyes hovering over the display he played a hunch he thought he had kept the best until the last from behind his back he produced a seethrough plastic bag in which was a framed photograph it was the photograph of a young man he held it under the south africans nose shit major hannes swart made the two links he linked the photograph with the photofit picture sent from johannesburg he linked the photograph with the young man who had met jacob thiroko shit jack curwen was the bomber in johannesburg and jack curwen was the one whom hed seen talking to jacob thiroko explanations hammering into place the detective inspector watched him keenly i demand the right to contact my embassy crash job is it time of the essence i have the right to telephone my embassy to tell them what your muckers found it is my right to make a telephone call so it can all go on the encoder and hum back home i can establish my identity you have no right to hold me major swart this isnt parking a cd car on a double yellow outside harrods major swart stared at the photograph of jack curwen he no longer listened to the detective inspector his eyes flickered on up to the table up to the opened envelope and the spider writing that addressed the envelope to mrs hilda perry he was a trained policeman excellent on faces he remembered the photograph of james carew he looked at the face of jack curwen the son shit i demand the right to make a telephone call they all say that every pissarsed common thief they all want to telephone their embassies i claim diplomatic immunity i must be getting hard of hearing in my old age major swart smiled he thought it was his winning smile he chuckled he beamed up at detective inspector cooper there was a fractional wink heh man were all policemen together im security police youre special branch same job same problems both fighting the same enemy were on the same side man we have to help each other if you had a problem in the north of ireland and we could help of course wed help just a telephone call man what do you say id say you are a common burglar and id say you are pissing in the wind major swart the detective inspector told the constable to take major swart to the cells down a white tiled corridor a locked door ahead the echo of the feet and the clanging of the keys as if a calmness had come to the major now that he was freed from the sarcasm and goading of his interrogator the door ahead was unlocked they went through the door was locked behind him closed in by the walls to the corridor and by the bright ceiling lights major swart understood the cell door was open waiting for him folded blankets on the bed and a bucket and a roll of lavatory paper on the floor beside it the door slammed behind him he sagged onto the bed he understood he understood why he was refused normal diplomatic facilities why immunity was denied him why a telephone was kept from him why a senior special branch officer had been brought late at night from london to this shit pit town he had grasped the importance of james carew he understood that james carew was their man he ran the three steps to the door he was beating with his fists at the steel facing bruising his hands bellowing his anger i know who your bloody carew is heh got it i know hes your bloody undercover man i know he is i demand a telephone i demand access to my embassy his words rang around his head beat at his ears he knew that no bastard heard him it was a bleak little room there were posters of the smiling leader on the walls and boxes of pamphlets piled on the bare floorboards the prime ministers speech to the constituency workers had failed because before it was delivered the message had come through that the director general was arriving for discussion on a matter of the utmost urgency theyre incommunicado at the moment yes prime minister but major hannes swart an accredited diplomat can if he is released as diplomatic procedures require furnish the security police authorities with information that in my opinion could lead them to judge that jack curwen will attack the maximum security section of pretoria central prison if those authorities were to receive such information it would in my judgement considerably improve their chances of arresting or killing curwen there was a gleam of mischief in the prime ministers eye when would curwen move tonight perhaps tomorrow night i doubt hed leave it until darkness on wednesday too fine does he stand any chance let me sidetrack recently a man called jacob thiroko visited london he was a principal officer in the military wing of the african national congress the special branch officer controlling the business at leatherhead has given us the basis of a connection between curwen and thiroko albeit a fragile one last week thiroko flew back to lusaka and immediately set off with a small team back across the south african border he was ambushed and killed with all the members of his group in the northern transvaal i suggest thiroko would only have ventured into his country to lead a major operation a major operation could be interpreted as an attack on the maximum security gaol where four members of an anc cadre are held and who will be hanged on thursday with carew now thirokos dead very possibly young curwen now stands alone no chance in my opinion no perhaps i exaggerate tell me a few years ago three men broke out of the white political prison thats about a quarter of a mile from where carew is due to hang in the annals of escapology it was pretty remarkable every time they saw a key on a warders chain they memorised it and when they were in the workshops they used those memories to make a key their collection opened just about every door in this very secure compound at night they used to let themselves out of their cells with their keys so that they could try every route that was available to them but each time they came up against high walls that were floodlit overlooked by watch towers they decided the only way out was through the front gate and thats the way they w e n t if youd asked me knowing what they planned to do what were their chances id have said one in two million if he were to succeed if he were to bring his father home i would face the collapse of this governments foreign policy in relation to south africa our position of persuasion towards reform would become meaningless pragmatic politics demand that they fail prime minister and die silent emotion requires that they succeed director general it is only for his father the director general said i doubt that a month ago hed ever given south africa ten minutes thought the prime minister said i hope he succeeds hold them at leatherhead to give the boy his chance and after hes had his chance we have to face the music the man at leatherhead well shrug it off the director general left by a back exit picking his way between the garbage bags it was past midnight ros and jan still not back jack worked methodically he was on the floor of the living room of the service flat ros had rented it using jacks money paid over the odds in deposit and said shed be back to sign the papers the next day he had the tube on the floor from a sheet of light aluminium he had cut a triangular shape that he had bent into a cone a squat witchs hat with pliers he had fastened steel wire at intervals along the cone and then secured the wire with heavy adhesive tape george hawkins had told him that the speed of the detonation would be metres per second the wire and the sticky tape would hold and do their job for the minifraction of time before the aluminium cone fused in white heat to become the boring projectile travelling ahead of the explosive force he placed the cone into the metal tube the open end leading pushing it gently forward till his arm was lost in the tube cautiously he took the slabs of explosive and worked them puttylike down the long length of the tube squeezing them with his finger tips first into the angle between the cone and the tubes sides and then back to the central point of the cone he knew that explosive without a firing agent was harmless but it took some faith to believe it the explosive was packed round the cone he had used three and a half pounds working on with care not hurrying because the hawkins method was care and never hurry he packed a further eight and a half pounds of explosive weighed meticulously into the tube and behind the point of the cone george had been very specific the packing must be even and firm jack worked long and hard at the packing sweat sheening his forehead georges lessons kept flickering into his head three and three quarter pounds of explosive will punch inches into sandstone with an entry hole a maximum of inches wide he had a tube that was nine inches in diameter he had twelve pounds of explosive to use nine inches of diameter and twelve pounds of explosive were the only facts that mattered a damn to him and he had no primer no priming charge george had talked to him of six ounces of priming charge to lie between the detonator and the polar ammon gelignite for the high velocity trigger into the explosive he didnt have a priming charge forget the bloody priming charge he had three detonators he taped two together with his finger he worked a slim hole into the packed explosive in the tube the two taped detonators into the slim hole the beginning of the arming of the shaped charge bomb with a sharp knife from the kitchen he cut a yard off the length of cordtex equivalent very slowly maximum care he had eased the cordtex equivalent into the protruding socket of one of the detonators making it live powerful enough to explode him through the walls of the flat to devastate that corner of the block with pliers he crimped the socket of the detonator to the cordtex equivalent had to be two detonators because he had no priming charge he made a sludge of ready mix concrete he kneaded it against the explosive and around the detonators and around the length of cordtex equivalent set concrete to make the block at one end of the tube to drive the explosive force forward undiluted against the cone at the other end of the tube later he would tie a length of safety fuse to the cordtex knot it and bind it jack had completed the shaped charge when they came hack when they came through the door he was assembling the last of his explosive in a three pound charge linked by his last detonator to cordtex equivalent and safety fuse all clear in his mind where he would use the shaped charge and where the smaller explosive charge and where the cordtex equivalent on the grilles because george had told him that cordtex would blow away the grille bolts slice them he was on his knees on the carpet when they came back and writing on a torn scrap of paper he had written rope and bent metal we took a car ros said jan said she didnt know it was so easy to open a car up and drive it away the two stared down at jacks handiwork a breathlessness in ross voice is it going to do the job if it doesnt ill be giving hell to an old guy in england when i get back jack grinned how so jack said this is the first time ive ever built anything like it the first time but youre supposed to be its the first time jack said ros turned away she was shaking her head broad sweeps and the red ribbon in her hair flowing a crack in her voice and you havent even thought how youll get away in the car where youll go my fatherll know i think its pathetic i dont have the time ros its way past midnight ive only today i dont have time time to go running around the getaway routes and im bloody tired and i dont need lecturing if you want to give a lecture then bugger off out through the door first ill make a cup of tea she said jan levered himself down onto the floor beside jack they studied the plan of pretoria central and magazine hill jan pointed to the place where the car would be waiting shrugged away the distance between pretoria central and the car jack led jan through the map points where the grenades would be thrown where the pistol shots would be fired and then youll get the hell out you have to give that promise you do what youre going to do and you get clear you dont stay about to see the show you go home and you get into your beds and you go to the university in the morning and ros goes to work it never happened you were never involved he saw the struggle working at the face of jan van niekerk jack said i have to know that youre clear thatll be a strength to me you have to make me that promise he saw the way that the crippled boys fingers stroked the heavy arms of the wire cutter light delicate fingers he thought the boy should never have been there ros stood in the doorway she held two mugs of tea to give you strength we promise never hesitate turn your backs on me i promise jan said ros leaned forward with the mug of tea for jack her eyes were misted he thought she was at the limit when are you going to sleep jack he smiled ill catnap when the old mans driving bloody old taxi driver can drive all n i g h t the smile swiped off his face oh christ furious concentrated anger spreading over him i missed a window jack hissed the mug rocked in his hands i have the outer wall i have the wall onto the exercise yard i have the window onto the catwalk i have the grille down into the cell ive all of that accounted for i dont have the window between the catwalk and the grille over the cell youre going to kill yourself ros said he didnt seem to have heard he was ripping at the adhesive wrapping he had made around the three pound charge what are you going to do just hope that a pound and a half on each will do the two windows and one without a detonator they left him they couldnt help him they left him on the floor with the sweet almond smell of gelignite they would sleep together on the one bed dressed and in each others arms they would hold each other to shut out the certainty of their fear he lay on his bed he could not sleep he stared up at the frail light patterned by the grille wires the trap had been tested during the afternoon the trap falling under a weighted sack there was a cool wind and the cold came into jeezs cell through the window between his cell and the catwalk and the window between the catwalk and the night he heard the shuffle of the feet of the guard on the catwalk above and the guttering cough as the man cleared his throat he heard the snore of the prison officer who was locked into the corridor of c section he heard the dribbling of the singing muffled because the sound swam along the catwalks all the way from a section or b section keeping a poor bastard company because there was a poor bastard who was going to hang in four hours time jeez wondered if anyone slept when they were going to hang in four hours time jeez had another fifty hours of living and he couldnt sleep either tuesday already started wednesday tomorrow wednesday was library day hed hear the trap going on wednesday and the sack under the trap would be of his weight he could end it all of course he could he had it in his power to make an end of it he could shout for the officer sleeping in the corridor the officer would send for the duty major the duty major would ring through to the night duty officer at john vorster square the night duty officer at john vorster square would rouse the colonel he had the promise of the colonel for his life if he coughed the details on the cadres and the safe houses and the arms caches just one shout fucking cruel typical of the pigs that they offered the judas kiss as the price for living it had just been a job for him watching over the african national congress just an assignment from old colonel basil wasnt supposed to get involved not physically and not with the heart just supposed to be bumming on the fringe just supposed to be a listener and a writer of reports hed hang with happy and charlie and percy and tom fucking cruel that it was better to hang with them than to make the judas kiss and live a life sentence in a boer white gaol jeez reckoned to find friends where he was didnt go looking for them found them when he needed them thered been a guy in spac good guy teacher theyd been friends for six years close enough to pick the lice from each others heads a good guy and a good friend and hed died in the snow with a bullet hole in his nape his best friend in spac and jeez had been on the detail that pickaxed the grave out of the ironfrozen ground he wouldnt have given that friend the judas kiss not just for life he would make new friends he would be friends with happy and charlie and percy and tom in the corridor going towards the door that was always closed hed be their friend in the preparation room and when they went through the doorway and into the shed hed be their friend when it was the hood and when it was the noose hed not give them the bloody judas kiss no way he would shout for the bastard sleeping in the corridor of c section he did not understand why the arm of century hadnt reached for him hurt hurt hard lying on his bed gazing at the dull light bulb through the mesh of the grille to think that century had dropped him off the team he had the proof that they had dropped him the proof was the bloody cell he was locked into and the hours that were left to him couldnt think about it because thinking of the team was fucking agony for jeez think of some other bloody thing think of why hilda hadnt written think of hilda in a nice house with a nice husband with a nice life think of the boy who was his and who was hildas think of the boy who would be twentyseven years old next birthday think of the boy jack think of anything other than the trap hammering in practice on wednesday afternoon after library he couldnt picture now what the boy his son looked like first thing in the morning first thing at his desk the colonel called london the london embassy told him that major swart was not yet in his office the colonel said that he would not be calling unless it was of great urgency the london embassy told him that the majors home had already been contacted that the majors wife had not seen him since the previous day the colonel said that it was an outrage that they had no contact with their man the london embassy told the colonel that as soon as they had contact with major swart they would pass on the message for him to call john vorster square priority as if a door slammed in the colonels face his investigation had been at a gallop a name an address overseas a photofit likeness because the door had slammed he did not know how to go forward a piece of basic beginners school detective work was all that was required from london but major swart had gone walkabout and the door was slammed he went down the stairs to the incident room expressionless he reported that london had not yet been able to furnish the material necessary for short circuiting a lengthy investigation he knew he had lost ground he made a lame suggestion he suggested that all the two and three star hotels in johannesburg should be checked again is he standing firm sir the civil servant had brought the first briefing papers of the day the minister of justice smiled the state president hes in great form i was with him yesterday firm as they come no question of clemency im surprised you ask because of the overnight telegrams washington the vatican the speaker of the european parliament in strasbourg the security council the secretary general of the commonwealth they all came in overnight a formality but you have missed one those are all the cables sir what about the united kingdom no word from her britannic majestys ratbag i noted that the civil servant said no message has come from the united kingdom the minister of justice clapped his hands did you see the opinion poll from the free state we are going to win that byelection because i was photographed at the grave of gerhardt prinsloo and because the pritchard five will hang but curious that the united kingdom is silent jack stood with jan below the wide climbing steps leading to the rearing stone hulk of the vortrekker monument jan spoke savagely of this edifice to afrikaner power and mythology as if it were something evil a national monument to privilege and superiority he showed jack with an angry pointing finger the carved relief of trekker wagons that formed a laager around the monument and the great hewn corner statues of the boer leaders with their rifles and the bronze of the trekker woman and her children jack thought the boys intensity was unreal just a drug to give him courage for himself he didnt listen he stood with his back to the monument and looked across the valley to the south side slopes of magazine hill there was a wire fence at the floor of the valley at the bottom of the hill the ground on the slope was rough half cleared cut by a stone vehicle track to the right side as he looked of magazine hill was the sweep of the johannesburg motorway the ben schoeman highway that would come round behind the hill on which the voortrekker monument had been built to the left side of magazine hill was a separate fenced area which his plans told him was the armys firing range directly ahead the crown of magazine hill was covered with tall and heavy pine trees rich green and he could see buildings in the shelter of the trees he made his estimates he tried to judge the distance from the floor of the valley to the crown of magazine hill he tried to see where he could lie up if he were ahead of schedule over which ground he could hurry if he was late he thought it could not be more than two hundred yards from the crown down the hidden treecovered slope to the walls of beverly hills he turned his back on magazine hill and walked to the far side of the voortrekker monument to see down below where the car would be left it was a hell of a distance to come back more than a mile his own thought that in the chaos after the attack he and jeez would be better on the scrub hills on foot than immediately into a car but a hell of a way for all that in the line between magazine hill and the ben schoeman highway was another stony outcrop he saw the summit of it had been shaped whats that skanskopfort built to protect pretoria historic monument colonial cannons and that crap lived in jan shook his head its just a museum and an army store jack walked again to the steps he stood in the morning sunlight he gazed again on the slope of magazine hill the slope that he would climb that evening they went to ross car jan drove back to pretoria in two heaps jacks possessions were laid out on the floor in one heap was his suitcase and his coat he had told jan to dump them from ross car once they were on the way back to johannesburg the other heap was what he would take with him that night there was the metal tube and the prepared cordtex equivalent and safety fuse lengths and the two charges for the windows and the shotgun and the ammunition and the wire cutters and the rope and the bent metal hook that was lashed to it all to be carried up magazine hill the bedroom door opened ros had taken the ribbon from her hair she had washed the makeup from her cheeks and her eyes and from her lips she was ice calm pale matter of fact lose yourself jan jan looked at her blinking not understanding just get rid of yourself lose yourself what for because i tell you to where to go and check the other car make sure it isnt being watched walk the streets anywhere ros came to jan and took his arm and kissed him on the cheek and led him to the door she opened the door and pushed him out through it she closed the door she came to jack she reached for his hand she might have been leading a child she led him into the bedroom he thought she might have been crying while he had been at the voortrekker monument and looking over magazine hill she did not look into his face she was clumsy with her fingers as she unbuttoned his shirt slid it away across his shoulders to let it fall from his arms she knelt in front of him and lifted away his shoes and peeled off his socks she reached up to unfasten his belt and to ease down the zipper she was kneeling as she pushed her light sweater up and over her head jack stood in his nakedness and watched her he knew he loved her he loved every part of her scrubbed clean body she stood to step out of her skirt she drove her pants down to below her knees jack reached for her he felt the loveliness of her she stepped back from him a slow sad smile she took his hand she took him to the bed she broke she pushed him hard down onto the bed she came down onto him she was sobbing her heart to him she tore at the skin on his back with her nails she hurt him as she bathed him in her tears she was stretching apart over him reaching for him guiding him driving onto him you cruel bastard jack for coming into my life for going out of it she lay beside him and her cheek rested on the centre of his chest she could feel the steady rhythm of his heart in her ear she thought he was at peace with her fingers with her nails she made shapes and patterns amongst the hairs of his chest she formed the letters of his name she wrote amongst the hairs of her love for him the curtains in the room had been open when she had taken him to the bed she could see that the skies were darkening now over pretoria and she could sense the thickening of the traffic on the streets below the window she hated the coming of the evening she felt a safety with this man as they lay against each other damp warm and loving safety there was a safety when his arm was around her his hand over her breast she knew that she could not hold him in the bed she had seen the way that a few minutes before he had shifted his hand from her stomach to look down at the face of his watch before returning his hand to the place of pleasure and comfort she knew that when the hour hand had trickled and the minute hand had rushed that he would leave her she acknowledged that on this evening on this last evening that she played the role of second best she accepted that she was secondary to the work of the evening that would start when he leaned across her kissed her pushed her back onto the pillow and left her bed she thought that she had helped him her friends had told her that the first time was awful ros van niekerk happy in her moist heat safe with a mans hand over her breast and with his fingers over the flatness of her stomach thought it was not at all awful he hadnt used anything she hadnt used anything not an act of gratification not an occasion when adults who knew their minds discussed the merits of pills and coils a time for soft urgent loving between two young people who would part when the hand of a watch had run its hour she thought she did not care about the consequences of his not having used anything of her not having used anything his hand moved she felt the aloneness of the skin on her stomach she felt his fingers climbing the slow length of her body and brushing the nipple of her breast she opened her eyes she saw that he looked at his watch she hated the watch how long just a few minutes i cant keep you you knew you couldnt to have found something precious and to lose it something wonderful to remember ros jack kissed her closed her eyes with his kisses with his tongue he ran over the nostrils and the fresh lips of his girl so calm as if when he left her he would go for an evening walk a stroll that was without danger she clung to him her arms were around his neck her breasts were forced against the jutted strength of his jaw please no hurting yourself ros she thought that if she cried she would weaken him she thought that to weaken him was to further endanger him and that was absurd because there could not be more danger than where he was going she choked on the tears she squeezed the wetness from her eyes trying great girl how long less than a few minutes will i ever see you again she faltered remember the brilliance ros of being loved and remember the brilliance that you gave me with your love he looked again at his watch she felt him start to move and god she didnt want him to go and god she was without the power to stop his going she rolled away from him she lay on her back and the bed sheet hid her knees she laid her arm over her eyes so that she would not see the moment of his going from her bed from her side it was only for you jack i know that because i love my country thats my guilt that ive made you fight what you love my country jack thats more than a rabble of politicians ros my countrys politicians and the bastard desk men they ditched my father and left him to hang but i too can still love my country and i love my brother and i hate his cause because his cause is bombs and guns his way is killing and loathing and fear his way takes us to ruin destroys the country that i love and will destroy the brother that i love how long he kissed her as if they both knew it would be for the last time he snapped off the bed he went to his clothes he started to dress she lay in the darkness her eyes under her arm she heard the movement of his body she could not let her eyes see him she felt his hands on her head lifting her head she felt the cold of the chain on her neck on the skin above her breasts she opened her eyes she saw the gold chain she lifted the crucifix of gold to see it better wear it and remember i wont forget you jack not ever she watched him go out through the door she heard his desultory conversation with jan in the living room she heard him speak aloud as he went through his check list of the items he would carry up magazine hill and down magazine hill to the gaol she was numbed too unhappy now for tears she swung her legs off the bed as she dressed she heard jack talking to jan they had moved on to the list of street places at which the grenades would be thrown where the pistol shots were to be fired her fingers played with the crucifix she thought she would wear it for the rest of her life for the ever of her life she had promised that in the morning she would be at her office desk and jan had promised that he would be in the lecture theatre at wits at home in the top drawer of her wardrobe there was a yellow silk scarf she thought that when she was again in her room that night when she was back with her parents and everything familiar she would leave her curtains open and she would tie the yellow scarf to the handle of the window and she would allow the light from beside her bed to be thrown against the yellow scarf and to be seen outside her window it was important to her that the yellow scarf should be seen should be her beacon to save him her fingers were tight on the edges of the crucifix when she was dressed she went into the living room sitting on the floor with the street map of pretoria spread out in front of him jan looked up at her he was grinning amused she blushed bit bourgeois ros handing out home comforts to the troops before the battle she ignored her brother can i do anything jack have you a nail file metal yes please would you take the serial number off the shotgun arent you going to take it with you to the border just in case i get separated from it jack said easily youll need it all the way to the border wouldnt want it to fall into the wrong hands come back to you it was insane to be thinking about the border jack passed her up the shotgun and he pointed to the serial number she took it into the bedroom where she had left her handbag she would remember him for ever as she had seen him in her bed because she would never see him again the assistant dropped frikkie de kok off home pretty damned stupid when he thought about it that he should have an armed escort every time he went to pretoria central and an armed escort back from pretoria central but nothing when he took hermione shopping nor when he took his boys to the loftus versfeld for rugby it had gone pretty well a pretty damned good days work the assistant had done him proud right from the start in the morning right from the time his assistant had picked him up he had told him to take his time not to get himself rushed just to go through the procedure the way he had seen frikkie do it it had been fine because it was only one man the assistant had executed his first man not that he had officially executed the man not that it went into the paperwork that he had done it but the arrangement had been made with the governor the governor could not really have put the spoke in because the governor had to accept that if a man was booked for hanging on a tuesday or a thursday and frikkie de kok happened to have the influenza or he had ricked his back in the garden then the man still had to go frikkie de kok with influenza or a bad back shouldnt be a reason for a stay of execution and the time came when an assistant had to prove himself show that he could manage the work himself and pretty damn well hed done for a first time frikkie had been behind him ready to lend a hand if he was needed and he hadnt been all right his assistant had been a little clumsy when they brought the fellow into preparation but who wouldnt have been on his first time with the responsibility a little aggressive with the pinions a little rough moving the fellow onto the centre of the trap a little hard when he had hooded him a very little bit fierce when he had ringed the fellows neck with the noose little things not grounds for complaint little things to be pointed out over a beer no trouble with the drop the assistant had made his calculations to the inch and to the pound just right the drop had been frikkie de kok had shaken his assistants hand while the rope still shivered while a young creep on compulsory attendance was in the corner throwing up over his uniform just frikkie de koks view and privately held but it wasnt right to have youngsters in the hanging gaol not the youngsters who had joined the prison service as an alternative to conscription into the army and service in the operational area the hanging gaol should be for professionals not for shirkers just his opinion afterwards he and his assistant had stayed all day in maximum security because thursday was a multiple five on the trap thursday took preparation six was the most he could do but that was a hell of a business even with a good assistant two and three and four at a time were pretty much all right but fives and sixes were hard on everyone present when he was busy round the trap he never looked at the spectators too much on his mind with the pinions and the hoods and the feet being right and the noose but he could hear them he could hear his audience gasping willing him to go faster stood to reason that fives and sixes couldnt be as fast as hanging one man alone frikkie de kok as he always said to his assistant would never hurry to hurry was the fastest way to a fiasco so they had stayed at the gaol all day and they had made their preparations and because he had a combined condemns weight of kilos on the trap he had gone down underneath and checked each single bolt and screw of the trap it paid to be careful in frikkie de koks job a good days work and after his tea his assistant was coming back to collect him and there would be a good evenings entertainment at the harlequins a floodlit cup match he was thinking of his shower and of getting out of his suit as he pushed open his front garden gate he was thinking of the match as he came up the path and how the second team flank forward would cope because he was replacing the injured first choice he opened his front door he could see into the living room his two boys singlets and shorts red cheeks and sweat pumping iron on his living room carpet so they shared the weights beautiful to frikkie de kok to see his boys working on the weights and beautiful for him to hear that his hermione was in the kitchen making his tea beautiful also to be going to the harlequins for a match and beautiful to know that he had a quiet day to follow before his waking before dawn on thursday he thought he could smell a meat pie from the kitchen and he thought the harlequins would beat defence and he thought he would make a hell of a fine job of dropping five on thursday morning the colonel listened intently sometimes it was a good line from london that evening it was a poor line he was listening on an open line to the brigadier who headed security police operations throughout western europe major hannes swart enjoyed a particular autonomy in london but nominally he reported to the brigadier he had forgotten the funeral slipped it from his mind aunt annie was dead buried gone he had forgotten the ministers rallying words and the repetitive threat of the afrikaners vengeance he had forgotten them because they were meaningless they were rhetoric when set against the real warfare of his own battlefield they would have been carrying their ids so it cannot be a hospital situation if they had been in any form of accident then we would have heard from the police or from a hospital i have checked back over the instructions that were sent to hannes yesterday morning i have had a man go down to this churchill close address not easy there is a police car parked outside the house so i have a problem what sort of inquiry am i to make delicate eh you understand me this afternoon i have been to the foreign office and i have reported that hannes and his two colleagues are missing perhaps the man i meet is lying perhaps he is in ignorance he tells me that he has no knowledge of the whereabouts of these three members of our staff i cannot ask him if they are in police custody because he will ask me why i should suppose that im at a halt the telephone purred in the colonels ear he thought the brigadier didnt give a shit for the john vorster square bomb the bastard was swanning in paris and london and amsterdam and bonn the bastard was freeloading in europe he rang through to the library he requested all communications over the previous month from major swart of the london embassy he was told such records were classified he said he knew they were classified he was told that for access to classified communications he needed the countersignature of the head of library on the docket he shouted into the telephone that he knew access to classified communications required the countersignature of the head of library he was told the head of library was at supper had left the building would be back in minutes what a fucking way to run a fucking intelligence gathering operation he telephoned his wife he told her he would not be home until late he said he thought the funeral had gone well she told him that the immersion heater had broken the thermostat had failed that there was no hot water in the house he asked her what she wanted did she want south africa sleeping safe or did she want her husband as a plumber for gods sake they moved all of their possessions to the corridor leading to the front door their bags and the explosives and the firearms each of them held a handkerchief underneath the kitchen tap and then set to work methodically to clean the rooms of finger prints jack took the bedroom jan the living room and ros did the kitchen not for the sake of jacks prints but for the brothers and the sisters when they had finished they carried the bags and the explosives and the firearms down the back fire escape to the car park to ross beetle and to the car she and jan had stolen jeez sat on his bed sergeant oosthuizen had moved his chair from the end of the c section corridor by the locked doorway to outside jeezs cell he allowed jeezs door to be three four inches open it was in direct contradiction of regulations at this time in the evening with the lights dimmed jeez should have been locked into his cell he was like a terrier with a rabbit with conversation if jeez didnt respond to him then sergeant oosthuizen asked a question that demanded an answer as though good sergeant oosthuizen had determined that a man who was to hang in less than a day and a half was best served by making conversation jeez didnt know his mind didnt know whether he wanted to hear the retirement plans over again didnt know whether he was better with the silence and the worm of his own thoughts a new worm crawling the worm was money money in the bank earning interest accumulating he had the account number and century had the account number who would tell hilda the number the guy who used to know him in accounts old threlfall bloody long time retired worry worming as a cash register and trying to hold the thread against oosthuizens battering he understood why sergeant oosthuizen talked about his retirement and about his kids it was all oosthuizen could talk about that did not drive coaches through the already broken regulations he couldnt talk about the state presidents plans for reform because jeez wouldnt be there to see them he couldnt talk about the unrest because jeez to him was a part of that unrest he couldnt talk about jeez about jeez being the centre of whispering interest through the gaol because it was tuesday night and jeez was to hang at dawn on thursday good sergeant oosthuizen ploughed on from his exhausted retirement plans into the difficulties at his sons liquor store in louis trichardt the murmur sounds of singing jeez heard them not the great choir of that dawn when a single man had gone to his death when the whole company of blacks had sung the hymn to strengthen him as he walked the corridor to the shed of execution a fist of voices only oosthuizen heard the singing and the slam of a door that cut into the singing and he was off his chair and straightening his tunic and heaving his chair away from jeezs door and back to the proper place beside the exit door from the corridor of c section firm bold singing more of an anthem than a hymn im sorry carew believe me i have to lock you up the singing was approaching a few voices along with the stamp of boots and the shouts in afrikaans for doors ahead to be opened whats happening theyre bringing the others down the other four theyre going to double them up in two cells in here why sergeant oosthuizen snorted you know i cannot tell you man the door closed oosthuizen turned the key the corridor door opened oosthuizen had keys only for the cells not for the door leading into the main corridor of c section of course sergeant oosthuizen could not tell jeez why the pritchard five were to be together of course the prison officer couldnt chattily explain that for the final few hours it was more convenient to have all five men in one wing one section where the disruption to prison life would be minimised not an ordinary hanging because the five men were from umkonto we sizwe a hanging that raised the tension pitch in the gaol jeez knew another reason that of course good sergeant oosthuizen could not explain to him thursday morning dawn on thursday and they wouldnt want to be bringing four men from b section and one man from c section because they might not have their watches together and one might walk too fast and one might have to wait in preparation and some might have to be scrambled down the corridors to the hanging shed get them all cosily together separated from a section and b section so that the rest of the gaol was less disturbed made sense to jeez the door into the corridor of c section was unlocked jeez heard the singing rest in peace comrade moloise he heard the voices of happy zikala and charlie schoba and percy ngoye and tom mweshtu long live comrade mandela brilliant voices that were without fear long live the african national congress he shook his head his chin was trembling he felt the moisture welling in his eyes he heard them all shout together happy and charlie and percy and tom heh comrade jeez heh comrade amandla hear us comrade jeez amandla comrade jeez his voice was a quaver listen you bastards dont you ever bloody listen to anything i bloody tell you what did i tell you lets have a bit of dignity lads thats what i told you bastards way back he heard the shrieks of their laughter he heard the orders of the duty major he heard the driving shut of two cell doors he heard the duty major demanding they should settle down for the night he heard the closing of the door into c sections main corridor they were still singing jeez thought his friends had found him he called for sergeant oosthuizen he saw the bulk of the man at the grille aperture on his cell door he thought of the way they had laughed when he had called for a bit of dignity doesnt it frighten you sergeant oosthuizen that they arent afraid jack parked the stolen car a hundred yards from the turning onto the ben schoeman highway he switched off the lights eyes closed he sagged back in his seat it was the inevitable moment he had come for he felt an awful tiredness through his body he heard ros bring her beetle to a stop behind him he stepped out of his car it was a renault he thought it had a decent engine and could make some speed he had filled the tank and had checked the oil himself he walked to the beetle jan was in the back half buried with equipment and the bags he settled in beside ros stretching above them was the slope to the fort that jan had said was called skanskopfort ros drove away she reversed sharply swung and went back to the ben schoeman she took them to the far side of skanskop to the road at the bottom of the valley between skanskop and magazine she drove off the road and onto a stone chip track and jolted them as she braked jack was out fast jan passed him the cumbersome shape of the metal tube that he had been cradling in his lap because the shaped charge was armed then the bag that held the smaller charges and the lengths of cordtex equivalent and safety fuse and the rope he laid them on the stones then took the shotgun that was loaded to capacity and the opened box of cartridges that he stuffed into his anorak pocket last came the heavy wire cutters difficult in the dark because ros had cut the lights as soon as they had left the ben schoeman he studied the luminous face of his watch he called the time the time was oclock and minutes and seconds and he counted through to and seconds three watches synchronised he had given himself one hour less three minutes before the decoying diversions he slung the bag over his shoulder he hooked the metal tube into the angle of his elbow more than forty pounds weight of it he pushed the wire cutters into his pocket with the shotgun ammunition he reached his hand into the darkness of the back of the car he felt jans two fists grip his hand next he leaned across the front passenger seat and his fingers found ross chin and drew it forward so that he could kiss her mouth brief an instant ill wear it always my mother gave it me if she knew you shed like you to have it he stepped back he picked up the shotgun he pushed the passenger door shut with the toe of his jogging shoe he didnt know what was in her face couldnt see her face the engine exploded to life the wheels bit into the loose stones the car pulled away she did not turn on her lights until she was back at the main road jack laid down the metal tube and the shotgun and took a handful of earth in his cupped hands and spat on it to make the soil moist and then smeared what was mud over the pale surfaces of his face he looked into the distance away to the main road he saw a single set of headlights and then the red flash of tail lights between trees and bushes he lifted the metal tube and the shotgun one under each arm and he started to walk away from the track and towards the start of the slope up magazine hill there was a sharp wind small clouds a half moon enough light for him to move without lumbering into the thicker scrub bushes he had thought when he had seen the slope in daylight that the ground had been cleared a dozen years or so before then allowed to grow again he madehimself pattern he climbed for a counted fifteen paces then stopped to listen for ten seconds when he stopped he could hear a radio playing music ahead of him where the prison service buildings were on top of magazine the stream of traffic on the ben schoeman was below him and away to the west a ribbon of fast moving lights as he climbed the sounds of the main road guttered and he was alert to the new sounds of the hillside the radio playing music the frantic wing clatter of a disturbed nesting bird and a drum beat on planks it took jack the full ten seconds of a listening pause to identify the drum beat he remembered that when he had stood with jan at the voortrekker monument and looked across at the slope of magazine that he had seen a low wooden watchtower half way up the hill away to the east of where he climbed the tower had not been manned in daylight he realised he had heard the sounds of booted feet stamping on a plank platform perhaps for warmth perhaps out of boredom he couldnt see the tower not high enough for it to be silhouetted against the grey blue faint light of the night sky he could sense the general direction of the tower and he could picture what he had seen from the voortrekker monument he knew that the tower was set the far side of the wire fence that he had identified when he had stood with jan on reconnaissance he wondered if the bastard who stamped his feet on the plank platform would have a night sight on his rifle sod all use having the bastard there if he didnt have a night sight because if he didnt have one then the bastard was as blind as jack had to reckon that he had a night sight on his rifle or infrared binoculars or an image intensifier spy glass the reckoning pushed jack down on his knees had him crawling forward the slope was a dark and indistinct mass above him he could only see the trees and scrub bushes that were within three four yards of his face less when the clouds hid the moon the fence seemed to rush at him to materialise above him when he was on the point of collision very gently he laid down the metal tube and the shotgun he wriggled the bag on its strap over into the small of his back so that it would not impede him his fingers groped forward so bloody insensitive his fingers because they were cold and bruised from when he had crawled on his hands and knees his fingers stretched to feel the pattern of the wire mesh a dark mesh fence against dark ground and his fingers must do the work for him and he must lie still and move only the barest minimum in case the bastard on the platform had a night sight or an infrared or an image intensifier his fingers traced the diamonds of the wire mesh he found the strand that he feared his forefinger brushed the single strand that ran along the face of the fence a foot above the ground he touched the first tumbler wire if the wire were disturbed an alarm would ring he noted it stored it his fingers moved on and traced the mesh above the tumbler desperately slow he dared not look at the luminous hands of his watch dared not see how much of his precious time he was spending in the search for a second tumbler wire god if he was late bloody stupid jack had the time he needed didnt know whether he had the patience he needed jack bloody curwen second class businessman from the south of england paid a second class wage to drum up second class work what the hell was he at lying on magazine hill searching for a second tumbler wire he found the second tumbler wire the second tumbler wire was four feet above the ground four feet above where the mesh was buried in the rough soil with the wire cutters he made a square hole between the bottom tumbler wire and the second tumbler wire he lifted the square mesh clear he could feel the heave of his breath he could hear the radio playing and the stamp of the sentry on his platform he lifted the metal tube through the hole and then the shotgun and then his bag he was half way through the hole head and shoulders and chest through when a strand of jagged cut mesh caught at his anorak his knees were on one side of the wire his elbows on the other he squirmed his trunk to reach with his fingers to free himself when he was through he lay on his stomach he was gasping he took his handkerchief from his pocket and looped it through the mesh immediately above the hole it was a risk but everything was a risk it was necessary to leave a marker jack gathered up his metal tube and his bag and his shotgun and the wire cutters so tired he crawled forward he was on his knees and using the hand that held the shotgun for leverage he dared not let the metal tube buffet the ground the metal tube was twelve pounds of explosive and two detonators and cordtex equivalent the metal tube was a primed bomb held close against his chest he was going forward he saw the light on his hands his head started up the light from the gable end of a concrete building was thrown from his right fell on him he had crawled forward concentration locked nursing the shotgun and the tube and he had not realised that he had reached the summit of the slope of magazine hill he moved fast to his left shuffling as a crab to reach shadow he could hear the music clearly he could hear voices and laughter he lay on his stomach and he heard the sounds of men who had no care no suspicion shadow was his security he stayed with the shadows as he moved away across the top plateau of the hill towards a line of trees he crossed paths he ducked past buildings he froze against a wall when a uniformed man came belching out of a doorway to urinate on the edge of a lawn high trees coated the skyline ahead of him and above the trees was an umbrella of hazed white light the tube was an agony on the muscles of his left arm his feet were leaden heavy but the white light above the trees was a talisman for him pulling him forward he came into the trees going slowly because under the conifers canopy he could see only the white knuckles of his fingers that were tight on the stock of the shotgun he broke from the trees his path was crossed by a tarmac road he could see darkened buildings and more trees ahead of him and the light above the trees were fiercer he looked right and he looked left he stood still and he listened he heard dogs barking he ran across the road and sagged against the back fence of a garden he thought from his map that he had reached the line of senior officers homes that were set on the hillside above beverly hills the moon helped him he saw a narrow track leading between two garden fences not wide enough for a vehicle there was another road crossing the far end of the track and he could see street lights ahead of him was a great cascade of light fit to blind him he felt the energy surging through him he was going forward a voice a man talking as to a child a voice and footsteps a caressing voice as if to quieten a child down flat squeezing his face side down into the dirt of the track he was in darkness short of the light thrown from the road ahead he saw a dog handler with a german shepherd the dog handler was cooing soft nonsense to his animal jack saw that the dog handler had an automatic rifle resting on the elbow of his right arm he heard the voice drift away he waited thirty seconds before he slowly rose to his feet and went on down the track to where the darkness merged with the light he laid down his tube and his bag and his shotgun he crawled forward he saw the high concrete wall in front of him he saw the sentry tower rising above the wall and above the sentry tower was the bank of floodlights he could sec low tilted roofs beyond the high concrete wall he was separated from the wall by a narrow paved road and by a strip of lawn jack curwen had come a hell of a long way he gazed at the outer wall of beverly hills the outer wall of the hanging gaol if he had shouted then his father would have heard him he looked down at the luminous hands of his watch he had six minutes before the diversion the wall was brilliantly lit in the wash of light from the close set bulbs ahead of him the sentry in the tower had his back to him jack could see the hunch of his shoulders he went back for his metal tube and his bag and his shotgun he crouched down he was shaking he had to will himself to control his fingers he checked the safety fuse length that was knotted to the cordtex equivalent he checked that the cordtex equivalent was firm where it disappeared into the readymix block in the metal tube he opened his bag and ran his fingers stuttering over the charge that contained the detonator and over the charge that did not he felt for the lengths of loose cordtex equivalent and of safety fuse he found the rope that was lashed to the cold bent iron he eased the safety catch off the shotgun he had eight cartridges in the magazine he emptied the remaining cartridges from the carton into his pocket he touched the smooth weight of the wire cutters it was all a matter of belief and arrogance the wall that he faced was of no use to him the wall fronted onto b section and onto the hanging shed he had to be against the wall that fell away down the hillside to his right down towards the glitter lights of pretoria arrogance and now courage he rose to his feet there was a softness in his knees there was a wetness in his belly because he must now walk in the light along the paved road in front of the homes of the senior officers under the watch tower walk for a hundred yards to the corner of the wall cheek too because he must walk as though he belonged he looked at his watch he had a minute and a half he had the metal tube under his arm and the bag on his back he cocked the shot gun he must walk no running no stopping he came off the track he ducked his head as the light found him so that the smear marks of mud on his forehead and cheeks could not be seen from the watchtower in the middle of the road he walked at a steady pace he waited for the rasp of a weapon being cocked he waited for the challenging shout he walked towards the corner of the wall along the road and towards the bend where it followed the side wall down the hill there was a yapping chorus there was a white bundle flying through the open gates from a large garden there was a pekingese dog circling his ankles he saw the garden shielded an elegant bungalow a large elderly woman in a housecoat and bedroom slippers was in pursuit of the dog jacks heart hammered the woman saw a young man who carried a long circular length of metal and a bag and a firearm she lived in the heart of the pretoria central complex she was the wife of the major general who was deputy commissioner of prisons security her bosom lurched forward as she bent to catch the collar of the darting beast she yanked it off the ground the woman spoke to jack in afrikaans and he smiled and nodded and she chastised the dog and jack nodded again and the dog yapped at him and earned itself a volley of reproach and jack took one step away and then two and then the woman was lecturing the beast in earnest and making for her garden and jack was away free the sentry in the watchtower saw the wife of the deputy commissioner talking at her front gate to a man the sentry knew the dog it was rumoured that ferret dog had killed the siamese cat of the daughter of the assistant commissioner of prisons personnel he thought the man must have had business at the deputy commissioners house come there before he had come on duty forty minutes earlier he thought the dog must have chased the man down the drive he thought it was a pity the old cow had come out so fast a pity the man didnt have a chance to put his boot firmly into the ferret dogs arse he walked on he felt the nakedness of his back the wall rose beside him the lights showed him thin knifeedge cracks in the wall between the faced brickwork thiroko had told him that beverly hills was built on a rubbish tip heart hammering he wondered if that helped him helped his twelve pounds of explosive the tip wailing siren very faint no must be singing so bloody frightened there was for jeez a sort of warmth in the singing listening to the singing he had put off his undressing and changing into his coarse cotton pyjamas he knew that once they had started they would not finish they would sing until the rope strangled the breath out of their throats and a warmth too from the wheezed bronchitic breathing of old oosthuizen he wondered what the other two whites in c section thought about sharing their block with black terrorist commies what they thought about jeez being amongst friends he was at the corner he was at the furthest point from the sentry tower and when he was round the corner he would be at the furthest point from the remote camera on the wall above the airlock entrance ros drove fast down from the motorway and onto potgieterstraat jan had his window down and the grenades and the pistols in his lap he heard the men singing a murmur in the night as with leaves in a gentle wind the colonel swayed back in his chair the words telex typed bounced at him from the page james carew had written to mrs hilda perry mrs hilda perry lived at churchill close leatherhead surrey jack curwen lived at churchill close leatherhead surrey he swept open the drawer of his desk he needed the telephone directory of the department of prisons he glanced at his watch he was on the countdown he started to mouth away the final seconds jan ripped the lever of the first rg high explosive grenade tossed it through the window the beetle was coming slowly now past the wall of local at the junction with soetdoringstraat his finger was in the loop of the lever of the next grenade as they approached the gates of sad f headquarters he could see the camera rotating patiently towards him he was fifty yards from the corner behind him seventyfive yards from the camera ahead jack twisted ducked towards the wall he heard the crack thump of the first grenade god i love you little bastard kids the tube down on the ground a foot from the wall paying out the cordtex equivalent and the length of safety fuse looking for the camera and the camera moving at steady inexorable pace towards him about to include him in the vision arc the second grenade explosion the metal box thump of the grenade going he looked again for the camera he saw the camera swinging away from him aiming for the main approach road that came from the direction of the grenade blasts struggling in his pocket for the lighter and his fingers floundering with the car keys the third grenade explosion brilliant bloody kids because youve pulled the camera off pistol shots in the night soft fire crackers half a mile away the lighter in his hand the flame cupped the flame held round the cut edge of the safety fuse jack ran back he flung himself down onto the hard road he pressed his face down onto the road surface a moment of desperate stillness he felt the blast bludgeon over him he felt the pain roaring in his ears he felt the fine draught of the debris hurtling back past him he crawled on his knees and elbows into the grey dust cloud he groped until he found the hole his hands were in the hole and scraping to find the reinforcing steel cords coughing dust spitting fragments cutters from his pocket finding the steel cords fastening the cutters on them heaving with his hands at the arms of the cutters squeezing the arms of the cutters until there was the snap and the tension break he was in the hole choking hacking his shoulders were in the hole if his shoulders were in then the hole was large enough he wanted to scream he wanted to shout that he had won he was crawling through the hole and pulling his bag and lifting his shotgun he wanted to shout because he thought that he had won something he came through he crawled into a lit garden ahead of him was another wall and the ground between him and the other wall was lit as by sunlight he saw to his right the white flood brightness high on the stanchion poles he was charging forward it was seconds after the exploding of the shaped charge he fired six shots from the pump action to blow away the lights not darkness there were the distant lights above the watch tower on the back wall but shadows thrown by trees and shrubs and bushes that were the gardens around the hanging gaol a charge now only speed mattered he saw ahead the pointed roofs of c section i and c section and c section the gaps between the roofs were the exercise yards covered by the grilles he ran towards the gap that marked the exercise yard of c section and his fingers were in his bag reaching for the rope that was lashed to the length of bent iron he could hear nothing his ears were dulled by the explosion at the outer wall in silent ballet a deer that was no taller than his knee cavorted away from him he saw between shadows the noiseless flight of a young warthog the piece of bent iron was in his hands and the rope it was his grappling hook and his climbing rope jack came to the wall he arched the bent iron over the wall he lost sight of its fall he heard the first sound that infiltrated his senses he heard the scrape of the bent iron on the metalwork of the grille above the exercise yard new sounds now flooding his ears as he pulled on the rope tested the strain there was the sound of a siren rising as if it were cranking itself awake there was a shout he heaved on the rope he slid back as the bent iron slipped fastened again slipped again held once more he tugged at the rope using desperate strength the rope and the hook were steady the iron was lodged as a hook into the grille he tucked the shotgun barrel up under the shoulder strap weighed in by the bag hanging across his stomach and his thighs and he started to climb his feet stamped on the wall as he dragged himself upwards it was fiftytwo seconds of time since the shaped charge had detonated against and through the outer wall a life time of jacks experience all about speed all about confusion all about men staying rooted in their positions for precious seconds all about officers who made decisions seconds after being asleep in their homes or dozing in the armchairs of their mess speed from jack confusion from the prison staff his certain purpose their being taken by surprise on these his chance depended he tried to walk up throw his body back from the wall the way the marines or the paratroopers did it but the marines and the paratroopers werent carrying a shotgun and the marines and the paratroopers had proper combat packs and not a grip bag on a shoulder strap and the marines and the paratroopers wouldnt be alone jack climbed the wall his ears now were filled with the howl of the sirens he reached the top he was a darkened figure that swung first an arm and then a leg and then a shoulder and then a torso over the top of the wall nursing his weight off the shotgun he rolled from the top of the wall to crash onto the grille above the exercise yard there was a moment when he was dazed when he saw below him the dull colours of flowers in a small square of earth under the grille if he let himself stop for more than a split second he was dead he pushed himself away from the wall out over the grille the shotgun free in his hands pressing back the safety catch he saw the spit of flame from the window to his right from the window that gave air onto the catwalk above the corridor of c section he was rolling swivelling his hips to turn himself to keep the momentum from his fall because he was rolling moving the rifle shot had missed him and the second shot missed him sharp granite chips of sound against the blanket wail of the siren he aimed the shotgun at the window there had been a pale face visible between the slats of the window the pale face was scarlet peppered gone a scream of pain of fear to merge with the siren jack crouched left hand in his bag the charge with the detonator in his fingers the moment when he had to stop the moment when he had to put down the shotgun on the grille he had the charge in his hand and the roll of adhesive tape fast movements as he pulled himself onto the sloping roof above the cell block as he reached for the window in front of him the window that led to the catwalk the window was a set of vertical bars four inches apart concrete with louvred glass slats he slapped the charge against the central bar his fingers were stripping adhesive tape from the roll he was kicking with his feet to hold a grip on the metal of the sloping roof he had the charge in place he had the adhesive tape back in his bag when he saw the man who lay on the catwalk and moaned and who held his hands across his face he dropped the length of cordtex equivalent and safety fuse back down the slope of the roof he let his grip go his feet slide came to rest on the grille the lighter was in his hand he guarded the flame against the safety fuse he ducked reached for the shotgun plucked out of his pocket more cartridges reloaded the blast sang in his head the explosion blotted out the siren sound and the shouting and the first rumble of booted feet on the catwalk jack scrambled up the roof a gaping hole for him to pitch himself through left arm first with the shotgun left elbow through left shoulder and his forehead caught against a shard of glass and was slashed no stopping he tumbled onto the catwalk and his fall was softened by the cringing body of the guard he stood he opened his lungs he shouted jeez he heard his voice boom back at him from the confines of the catwalk from the short corridor below him from through the cell windows around him that were flush into the catwalk jeez where are you it was one minute and twentyfour seconds of time since the hollow charge had detonated he heard a gravel voice he heard the reply im here a babble of voices springing from the personal radios concentrating around the controller in his glassfronted booth beside the airlock main entrance its not in b section a sections fine whats with b section and c section over i repeat nothing in b section is this a fire practice johan are we to stay or are we to move if you have nothing to report for christ sake keep whos giving orders several shots rifle fire i think sounded like a section was that a bang on the outer wall what has happened to the lights duty officer do you hear me has the military been telephoned chaos sweeping the ears of the controller the guard in the sentry box thought of the man he had seen with the gun and the length of circular metal the man who had been talking with the wife of the deputy commissioner he felt the crimson of panic that he would be blamed surging up from his gut there were five prison staff locked into the main c section corridor none of them had a weapon they were in contact with prisoners they cowered on their haunches in the corridor locked into c section s corridor sergeant oosthuizen shouted into the wall telephone but he could find no one to listen jack blew the window out that looked down onto the cell the charge without the detonator gone a cream cake back on his feet the cell below him was a dust box a grey cloud haze and the ceiling light had been smashed he peered down trying to probe the dust and darkness to see the man time running and time that was his life and jeezs life he fell through the window gap he bounced on the mesh over the cell he had cordtex equivalent and safety fuse in his hand six feet of cordtex equivalent and twelve feet of safety fuse he laid the length of cordtex equivalent against the angle of the mesh and the vertical wall it was above the bed under the bed or the table jack shouted he jumped for the smashed window his hands ripped on cut glass and torn metal and broken concrete he saw the uniformed man beneath him beneath the catwalk pleading with the telephone hadnt time for the bastard he lit the safety fuse christ only knew what it would be like underneath sirens invading the long seconds cut off by the blast he saw that a length of mesh had been torn from the wall he saw the plaster battered away from the concrete get yourself onto the mesh jeez hurry he saw the man he saw a small hunched figure crawl out from under the bed the mans face was pale grey from the plaster dust the man was dazed slow motion movements jack was back on the catwalk reaching for the shotgun booted feet hammering running on the catwalk close to him he knew the catwalk was the causeway that covered the whole gaol no locked doors on the catwalk the briefing papers said he heard the wheeze of the mans breath he saw the white head of short hair at the hole where the window had been he saw the face of the man wideeyed staring at him jack grabbed the collar of the mans tunic he pulled him over the glass edges and the torn metal and the broken concrete it was one minute and fiftyeight seconds of time since the charge had detonated jack had hold of the mans tunic not stopping to look at him he heard the voices welling through the windows onto the catwalk amandla jeez fly on the wind jeez tell them about us jeez that we were singing the man who was loose in jacks grip stiffened the lines cut and broke the grey dust on his face and forehead jack tugged at him couldnt move him the man broke jacks gripjack watched the man who was his father who was jeez jeez picked up the rifle of the guard lying on the catwalk he poked the barrel down through the grille of the catwalk oosthuizen drop that telephone unlock those doors unlock my door you have five seconds oosthuizen he fired once into the floor below him four seconds oosthuizen or youre dead you dont get to retire three dont play heroes oosthuizen two i dont give a shit about shooting you one jack couldnt see he heard the rattle of the keys he heard a door opening another door opening clever oosthuizen thats being clever he fired once more and the telephone flew from the wall socket the catwalk crowded as the four blacks came up in fast succession jack saw a shadow figure materialise at the corner where the catwalk over c section joined with the catwalk over the main c section corridor he fired he pumped the shotgun fired pumped again fired again shrill shouts of surprise should have been gone on their way and still on the catwalk it was two minutes and thirtyfive seconds of time jeez and four blacks crouched by the blown window the route to the sloping roof jack motioned them gone they helped each other and jack last through the narrow window children on a fairground slide they tumbled down the roof into the night air out into the embrace of the unforgiving perpetual siren as they scrambled across the grille above the exercise yard jack turned and aimed a shot at the window keep them back keep their heads below the window the controller bellowed his frustration i dont care what colonel you are i dont care about john vorster square i have a breakout here man so clear the line he slashed down the telephone he depressed his microphone switch he could be heard by every prison officer with a personal radio this is control the armoury is now unlocked all unarmed personnel are to go straight to the armoury armed officers on b section and a section are to remain at their posts all further orders will come from the duty major on alpha frequency of transmission the point of entry is believed to be the east perimeter wall captain van rooyen orders all personnel to the central hallway as soon as weapons have been drawn i repeat further orders will come direct from the duty major the controller was a senior sergeant he looked up the duty major was panting redfaced and sweating the duty major had run all the way from administration to the radio control to take charge he weighed eighteen stones the controller said quietly c section thats where the terrorists are the duty major struggled for his voice have the police been informed more than one minute ago sir get the internal phone into c section sergeant oosthuizen sat on his backside and his spine rested against the inside of the locked corridor door the telephone dead was in his lap in front of him gaping laughing at him were the opened doors of three cells they went down the rope jack led his shotgun was in his right hand his left hand clung to the sleeve of jeezs tunic the blacks ran alongside them he led them through the gloom of the gardens he was not aware of distance just that the great wall was ahead still the siren filling the night and then the first sporadic shots down from c sections upper windows searching for the bastard hole couldnt see it he thought the shots were random aimed haphazardly into the gloom light with their impetus jeez and the blacks were bouncing against jack as he slowed as he searched for the gap he went to his right went fifteen strides and they were running again with him no bloody hole he stopped he cursed fighting for breath again the bodies slacked against him he turned he went left and back over the same fifteen strides there was a jabber of voices in his ear couldnt the bastards see that he was trying to find the hole they trampled through a bush he tripped on the debris he saw the hole close to the grass god had he ever made it through that hole in hells name how had he ever made it through so bloody small two of the blacks went first eellike then jack jack wriggled through the hole he loosened his hold on jeez for the first time since they had come down the sloping roof his hand was back and into the hole to take jeez and work him through there was a spatter of bullets jack saw the dirt kick close to his legs close to where the two blacks sheltered against the wall the sentry in t h e high tower and the lights above the sentrys platform he wrenched jeez clear he heard the man cry in pain he heard the ripping of the mans shirt where it had caught on a cut edge of steel cord jeez was through jeez and his rifle take the lights out jeez hissed jack ran forward he must stand if he were to see the lights he fired three times with the shotgun it was like knocking skittles away in an alley first time some out second time more out third time most out most of the light gone they ran in a tight group towards the corner of the wall they were outside the walls of beverly hills ahead of them were the street lights and the road through the senior officers quarters when they were on the road they would be in the clear field of fire from the sentry in the tower they came to the corner where are we going across the road up that track jeez said the riflell keep his head down theyre not soldiers wont take it when its coming back at them how many shots he fired twice at me you fired once three left they carry six jeez was fluently taking control happy charlie percy tom when i fire at the tower run like shit jeez gestured at the track opening that jack had pointed to jeez had the rifle to his shoulder he edged round the corner of the wall there was the crack of a shot the blacks ran they ran bent low weaving over the tarmac sprinting for the darkness of the track jeez fired a second shot jack ran he thought jeez was immediately behind him jack was in the middle of the road going like smoke the sledgehammer hit him the darkness at the tracks mouth was yawning for him he felt the crowbar smash into him he never heard the shot no pain just the staggering blow of the sledgehammer the crowbar it was three minutes and fortynine seconds of time jack felt the hard road against his face his chest no breath left and a fist snatched at his arm and held him up dragged him across the road towards the track i hit one definitely a hit the message squawked into the headphones clamped down on the majors bald head identify your position south sentry tower how many of them cant be sure sir two for certain armed shot out the lower lights before they ran for it going in what direction going south onto magasyn kopje out for the first time a glimmer of a smile he had hard information he was reaching for the microphone that would link him to every personal radio inside maximum security when he heard the door click open behind him he turned he saw the governor standing in the centre of the room his arms folded across his chest the governor wore his dinner jacket well cut and above the folded arms was a line of miniture medals topped by vivid coloured ribbon the governor gestured with his hand a small movement for the duty major to carry on with his broadcast he gave out the information he issued his orders a much rehearsed plan involving prison staff and police and military had slipped into place he switched off the microphone the governor pursed his lips there was a frown of surprise cutting deep in his forehead i think i heard you correctly that one man alone came in and took five out the duty major nodded extraordinary i would not have conceived it as possible the blocks will be in place within a few minutes the duty major spoke with pride perhaps in time perhaps not the governor seemed to speak to himself left the duty major as an eavesdropper if they are not all back with us in time to face the penalty of the law on thursday morning then the scandal of one mans achievement will destroy me the duty major swung away and snatched for the telephone that would connect him to defence headquarters he did not wish to look again at his governor to witness the fall of a fine man you have to tell me whats ahead they were crowded together on the track jeez was bent over jack the sledgehammer blow was to jacks right knee jeez could see the blood not much blood blood on either side of the trouser leg as if the bullet had pierced his knee gone straight through theres just buildings ahead then you go down the hill and theres a fence thats all after that youre out under the voortrekker monument and the skanskopfort jeez put up his hand cut jack off he turned to the others you heard him get bloody going move your arses he pushed the one who was nearest to him away each one crouched slapped jeezs shoulder gripped his arm an ecstatic farewell and the last one said god go with you jeez and you too friend well fight together again and was gone there was the patter of their feet they were shadows and then they were nothing go with them jack said jeez stood and hoisted jack up he slung jacks arm over his shoulder he was on jacks right side they stumbled together up the track i said go with them jeezs fist was tight into jacks anorak under his armpit jack doubted he could have torn the fist free they made the best speed that was possible for them his leg was numb useless the pain came later into the ripped hole into the wrecked ligaments into the broken cartilage into the splintered bone the pain was in water surges damned and then rushing in intensity flash floods of pain in jacks whole leg as they went forward up the hillside and through the trees skirting the buildings and holding to the black holes where the lights did not reach silence around them no cordon no dogs only the sirens pulsing behind them together jeez supporting jack they started down the hill down the south slope of magazine they couldnt crawl because jacks wound would not have permitted him to crawl jeez walked jack leaning on his shoulder hopped beside him in the pure darkness they went down magazine jeez said where are the wheels far side of skanskopfort he heard the whistle of surprise what i was trying for save your strength jack found the hole that he had cut in the fence he found his handkerchief they slithered through jack in his life had never known such agony as when jeez worked him through the wire and over the lower tumbler strand he thought they should have been going faster he knew he was incapable of greater speed they crossed the road at the bottom of the valley between magazine and skanskop and they climbed again they climbed over the stone hard earth and the broken rock and through the matted thorn scrub against the clean night sky were the ordered plateau lines of the old forts ramparts they looked down jack gazed down the south face of the skanskop slope to the road and the place where he had parked the renault the triumph was bolted in his gut the words were blocked in his throat he could see the renault the renault was illuminated by the lights of a jeep there were many lights many jeeps and transport lorries for moving troops the lights of the vehicles shone on to the hillside where it fell to the road he heard the rising drone of engines to his right and to his left and away behind him his eyes squeezed shut the voice grated in his ear you bastards took your time and now youve blown it it was the best jeez snapped bloody awful best and after ive been sitting there thirteen fucking months bastards who are the bastards your crowd whats my crowd teeth bared the team what team wheres the backup theres just me me alone still leaning on jeezs shoulder wheres colonel basil never heard of him lennie adrian henry dont know them who sent you i sent myself jeez looked up at him searched his face didnt understand couldnt split the mist so who are you im jack and who the hells jack when hes at home hes your son jack hung on his fathers neck jeez buried his face in his sons shoulder and around them far beneath them was the tightening circle of lights they had come off the motorway they were close to their parents home after jan had thrown the grenades at local and the saaf recruiting office and the creepercovered fence of sadf hq and after he had fired a whole magazine of pistol shots at the sentry box at the bottom of potgieterstraat ros had taken a circular route to johannesburg not a word was spoken ross knuckles were white on the wheel all the way their nerves were stretched like wire they expected every moment the flail of the siren in pursuit the road block in their path the number plates were mudsmeared she did not think that the sentries would have noted her number plate theyd have been lying in the dirt and shielding their heads from the shrapnel and the pistol bullets she had driven fifty kilometres out of her way across to the east before doubling back through bapsfontein and kempton park and edenvale she hadnt been followed there had been no road blocks they had heard one explosion jan had said it was the main charge going against the wall and then they had finished with their diversion and he had wound up the passenger window they had heard nothing more now the radio was on in the car the midnight news bulletin a bland english accent english service of the sabc good evening in the last ten minutes police headquarters in pretoria has announced that the area to the south of the capital between verwoerdburg and valhalla has been declared an emergency military zone all persons travelling through that area until further notice are subject to sadf and police control residents in the area are advised to stay in their homes throughout the hours of darkness they made it jan squealed theyre running late this evening it was reported that explosions and firing were heard in the area of the sadf headquarters on potgieterstraat in the capital but as yet there is no official police confirmation of these reports in london a demonstration by an estimated two thousand people outside the south african embassy was broken up by police after violence jan switched off the radio it didnt say he made it ros said bleakly it just said he was being hunted wrong not a military zone unless hes taken his father out she drove on she held the wheel lightly with one hand the fingers of her other hand played listlessly with the shape of the crucifix at her neck she wanted only to be home she wanted to tie the yellow scarf in the window of her bedroom did you love him ros she turned the car into the driveway of her parents home she parked beside her fathers bmw youre best to go straight to bed jan or youll be sleeping right through your classes in the morning all pretoria had heard the gunfire and the explosions frikkie de kok had heard them pretoria is a valley city the gunfire and the explosions on the southern hills were cradled above the community by the northern slopes distant gunfire and muffled explosions and the city was an armed camp and the sounds were insufficient to disturb the celebration between himself and his assistant right that they should take some beers in the harlequins bar after the assistant had performed well at dawn a celebration for the two of them in the corner by the window going on long after the field floodlights had been switched off away from the talk at the bar when it came to be time to gohome the bar closed the hangman did not know whether the gunfire and explosions were part of an army night exercise or the result of a terrorist attack at his front gate he waved his assistant goodnight he came up the path the porch light showed him that hermione had been weeding in the evening after he had gone to the match a fine woman the rock of a fine family he let himself inside moved quietly into the darkened hall he could hear hermione snoring softly down the corridor he could see the edge of light under his boys bedroom door he thought they would be int erested to know the score of the match and how the springbok who played for defence had performed fine boys with a fine future boys such as his would survive whatever he pushed gently at the door the flicker of a frown played at his forehead erasmus was curled in his bed asleep and facing the wall and avoiding the light that was between the beds dawies bed was empty the coverlet not pulled back he was annoyed dawie had been working so hard and there was talk of a university scholarship and all the school exams were important and the boy should have been in his bed he would tell dawie of his displeasure perhaps he was too soft on the boy he went into the living room he saw the white sheets of paper on his desk he went to them he picked them up and recognised the papers that had come that morning from the school the entry forms for university application the envelope was beside the papers the boy was normally so tidy his leg brushed against an obstruction he glanced down and made out the black leather widebuilt attache case with which he went to work the lock catch of the black leather case was unfastened he cursed himself for his own carelessness in leaving the bag unlocked he was as careless as his dawie heh that was rich father and son as careless each other the smile extinguished so fast developing the picture in his mind his dawie skimming through the university entrance form and his dawie seeing the bag that had never been opened in his presence and his dawie succumbing to curiosity and his dawie feeling for the lock and finding it unfastened and his dawie opening the case that carried the tools of the hangmans trade chilled frikkie de kok stood for a moment motionless he lifted back the flap of the black case the ropes were coiled neatly in seethrough cellophane bags to count them he did not have to lift them out new ropes drawn from the prison store that day signed for that afternoon he loved his boy and he did not know how his boy would react on finding that his father was the executioner in pretoria central there were four ropes when he had brought his case home there had been five ropes the ropes he would use at first light on thursday only because he loved his dawie frikkie de kok had never summoned the courage to tell his boy what work he did for the state he thought that he knew where to look frikkie de kok went to the window he stared out onto his back garden the ceiling lights of the living room threw shadows across the lawn the lights groped as far as the old pear tree from which the autumn frosts had stripped the leaves cold shivering now the hangman saw the slowly revolving shape the colonel stood beside the stolen renault car above him the bleak outline of the hillside with him was an army brigadier between the palms of his hand the colonel held a warming beaker of coffee technically the military had been called in to aid the civil power in practice they had taken control and the colonel was outranked and deferential and damned tired because hed not slept and he had left his office at a quarter past two in the morning for the drive to pretoria he had no place in the cordon line he could not have stayed away could not have borne it in john vorster square with only the telephone and the telex machine to feed him the news the brigadier munched at a sandwich tell you this we were pretty poor getting the act into place the operations room had us under sustained attack at defence headquarters so we lost critical minutes ill kick someones arse for that its why weve only got two of them up there for definite but those two are bottled and anyway theres a blood trail so theyre not going anywhere which ones which two a sentry on magasyn had an image intensifier on them when they came off the hill cant be sure not through that thing but he reckons they are both white there was only one man came into maximum security and he was white so the other is carew the colonel heaved his relief whatll you do its what theyre going to do if one of thems hurt hell need the medics when theyre cold enough and hungry enough and hurt enough they have to come down theyve nowhere to go id like them alive the brigadier smiled sardonically so you can put them back inside hang them its no help to me to have them dead they have a rifle and they have an automatic shotgun and im not having my men shot up by desperate men who are going to end on the rope anyway if they shoot first theyre dead if they dont shoot theyll live its pretty simple would you allow me to broadcast that to them the brigadier snapped his fingers brought his adjutant hurrying he asked for a loudhailer you can tell them that if they dont shoot first they will not be harmed the brigadiers voice dropped then theyll be able to meet the hangman on another morning the colonel drank from his beaker and stared again up at the silent hillside around him were quiet voices the occasional clatter of weapons being checked there was the low throb of running engines the crackle of brief radio messages if there were only two on the hillside then he knew those two were james carew and his son the loudhailer was handed to him the dawn was coming the blast of the message had slipped away dispersed amongst the surrounding hills a mauve streak in the east they had talked through the night they had met as strangers and during the dark hours in faintest starlight they had lurched through understanding towards friendship jeez sat with his arms gathered round his knees as if to find warmth for himself against the cold on the skanskop near to freezing on the hillside and he wore only his prison tunic and cotton trousers and his thin prison shoes jack lay prone beside him sometimes twisted by the agony in his leg sometimes able to rest in relief between the spasms of pain they were together it was as if they had never been apart they talked of hilda perry and her life with sam and the house in churchill close and jeez seemed pleased at what he heard they talked of jacks job and jeez chuckled at the stories of the blaster george hawkins they talked of the foreign office and of the man called jimmy sandham and jeez spat into the dew damp earth they talked of a girl called ros van niekerk and of her brother with a club foot and jeez heard his son through when the pain came to jack then jeez held his hand when the pain spurted then jeezs fingers clenched over his sons fist they could see the lights of the vehicles around the base of the skanskop a mesmerising cage of lights when they were not talking they could hear the idling engines of the trucks and jeeps you wont be afraid jack shook his head enough light seeping onto the hilltop for jeez to see his sons face through the night he had talked to his son and he had not known his sons face jack gazed at the face of his father a thin pinched face stubble on the chin short back and sides where there was hair to cut jack thought he saw a love in his fathers face not having been a talking man jack not any of my life its hard for me to say what i want to say to you to say thank you thats not enough just crap to say thank you ill tell it better if i say what youve given me jack watched his fathers head clearer against the sky it wont be by them thats rich to me itll be in our time not at the time theyd open my cell up the time theyve decided because itll be us by ourselves who decide the time thats bloody fantastic to me free hands and free arms and free legs no pinions on my ankles no hood over my face thats wonderful for me yesterday i couldnt have imagined how wonderful you understand me jack i understand you jeez youre the son that i made with your mother youre the son that i bloody failed and you came here to take me out when none of the other bastards were coming youve given me the thing i wanted most almost a shyness on jeezs face where ive been you dont get to see the morning coming and you dont feel the wind on your face i wanted most to see the morning coming the sun rise and feel the wind and i dont have to be counting got that got it in that place you may be counting in months weeks days i was down to counting hours id got to counting meals day before yesterday i was counting how many socks id be needing day before yesterday they gave me a new uniform but it wasnt new oldest theyd got look at it you mess your clothes when youre hanged jack so they give you an old uniform before they drop you off you got me out of the counting you got me to see a morning coming you got me to feel the fresh wind on my face he was between the pain he was lying back he was aware of the light building in the sky jack said everyone i spoke to they all said it was impossible a dry smile from jeez probably was the car was wrong just as wrong as when i said we had to stop and take the boys we had to bring them jack you dont get a choice you had to take the boys just as i had to come for you they might just make it us going so slow might have drawn the flak off them you know what if they do make it you might just get to have a street named after you in some real african shitheap up in saka or dar i dont blame you for anything jeez youre not afraid its like im happy you screwed them proper cheated them its the best morning of my life the cleanest air thank you for nothing jeez so lets get this fucking show on the road they dont take us no way they take us itll be what they wanted in london theyll be breaking open crates in century swilling champagne jack said there must be some people who know wholl want to tell the truth jeez said theyll promote them promotion and the honours list theyre good silencers i wanted to walk you down whitehall i wanted to take you into the foreign office i wanted to see those bastards faces the bastards dont get to lose that often not there not here jeez stood for a long time he looked away to the clipped half rising sun he breathed in he dragged the morning air into his lungs he wondered how long it would be before the dandelion weed showed again in the garden of the exercise yard of c section he clapped his hands jeez took off his tunic shirt and started to rip strips from it he made five strips he came behind jack and put his hands under jacks armpits and lifted him up with the strips from his tunic jeez bound jacks right leg he knotted the strips tight jeez checked the shotgun he checked the rifle you heard their message what they want of us they dont take us jeez were close as family boy they stumbled forward to the edge of the hill the pain swam again through jack behind them were the walls of the old skanskopfort and the light of morning and a gathering wind it would be a short pain the pain would not last they were stiff with cold it took them a few strides to find the rhythm he wondered whether he could live with the pain from his stiffening ruptured leg he looked into jeezs face saw the chin jutting bloodyminded defiance he saw his fathers face the face he had grown to know in a dawn haze they came to the edge jack clung to jeezs shoulder supporting himself trying not to shake trying to hold back the agony tremors jeez had the rifle to his shoulder aimed jack saw a jeep far below a bristle of aerials he saw the pygmy figures evacuating the jeep he could hear the faint alarum calls one shot one bullet left he understood the controlled pleasure at jeezs mouth hitting back after thirteen months aiming on the jeep finger squeezing over the trigger the report of the shot the kick in jeezs shoulder jeez whipped the rifle down gave it to jack as a support as a stick jeez took the shotgun they came down the slope they were juddering forward faster jacks arm tight across jeezs shoulders they were one father and son down the slope and the pain gone from jacks knee just the echo cracks of the shotgun and jeezs laughter laughter pealing at the sun and the clean cold of the wind and the blast of the shotgun jeez firing from the hip at the vehicles that seemed to soar to meet them and all the time his laughter no pain for jack only the laughter and the shotgun blasting he didnt hear the shouted order of the brigadier he didnt see the barrel of a vickers machine gun waver and then lock on their path he didnt know that the colonel of security police howled his frustration in the ear of the brigadier and was ignored he only knew his own happiness and his fathers freedom and the hammer whip of the shotgun they were wrong all those who said it was impossible they were wrong because jack had come for his father and had taken him out
