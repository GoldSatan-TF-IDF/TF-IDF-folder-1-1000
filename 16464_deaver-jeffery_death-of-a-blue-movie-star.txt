jeffery deaver death of a blue movie star the second book in the rune series chapter one rune had walked past the movie theater and was three blocks away when the bomb went off no way was it constructionsite dynamiteshe knewthat from living for several years in urbanrenewing manhattan the noise was way louda huge painful bang like a falling boiler the turbulent black smoke and distant screams left no doubt then sirens shouts running crowds she looked but couldnt see much from where she stood rune started toward it but then stopped glanced at a watchof the three on her wrist it was the only one that worked she was already late getting back to the studio was due a half hour ago thinking hell if im going to get yelled at anyway why not come back with a good story to take the sting out of it yes no go for it she walked south to see the carnage the blast itself wasnt all that big it didnt crater the floor and the only windows it took out were the theaters and the plate glass in the bar one address up no it was thefire was the nasty part wads of flaming upholstery had apparently arced like those tracer bullets in war movies and had ignited wallpaper and carpeting and patrons hair and all the recesses of the theater the ownerd probably been meaning to get up to code for ten years but just hadnt by the time rune got there the flames had done their job and the velvet venus theater xxxonly the best projection in town was no more eighth avenue was in chaos closed off completely between fortysecond and fortysixth streets diminutive rune thin and just over five feet easily worked her way to the front of the spectators the homeless people and hookers and threecard monte players and kids were having a great time watching the slick choreography of the men and women from the dozen or so fire trucks on the scene when the roof of the theater went and sparks cascaded over the street the crowd exhaled approval as if they were watching the macys fireworks over the east river the nyfd crews were good and after twenty minutes the fires were knocked down as she heard one fireman say and the dramatic stuff was over the theater a bar a deli and peep show had been destroyed then the crowds murmuring disappeared and everyone watched in solemn quiet when the medics brought out the bodies or what was left of them rune felt her heart slamming as the thick green bags were wheeled or carried past even the emergency medical service guys who she guessed were pretty used to this sort of thing looked edgy and green at the gills their lips were squeezed tight and their eyes were fixed ahead of them she eased closer to where one of the medics was talking to a fireman and though the young man tried to sound cool slinging out the words with a grin his voice was shaky four dead but two are mystery stiffsnot even enough left for a dental she swallowed nausea and an urge to cry were balanced within her for a moment the queasiness returned when she realized something else three or four tons of smoldering concrete and plaster now rested on the same sidewalk squares where shed been strolling just minutes before walking and skipping like a schoolgirl careful to miss the cracks to save her mothers back glancing at the movie poster and admiring the long blonde hair of the star of lusty cousins the very spot a few minutes earlier and what happened rune asked a pockfaced young woman in a tight red tshirt her voice cracked and she had to repeat the question a bomb a gas line the woman shrugged maybe propane i dont know rune nodded slowly the cops were hostile and bored authoritative voices droned move along come on everybody move along rune stayed put excuse me miss a mans polite voice was speaking to her rune turned and saw a cowboy can i get by hed walked out of the burntout theater and was heading for a cluster of officers in the middle of the street he was about six two wearing blue jeans a work shirt and a soldiers vest stiff with plates of armor boots he had thinning hair swept back and a mustache his face was reserved and somber he wore battered canvas gloves rune glanced at his badge pinned to his thick stained belt and stepped aside he ducked under the yellow police tape and walked into the street she edged after him he stopped at a blueandwhite station wagon stenciled withbomb squad and leaned on the hood rune slipping into eavesdropping range heard whatve we got a fat man in a brown suit asked cowboy plastic looks like a half ki he looked up from under saltandpepper brows i cant figure it no ira targets here the bar was greek he nodded and the syndicate only blows things up after hours anyway their mo is if you want to scare folks they miss protection payments you use tovex from a construction site or maybe a concussion grenade something that makes a big noise but military plastic sitting right next to the gas line i dont get it we got something here a patrolman came up and handed cowboy a plastic envelope inside was a scorched piece of paper were going fishing for latents so if you could be careful sir cowboy nodded and read rune tried to get a glimpse of it saw careful handwriting and dark stains she wondered if they were blood cowboy glanced up are you someone my mother thinks so she tried a fast smile he didnt respond studied her critically maybe trying to decide if she was a witness or the bomber she decided not to be cute i just wondered what it said youre not supposed to be here im a reporter im just curious what happened brown suit offered why dont you be curious someplace else which ticked her off and she was about to tell him that as a taxpayerwhich she wasntshe paid his salary but just then brown suit finished reading the note and tapped cowboys arm whats this sword forgetting about rune cowboy said never heard of them but they want credit they can have it till somebody better shows up then he noticed something stepped forward away from the station wagon brown suit was looking elsewhere and rune glanced at the message on the burned paper the first angel blew his trumpet and there followed hail and fire mixed with blood which jell on the earth and a third of the earth was burntup a warning from the sword of jesus cowboy returned a moment later a young priest was behind him here it is father cowboy handed him the plastic envelope the man touched his ear above his roman collar as he read nodding his thin lips pressed together solemn as if he were at a funeral which rune figured he just about was the priest said its from therevelation to john chapter eight verse seven or six maybe im not cowboy asked whats that about revelation like getting inspiration the priest gave a polite noncommittal laugh before he realized the cop wasnt joking what its about is the end of the world the apocalypse which is when brown suit noticed rune looking through the crook of cowboys arm hey you move along cowboy turned but didnt say anything ive got a right to know whats going on i walked by there just a minute ago i couldve been killed yeah said brown suit but you werent so count your blessings look im getting tired of telling you to get out of here good cause im getting tired of hearing it rune grinned cowboy reined in a smile now brown suit stepped forward okay okay rune walked away but slowlyjust to show they werent going to bully hertoo much her leisurely departure let her overhear something the young priest was saying to cowboy and brown suit i hate to tell you this but if that note has to do with the bombing its not such good news why not cowboy asked that verse its about thefirst angel in the whole passage there are seven angels all together so asked brown suit i guess that means youve got six more to go until god wipes the slate clean in the office of l ampr productions on twentyfirst street rune took a beer from the fridge it was an old kenmore and one of her alltime favorite objects on the door was a raised pattern like the grille of a studebaker and it had a big silver handle that looked like it belonged on a submarine hatch looking at her reflection in a scabby mirror above the receptionists desk she saw her muted blackandgreen portrait lit by the fluorescence of the office a girl in a red miniskirt printed with silhouettes of dinosaurs and two sleeveless tshirts one white one navy her auburn hair was pulled back in a ponytail which made her round face somewhat less round in addition to the watches rune wore three pieces of jewelrya doubleterminated crystal on a chain a single fakegold earring in the shape of the eiffel tower and a silver bracelet in the shape of two hands clasped together which had been broken and soldered together the little makeup she had put on that morning had vanished in the sweat of the august afternoon and the spewing water from an open hydrant on thirtyfirst street she couldnt resist dunking her head under rune wasnt much for makeup anyway she did best she felt with the least attention when she got elaborate with her looks she turned sophisticated into clowny svelte into whorish her theory of fashion youre short and occasionally youre pretty stick to the basics tshirts boots and dinosaurs use hair spray only to kill flies and to paste things into scrapbooks she rubbed the cold beer bottle against her cheek and sat down at the desk the l ampr office was a good reflection of the cash flow of the company gray steel furniture circa peeling linoleum stacks of yellowing invoices storyboards art directors annuals and papers that had grown the dense fur of city grit larry and bob her bosses were australians documentary film makers andrunes opinion on most days maniacs as producers of commercials for melbourne and new york ad agencies they had developed something more than their massive artistic egos they were in their own words accurate words bloody fucking good they ate like farm animals belched lusted over blondes with big boobs and indulged in gloomy moodiness in between doing tv commercials they now produced and shot some of the best documentaries that ever ran on pbs or england s channel or at the film forum rune had wheedled a job here hoping some of their magic would rub off it was now a year later and not much had larry the partner with the longer beard walked into the office his uniform of the day boots black leather pants and a black blousy parachute shirt every button of which his gut tested about bleedin time whereve you been she held up the schneider lens shed picked up at optirental in midtown he reached for

beautiful piece of german optics and machinery rune didnt move kept staring at him he looked up sighed how fucking much was it forty dollars jesus he dug into his pocket and gave her two twenties she smiled curtly thank you boss listen luv ive got a big pitch meeting going on not another commercial larry come on dont sell out they pay the rent and your salary so i need four coffees one light one

i came here to learn how to make films its been eleven months and all i do is get coffee and pick up equipment and coil cables on the set and drop off film and walk bobs mangy dog i thought you liked

thing this bombing whatever appened the newsll do the story up right rune nodded seeing that intensity she recognized in his eyes when he was on a set shooting or kicking around ideas with bob or the cinematographer she paid attention he continued use the bombing like a ook a hook you want to make a good documentary do a film thats about the bombing but not about the bombing it sounds like zen fucking zen right he twisted his mouth and three sugars for me tea last time you bleedin forgot rune was paying for the tea and coffee when she remembered stu she was surprised she hadnt thought about him before this and so she paid the deli guy two bucks of her own money which is the way she looked at larrys change to have somebody deliver the cartons to l ampr then she stepped outside and trudged toward the subway a lowrider a fifteenyearold beige sedan churned past her the horn sang and from the shadows of the front seat came a cryptic solicitation lost in the ships diesel bubbling of the engine the car accelerated away god it was hot halfway to the subway stop she bought a paper cone of shaved ice from a latino street vendor rune shook her head when he pointed to the squirt bottles of syrup smiled at his perplexed expression and rubbed the ice over her forehead then dropped a handful down the front of her tshirts he got a kick out of it and she left him with a thoughtful look on his face maybe considering a new market for his goods painful hot mean hot the ice melted before she got to the subway stop and the moisture had evaporated before the train arrived the a train swept along under the streets back up to midtown somewhere above her was the smoking ruin of the velvet venus theater rune stared out the window intently did anyone live down here in the subway system she wondered maybe there were whole tribes of homeless people families whod made a home in the abandoned tunnels theyd be a great subject for a documentary too lifebelow the streets this started her thinking about the hook for her film about the bombing but not about the bombing and then it occurred to her the film should be about a single person someone the bombing had affected she thought about movies she likedthey were never about issues or about ideas in the abstract they were about people what happened to them but who should she pick a patron in the theater whod been injured no no one would volunteer to help her out whod want to admit hed been hurt in a porn theater how bout the owner or the producer of porn films sleazy came to mind one thing rune knew was that the audience has to care about your main character and some scumbag in the mafia or whoever made those movies wasnt going to get much sympathy from the audience aboutthe bombing but not as the subway sped underground the more she thought about doing the document the more excited she became oh a film like this wouldnt catapult her to fame but it wouldwhat was the wordvalidateher the list of her abortive careers was long clerking waitressing selling cleaning window dressing business was not her strength the one time rune had come into some money richard her exboyfriend had thought up dozens of safe investment ideas businesses to start stocks to buy shed accidentally left his portfolio files on the merrygoround in central park not that it mattered anyway because she spent most of the money on a new place to live im not good with the practical stuff shed told him what she was good with was what shedalways been good with storieslike fairy tales and movies and despite her mothers repeated warning when she was younger no girl can make a living at movies except youknowwhatkindofgirl the odds of making a career in film seemed a lot better than in fairy tales she was shed decided born to make films and this onea real grownup film adocumentary the groundzero of serious filmshad in the last hour or two became vitally important to her as encompassing as the air pressure that hit her when the subway pounded into the tunnel one way or another this documentary was going to get made she looked out the window whatever subterranean colonies lived in the subways theyd have to wait a few more years for their story to be told the train crashed past them or past rats and trash or past nothing at all while rune thought about nothing but her film but not about the bombing in the offices of belvedere postproduction the airconditioning was off give me a break she muttered stu not looking up fromgourmet waved i do not believe this place rune said arent you dying she walked to the window and tried to open the greasy chickenwireimpregnated glass it was frozen with age and paint and wormy strips of insulating putty she focused on the green slate of the hudson river as she struggled her muscles quivered she groaned loudly stu sensed his cue and examined the window from his chair then pushed himself into a standing slump he was young and big but had developed muscles mostly from kneading bread and whisking egg whites in copper bowls after three minutes he breathlessly conceded defeat hot air outsides all wed get anyway he sat down again he jotted notes for a recipe then frowned are you here for a pickup i dont think were doing anything for l ampr naw i wanted to ask you something its personal like like who are your clients thatspersonal well mostly ad agencies and independent film makers networks and big studios occasionally but who are the independents you know small companies doing documentaries or lowbudget features like l ampr youre grinning and youre coy and theres an old expression about butter melting in the mouth that i could never figure out but i think fits here whats up you ever do adult films he shrugged oh porn sure we do a lot of it i thought you were asking me something inscrutable can you give me the name of somebody at one of the companies i dont know isnt this some kind of businessethics question client confidentiality stu were talking about a company making films thatre probably illegal in most of the world and youre worried about business ethics stu shrugged if you dont tell them i sent you you might try lame duck productions theyre a big one and just a couple blocks from you guys from l ampr yeah on nineteenth near fifth the mans huge rolodex spun and gave off an afternoon library smell he wrote down the address do they have an actress whos famous in the business what business adult films youre asking me i have no idea when you super the credits in the postproduction work dont you see the names whose name do you see the most he thought for a minute well i dont know whether shes famous but theres one actress for lame duck that i see all the time her names shelly lowe there was a familiarity about the name does she have a narrow face blonde yeah i guess i didnt look at her face very much rune frowned youre a dirty old man you know her he asked there was a bombing in times square this porn theater did you hear about it no just today a couple hours ago i think she was in one of the movies that was playing there when it happened perfect rune put the address in her plastic leopardskin shoulder bag stu rocked back in his chair well rune asked well what arent you curious why i asked stu held up a hand thats okay some things are best kept secret he opened his magazine and said you ever made atarte aux marrons chapter two contrasts rune sat in the huge loft that was the lobby of lame duck productions and watched the two young women stroll to a desk across the room overhead fans rotated slowly and forced airconditioned breezes throughout the place the woman in the lead walked as if she had adegree in it her feet were pointed forward her back straight hips not swaying she had honeyblonde hair tied back with a braided rope of rainbowcolored strings she wore a white jumpsuit but saved it from tackiness by wearing sandals not boots and a thin brown leather belt rune examined her closely but wasnt sure if this was the same woman shed seen in the poster in that photo the one on the front of the porno theater her makeup had been good today this woman had a dull complexion she seemed very tired the other woman was younger she was short face glossy a figure bursting out of the seams of her outfit she had a huge juttingand undoubtedly fakebust and broad shoulders the black tank top showed a concise waist the miniskirt crowned thin legs there was no saving this cookie from tack she had spiky high heels feathery and teased hair sprayed with glitter and purplebrown makeup which did a fair job minimizing the effect of a wide slavic nose wouldnt be a badlooking woman rune thought if her mother dressed her right they stopped in front of her the shorter one smiled the tall blonde said so youre the reporter from what was it erotic film monthly she shook her head i thought i knew everybody from the industry mags are you new with them rune started to continue the lie but impulsively she said what i am is dishonest which got a faint smile oh i lied to the receptionist to get in the front door are you shelly lowe a momentary frown then she gave a curious smile and said yes but thats not my real name the handshake was strong a mans grip confident her friend said im nicole that is my real name but my last name isnt dorleans she gave it a gallic pronunciation but its spelled like the city rune took her hand carefully nicole had inchlong purple fingernails im rune interesting shelly said is it real rune shrugged as real as yours lot of stage names in our business shelly said lose track sometimes now tell me why youre a liar i thought theyd kick me out if i was honest why would they do that you a rightwing crazy you dont look like one rune said i want to make a movie about you do you now you know about the bombing oh that was terrible nicole said actually shivering in an exaggerated way we all know about it shelly said i want to use it as sort of a jumpingoff point for my film and im the one you want to jump to shelly asked rune thought about those words thought about disagreeing with her but said thats about it why me just a coincidence really one of your pictures was playing when the bomb went off shelly nodded slowly and rune found herself staring at her nicole was scrunching her broad shiny face at the mention of the explosion and the deaths in the theater closing her eyes practically crossing herself while shelly was simply listening leaning against a column her arms crossed runes thoughts were muddled under shellys gaze she felt young and silly a child being indulged nicole took a package of sugarfree gum from her pocket unwrapped a stick and began to chew rune said anyway thats what i want to do shelly said you know anything about the adultfilm business i used to work for a video store my boss said the adult films gave us the best margin she was proud of herself for that saying something aboutbusiness margin a mature way to talk about fuck films theres money to be made shelly said hers were eyes that sent out a direct light pale blue laser beam they were intense at the moment but rune sensed they were switchablethat shelly could choose in an instant to be probing or angry or vindictive by a slight touch to the nerves rune assessed too that her eyes wouldnt dance with humor and there was a lot they chose not to say she wanted to start her documentary with the camera on shellys eyes the actress said nothing glanced at nicole who chewed her gum enthusiastically do you two like perform together rune blushed fiery red the actresses shared a glance then laughed i mean rune began do we work together nicole filled in sometimes shelly said were roommates too nicole said rune glanced at the iron pillars and tin ceiling this is an interesting place this studio it used to be a shirtwaist factory yeah whats that nicole asked a womans blouse shelly said not looking down from the ceiling shelly is tall and she isnt a stunning beauty her presence comes from her figure and eyes her cheekbones are low she has skin the consistency and the pale shade of a summer overcast how did i get into the business i was raped when i was twelve my uncle molested me im a heroin addictdont i cover it up well i was kidnaped by migrant workers in michigan nicole lit a cigarette she kept working on the gum too shelly looked down from the tin panels at rune so this would be a documentary rune said like on pbs nicole said somebody wanted me to do one once this guy a documentary but you know what he really wanted shelly asked still hot out boiling nicole gavea faint laugh though rune had no idea what she was thinking of shelly walked to a spot where cold air cascaded on the floor she turned and examined rune you seem enthusiastic more enthusiastic than talented excuse me thats just my opinion well about your filmi want to think about it let me know where i can get in touch with you see itll be great i can let me think about it shelly said calmly rune hesitated looked at the womans aloof face for a long moment then dug into her leopardskin bag but before she found her road runner pen shelly produced a heavy lacquered mont blanc she took it felt the warmth of the barrel she wrote slowly but shellys gaze made her uneasy and the lines were lumpy and uneven she gave shelly the paper and said thats where i live christopher street all the way to the end at the river youll see me she paused will i see you maybe shelly said yo film me momma come on film me hey you wanna shoot my dick you got yourself a wideangle lens you can shoot my dick shit be a microscope what she need for that yo fuck you man walking out of the times square subway rune ignored her admirers hefted the camera to her shoulder and walked along the platform she passed a halfdozen beggars shaking her head at their pleas for coins but she dropped a couple of quarters into a box in front of a young south american couple giving a tango demonstration to the rattling music of a boom box it was eight pm a week after shed first met with shelly and nicole rune had called shelly twice at first the actress had been pretty evasive about doing the film but the second time shed called shelly had said if iwere to do it would you give me a chance to review the final cut from her work at l ampr and her love of movies in general rune knew that the final cutthe last version of the film what was shown in the theaterswas the holy grail of the film business only producers and a few elite directors controlled the final cut no actor in the history of hollywood ever had final cut approval but she now said yes instinctively feeling that it was the only way she could get shelly lowe to do the film ill let you know in a day or two for sure rune was now out looking for atmosphere footage and for establishing shotsthe longangle scenes in films that orient the audience and tell them what city or neighborhood theyre in and there was plenty of atmosphere here life in the tenderloin times square the heart of the porno district in new york she was excited at the thought of actually shooting footage for her first film but remembered the words of larry her mentor as she was heading out of l amprr studios that night dont overdo it rune any friggin idiot can put together ninety minutes of great atmosphere the storys the important thing dont ever bleedin forget that the story she eased into the swirl and noise and madness of times square the intersection of seventh avenue broadway and fortysecond she waited at the curb for the light looking down at the accidental montage embedded in the asphalt at her feet a strohs bottle cap a piece of green glass a brass key two pennies she squinted in the arrangement she saw a devils face ahead of her was a white highrise on the island of concrete surrounded by the wide streets fifty feet up the days news was displayed along a thick collar of moving lights soviets express hope for the light changed and she never saw the end of the message rune crossed the street and passed a handsome black woman in a belted yellow cotton dress who was shouting into a microphone theres something even better in heaven amen give up your ways of the flesh amen you can win the lottery you can become a multimillionaire billionaire get everything you ever wanted but all that gain cannot compare with what youll find in heaven amen give up your sinful ways your lusts if i die in my little room tonight why id praise the good lord because i know what that means that means im going to be in heaven tomorrow amen a few people chorused withamens most walked on farther north in the square things were ritzier around the tkts discount ticket booth where one could see the huge billboards that any outoftowner who watched television would recognize here was lindys restaurant with its famous and overpriced cheesecake here was the brill buildingtin pan alley several glossy new office buildings a new firstrun movie theater but rune avoided that area she was interested in the southern part of times square where it was a dmz she passed a number of signs in stores and arcades and theaters stop the times square redevelopment project this was the big plan to wipe the place clean and bring in offices and expensive restaurants and theaters purify the neighborhood no one seemed to want it but there didnt seem to be organized resistance to the project that was the contradiction of times square it was a place that was energetically apathetic busyness and hustle abounded but you still sensed the area was on its way out many of the stores were going out of business nedicksthe hot dog station from the fortieswas closing to be replaced by slick mirrored mikes hot dogs and pizza only a few of the classic fortysecond street movie theatersmany of them had been grand old burlesque houseswere still open and all they showed was porn or kung fu or slasher fiicks rune glanced across the street at the huge old artdeco amsterdam theater which was all boarded up its curvaceous clock stopped at five minutes to three of which day of which month of which year she wondered her eye strayed to an alleyway and she caught a flash of motion someone seemed to be watching her someone in a red jacket wearing a hat she believed then the stranger vanished paranoid well this was the place for it then she walked past dozens of small stores selling fakegold jewelry electronics pimp suits cheap running shoes id photos souvenirs bootleg perfumes and phony designer watches hawkers were everywhere directing bewildered tourists into their stores check it out checkit we got what you need and you gonna like what we got check it out one store the windows painted black named arts novelties had a single sign in the window leisure products you must be twentyone to enter rune tried to peek inside what the hell was a leisure product she kept walking listing against the weight of the camera sweat running down her face and neck and sides the smells were of garlic and oil and urine and rotting food and car exhaust and brother the crowds where did all these people come from thousands of them where was home the city the burbs why were they here rune dodged out of the way of two teenage boys in tshirts and guess jeans walking fast in an armswinging loping roll their voices harsh man mothafuckah be mah boss but he don own me man you hear what im sayin man fuck no he don own neither of us he try that again man an ill deck him i mothahfuckin deck him man they passed her by rune and her camera as she taped a visual history of times square a place like no other in new york times square but every magic kingdom needs its mordor or hades and tonight as rune walked through the place she didnt feel too uneasy she was on her quest making her movie about the bombing but not about the bombing she didnt have to justify the creepy place to anyone or worry about anybodys shoes but her own and she was careful where she put her feet behind her a huge snort fantastic knights rune turned the camera on two mounted policemen who sat rodstraight in their saddles their horses lolling their heads and stomping solid hooves into the piles of granular manure under them hey sir gawain rune called they glanced at her then decided she wasnt worth flirting with and continued to scan the street with stony gazes that streamed from under the visors of their robinseggblue helmets it was when she looked down from the tall chestnut horse that she saw the red jacket again it vanished even more quickly than earlier a chill ran through her despite the heat who was it she wondered no one just one of the ten million people in the magic kingdom and she forgot about it as she turned the corner and walked up eighth avenue toward the site of the former velvet venus theater along this stretch she counted six porn theaters and adult bookstores some had live dancers some had peep shows where for a quarter or a token you could watch films in little booths she stuck the camera through the door and shot a signonly one person per booth its the law and our policy have a nice day until big guy selling tokens shooed her away she got some good footage of commuters on their way to the port authority and their homes in suburban jersey some glanced in the windows most wore glazed faces a few businessmen turned quickly into the theaters not pausing at all as though a gust of wind had blown them through the door it was then that a humid wind carried a sour stink of burn to her from the theater she knew rune shut off the camera and strolled up the street still spooked the paranoia again but she still could hear in her memory the terrible bang of the explosion the ground moving under her recalling the bodies theparts of bodies the terrible aftermath of the bomb and the fire she glanced back saw no one watching her she continued along the street thinking the press coverage of the event had been good newsat eleven had devoted ten minutes to the incident and the story had been a hook for atime magazine article on the trends in adult films hard times for hardcore and one in thevillage voice on the conflict the bombing presented to the first amendment disrespecting religion and abridging the press but as larry had predicted those were all spot news stories hard news nobody was doing a humaninterest piece on the bombing come on shelly she thought youre the key i need you as she approached the ruins of the theater rune paused resting her hand on the yellow police tape the odor was stronger than the day of the bombing she almost gagged on the air thick with the smell of wet scorched upholstery and something elsea sickening cardboardy scent it would have to be the scorched bodies rune figured and tried to force the image out of her thoughts across the street was another theater the neon said the finest in adult entertainment cool comfortable and safe rune assumed that patrons were not much soothed by the illuminated reassurance and that business was slow she turned back to the destroyed theater and was startled by motion her first thought shit hes back whoever was following her through times square a mans face panic took her just as she was about to turn and run she squinted into the shadows and got a better look at her pursuer he wore jeans and a navyblue windbreaker that said nypd in white letters on the chest it was cowboy the guy from the bomb squad she closed her eyes and exhaled slowly tried to steady her shaking hands he sitting on a folding chair looking at a white sheet of paper which he folded and put into his pocket she saw a thin brown holster on his right hip rune lifted the camera and shot a minute or so of tape opening the aperture wide to get some definition in the gloom he looked at the camera she expected the man to tell her to get lost but he merely stood and began walking through the ruined theater kicking at debris bending down occasionally to examine something training his long black flashlight on the walls and floor the image in the viewfinder of the heavy camera faded dusk had come quicklyor perhaps she just hadnt noticed it she opened the lens wide but it was still very dim and she didnt have any lights with her she knew the exposure was too dark she shut the camera off lowered it from her shoulder when she looked again into the building cowboy was gone where had he disappeared to she heard a scuttling of noise near her something heavy fell hello nothing hey rune called again there was no answer she shouted into the ruins of the theater were you following me hey officer somebody was following me was it you another sound like boots on concrete nearby but she didnt know where exactly then a car engine started she spun around looking for the blueandwhite station wagon emblazoned withbomb squad but she didnt see it a dark car pulled out of an alley and vanished up eighth avenue uneasy once more no damn scared for some reason but as she looked over the people on eighth avenue she saw only harmless passersby people on their way to the theaters everybody lost in their own worlds nobody in the coffee shops and bars paid her any mind a horde of tourists walked past obviously wondering why the hell their tour guide was leading them through this neighborhood another teen a meanlooking latino propositioned her harmlessly and walked on when she ignored him telling her to have a nice night across the street a man in a widebrimmed hat carrying a lord amp taylor shopping bag was gazing into the window of an adult bookstore nobody in a red jacket nobody spying on her paranoia she decided just paranoia still she shut down the camera put the cassette into her leopardskin bag and headed for the subway deciding that shed had enough atmosphere for one night in the alley across the street from what was left of the velvet venus a bum sat beside a dumpster drinking from a bottle of thunderbird he squinted as a man stepped into the alley hell hes gonna pee here the bum thought theyalways do that have beers with their buddies and cant make it to penn station in time so they come into my alley and pee he wondered how the guyd feel if the bum walked into his living room to take a leak but the man didnt unzip he paused at the mouth of the alley and peered out over eighth avenue looking for something frowning wondering what the man was doing here why he was wearing that widebrimmed oldfashioned hat the bum took another sip of liquor and set the bottle down it made a clink the man whirled around quickly got a quarter the bum asked you scared me i didnt know anybody was there got a quarter the man fished in his pocket sure are you going to spend it on booze probably the bum said sometimes hed hustle the crowds at the commuter stations by saying help the blind help the blind i want to get blind drunk and people gave him more money because hed made them laugh well i appreciate honesty here you go the man reached down with a coin as the bum began to take it he felt his wrist gripped hard by the mans left hand wait but the man didnt wait then there was a slight stinging feeling on the bums neck then another on the other side the man let go of his wrists and the bum touched his throat feeling two flaps of skin dangling loose then saw the razor knife in the mans hand the bloody blade retracting the bum tried to shout for help but the blood was gushing fast from the two wounds and his vision was going black he tried to stand but fell hard to the cobblestones the last thing he saw was the man reaching into his lord amp taylor shopping bag pulling out a red windbreaker and pulling it on then stepping out of the alley quickly as if he were in fact late for his commuter train home chapter three the next morning rune was lying in bedwell a bunklistening to the sounds of the river there was a knock on her front door she pulled on her jeans and a red silk kimono then walked to the front of the boat she opened the door and found she was looking at shelly lowes back the actress was examining the water lapping under her feet as she stood on a small gangway painted eggyolk yellow she turned and shook her head rune nodded at the familiar reaction its a houseboat you live on a houseboat rune said i used to make wisecracks about having water in the basement but the materials limited there arent a lot of houseboat jokes you dont get seasick the hudson river isnt exactly cape horn rune stepped back to let shelly into the narrow entryway in the distance along the roof of the pier to the north a flash of color red it reminded her of something disturbing she couldnt remember what she followed shelly into the boat give me a tour the style nautical suburban ranch midfifties downstairs were the living room kitchen and bath up a narrow staircase were two small rooms the pilot house and bedroom outside a railing and deck circled the living quarters the smell was of motor oil and rose potpourri inside rune showed her a recent acquisition a halfdozen lucite paperweights with flecks of colored plastic chips in them im very into antiques these are guaranteed that was a great year my mother tells me shelly nodded with detached politeness and looked around the rest of the room there was a lot to put politeness to the test turquoise walls a painted vase the scene a woman in pedal pushers walking a poodle lava lamps kidneyshaped plastic tables a lampshade made out of bon ami and ajax cleanser cartons wroughtiron and blackcanvas chairs you sank down into like hammocks an old motorola console tv also an assortment of fairytale dolls stuffed animals and shelves filled with old books shelly pulled a scaly battered brothers grimm off the shelf flipped through and replaced it rune squinted at shelly studying her a thought occurred to her she laughed know whats weird ive got a picture of you me well sort of here look she took a dusty book from the shelf and opened it up metamorphoses some old roman dude wrote these stories roman shelly asked as in julius caesar yeah here look at this picture shelly glanced at the color plate of a beautiful woman being led out of a dark cave by a man playing a lyre the caption read orpheus and eurydice see youre her eurydice you look just like her shelly shook her head then squinted she laughed i do you know thats funny she looked at the spine of the book this is roman mythology rune nodded it was a sad story eurydice died and went down to hades then orpheushe was her husband this musician guywent to rescue her isnt that romantic wait ive heard that story it was an opera didnt something go wrong yeah those roman gods had weird rules the thing is he could take her out of the underworld as long as he didnt look back at her that makes a lot of sense right anyway he did and that blew the whole thing back she went people think myths and fairy tales have happy endings but they dont all shelly gazed at the picture for a moment i collect old books too what kind rune assumed erotica but shelly said plays mostly in high school i was president of the drama club a thespian she laughed whenever i tell somebody in the industryi mean the porn businesstell them that they say something like whats that a dyke with a speech problem she shook her head my professions got a pretty low common denominator rune clicked on an ultraviolet light a blacklight poster of a ship sailing around the moon popped out into three dimensions it was next to purpleandorange tiedye hangings i mix my eras but you dont want to get too locked in do you now never be too literal thats my motto avoid it at all costs shelly had climbed up to the pilot house and was pulling the whistle cord there was no noise can you take this thing out for rides naw it doesnt drive rune said oh no wait im supposed to say she she doesnt drive drive well sail or whatever theres a motor but it doesnt work my old boyfriend and i were driving up along the hudson and we found iti mean her moored near bear mountain she was for sale i asked the owner to take me out for a spin and he said the motor didnt work so we went out for a tow we did a lot of haggling and when he agreed to throw in the formica dining room set i had to get it you pay to dock it here yep you pay the port authority they still run the docks even though they dont have much ship traffic anymore its pretty expensive i dont think i can stay here forever but itll do for now is it safe rune pointed out one of the picture windows thats still a working pier so this whole areas chained off the security guards and i are friends they keep an eye out i give them good christmas presents its really neat owning a house and theres no grass to mow shelly gave her another wan smile youre so enthusiastic and you actually live on a houseboat in manhattan amazing runes eyes sparkled come here ill show you whats amazing she walked out onto the small graypainted deck she clung to a railing and dipped her foot into the opaque oily water you going swimming shelly asked uncertainly rune closed her eyes you know that im touching the exact same water thats lapping up on the galapagos islands and in venice and in tokyo and hawaii and egypt its so neat andi havent figured this out yetit may very well be the same water that splashed against the nina pinta andsanta maria and against napoleons ships the same water they used to wash away the blood after marie antoinette got the axe im guessing that it might be thats the part im not too clear on does water like die i remember something from science class i think it just keeps recirculating shelly said you have quite an imagination ive been told that before rune jumped back on deck coffee something to eat just coffee they sat in the pilot house rune was putting peanut butter on her toast while shelly sipped black coffee the woman may have been a celebrity in the flesh trade but today she looked just like a connecticut housewife jeans boots white blouse and a thin light blue sweater the arms tied around her neck find the place okay rune asked wasnt hard i wouldve called first but you didnt give me a number i dont have a phone when i tried to get one the new york bell guys drove up laughed and left a moment passed and shelly said ive been thinking about the film even after you agreed to the final cut approval i didnt want to do it but something happened that changed my mind the bombing no shelly said what happened was i had a bad fight with one of the guys i work for i dont want to go into the details but it brought a lot of things into focus i realized how sick i was of the business ive been in it too long its time to leave if i can get some legitimate publicity if people can see that im not a bimbo maybe itll help me get legitimate jobs ill do a good job i really will i had a feeling about you the pale blue laser beams of her eyes fired out i think youre just the person who could tell my story when can we start rune said hows now ive got the day off she shook her head ive got some things to do now but why dont you meet me this afternoon around lets say five we can do a couple hours of work then tonight theres a party this publishers giving most of the companies publishing skin magazines are also into adult films and video therell be a lot of people from the business there maybe you could talk to them excellent where do you want to do the filming she looked around the room hows here i feel very comfortable here its going to be a great interview shelly smiled i may even be honest after shellyd left rune was at the window she caught another glint of red from the roof of the pier across the spit of slick water and she remembered the color the same as the jacket or windbreaker of the person shed seenor thought shed seenin times square following her she went into her bedroom and dressed five minutes later the red was still there and five minutes after that she was on her way toward the pier running low crouched like a soldier around her neck was a big chrome whistle the kind football referees use she figured she could get decibels easy and scare the hell out of anybody looking to give her trouble which was fine for skittish attackers for the others rune had something else a small round canister it contained grams of cs military tear gas she felt its comfortable weight against her leg she hurried along the highway the river water gave off its rottenripe smell riding on the humidity that the cloudsnow covering the skyhad brought the day became still several church bells chimed it was exactly noon rune twisted through the gap in the chain link and walked slowly up to the pier it rose three stories above her and the facade was weathered down to the bare wood in many places she could make out part of the name of the shipping line across the top in a dark blue paint that she associated with oldfashioned trains america was one word and she saw or thought she did a faint blue star the twelvefoot wooden doors looked imposing but were off their track and rune easily slipped through a seam into the darkness it was ratty and spooky inside at one time these piers had been the places from which the great liners had sailed to europe then theyd been used for cargo ships until brooklyn and new jersey docks took over most of that business now they were mostly just relics a barge half the size of a football field had appeared one day moored next to runes houseboat while shed been at the studio but that was the only commercial shipping traffic in the neighborhood rune had been to this particular pier a couple of times since shed docked the boat along this stretch of river shed stroll around imagining what the luxurious liners of the nineteenth century mustve been like she also wondered if some of the ships had dropped off contraband gold bullion was a frontrunner that had never been found pirates she knew had sailed the hudson river not far from here she wasnt surprised that she found no chests of gold the only salvage was empty cardboard boxes lumber and big pieces of rusty machinery after shed decided there was no plunder rune would come occasionally to picnic with friends on the roof and watch the giants in the clouds play above the city until they disappeared over brooklyn and queens sometimes shed come just to be by herself and feed the gulls in the portion of the pier farthest into the water there were warrens of rooms these had been offices and the offloading docks and were boarded up now whatever light snuck in did so through the grace of the carpenters sloppy nailing this portion of the pier contained the rickety staircase that led up to the roof and this portion of the pier was what she now slipped into rune eased through the back of the pier and started toward the stairs slowly at the foot of the stairwell the floor of the pier had given way a ragged hole three feet across led down into darkness water lapped the smell was sharp and foul rune stared through the gloom at the hole and edged slowly past it she listened carefully on her way up but there was no sound other than distant traffic and the water on the pilings and the wind that meant the storm would hit pretty soon rune paused at the top landing she pulled the white tear gas canister from her pocket and pushed the door open the roof was empty she stepped outside then walked carefully along the rotting tar paper and gravel testing each square in front of her at the edge she walked back toward the front of the building to the spot where she thought shed seen the guy rune stopped and looked down at her feet okay so itsnot my imagination she was looking at footprints in the tar they were largea mans shoe size and were smooth like conservative business shoes not sneakers or running shoes but aside from that nothing no cigarette ash no discarded bottles no cryptic messages as she stood there a sprinkling of rain began and she ed back to the stairs she started down slowly reaching out with her foot to find the flooring in the dimness a noise she paused on the secondfloor landing stepped through an open doorway into the dark abandoned office her hand gripped the tear gas canister firmly her pupils contracted from the brightness couldnt take in enough light to see anything but she could hear rune froze hes here someone was in the room nothing specific told herno popping boards no whispers no shuffles of feet the message was transmitted maybe by a smell or maybe by some sixthsense radar the wave came back with a message whoa honey hes big and hes pretty damn close rune didnt move the other figure didnt either though twice she heard the air of his breath across his teeth her eyes became accustomed to the dark and she looked for a target and slowly lifted the tear gas her hands began to quiver no not one but two of them and they were ghosts two pale forms humanlike vague undefined they both stared at her one held a thick white billy club she aimed the canister at them ive got a gun shit a mans voice said the other voice also male said take the wallet takeboth wallets her vision was improving the apparitions turned into two naked crewcut men in their midthirties she began to laugh when she saw what the club was it was now considerably smaller sorry she said this isnt a mugging sorry heavyduty indignation well i just want you to know you scared the living hell out of us for your information this room happens to be reserved rune asked how long have you been here too long apparently for the last hour or so the anger became giddy relief one of the men nodded toward his friend and said hes good but hes notthat good the other more sober fortyfive minutes closer rune asked did you hear anybody come down from the roof yeah i did fifteen minutes ago then you go up then you come down grand central station today did you see him wewere a little busy rune said please its important we thought he was cruising but we werent sure you have to be kind of careful sure no telling what kind of degenerate youll meet while having sex in deserted piers so we kept mum what did he look like medium build but otherwise i have no idea turning to his companion do you no we dont have any idea rune said did you see what he was wearing a jacket a red windbreaker hat an oldfashioned one dark slacks i think one voice said tight from the other youwould notice that rune said well thanks as she left she heard them whispering something about not exactly being in the mood anymore well you cantry she started the descent to the first floor feeling her thudding heartbeats slow rune laughed thisroom is reserved why didnt they pick a more romantic he got her from behind at the foot of the stairs as she was stepping carefully around the hole the hand grabbed her pony tail and jerked her backward she saw a gloved hand holding a razor box cutter start for her neck she grabbed his wrist and dug in hard with her short nails it deflected the knife and for a moment they grappled for it she knew if she let go of the banister shed fall but there was no other way to get the tear gas with her other hand it was deep in her pocket rune released her grip and as she tumbled into her attacker she grabbed the canister and without aiming pushed the button a cloud sprayed out between them blinding them both she cried out in pain as the attacker spun away hands over his face but he didnt let go and rune felt herself being pulled backward eyes shut she reached out but grabbed only air and fell in panic and confusion her breath exploded from her lungs as she hit the floor hard on her back she twisted onto her stomach then was up on one knee scrabbling away from him the man bent down quickly and gripped her around the neck he wasnt strong but he had surprise on his sideand desperation he kicked her in the chest again knocking her windless she curled into a ball gasping vaguely she saw his blurry form groping for the razor knife she smelled old wood and salt water and motor oil and rot and she tasted saltmaybe her tears maybe blood christ her eyes stung like alcohol she too began looking for her weapon slapping her hand on the floor trying to find the canister of tear gas he gave up on the knife and looked at the floor near them then he grabbed her by the collar and dragged her toward the jagged black opening that led down to the hudson a roar was in her ears he pushed her head then her shoulders into the hole he gripped her belt and she started to go in chapter four rune lashed out with her boot and came close to catching his groin but her aim was bad she hurt him only slightly and he just grunted angrily and drove a fist into her back she gave a faint scream tears ran the rotten fishy scent of the water rose from the water and choked her he kicked boards into the hole to widen it they fell into darkness he pushed her farther and farther in it was so dark beneath her she got a hand on the banister and held tight but this was just a minor inconvenience he kicked her hand and easily broke her grip ill swim but can i see the light of the surface what if theres no way to swim out from underneath what if theres just a pipe that goes a hundred feet down he dropped to his knees and took her by the hair with one hand then reached out with the other toward the edge of the hole to get a good grip and fling her into it hello ohmygod a mans voice the attacker froze jesus whats going on the other man from upstairs asked theyd either given up on their tryst or finished it and had come to investigate the noise the man let go of rune and glanced up the stairs she twisted away from him as he leapt back panicking she rolled away from the foot of the stairs when the attacker turned back toward her reaching forward what he was looking at wasnt rune but a tiny hissing nozzle the stream of tear gas caught him in the nose breathe it sucker breathe the man gasped covered his eyes and took a wild swipe at her rune fired again he stumbled past her shoved her hard into the hole that led to the river and then ran into the warehouse his pounding footsteps faded then vanished rune pulled herself from the hole and collapsed onto the floor frozen she pressed her eyes shut against the terrible pain her nose and throat burned violently she rested her face against the wooden floor as her breathing calmed and she smelled grease felt the coolness of fresh air returning oh my god one of the men said they were dressed now are you all right who was he they helped her to her feet did you get a look at him she asked no just saw that jacket it was red his friend answered like i said oh and the hat you have to call the police whats that smell its terrible tear gas a pause just whoare you rune rose to her feet slowly thanked them then stumbled through the warehouse out into the daylight when she got to a pay phone she called the police they showed up pretty quickly but as shed expected there wasnt much they could do she didnt have a detailed description of the attacker probably white male medium build no hair color no eye color no facial characteristic a red windbreaker like indont look now that scary movie based on the daphne du maurier story which rune deduced neither of the responding cops had seen or read judging by the blank look on their faces they said theyd check into it though they werent happy that shed had a canister of cs which was illegal in the city you have any idea why hed want to do it she supposed it might have something to do with her movie and the porn theater and the sword of jesus she told them this and the look on their faces told her that as far as they were concerned the case was already a dead end they flipped their notebooks closed and said theyd have a patrol car cruise past occasionally she asked them again how many men they were going to put on the case but they just looked at her blankly and told her they were sorry for her troubles and then they confiscated the tear gas after cleaning up putting hydrogen peroxide on the scrapes and digging a new tear gas canister out from under the sink rune went to l ampr productions ey whatve we got ere bob asked examining her face she wasnt about to tell him that the injuries might have to do with her moviesince it was l amprs betacam that would be at risk if she got machinegunned down on the street guy hassled me i beat the crap out of him uhhuh bob said skeptically listen after work i need to borrow the camera again and some lights bob in a lecturing mood said to her you know what this is rune rubbing the large video camera as if it were a blondes rump larry said it was okay ive used it before humor an old man luv tell me what is it its a betacam video camera bob its made by sony it has an ampex deck ive used one about fifty times do you know how much they cost more than youll ever pay me in my lifetime ill bet ha its worth fortyseven thousand dollars he paused for dramatic effect larry told me that the first time he loaned it to me i didnt think itd gone down in value you lose it you break it you burn out the tube you pay for it ill be careful bob do you know what fortyseven thousand dollars will buy he asked philosophically a man could take fortyseven thousand dollars move to guatemala and live like a king for the rest of his life ill be careful rune began numbering storyboards for a tv commercial estimate that larry and bob were bidding on next week like a king for the rest of his days bob called out retreating into the studio rune set the sony up on the deck of her houseboat next to a single watt redhead lamp she tore bits of silver gaffer tape from a large roll and with them mounted a pink gel on the black metal barn doors of the lamp it put a soft glow on shellys face tomaster cinematography luv you master light larry had told her she added a small fill lamp behind shelly rune also found she was picking up the lights of the city over the actresss head without any flare or afterimage looking through the eyepiece she thought totally excellent thinking too it also looks like i know what im doing she was very eager to impress her subject as shed been stuffing the storyboards into an envelope rune had been thinking up questions for shelly jotting them on a yellow pad but now as she turned the light on and started the tape rolling she hesitated the questions reminded her of her journalism course in high school uhm when did you get started in the business uhm whatre your favoritemovies other than adult movies did you go to college and what did you major in shelly though didnt need any questions rune got the opening shot shed been planning all alongan ecu extreme closeup of those reactorblue eyesthen pulled back shelly smiled and began to talk she had a low pleasing voice and seemed wholly in control confident like those feisty women senators and stockbrokers you see on pbs talk shows the first hour or so shelly discussed the pornography industry in a matteroffact businesslike way adult films were experiencing a reluctant death they were no longer chic and trendy as some had proclaimed them to be in the seventies the excitement of illicit thrills was gone the religious right and conservatives were more active but shelly explained there were other factors that helped the business certainly aids was a consideration watching sex is the safest sex also people tended to be more faithful now with fewer affairs couples experimented more at home you didnt have to go to some stinky theater in a tawdry part of town you and your partner could watch sexual acrobatics in your own bedroom the mechanics for viewing porn had changed too vcrsre the biggest contributor to the new popularity she explained porn shelly felt was meant for the video medium fifteen years ago the heyday of bigproduction porn the budgets for a film sometimes hit a million dollars there were elaborate special effects and constructed sets and costumes and ninetypage screenplays that the actors memorized they were shot on mm film in technicolor the producers of the classicbehind the green door actually campaigned for an oscar now porn was virtually homemade with dozens of small companies in the business they shot on tape never on film a producer was somebody with five thousand bucks a good source of coke and six willing friends there were few superstars like john holmes or annette haven or seka or georgina spelvin shelly lowe was as famous as anyone with a tough glance at the camera hell ive got five hundred films under my belt so to speak but stars fame was limited to new york and california mostly in middle america shelly lowe was just another face on the boxes of tapes offered for rental in curtainedoff corners of family video stores if shed been in the business in the midseventies she would have done live appearances at theater openings across the country now that didnt happen making a film was easy a threeperson crew rented a loft or took over somebodys apartment for two days set up the camcorders and lights and sound shot six to ten fuck scenes and twenty minutes of transitions the script was a tenpage story idea dialogue was improvised in the postproduction house two versions were edited hardcore for sale to the adult theaters mail order peep shows and video stores soft for sale to the cable stations and inroom hotel movie services movie theaters werent the biggest outlet for adult films anymore they went out of business or put in video projection units then went out of business anyway but people rented porn tapes and took them home and watched them four thousand xrated videos were made every year they had become a commodity mass production its the era of pornography as volkswagen what about you like personally rune asked you get forced into the business were you like kidnaped molested when you were ten shelly laughed not hardly i wanted to do it or maybe should say that the pressures were subtle i wanted desperately to act but i couldnt get any legit jobs nothing that paid the rent porn was the only job i could get then i found that not only was i acting but i was making great money i had control not only creative control but sexual control too it can be a real high werent you exploited shelly laughed once more shook her head looked straight into the camera thats the myth of pornography no were not poor farm girls who get enslaved men have the power in legitimate films but in porn its the other way around just like with sex in real life its thewomen whore in control we have what men want and theyre willing to pay for it we make more money than men do we dictate what we do and what we dont do were on top forgive the joke surprise in runes voice so you like the business a pause and the sincere eyes glazed back easily into the betacams expensive glossy lens not exactly theres one problem theres no sense of beauty they call them erotic films but theres nothing erotic about them erotic connotes emotional stimulation as well as physical closeups of people humping isnt erotic i think i said this to you before the business has a real low common denominator so why have you stayed with it rune asked i do some legitimate theater now not much but every once in a while and most ive ever made has been four thousand dollars a year making porn i made a hundred twelve last year lifes expensive i took the path of least resistance shelley slumped an inch and rune noticed something the tough flirty woman whod begun talking the shelly with the facts and figures the shelly with the newscasters grit in her voice wasnt the same person who was talking now this was someone different softer sensitive thoughtful shelly sat up crossed her legs she looked at her watch hey im beat lets call it a wrap for tonight sure the hot lights went dark and made tapping noises as they cooled immediately rune felt the chill of the evening envelop them how did it go you think rune asked i thought it was super shelly said youre a very easy person to talk to im not even using any of my questions rune sat in the lotus position and flapped her knees up and down like butterfly wings theres so much material and weve hardly started talking about you yet youre so good youre still interested we can go to that party you bet shelly asked use your phone sorry remember im miss incommunicado a shiptoshore radio thats what you need then lets stop by the studio for a minute ive got to see if theres a shoot scheduled for tomorrow she noticed runes small jvc camcorder why dont you bring that you can do some taping at the party great rune packed the small camera you think theyll mind shelly smiled in a way that was also a shake of her head youll be with the star remember lame duck productions soundstage was only three blocks from runes company both were located in chelsea a neighborhood that changed block by blockwhile l amprs building sat next to an overpriced gentrified restaurant lame ducks squatted in a gray and greasy stretch of korean importers and warehouses and coffee shops rune smelled garlic and rancid oil as they walked along the street cobblestones shone through the asphalt battered cars and delivery vans waited for another day of abuse on the streets of new york city they walked into the lobby of the building stained with the residue of a thousand halfhearted moppings shelly said ill be right down i just have to check the scheduling board is it too dark to shoot some exteriors she nodded toward the video camera rune said she would the security guard said oh miss lowe phone message for you it says urgent shelly took the pink message slip read it she said to rune be right down rune wandered along the sidewalk outside she held the camera to her eye but the lowlight warning flashed through the eyepiece she put it back into her bag the garlic was making her hungry and she wondered what there was to eat at pornographic film parties food like everybody else girl what do you think shellys just like anybody else she hey rune shellys voice filled the street rune looked up but in the gloom couldnt see which window she was calling from then she saw the actress outlined in a thirdfloor window she called back what im shooting at eleven tomorrow you want to watch i guess she said quickly and then just as quickly realized that she did not in fact want to see the shoot you think its okay ill make it okay let me make this call ill be right down she vanished inside this could be totally weird what was the set like would the crew seem bored did the sets turn into one big orgy maybe some of the actors would proposition herthough if all the actresses were tall and blonde and beautiful like shellythat probably wouldnt be a problem did men and women just walk around naked on thethe ball of flame was like a ragged sun so bright that rune instinctively threw her arms up over her eyes just saving her face from the bits of concrete and glass and wood that hurtled into the street on the heels of a roar so loud that the slap of the concussion landed like knuckles all over her body rune screamedin terror at the thundering volume and in pain as she slammed into a battered chevy van parked on the curb smoke rising flames for some time rune lay in the gutter her head wedged against the concrete curb her face resting in a patch of oily water the ringing in her ears so loud she thought a steam pipe had ruptured god what happened a plane crash rune sat up slowly she brushed at her ears they felt cottony stuffed with ash she snapped her fingers near them she couldnt hear a sound not her fingers not even the huge seagrave fire truck as it braked to a halt ten feet from her whose siren was probably screaming loudly she stood supporting herself on the van she was dizzy she waited for the sensation to pass but it didnt and she wondered if maybe she had a concussion rune wondered too if there was something wrong with her visionbecause she found she was focusing perfectly on two things at the same time one near the other far away the close object was a feather of thin paper giltedged and printed with fine lettering it sailed decorously down past her cheek and slipped away in the uneasy current of air the other thing rune could see all too clearly even through the column of black smoke was the hole in the third floor of the building in front of herthe cavern that had been the office where shelly lowe had been standing to shout to rune what would be apparently the last words shed ever say chapter five their faces were stone rune sat in the back of an nypd patrol car the door open her feet on the ground outside and wiped at her tears she was aware of the two men who stood five feet away watching her but she didnt return their gaze the fire was out a foul chemical reek filled the air and a film of smoke hung over the street like an oily fog runes face and elbows had been cleaned and bandaged by the ems attendants they used bandaids she thought they wouldve used something more elaborate but they just scrubbed the skin slapped on fleshcolored strips and went upstairs they walked slowly no one up there needed their talents she pressed the shredded wad of kleenex into her eyes one final time and looked up at the men who were dressed in dark suits shes dead isnt she youre shouting one of the detectives said she couldnt hear her own voiceher ears were still numb she repeated the question trying to talk more softly the question surprised them one had an expression that could have been a faint smile he said something she couldnt hear rune asked him to repeat it he said shes extremely dead it was confusing talking to them she caught fragments of phrases missed others she had to look at their eyes to make sense of what they were asking what happened she asked neither of them responded one asked gruffly whats your name miss she told them she heard not your stage name honey not the one you use when youre up on the silver screen your real name he gazed at her coldly rune is my real name wait you think i worked with shelly work you call itwork what does your mother say about your career anger burst in her face im not a porn actress the other smiled well i guess thats not too hard to figure out his eyes scanned her body so whatta you do for the company get coffee do makeup give the actors head to get em up before the shoot she started up listen sit down he waved her back into the car ive got a lot better things to do with my time than talk to one of you people his partner didnt seem as angry but he wasnt stopping the mans tirade you want to do this kind of bullshit with your life encouraging people to get diseases and things fine its a free country just dont expect me to like you and tell you how sorry i am your friend got blown the fuck up now i wanna ask my questions and get the hell outa here so tell me what you saw a notebook appeared she was crying again messy sniffling tears as she told them what happened about the party they were going to about shelly getting a phone message rune waiting for her downstairs rune said i saw her in the window then the room exploded she closed her eyes the blast replayed in slow motion she opened her eyes again the scene continued vivid in her mind it was it was soloud the one who was taking notes the mean one nodded and slipped his pad into his coat pocket you didnt see anybody else no he turned to the other with a feigned frown of thought maybe we should take her up to see the body she could id it yeah with that blast the mes officell have a bitch of a time you can be a big help come on miss porn youve got a strong stomach dont you he took her by the arm pulled her from the car the other was grinning half her skins blown off and the rest is pretty burnt he pushed her toward the doorway a voice behind them howdy gentlemen whats up cowboy stood on the sidewalk moving his knuckles slowly along the rim of his baseball cap he glanced at rune then back to the cops a detective nodded toward her eyewitness we were just rune pulled away stepped toward cowboy they were going to make me go upstairs and look at shellys body cowboys brow creased were they one of the cops shrugged a grin on his face cowboy said they took it out ten minutes ago sent it to the mes office you guys saw it go the detectives grinned having a little fun is all sam he was nodding not pissed but not smiling back either you finished with her guess mind if i talk to her for a bit shes all yours the detective turned to her well want you to sign a statement where can we get in touch with you rune gave them the phone number of l ampr productions climbing into their unmarked car one detective said i hope you consider this a lesson young lady get your life together i wasnt rune began but they slammed the doors and sped off cowboy was studying her face not too bad what do you mean by that the cuts i mean you were lucky itd been on ground level you might not have made it rune was staring at the smoldering hole where firemen had set up portable lights in metal cages hanging from scorched wires and conduit what was her name he asked shelly lowe that was her stage name she was an adultfilm star that was a studio lame duck productions he nodded looking up at the hole in the side of the building another porn bombing they she nodded at the detectives whod just left thought i worked for them they were giving you the shock treatment they do the same thing with kids they find with drugs and hookers and drunk drivers you humiliate them theyre supposed to change their wayward lifestyle and go back to school or go on the wagon and join the church i did it myself when i was a portable a what a beat cop she walked a foot or two toward the building staring at the opening i didnt work with her im doing a documentary about her i dont do those kind of films ive seen you before i was at the other bombing the theater and i saw you then again last night i saw somebody with acamera i didnt recognize you i asked you something and you didnt answer me i didnt hear he answered he touched his ear hearings not so great been doing bomb work for a few years now im rune she stuck out her hand his fingers were narrow but thick with calluses sam healy healy motioned for her to step back as several blueandwhite police cars pulled away rune noticed that most of the police were gone just a halfdozen fire trucks were left and the blueandwhite bomb squad station wagon he stood with his hands on his hips looking at the shattered wall he paced up and down why is everyone gone healy stared at the bricks he asked did you see a flash a flash yeah what color was it i dont remember red or orange i guess he said did you feel a chemical irritation like tear gas or anything it smelled pretty bad but i dont think so no one threw anything through the window like a hand grenade like anything he said no shelly called out the window asked me a question then she went to make a phone call it blew up a minute later less maybe phone call she got a message that she was supposed to call someone the guard might know who but im sure the detectives talked to him healy was frowning he said in a soft voice they sent the guard home he didnt know anything and didnt say anything about a message or the detectivessaid he didnt hey wait here a minute okay he was walking back to the station wagon on his long legs he spoke on the radio for a few minutes she saw him put the receiver back on the dash a young officer came up to him and handed him a plastic bag when he returned to rune she said second angel he gave a surprised laugh i was looking over your shoulder last week he nodded then debated and showed her the plastic sleeve thesecond angel blew his trumpet and a great mountain burningwithfire was thrown into the sea and a third of the sea became blood this too was from the sword of jesus he slipped it into his attache case rune said what was asking a minute agowhere is everybody youre almost the only cop left ah the word has come down healy looked at the crater again word he nodded toward the smoking building if say a copd been killed in there or a kid or a nun or pregnant lady well thered be a hundred cops and fbi here right now he looked at her the kind of glance parents give their kids during birdsandbees lectures to see if the message is getting across it didnt seem to be and healy said the word is were not supposed to waste too much time on people like this in the porn industry understand thats ridiculous runes eyes flashed what about those people in the theater dont you care about them we care we just dont care too much and you want to know the truth about the patrons at the velvet venus a couple of them were innocent bystanders sure but two were wanted on drug charges one was a convicted felon who jumped parole one was carrying a teninch butcher knife and if a nund been walking by outside when it went off or on that sidewalk there shed be just as dead as shelly lowe true whichs why im saying the were not going to stop investigating were just not going to waste resources rune was spinning the silver bracelet on her wrist you talk like shelly wasnt a real person she was and somebody killed her im not saying i feel that way would it give you any more incentive if you knew she was trying to get out of the business rune somebody kills you and its a crime somebody kills shelly lowe and its urban renewal that sucks a fire department inspector walked up to them larger than life in his blackandyellow gear were going to have to put supports in before anybody can go up sam ive got to do the postblast have to wait till tomorrow i wanted to finish up tonight rune walked away sure he wants to take five minutes or so and look for clues rune then get back to protecting nuns healy called after her wait the voice was commanding she kept going please she slowed i want to ask you some questions she stopped and turned to him and she knew that he could see her thick tears in the swinging glare of the firetruck lights she held up a hand angrily she said okay but not tonight not now theres something ive got to do and if i dont go now i wont ever the detectives have my number she thought maybe healy called something to her she wasnt sure her hearing was at the moment a lot worse than his but mostly she was concentrating on where she was going and had absolutely no idea how she was going to handle what she now had to do nicole dorleans however had already heard the news rune stood in the doorway of the apartment in a highrise in the fifties watching the woman lean against the doorjamb exhausted by the weight of sorrow her face was puffy along with the tears shed scrubbed away some of the makeup but not all it made her face lopsided nicole straightened up and said like sorry come on in the rooms were cool and dark rune smelled leather and perfume and the faint fumes of the vodka that nicole had been drinking she glanced at the blotches of modern paintings on the wall the theatrical posters she noticed some framed signatures one looked like it said george bernard shaw most she didnt recognize they walked into a large room a lot of black leather though not kinky the way youd think a porn stars apartment would be more like some millionaire plastic surgeon would have there was a huge glass coffee table that looked like it was three inches thick the carpet was white and curled around the toes of runes boots she saw packed bookshelves and remembered the way she and shelly had looked through some of runes books just that morning and she wanted to cry but forced herself not to because nicole seemed to be pulling up just shy of hysterical the woman had her mourning station assembled a box of kleenex a bottle of stoly a glass a vial of coke she sat down in the nest of the couch ive forgotten your name ruby rune i just cant believe it those bastards theyre supposed to be religious but thats not the way good christians ought to be fuck em who told you rune asked the police called one of the producers he called everyone in the company oh god nicole blew her broad nose demurely and said you want a drink anything rune said no i just came by to tell you i was going to call but that didnt seem rightyou two seemed close nicoles tears were streaming again but they were the sort that dont grab your breath and her voice remained steady you were with her when it happened she hadnt heard runes refusing a drink or had decided to ignore it and was pouring stoly over small halfmelted ice cubes i was in the street waiting for her we were going to a party the aaaf party sure the memory of which set off another jag of tears nicole handed rune the drink she wanted to leave but the actress looked at her with such wet imploring eyes that she eased into the hissing leather cushions and took the offered glass oh rune she was one of my best friends i cant believe it she was here this morning we were joking talking about the partyneither of us really wanted to go to it and she made breakfast what should i say rune thought that itll be all right of course it wont be all right that time heals all wounds forget about it no way some wounds stay open forever she thought of her father lying in a shaker heights funeral home years ago death changes the whole landscape of your life forever rune sipped the clear bitter drink you know whats unfair nicole said after a moment shelly wasnt like me okay i do a pretty good job ive got big boobs so men like watching me and i think i know how to make love pretty good and i like what i do i make good money ive even got fans send me letters hundreds of em but shelly she didnt like the business it was always like she was carrying around a you know burden of some kind she wouldve done something else if she had a chance those religious nuts its not fair they picked her nicole stared at the bookcases for a moment you know one time we went to this movie about this hooker who was also a blues singer she had a terrible life she was so sad shelly said that was her thats how her life was blue we saw it twice and boy did we cry which is what she did now rune set the vodka down and put her arm around nicoles shoulders what a pairwe are she thought but there was nothing like tragedy to bring out sisterliness they talked for another hour until runes head began to ache and the cuts on her face began to throb she said she had to leave nicole was sentimental drank and still segued into tears every few minutes but she also would be asleep in a few minutes she hugged rune hard and took her number at l ampr rune waited for the elevator to take her down to the shiny marble lobby of the building thinking how it was really sad that now with shelly gone rune wouldnt be able to make the movie that would tell everyone about herabout how she was really a serious person despite what she did for a living how she wanted to rise above it but then she thought why not whycouldnt she make the film sure she could and remembering something that nicole had said about the blues suddenly the title for her film came to mind she thought about it for a minute and decided that yes that was it epitaph for a blue movie star the elevator arrived rune stepped in rested her face against the cool brass plate holding the buttons and sent the car on its journey to the first floor chapter six i just look like you know what youre doing and he wont stop you hell let you right in life is all a question of attitude rune knew she was wearing a blue windbreaker on the back in white were the lettersny shed stenciled them on that morning with acrylic poster paint she kept the sony betacam on her shoulder as she walked past the uniformed policeman standing in the lobby of lame duck productions she nodded in a distracted way cool a civil servant nod confident hed let her pass by he stopped her whore you he asked a guy who looked likewhat was his nameeddie haskell on leaveit to beaver film unit he looked at her black stretch pants and hightop keds never heard of it what precinct you out of state police she said now you dont mind i got five other css to do today whats a cs eddie didnt move crime scene cs he was nodding shield he asked rune reached into her purse and flipped open an id wallet on one side was a bright gold badge and on the other was an id card with a sullen photo of her it gave her name as sargant randolf the man who sold her the id an hour before in an arcade in times square had said your names sargant my generation they named kids weird things too like sunshine and moonbeam eddie glanced at it shrugged you gotta use the stairs elevators broke rune climbed to the third floor the scorched smell assaulted her again and turned her stomach she stepped through the door into what had been an office she lifted the heavy camera and started shooting the scene wasnt what she expected wasnt like in the movies where you see a little smoke damage chairs knocked over broken glass this was pure destruction whatever furniture was in the room had been blown to shreds of wood and metal and plastic nothing was recognizable except a blistered file cabinet that looked as if a huge fist had slammed into it the acoustical tile on the ceiling was gone wires hung down and the floor was a frozen black sea of paper trash and chunks of debris the walls were crisp bubbles of blackened paint heat still rose from piles of damp black cloth and papers she panned slowly this is whereshelly lowes life ended this is how it ended inflames and avoice behind her asked what do you think the camera drooped and she shut it off she turned and saw sam healy standing in another doorway sipping coffee from a blue deli cup she liked that asking what hed asked rather than what the hellre you doing here which is probably what he shouldve been asking rune said i think it looks like hades you know the underworld hell yeah healy nodded toward the hallway whyd he let you up here i reasoned with him healy walked up to rune and spun her around slowly looking at the letters on her back cute whatre you impersonating a bus driver just shooting some tape ah your documentary she looked at a small suitcase on the floor next to him whatre you doing here i thought the word was keep your distance remember the word im just a grunt i collect the evidence what the da does with it is his business she looked at a number of plastic bags sitting next to his attache case what kind of evidenceve you another voice cut through the room thats her eddie the cop it was that kind of emphasis onher that rune had heard before it usually came from teachers her parents and bosses rune and healy looked up eddie was with another man heavyset he looked familiar yeah that was itat the first bombing the theater brown suit sam he nodded at healy then said to rune im detective begley i understand youre with the new york state police could we see your id again please rune frowned i never said that i said i wanted to do some tapesof the state police for the news eddie shook his head she showed me a shield miss you know its a crime to have a badge its a crime for some people to have a badge healy said artie shes with me its okay sam she cant go flipping shields around begley turned to her either open your bag or well have to take you to the precinct the thing is eddie took the leopardskin bag and handed it to begley he rummaged through the dullclinking carnival of junk he searched for a minute or two then grimaced and dumped the contents out on the floor there was no badge rune pulled out all her pockets empty begley looked at eddie who said i saw it i know i did healy said ill keep an eye on her artie begley grunted handed her bag to eddie and ordered him to fill it back up she had a shield he protested begley said to healy got a positive id on the body from dentals its that lowe woman all right nobody else hurt and you were asking last night about her phone call healy nodded the security guard doesnt remember who the message was from and the phone companys still running pen registers trying to find out who called who as soon as we know anything else well let you know thanks begley left eddie finished refilling runes bag with a cold glance at rune he too left rune turned and saw healy reading her id you spelled sergeant wrong she reached for it and he lifted it above her reach begleys right you get caught with this its a misdemeanor and wising off to a copll get you the maximum sentence you picked my purse he slipped the fakeleather wallet into his pocket bomb squads got steady hands he finished his coffee rune nodded after begley you were asking them to check out phone calls and things sounds to me like youre more than just a grunt a nonchalant shrug you leave the camera off and ill show you what got okay they walked to a crater in the concrete floor rune slowed as she got close streaks of white and gray led outward from it above them was a black mess of a dome where the explosion had destroyed the acoustictiled ceiling in front of rune was the gaping hole where the outer wall had been healy pointed to the crater i measured it we can tell from the size how much explosive there was he held up a small glass vial with cotton in it this has absorbed the chemical residue in the air around the site ill send it over to the police lab in the academy near second avenue theyll tell me exactly what kind of explosive it was runes hands were sweating and her stomach was knotted this is where shelly had been standing when shed turned to make her call this is where shed been standing when she died maybe in this very spot her legs went weak she backed away slowly healy continued but im sure it was composition four c its usually called you hear about it in beirut the number one choice among terrorists its military you cant buy it from commercial demolition suppliers it looks like dirty white putty kind of oily you can mold it real easily was it like hooked to a clock or something healy walked to his attache case and picked up one of the plastic bags it contained bits of burnt metal and wires junk rune said butimportant junk it tells me exactly how the bomb worked how she was killed it was in the phone she called from which was on a wooden desk right about there he pointed to a space on the floor near the crater the phone was a newmodel taiwanese import thats significant because in the old western electric phones most of the space was take up by the workings theres a lot of empty space in new phones that let the killer use about a half pound of c thats not so much healy smiled grimly oh yes it iscs about ninetyone percent rdx which is probably the most powerful nonnuclear explosive around its a trinitramine rune nodded though she had no idea what that was they mix that with a sevacate and an isobutylene oh and a little motor oilthose are for stability so it doesnt go off when you sneeze you dont need very much at all for a very very big bang detonation rate of about twentyseven thousand feet per second dynamite is only about four thousand if you havent sent it to the lab how do you know its c i pretty much knew when i walked in i could smell it it was either that or semtex a czech explosive i also found a bit of plastic wrapperwith a us army code on it so itd have to be c and old c because it didnt completely detonate what set it off he was absently examining burnt pieces of metal and plastic in the bag squeezing them sliding them around the c was molded around an electric detonating cap attached to a little box that contained a battery and a radio receiver the wiring was also connected to the switch that closes the circuit on the phoneso the device wasnt armed until someone picked up the receiver thats the problem with radio detonation you always run the risk that somebody police or fire or a cb operator will hit your frequency by mistake and set the charge off while youre planting it or when theres somebody in the room you dont want to kill rune said so shelly picked up the phone called the number and whoever was on the other endwhatused a walkietalkie to set it off something like that healy was staring out the window and thats the phone number your friends trying to find out only hes not as enthusiastic as he ought to be yeah i kind of saw that hey therere phone booths on the corner rune said nodding out the window would heve been nearby so he could see shelly go inside healy said youre a born cop i want to be a born film maker so i already called somebody at your unit this morning my unit he glanced at her jacket cs crime scene its on their list to dust all the phones that have a clear visual path to the building here definitely not a grunt or a techie he sounded like a real detective rune said so somebody followed us here you know there was someone spying on shelly and me near where i live i went to see and he beat me up healy frowned turned toward her you report it yeah i did but i didnt get a good look at him whatdid you see broadbrimmed hatkind of tan color he was medium build wore a red jacket i thought i saw him earlier too around the theater that night i saw you a week after the first bomb young old dont know red jacket healy wrote some lines in a notebook rune poked at the metal bits through the plastic bag you know whats kind of funny healy turned to her that this is the kind of setup you use when you want to kill someone specific is that what youre thinking well yeah thats exactly what i was thinking healy nodded this is what the mossad and plo and professional hit men use you just going to make a statement like the faln or the sword of jesus you leave a timed device in front of the office or in a movie theater this bomb was it different from the one in the theater a bit this was remotedetonated that one was timed and the charge was different too this was c that was c which is about as powerful but leaves dangerous fumes and is messier to work with isnt that suspicious two different explosives not necessarily in the us good explosives are hard to find dynamites easyhell southern states you can buy it in hardware storesbut like i told you c and c are strictly military illegal for civilians to buy you can only get them on the black market so bombers have to take what they can get a lot of serial bombers use different materials the common elements are the target and message ill know more when i talk to the witness what witness a guy who was hurt in the first bombing he was in the theater watching the movie rune said and what was his name again noagain about it i dont give out the names of witnesses i shouldnt even be talking to you then why are you healy looked out the gap traffic moved slowly by on the street horns screamed and drivers hooted and gestured everyone in a hurry a halfdozen people stood outside gawking up at the hole he looked at her for a moment in a probing way that made her uncomfortable what they did herehealy nodded at the cratered floorthat was real slick real professional i were you id think about a new subject for your film at least until we find this sword of jesus rune was looking down playing with the plastic controls on her sony i have to make my film ive been in ordnance disposal for fifteen years the thing about explosives is that theyre not like guns you dont have to look the person in the eyes when you kill them you dont have to be anywhere near you dont worry about hurting innocent people hurting innocent people ispart of the message i told shelly i was going to make this film and i am nothings going to stop me healy shrugged im just telling you what id want you to do you were my girlfriend or something rune said can i have my wallet back no letme destroy the evidence it cost me fifty bucks fifty for a phony shield healy laughed youre not only breaking the law youre getting ripped off in the process now get out of here and think about what i said about the mossad and bombs and c about making a different kind of movie sonof a bitch that night home from work rune stood in the doorway of her houseboat and looked at the damage every drawer was open the thief hadnt been very carefuljust dumping clothes helterskelter opening notebooks and dressers and galley drawers and looking under futons clothes papers books tapes food utensils stuffed animals everything everywhere sonof a bitch rune pulled a new tear gas canister out of a closet near the door and walked through the boat the burglar had left she stepped into the middle of the mess picked up a few thingsa couple of socks the book of grimms fairy stories her shoulders slumped and she set the objects on the floor again there was too much to do and none of it was going to get done tonight damn rune turned a chair right side up and sat on it she felt queasy somebody had touched that sock touched the book touched her underwear and maybe her toothpaste throw them out she thought she shuddered from the sense of violation why she had valuables fiftyeight indian head nickels which she thought were the neatest coins ever made and would have to be worth something about three hundred dollars in cash wadded up and stuffed in an old box of cornflakes some of the old books would be worth something the vcr then she thought shit the sony l amprs camera hells bells it cost fortyseven thousand dollars shit larrys gonna sue me double shit enoughfor a man to live in guatemala for the rest of his life shit but the battered betacam was just where shed left it she sat for ten minutes calming down then started to clean an hour later a good percentage of order had been restored the burglar hadnt been particularly subtle to unlock the door hed pitched a rock through one of the small windows looking out on the jersey side she swept the glass up and nailed a piece of plywood over the opening shed thought about calling the cops again but what would they do why bother theyd be too busy protecting nuns and the mayors brother and celebrities she was just finishing cleaning when she glanced at the betacam once more the door on the video cameras recording deck was open and the cassette of shelly was gone the man in the red jacket had robbed her a moment of panic until she ran to her bedroom and found the dupe tape shed made she cued it up to make sure saw a bit of shellys face and ejected the cassette she put it in a baggie and slipped it into the cornflakes box with her money rune locked the doors and windows turned out the outside lights then she made herself a bowl of grapenuts and sat down on her bed slipped the tear gas canister under a pillow and lay back against the pile of pillows she stared at the ceiling as she ate out the window a tug honked its deep vibrating horn she turned to look and caught a glimpse of the pier she remembered the attack the man in the red windbreaker she remembered the terrible burst of explosion the pressure wave curling around her face she remembered shellys blonde head turning into the room to die rune lost her appetite and put aside the bowl she climbed out of bed and walked to the kitchen she opened the phone book and found the section on colleges and universities she began to read chapter seven the problem was that his voice kept trailing into silence as he answered her questions as if everything he said brought to mind something else he had to consider professor rune prompted right sure and hed continue on for a few minutes then the words would meander once again his office was filled with what must have been two thousand books the window overlooked a patch of quadrangle grass and the low sprawl of harlem beyond that students strolled by slowly they all seemed dreamyeyed and intense professor vcv miller sat back in his creaky wooden chair the camera didnt bother him in the least ive been on tv before he told her when shed called i was interviewed for sixty minutes once his subject was comparative religion and hed written a treatise on the subject of cults when rune had told him she was doing a documentary on the recent bombings hed said id be happy to talk to you ive been told my work is definitive making it sound likeshe should be happy to speak tohim miller was in his sixties hair white and wispy and he always kept his body threequarters to the camera though his eyes locked right onto the lens and wouldnt let go until his voice grew softer and softer and he looked out the window to contemplate some elusive thought he wore an ancient brown suit flecked with the dandruff of cigarette ash his teeth were as yellow as little ivory buddhas and so were his index finger and thumb where he held his cigarette even though he didnt inhale it while the camera was running rune found the monologue had wandered into haiti and she was learning a number of things about voodoo and west african dahomean religion do you know about zombies sure ive seen the movies rune said somebody goes to an island in the caribbean and gets bit by this walkingdead gross thing yuck with worms crawling around then he comes back and bites all his friends and im talking about real zombies real zombies her finger released the trigger of the camera there is a such a thing you know in haitian culture the walking dead are more than just a myth its been found thathoungans ormambos the priests and priestesseswould appear to induce death by administering cardiopulmonary depressants the victims seemed to die in fact they were in suspended animation rune larryd told her the interviewer is always in control remember that she said lets get back to the sword of jesus sure sure sure the people thatre responsible for these pornography bombings rune said what do you know about them nary a thing miss you dont her eyes strayed to the bookshelves what was this definitive stuff no never heard of them but you said you knew most of the cults and i do but that doesnt necessarily mean they dont exist there are thousands of cult religions in this country the sword of jesus could be one that has a hundred members who read from the bible and talk fire and brimstoneof course all the while writing off their tithes on their income taxes he got an ash into the round ceramic ashtray on his desk before it fell to the floor say they did exist you have any thoughts on them well guess the volume went way down eyes out the window again professor sorry its surprising what is the killings the violence whys that you see in america we cant escape the heritage of religious tolerance were so damn proud of it oh well lynch a man because hes black persecute him because hes a communist despise him because hes poor or because hes irish or italian but his religion no that is not a prejudice that flies in america the way it would in europe and you know why nobody really cares about religions here but what about jim jones he was american people may kill toprotect their religion and these sword of jesus people if there is such a thing unquestionably come from conservative military backgrounds and a love of firearms and hunting theyd kill abortionists but see thats to save lives killing purely to further a system of morality well i could see some islamic sects some primitive religions doing that but not in america not a christian group remember christians were the folks that brought you the crusades and the reviews were not good at all weve learned our lesson would you have any idea where i could find out if theyre real youre talking to the best source young lady and im afraid i cant help very much is this going to be network she said maybe even in the movie theaters a caterpillar of ash fell onto his shiny pants and he brushed it away to join the other fractured gray bodies at his feet i have tenure you know but still every bit helps now if you still have some tape left would you like to hear about the sioux sun dance ceremony in his most cheerful down under lilt larry was saying what it is were gonna give you a raise rune was unplugging the tungsten lights theyd just finished interviewing people for a documentary on daycare centers rune was exhausted shed been up until three that morning poring over books about cultsand finding nothing about the sword of jesusand rewatching professor millers lessthanhelpful tape now she paused and stifled a yawn looked at her boss this was larry wasnt it occasionally when she had a hangover or was tired or it was early in the morning she had trouble telling them apart bob she had to remember was a little smaller with a trimmer beard and a tendency toward beiges and browns while larry wouldnt be found south of dutchess county in anything but black a raise he said we figure its time you took on a few more things her stomach gave an excited lurch a promotion i get to be a cameraman something like that howmuch like that we were thinking an administrator rune began coiling the electric wires into loops after a moment she said i worked for an administrator once she wore her hair in a little bun and had glasses on a metal chain and her blouses had little embroidered dogs on them i got fired after about three hours is that the sort of administrator you have in mind serious work is what im saying luv youre firing cathy and you want me to be a secretary oh this is like too gross for words larry rune forget it his face was a massive grin and he would have been blushing if he knew how cathys leaving right that part is true larry i

shouldnt do that crap larry what about your documentaries theyre honest honesty as its place luv but what it is this agencys paying us a two undred thousand fee plus fifteen percent markup on

right his mouth curled a portion of a millimeter maybe when its finished you could talk to some of the programming people you know put in a good word for me rune you think youre gonna send a tape to pbs and theyre gonna bleedin show it just like that pretty much lemme see it first maybe you got some good footage we could go in and work with it not it me work with me sure yous what i meant to say you can introduce me to some distributors yeah might appen all right fair enough you want an administrator ill do it larry hugged her ey way to go luv rune finished coiling the wires she made sure the coils were even but not too tight that was one thing theyd taught her at l ampr and she appreciated ithow to take care of your equipment larry asked ey what kinda hook dyou come up with for that film on the bombing a bio of that girl got killed thats what it was going to be about but not anymore whats its about now its going to be about finding a murderer rune sat on nicole dorleanss couch sinking so far into the luxurious leather that her feet were off the ground this is very embryonic you know they oughta sell these to therapists get right back you know to the womb sitting here nicole wore a purple minidress with a scooped neck showing six inches of taut cleavage purple glittery stockings white highheel shoes when she walked she loped forward awkwardly her concession to mourning was a huge black bow in her hair shed just come back from a memorial service for shelly an informal event that the people at lame duck had arranged ive never seen so many people crying at one time everybody loved her that brought back the tears but this time she was able to control the sobbing rune watched her wander through the living room nicole had startedobsessively it seemedto pack up shellys belongings but since the actress had no close family she didnt know what to do with them moving cartons lay halffilled in the bedroom sunlight streamed through the openweave drapes and fell in bright patterns on the carpet rune squinted against it as she waited for nicole to finish aligning the boxes folding the lids over finally nicole sighed and sat down and that was when rune said to her i think shelly was murdered nicole gazed blankly for a minute well yeah the sword of christ sword of jesus whatever except that its fake rune said it doesnt exist but they left these notes about angels destroying the earth and everything its a coverup but i read it innewsweek ithas to be true rune looked at the centerpiece on the table hungry and wondering if the apples were too ripe she hated mushy apples but if she started to eat one she couldnt very well put it back she said nobodys every heard of them and i cant find any reference to the group anywhere and think about ityou want to kill someone okay you make it look like a terrorist thing its a pretty good cover but why would somebody want to kill shelly thats what im going to find out thats what my movies going to be about im going to find the killer nicole asked what do the police think they dont first of all they dont care she was killed they said well they dont think much of people in your line of work second i havent told them my theory and im not going to if i do and its true then everybbdyll get the story i want it for me an exclusive murder what do you think nicole was there anybody that wouldve wanted shelly dead rune could sense the gears turning beneath the teased sprayed hair that glittered with tiny silver flecks a living hallmark decoration nicole shook her head was she going out with anybody nobody serious the thing is in this business its realwhats the wordincestuous you know you cant just meet some guy at a party like anybody else sooner or later hes gonna ask what you do for a living nowadays with aids and hep b and everything thats a way for a girl to get dropped real fast so what happens is you tend to just hang out a lot with other people in the business date a lot maybe move in with a guy and finally get married but shelly didnt do that there was one guy she was seeing recently andy somebody a funny last name dont remember he was never over to the apartment it seemed pretty casual could you find out his name nicole walked into the kitchen and looked at the wall calendar she traced a pencilwritten note with her finger it made a sad sweep as it followed shellys writing andy llewellyn fourl s in his name thats why i thought it was weird rune wrote down the name then looked over the calendar she pointed whos thata tucker was penned in his name appeared almost every wednesday going back for months doctor nicole blew her red nose with a paper towel that was her acting coach acting coach the movies we did they paid the rent but she loved real plays most of all it was kind of a hobby of hers going to auditions doing small parts but she never got any big roles as soon as they found out what she did for a living it was dont call us well call you come here nicole motioned rune back into the living room and over to the bookcases her neck crooked sideways rune read some of the titles they were all about acting balinese theater stanislavsky shakespeare dialects playwriting history of theater nicoles hand strayed to a book the astonishingly red nails tapped the spine that was the only time shelly was happy when she was rehearsing or reading about the theater yeah rune said remembering something that shellyd told her she said she had some real parts she made a little money at it rune pulled a book off the shelf it was written by someone named antonin artaud the theater and its double it was dogeared and battered a lot of it was underlined one chapter had an asterisk next to it it was headed the theater of cruelty sometimes shed take time off and do summer stock around the country she said that regional theater was where most of the creative playwrights were being showcased it was all very brainy stuff i tried to read some of the scripts gosh i tell you i can follow lines like and then they take their clothes off and fuck nicole laughed but this stuff shelly was interested in was way way beyond me rune put the book back on the shelf she jotted tuckers name next to andy llewellyns shelly said what made her decide to do the film was that she had a fight with somebody she worked with you know who that was nicole paused no rune had seen nicole inlusty cousins she was a bad actress then and she was a bad actress now come on nicole well dont make too much out of it i wont its just i dont want to get anybody in trouble tell me who guy who runs the company lame duck rune asked yeah danny traub but him and shelly fought all the time they have since shes been working for them a couple of years what do they fight about everything dannys like your nightmare boss into the notebook okay anybody else nobody she worked with but maybe somebody she didnt well theres this guy tommy savorne he was her ex husband boyfriend they lived together in california for a couple years he still lives there he does yeah only hes been in town for the past couple weeks but i know he didnt have anything to do with the bomb hes the sweetest guy youd ever want to meet he looks kind of like john denver what happened with them did they break up because of her business she didnt talk about tommy much he used to make porn did a ton of drugs too hey who doesnt right but then he cleaned up his act got out of the business dried out at some fancy clinic like betty ford did the twelve steps or something then he started doing legit videosexercise tapes something like that i think shelly resented that he went legit kind of a slap at her i think he kept needling her to leave the business but she couldnt afford to finally she left him i dont know why she wouldnt go back hes cute and he makes good money and they were fighting oh not recently they didnt have much contact but they used to fight a lot i heard her on the phone sometimes he kept wanting to get back together and she kept saving she couldnt one ofthose conversationsexboyfriend thing you know youve had those a hundred times rune whose romantic life had been nonexistent since richard had leftand pretty damn bleak before him toonodded with phony female conspiracy hundreds thousands but that was months ago nicole added im sure he couldnt have hurt her i see him from time to time hes really sweet and they were good friends seeing them togethertheres no way he could look at shelly and hurt a hair on her head why dont you tell me where hes staying anyway hearing in her memory sam healys voice ive been in ordnance disposal for fifteen years the thing about explosives is that theyre not like guns you dont have to look the person in the eyes when you kill them you dont have to be anywhere near chapter eight the hotel overlooked gramercy park that trim private garden bordered in wrought iron at the end of lexington avenue the lobby of the place was all red and gold with flecked fleurdelis wallpaper dozens of layers of paint coated the woodwork and the carpet smelled soursweet one of the two elevators was brokenpermanently it seemed it was quiet as rune waited for the elevator to descend to the ground floor a woman in her fifties wearing a greenandgold dress her face a smooth curve of foundation makeup watched rune from under jutting glossy eyelashes a middleaged musician with dirty brown hair sat with his foot up on a battered ovation guitar case and read the post tommy savornes room was on the fourteenth floor which it occurred to rune was really the thirteenth because when they built hotels in the thirties and forties they didnt label the thirteenth floor that had a certain appeal for her she felt that superstition was something people who were unliteral tended to believe in and being too literal was a major sin in her bible she found the door and knocked chains and latches jangled and the heavy door swung open a man stood there sunburned and cuteand looking yeah a bit like john denver more like a cowboy at a dude ranch his face was somber he wore blue jeans and a work shirt he wore one crew sock the other dangled from his hand his hair was shaggy and blond he was thin hi what can i do for you youre tommy savorne he nodded im rune i knew shelly nicole said you were in town and i just wanted to come by and say i was real sorry about what happened she hadnt been sure what she was going to say after that but it didnt matter tommy gave a nod and motioned her inside the room was small the walls offwhite the carpet gold she got a whiff of a stale smellwhat was it old food aging plaster probably just the smell of a prewar hotel going to seed but tommy was burning incense sandalwoodwhich helped two table lamps gave off a salmon glow hed been reading a cookbook one of a dozen of them on the chipped brownlaminate desk sit down you want something he looked around i dont have any liquor just soda mineral water oh i have some babagounash whats that like sassafras i had this ginseng cola one time yuck its eggplant dip my own recipe he held up a plastic container of browngreen mash rune shook her head i just ate but thanks nothing for me savorne sat on the bed and rune flopped into the naugahyde chair with split sides it bled dirtywhite upholstery stuffing you were shellys boyfriend rune asked he was nodding squinting slightly tommy said shelly and i broke up over a year ago but we were good friends i still live in california where she and i used to live im just in town now for a job california rune mused ive never been id like to go sometime sit under palm trees and watch movie stars all day long im from the north monterey its about a hundred miles south of san francisco hard to starspot there except for clint eastwood thats a pretty good exception tommy was carefully pulling a sock over his large foot even his feet looked tanned and trim she looked closely wild hes got manicured toenails she saw cowboy boots and several cowboy hats in the closet he sighed i cant believe it i cant believe shes dead he reached lethargically under the bed then snagged a black loafer slipped it on found the other one it drooped in his hand how did you know her i was making a movie about her rune said savorne said a movie a documentary she didnt mention that we just started the day she was killed i was with her when it happened savorne scanned her face that how you got those scratches i was outside when the bomb went off its nothing serious you know even though we werent going out anymore we still talked a lot i was thinking thats something i wont be able to do anymore not ever again how longve you known her five six years i used to he looked away well i used to be in her line of work the films i mean an actor he laughed wanly not really built for that laughed again his red face turned redder im talking about physique not equipment rune smiled he continued no i was a cameraman and director did some editing too id was in film school at ucla for a couple of years but that wasnt for me i knew how to handle a camera i didnt need to sit in classes full of these nerds so i borrowed some money bought an old bolex and opened my own production company i was going to be the next george lucas or spielberg i didnt get to first base i went under in about three months then this guy i knew called and told me about a job shooting an adult film i thought hey watching beautiful women and getting paid for it why not i gotta admit i thought maybe id get a little of the action myself everybody in the crew thinks that but it never works out that way but they paid me a hundred cash for two hours work and i decided that was going to be my career howd you meet shelly i moved to san francisco and started making my own films shelly was auditioning at the theaters in north beach the legit theaters actually i picked her up in a bar is how we met we started going out when i told her what i did well most girlsd go im outa here but shelly was interested something about it really turned her on something about the power she was reluctant sure but since her theater career was going nowhere i talked her into working for me or she let youthink you talked her into it rune asked silently just how well did you know your girlfriend she couldnt imagine talking shelly into anything i saw one of her films rune said i was surprised she was good good man forget about it what it was she was real i mean real she played an eighteenyearold cheerleader man she was a cheerleader she played a thirtyfiveyearold businesswoman you believed her yeah but with those kinds of movies do the audiences care rune asked thats a good question i didnt think so but shelly did and thats all that mattered we got into some wild fights over it shed insist on rehearsing christ wed shoot a film a day theres no dialogue theres a couplepage treatment is all whats this rehearsal bullshit then shed insist on setting up the lighting just right lost money on her cost overruns missed delivery dates to the distributors but she was right i guessin some kind of artistic sense the films she made some of them are fabulous and a hell of a lot more erotic than anything else youll see see her theory is that an artist has to know what the audience wants and give it to them even if they dontknow they want it you make the movie for the audience not yourself shelly said that a million times youre not in the business anymore tommy shook his head nope porn used to be a classier crowd and a smarter crowd real people it was fun now theres too many drugs i started to lose friends to overdoses and aids i said time for me to move on i wanted shelly to come with me but another faint smile i couldnt exactly see her working for my new company which does what health food howto videos he nodded at the babagounash you ever hear of infomercials nope you buy a half hourusually on cableand make it look like a real program something informative but you also sell the product its about theyre fun hows business oh not great compared with pom but im not embarrassed to tell people what i do his voice faded he stood up and walked over to the window pulled aside a stained orange drape shelly he whispered shed still be alive if shed quit too but she didnt listen to me so pigheaded rune flashed back to her fiery blue eyes tommys lips were trembling his thick sunburned fingers rose to his face he started to speak but his breath caught and he lowered his head for a moment in silent tears rune looked away finally he calmed shook his head rune said she was quite a person a lot of peoplell miss her i just met her and i do it was hard to watch him a big man a healthy cheerful man overcome by grief but at least it answered the first of runes two questions tommy savorne probably wasnt shellys killer he didnt seem to be that good an actor so rune asked the second do you know anyone who might have wanted to hurt her savorne looked up a frown of curiosity on his face this religious group assuming this sword of jesus doesnt exist you think i dont know just consider it at first he shook his head at the foolishness of the question at the craziness of anyones wanting to hurt shelly but then he stopped well i wouldnt make much out of it but there was somebody a guy she worked for danny traub how did you know let me tell you and i mean this sincerely that i loved shelly lowe i loved her as an artist and i loved her as a human being danny traub was short and thin but muscular thin tendony his face was round and his hair was a cap of tight brown curls he had jowl lines that enclosed his mouth like parentheses he was wearing baggy black slacks a white sweatshirt with a design like semaphores his jewelry was heavy and gold two chains a bracelet a ring with a sapphire in it and a rolex oyster perpetual that watch cost more than my parents first house rune guessed traub continually looked around him as if there were a crowd of people nearby an audience an insincere smile kept curling into his face and he gestured constantly and arched his eyebrows the phrasedoss clown came to mind they were in traubs greenwich village town house it was a duplex done in blond wood and offwhite walls and loaded with small trees and plants like a jungle she said when shed arrived he had her leave the betacam and the battery packs in the front hall and walked her through the place he showed her his collection of indonesian fertility gods and sculpture one rune loved a fourfoothigh rabbit with a mysterious smile on his face hey youre great shed said walking right up to it oh she could have dicks and boobs butshe wants to talk to the rabbit traub had said to his invisible audience glancing over his shoulder theyd walked past blotchy paintings glass and metal sculpture huge stone pots indian baskets brass buddhas more plants the smell was heavyduty greenhouse upstairs one door was partially open as theyd walked past traubd shut it quickly but not fast enough to keep rune from seeing an assembly of sleeping limbs there were at least three arms and she was pretty sure she saw two blonde hairdos the back of the apartment opened onto a courtyard around a green bronze fountain this is where they were sitting when rune told him that she was doing a film about shelly lowe and danny traub had looked to the sideinto the eyes of his portable audienceand delivered his line about really truly loving shelly lowe he was stationary when he offered this but he didnt stay still for long as he talked about shelly he bounced up radiating energy and rocked on his feet swinging his arms back and forth he dropped into the chair again and continued to shift positions and stretch out until he was nearly horizontal then swung his legs over the arm i was the word that comes to mind is devastated i mean like fucking devastated about what happened she and me were best buddies on the set im not saying we didnt disagreewe both have strong personalities but we were a team we were an example always better if you have examples now its cheapest and most efficient to shoot direct to video betacam or ikegami running oneinch tape through an ampex traub grinned and pointed rune out to the audience do we have a sharp kid or what yessir ladies and gentlemen back to rune anyway shelly wanted to shoot on thirtyfive millimeter fuckingfilm i mean forget it your budget is ten thousand for the wholeflick how can you spend eight on film and processing aloneand even thats jewing down the price at one of the labs then forget about postproduction well finally i get shelly to agree no thirtyfive millimeter but right away she starts up on sixteen millimeter it looks better so can i argue anyway that was typical creative disputes you know but we respected each other who won about the film i mean i always win well most of the time a couple films we shot on sixteen course that was the one that got the aaaf picture of the year award he pointed to an oscarlike statue on his mantel what does a producer do exactly hey this kid is just like mike wallacequestion question question okay a producer in this business he tries out the actresses hey just kidding i do what all producers do i finance a film hire the cast and crew contract with a postpro house the business side you know i happen to direct some too im pretty good at it can i tape you talking about shelly the smile flickered for a moment before it returned tape me i dont know or maybe you could recommend somebody else i just need to talk to somebody whos pretty high up in the business somebody successful so if you know anybody rune thought this was way too obvious but traub snagged the bait greedily okay she wonders if ive been successful ive done fucking astronomical ive got a ferrari sitting not thirty feet away from us right this moment in my own garage in new york my own fucking garage wow wow she says yeah wow i own this town house and i could eat in any restaurant in manhattan every night of the year i wanted to i ownnot a shareiown a house in killington you like to ski no i could teach you you own lame duck a controlling percentage there are some other people involved the mafia rune asked the smile stayed on danny traubs face he said slowly you dont want to say that lets just say theyre silent partners you think they might have anything to do with the bombing again the fake smile some calls were made some questions were asked nobody from over the river lets say had anything to do with it that informations gold she supposed that meant brooklyn or new jersey headquarters of organized crime so yeah ill talk to you ill tell you my whole life story ive been in the business for about eight nine years i started as a cameraman and i did my share of acting too you wanta see some tapes thats okay i ill give you one to take home a blonde womanmaybe last nights entertainmentappeared groggy and sniffling she was dressed in a red silk jumpsuit unzipped to the navel traub raised his fingers as if he were signaling a waiter the woman hesitated then walked toward them combing her long hairit tumbled to her midbackwith her fingers rune stared at the hair a platinumgold color neither god nor nature could take credit for a shade like that traub said to rune so what would you like coke i mean the real thing of course he held up a saltshaker rune shook her head the audience heard shes a puritan oh my god traub glanced back at rune scotch rune wrinkled her nose tastes like duz hey im talking singlemalt aged twentyone years old soap isnt any better than new soap well just name your poison bourbon beer rune stared at the womans hair a martini it was the first thing that came into her mind traub said two martinis chopchop the blonde wrinkled her tiny nose im not like a waitress thats true traub said to rune who had apparently joined his audience shes notlike a waitress at all waitresses are smart and efficient and they dont sleep until noon he turned back to the woman what youre like is a lazy slut she stiffened hey he barked just get the fucking drinks rune shifted thats okay i dont traub gave her a cool smile the creases cut deep into his face youre a guest its no problem the blonde twisted her face in anemic protest and shuffled off to the kitchen she muttered a few words rune couldnt hear traubs smile fell he called you say something but the woman was gone he turned back to rune you buy them dinner you buy them presents you bring them home they still dont behave rune said coldly people just dont read emily post anymore he missed the dig completely you mean like the flier wasnt she the one tried to fly around the world i did a movie about an airplane once we called itlove plane sort of a takeoff onthe love boat i loved that show you ever see it no we rented a charter for the day fucking expensive and a pain in the ass to shoot in i mean were in this hangar in march everybodys blue you dont realize how small a plane is until you try to get three four couples spread out on the seats im talking wideangle lenses i mean almost fisheyes didnt work out too good it looked like all the guys had dicks about an inch long and three inches wide the blonde returned rune said to traub my film will you help me out please just a few minutes about shelly he was hesitating the blonde handed out the drinks and put an unopened jar of olives on the thick glass coffee table traub started to grimace she turned to him and looked like she was going to cry i couldnt get it open traubs face softened he rolled his eyes hey hey honey come here gimme a hug come on she hesitated and then bent down he kissed her cheek you got any she whined say please come on danny please he prompted she said please he fished into his pants pocket then handed her the saltshakerfilled with coke rune assumed she took it then walked sullenly off she hadnt said one word to rune who asked traub shes an actress uhhuh she wants to be a model so does everyone else in this city shell make some movies for us get married get divorced have a breakdown get married again and itll take and shell be out in jersey in ten years working for at ampt or cibageigy rune felt traubs eyes on her the feeling reminded her of the time her first boyfriend age ten had put a big snail down the back of her blouse traub said theres something i dunno refreshing about you you know i see all these women all day longbeautiful blondes and redheads to die for stunning tall oooo watch the tall mister big tits but hey youre different she sighed i mean that sincerely you want to come down to atlantic city with me meet some wild people i dont think so one thing i am is talented in the sack you know im sure plenty of recreational pharmaceuticals thanks anyway he looked at his watch okay tell you what uncle dannyll help you out you want to shoot me so to speak go ahead but lets hurry i got a busy day in ten minutes rune had the equipment set up she slipped a new tape into the camera traub sat back popped his knuckles and grinned he looked completely at ease what do you want me to say anything that comes to mind tell me about shelly he glanced sideways then looked into the camera and smiled sadly the first thing i have to say and i mean this sincerely is that i was wholly devastated by shelly lowes death the smile faded and his eyes went dull when she died lost more than my star actress i lost one of my very dearest friends from somewhere rune had no idea where danny traub produced what might pass for a tear chapter nine the gruff man in his sixties with abundant white hair and cool eyes looked down at rune so you think you can act he asked sternly before she could say anything he turned and walked back into his office leaving the door halfopen it was an oldfashioned office door with a large window of mottled glass in it the sign in gold lettering read arthur tucker acting and voice instruction rune stepped into the doorway but stopped she didnt know whether shed been dismissed or invited in when tucker sat down at his desk she continued inside and closed the door behind her he wore dark slacks and a white shirt and tie his dress shoes were well worn tucker was slightly built which made him seem younger his legs were thin and his face chiseled and handsome bushy white eyebrows and those piercing green eyes it was hard to hold his gaze if tucker were a character actor he wouldve played a president or king or maybe god i dont know whether i can act or not rune said walking up to the desk he sat behind thats why im here the office on broadway and fortyseventh was a theater museum the walls were covered with cheapframed photos of actors and actresses some of them rune had seen in films or heard ofbut nobody was very famous they seemed to be the sort of actor who plays the male leads best friend or the old wacko woman who shows up three or four times during a movie for comic relief actors who do commercials and dinner theater also on the walls were props bits of framed fire curtains from famous theaters now gone stagebill covers pasted on posterboard hundreds of books rune recognized some titles they were the same as shelly lowe had on her bookshelf she saw the name artaud and she remembered the phrase again the theater of cruelty it brought a jolt to her stomach tucker went through an elaborate ritual of lighting a pipe and a moment later a cloud of smoke smelling of cherry filled the room he gestured to the chair sat lifted an eyebrow saying in effect keep going i want to be a famous actress so does half of new york the other half wants to be famous actors where have you studied shaker heights where ohio outside of cleveland i dont know any academies or studios there it was the middle school i was in the thanksgiving pageant he stared at her waiting for her to go on no sense of humor she noted thats a joke uhhuh i was also a snowflake once and in high school i painted backdrops for southpacific thats another joke look sir i just want to act im a coach tucker said thats all i am i improve i dont create if you want to go to school study drama come back i may be able to help you but for now he motioned toward the door rune said but my friend said youre the best in the city you know one of my students shelly lowe rune said and pressed the button of the little jvc camcorder in her bag the lens was pointed upward toward tucker she knew she wouldnt get the whole angle but shed see enough also she thought the little black border might give it a nice effect tucker turned to look out the window a pile driver in a nearby construction site slammed a girder down toward the rock that manhattan rested on rune counted seven bangs before he spoke i heard what happened to her tuckers ruddy face gazed at rune from under those bushy white eyebrows did he brush them out like that rune changed her mind hed be a much better wizard than a president a gandalf or merlin rune said whatever else about her she was a good actress after a long moment tucker said shelly lowe was my best student a faint humorless smile and she was a whore rune blinked at the viciousness in his voice tucker continued thats what killed her because she sold herself rune asked had she been coming to see you long reluctantly tucker answered her question shelly had been studying with him for two years shed had no formal training other than that which was very unusual nowadays when schools like yale and northwestern and ucla were producing the bulk of the professional actors and actresses shelly had a superb memory she was like a chameleon slipping into parts like someone possessed by the characters spirit she had a talent for dialects and accents she could be a barmaid from northeast of london then change herself into a schoolteacher from cotswold the way meryl streep can tucker spoke these words of admiration with troubled eyes when did you find out about her film career his voice was bitter again a month ago she never said a word about it i was stunned he laughed with derision and the irony is that when it came to her legitimate auditions she wouldnt take just any job she didnt do commercials or musical comedy she didnt do dinner theater she wouldnt go to hollywood she did only serious plays i said to her shelly why are you being so pigheaded you could work fulltime as an actress if you wanted to she said no she wasnt going toprostitute herself and all the while she was doing those films he closed his eyes and moved his large head from side to side to shake off the unpleasantness i found out a month ago someone was returning a tape at the video store i go to i glanced at it there she was on the cover and whats more it was under the name shelly lowe she didnt even use a stage name when i found out i cant tell you how betrayed i felt thats the only way i can describe it betrayal when she came in for the next lesson we had a terrible fight told her to get out i never wanted to see her again he spun around to face out the window again every generation has its candidates for genius shelly could have been one of those all of my other students he waved his hand around the room as if they were sitting behind rune theyre talented and i like to think that i helped them improve but theyre nothing compared with shelly when she acted youbelieved her just what tommy savorne had said rune recalled it wasnt shelly lowe on stage it was the character tennessee williams arthur miller the greek classics lonesco ibsen why she came this close to the lead in michael schmidts new play he held his fingers a millimeter apart rune frowned the big producer the guy gets written up in the newspapers he nodded she went to his epi whats that equity principal interview its like an audition she met with schmidt himself twice and she didnt get the part no i guess not that was just before our fight i didnt keep up with her tucker ran the stem of his pipe along his front lower teeth he was not speaking to rune as he said my own acting career never went very far my talent was for coaching and teaching i thought that with shelly id leave behind someone who was truly brilliant i could makethat contribution to theater he stared at a photo on the opposite wall rune wondered which one betrayal he whispered bitterly then he turned his gaze to rune she felt naked under his deep eyes shaded by the brush of his eyebrows you seem very young do you make those films too the ones she did no rune said she was going to make up something the sort of job a girl her age should be doing but with those strange currents shooting out from his eyesa green version of shellys blue laser beamsshe just repeated the denial in a whisper tucker studied her for a long moment you have no business being an actress pardon my bluntness but you should look for another line of work i just but he was waving his hand i wouldnt do you a favor by being kind now if youll excuse me he pulled a script toward him it wasnt much of a list rune sat at her deskcathys old battered gray governmentissue shed pushed it right next to the cracked front panel of l amprs air conditioner which was churning out about a tenth of the btus it once had she closed the manhattan phone book there were only two a llewellyns listed and neither of them was an andy that left only the remaining twenty million citizens to survey in the other boroughs westchester new jersey and connecticut shellys most recent boyfriend would have to go unquestioned for the time being larry walked into the office and glanced at rune whatcha doing luv looking up things things important things well if you could postpone your search for a bitive got something important for you letters to type yeah well i wasnt going to mention it but those last ones they were ardly the best typing job ive ever seen i told you i wasnt a typist you spelled the mans name three different

like that wants you to call sam called great ill just be later but he held the door open and smiled threateningly after you luv rune heard the name but forgot it immediately larry was droning on looking impressed as he recited the second biggest wallet and billfold manufacturer in the united states rune said how interesting the man with the company and the unmemorable namerune called him mr walletwas about fifty round and sharpeyed he wore a seersucker suit and sweated a lot he stood with his arms crossed hovering beside a doughy woman in her late twenties who also crossed her arms looking with flitting eyes at the lights and cameras and dollies she worked for the company too and was his daughter she was also rune found out going to act in the commercial larry pretended to miss runes eyes as they made a circuit of the ceiling at this news another young woman horsey with a sensible pageboy haircut and an abrasive voice said to rune im mary jane collins im house o leathers advertising director ill be supervising the shoot rune mary jane extended her bony hand the costume jewelry bracelets jingling rune gripped it briefly daughter said im a little nervous ive done voiceovers but ive never been on camera before mr wallet youll do fine baby just forget that he looked at mary jane how many people are going to see her the media buy should put us at about fifteen million viewers he continued fifteen million people are going to be watching your every mood oops i mean move he laughed daddy she smiled with a twisted mouth mary jane read some papers to larry she said the budgets i havent seen the revised budgets larry looked at rune who said theyre almost ready he mouthed almost mary janes dark hair swiveled as she looked down at rune almost a problem with the typewriter oh mary jane laughed with surprise sure i understand its just that well i wouldvethought youd have them for us before this i mean this is the logical time to review them even today is a little tardy in terms of timing another couple hours i glued the key back on larry said rune maybe you could go work on them now rune said i thought we were going to talk concepts oh mary jane said looking down at her i hadnt understood you were in a creative position here at the studio i what do you do exactly larry said runes our production assistant looking her up and down mary jane said oh

that for the shoot mary jane what do you think she glanced toward it and said slowly might just fly well put our thinking caps on about it she turned back to the desk and opened her briefcase ive done a memo with all the schedule deadlines she handed the paper to rune could you run and make a copy of it larry took the paper and held it out to rune sure she will his eyes narrowed and rune took the sheet ill be back in just a minute ill run just like a bunny daddy will they have a makeup person i dont have to do my own makeup do i rune vanished through the door into the office larry followed i

eyes perching on rune are you the one whos in charge of lunch rune smiled you betcha we should probably get a head start on it we were thinking in terms of salads oh and hows that copying coming rune saluted with a smile its on its way the next day at eleventhirty sam healy picked her up outside of l ampr and they drove north its just a station wagon rune looking around inside was mildly disappointed sam healy said but its blue and white at least it also hadbomb squad stenciled in large white letters on the side and a cage empty at the moment that he explained was for the dogs that sniffed out explosives you were expecting i dont know hightech stuff like in the movies life is generally a lot lowertech than hollywood true they drove out of manhattan to the nypd explosives disposal facility on rodmans neck in the bronx oh wow check this place out this is totally audacious it was essentially a junkyard without the junk her feet bounced up and down on the floorboards as they pulled through the gate in the chainlink fence crowned with spirals of razor wire to their left was the police shooting range rune heard the short cracks from pistols to their right were several small red sheds thats where we keep our own explosives healy explained your own most of the time we dont dismantle devices we bring them here and blow them up rune picked up her camera and battery pack from the backseat there was a green jumpsuit there she hadnt noticed it before she tried to pick it up it was very heavy the helmet had a green tube probably for ventilation coming out of the top and hanging down the back it looked just like an aliens head wow whats that bomb suit kevlar panels in fireproof cloth is that what you wear when you disarm bombs you dont call them bombs no theyre leds improvised explosive devices the departments a lot like the military we use initials a lot they walked into a low cinderblock building that reeked of city government budget a single overworked air conditioner groaned in the corner healy nodded at a couple uniformed officers he carried a blue zipper bag she glanced at a poster rules for boiling dynamite there were dozens of others all with bullet points of procedures on them the clinical language was chilling in the event of consciousness after a detonation attempt to retrieve any severed body parts jesus he noticed what she was reading and maybe to distract her from the gruesome details asked hey want to hear the basic lecture on explosive ordnance disposal she looked away from the section on improvising tourniquets and said i guess there are only two goals in dealing with explosives first to avoid human injury destroy or disarm by remote if at all possible goal number two is to avoid injury to property most of our work involves investigating suspicious packages and sweeps of consulates and airports and abortion clinics things like that you make it sound i dont know routine most of it is but we also got odd jobs like a couple weeks agosome kid buys a sixtymillimeter mortar shell from an armynavy store in brooklyn and takes it home he and his brotherre in the backyard playing catch with it supposed to be a dummyall the powder drained out only the kids father was in nam and he thinks it looks funny takes it to the local precinct station turns out it was live ouch we got it taken care of then we get a lot of false alarms just like the fire department but every once in a while bingo theres a suitcase at the airport or a bundle of dynamite or a pipe bomb and weve got to do something with it so somebody crawls up and cuts the wires healy said whats the first goal rune grinned dont get anybodys ass blown up mine included first we evacuate the area and set up a frozen zone frozen we call it a frozen zone maybe a thousand yards wide then well put a command post behind armor or sandbags somewhere within that area we have these remotecontrol robots with video cameras and x rays and stethoscopes and we send one up to take a look at the thing to listen for the ticking yep exactly he nodded at her youd think everybodyd be using batterypowered digital timerdetonatorshollywood again but ninety percent of the bombs we deal with are really crude homemade pipe bombs black or smokeless powder dynamite match heads in conduit and most of these use good oldfashioned dimestore alarm clocks you need two pieces of metal coming together to complete the circuit and set off the detonating cap whats better for that than a windup alarm clock with a bell and clapper on top so we look and listen then if it really is an ied and we can disarm without any risk we do a rendersafe if its a tricky circuit or we think itll go off we get it into the containment vehicle he nodded toward the field near the shack and bring it here and blow it up ourselves they walked outside two young men stood a hundred yards away from them in one of the three deep pits dug into the field they wound what looked like plastic clothesline around a square olivedrab box rune looked around she said this looks just like the underworld healy frowned he asked her eliot ness no like hades i mean you know hell oh yeahyour analysis of the crime scene the other day healy looked back to the men in the pit he said to rune you have to understand something about explosives in order to be effective they have to be explosive only under certain conditions if you make this stuff that blows up when you look at it crosseyed well thats not going to be real useful now is it hell most explosives you can destroy by burning them they dont blow up they just burn so to make it go bang you need detonators thosere powerful bits of explosive that set off the main charge remember the c that they used in the second bombing if you dont have the detonator surrounded by at least a half inch of c you might not get a bang at all she heard enthusiasm in his voice she thought how good it is when youve found the one thing in life that youre really good at and that you enjoy doing for a living thats what we look for healy continued thats the weak point in bombs most detonatorsre triggered electrically so yeah we cut the wires and thats it if somebody wants to get elaborate they could have a timed detonator and a rocker switch so that even if you cut the timer any movement will set off the bomb some have a shunta galvanometer hooked up to the circuit so that if you cut the wire the needle swings to zero because the currents been cut andthat sets off the bomb the most elaborate bomb i ever saw had a pressure switch the whole thing was inside a sealed metal canister filled with pressurized air we drilled a tiny hole to test for nitrate molecules thats how bomb detectors at airports work sure enough it was filled with explosives there was a pressure switch inside so if wed open the canister the air would have escaped and set it off god what did you do we brought it up here and were just going to detonate it but the word came from downtown they wanted to check the components for fingerprints so we put it in a hyperbaric chamber equalized the pressure inside and outside opened it up and rendered it safe it had two pounds of semtex in it with steel shot all around like shrapnel purely antipersonnel mean sonofabitch bomb you got the robot into the chamber well no actually i dismantled it you he shrugged and nodded to the pit where the two men had finished their wrapping exercise and were retreating to a bunker of concrete and sandbags theyre practicing setting off military charges thats an mi demolition block about two pounds of c for blowing bridges and buildings trees theyve wrapped it with detonating cord andll set it off by remote control over the loudspeaker came a voice pit number one fire in the hole fire in the hole what do they mean rune asked thats what they used to yell in coal mines when they lit the fuse on the dynamite demolition people use it now to mean theres about to be an explosion suddenly a huge orange flash filled the sky smoke appeared and an instant later a clap of thunder slapped their ears boaters hate us healy explained city gets a lot of claims for broken windows rune was laughing healy looked at her what she said its just weird you brought me all the way out here to give me a lesson on ieds not really he said considering then why did you invite me healy looked away for a moment cleared his throat his face was ruddy to start with but it seemed he was blushing he opened his attache case and took out a couple of cans of diet coke two deli sandwiches a bag of fritos i guess its a date chapter ten he may have looked like a cowboy but he wasnt the silent type detective sam healy was thirtyeight nearly half of his fellow bomb squad detectives had gotten into demolition in the military but hed gone a different route first a portablea foot patrolmanthen working an rmp remote motor patrol it means police car initials i remember healy smiled youre talking to an mos moss member of service after a few years of that healyd gone into emergency services new york s swat team then hed signed up for the bomb squad hed taken the monthlong course at the fbis hazardous devices school in huntsville alabama and then was assigned to the squad healy had majored in electrical engineering in college and was studying criminal justice at john jay he talked with excitement about his workshop at home inventions hed made as a kid his twentyyear uninterrupted subscription toscientific american once he had come up with a formula for a chemical solution to neutralize a particular high explosive and had almost gotten a patent but a big military supplier beat him to it hed never fired his gun except on the range and had only made four arrests he carried a brooklyn gun shops business card on the back of which was printed themiranda recitation he knew hed never remember the words in a real arrest hed been called on the carpet several times for failing to wear his service revolver when the conversation turned personal he became quieter though rune sensed he wanted to talk his wife had left him eight months before and she had informal custody of their son i want to fight it but i cant bring myself to i dont want to put adam through that anyway what judge is going to awardme custody of a tenyearold kid i deal with explosive devices all day is that why she left you healy pointed across the field rune heard the staticky warning again another huge flash followed by a tower of smoke fifty feet high rune felt a concussion wave slap her face like a sudden summer wind the cops watching lifted their fingers to their mouths and whistled rune jumped to her feet and applauded nitramon cratering charge healy said studying the smoke fantastic healy was nodding looking at her she caught him and he looked away the job you mean he asked rune had forgotten her question then she recalled the reason your wife left i dont know i think the reason was i didnt ever get home mentally i mean i live in queens ive got a house with a lab in the basement one night id been doing some work downstairs and i was kind of lost in it and my wife came down and said dinner was ready i wasnt paying any attention and i told her about the experiment and i said you know this feels just like home and she said thisis your home rune said dont be too hard on yourself takes two he nodded still in love with her huh no way he said quickly uhhuh no really the sound of wind rilled the range he became silent almost impenetrable which would have been one of his wifes gripes the difficulty of reaching him after a moment healy said all of a sudden out of the blue she says she cant stand me im just one big irritation i dont understand her im never there for her i was floored i really asked for it in a wayi pushed her i kept telling her how much i loved her how sorry i was how id do anything she said that was just torturing her i went a little nuts lovers can do that to you rune said healy continued for instancewhen she left cheryl took the tv so the next day all i can think about is getting a replacement i went out and boughtconsumer reports and read all about the different kinds of sets i mean i had to buy the best tv there was it became an obsession finally i went to savemart and spentgod i cant believe iteleven hundred on this set whoa that must be one hyper tv sure but the thing is i never watch television i dontlike tv id do things like that i was pretty depressed then one day we got a call on this pipe bomb see theyre real dangerous because theyre usually filled with gunpowder which is awfully unstable thing weighed about thirty pounds turns out its planted in front of a big bank downtown in a stairwell we cant get the robot in there so i get a bomb suit on and take a look at it i could just carry it out to where the robot can pick it up then put it in the containment vehicle but im thinking i dont care if im dead or not so i decide to do a rendersafe myself i started twisting the end off the pipe and what happened was some of the powder got in the threads of the cap and the friction set off the charge god sam turned out it was black powdernot smokeless thats the weakest explosive you can find and most of it was wet and didnt go off didnt do anything more than knock me on my ass and blister my palms but i said to myself healy time to stop being an asshole that helped me get over her pretty well and thats where i am now over her right after a moment rune said marriage is a very weird thing im not sure its healthy my mothers always after me to get married she has a list of people for me nice boys her friends sons shes nondenominational jewish wasp doesnt matter to her okay theyare sort of ranked by professions and yeah a doctors firstbut she doesnt really care as long as i end up rich and pregnant oh and happy she does want me to be happy a rich happy mother i tell you i have a great imagination but thats one thing i cant picture me married healy said cheryl was real young when we got married twentytwo i was twentysix we thought it was time to settle down people change i guess silence and rune sensed he felt theyd gone too far into the personal he shrugged in a dismissing way then noticed a uniformed cop he recognized and asked what had happened to a live hand grenade someone had found in the bronx sin the captains office on his chair his chair healy asked well we took the tnt out first he turned back to rune and to fill the silence she asked you ever happen to talk to that witness healy drank most of his soda but left half his sandwich what witness the guy who was hurt in the first bombing the first angel the wind came up and whipped smoke from a burning pit toward them yeah ah rune said was he helpful healy hooked his thumbs into his thick belt which really made him look a lot like a cowboy arent you going to tell me what he said no why not doesnt concern you you just filed it away what he said and thats it no thats not it healy debated for a moment finally he said the witness wasnt helpful so therere no leads therere leads but nobodys following up on them she said cynically because of the word right from downtown im following up healy said what she asked quickly tell me and she guessed he was wondering whether the date had been a good idea i checked the fingerprints from the phone where the killer called her the night of the bombing and nothing im also tracking the explosives the wrapper i mentioned i think we can trace the inventory so you going to get fired for doing all this because of the word from headquarters way i figure it the ops coordinator or precinct commanders got my phone number they want me to stop they can always give me a call her hand closed on his shoulder she felt a sizzle part of it was gratitude that he was going out on a limb to find out whod killed shelly part of it was something else but she concentrated on the detective part at the moment look sam how bout i help you help me what find the killer no come on we can be a team rune i can do stuff you cant i mean you have to do things legally right rune this isnt a game im not treating it like a game you want to catch a perp she emphasized the word to let him know shed been around crime and criminals then added and i want to make a film her lips were taut thats not a game he saw that fire in her eyes he didnt say anything else after a moment she asked just tell me one thing what promise youll answer no please maybe healy said what about the fingerprints i told you they were negative not on the phone rune said on the letters the ones from the sword of jesus about the angels he debated then said whoever wrote them used gloves where was the paper from i said id answer one question you said maybe you would which means you havent ruled out answering two i make the rules i answered you now promise me youll just make your movie and stay out of the investigation she brushed her bangs out of her eyes then stuck her hand out okay but only if you give me exclusive press coverage deal his large tough hand enfolded hers he didnt let go for a moment the only sound was of the wind she knew he wanted to kiss her and she was ready to kiss him backin a certain noncommittal way but the moment passed and he released her hand they gazed at each other for a moment then he turned toward the pit come on he said ill let you throw a hand grenade you want yeah she asked excitedly well a practice one rune said thats okay ill work my way up through the huge backstage doorway rune saw a construction site not a theater the aroma was of sawn wood and the nosepinching sweet smell of paint and varnish lumber was in constant motion carried by husky men in tshirts printed with the names of longgone broadway plays cables snaked along the dusty battered stage shouts theboom boom boom of hammers the shrill screech of electric saws routers drills she walked into the wings of the stage true shed painted backdrops for one high school play as shed told arthur tucker and she had been in several pageants but shed never been backstage at a real theater and she didnt realize how much space there was behind the curtain and what an ugly scuffed beatup space it was a huge cavern a massive pit in the underworld she made her way unnoticed to the front of the stage three people sat in the front row bent over a script two men and a woman their discussion was animated they were having a disagreement rune interrupted excuse me are you michael schmidt a man about fortyfive looked up and his first motion was to remove his reading glasses which had half lenses in the bottom of the frames yes the othersa heavy man in a work shirt and a woman inhaling greedily on a cigarette and looking grimhad not looked up they stared at the script as if they were identifying a body in the morgue rune said your office told me i could find you here did they now ill have to talk to someone about that schmidt was short very compact and in good shape rune could see his biceps squeezed by the cuffs of his closefitting shortsleeve shirt though he was muscular his face looked unhealthy his eyes were red and watery maybe allergies maybe she thought cs tear gas she looked around the seats near the producer for a red windbreaker and a hat didnt see any and he didnt seem to recognize her as the person he mightve attacked on the pier still his profession was creating the illusion of the theater what do you want he said curtly rune said can i have your autograph schmidt blinked how the fuck did you get past security just walked in please ive always wanted your autograph he sighed please he glanced at the others who were still staring at the script and whispering darkly he stood schmidt was limping and winced once as he climbed a stained set of plywood stairs onto the stage she stuck her hand out he glanced at her without a bit of expression on his face and walked past went to the coffee machine and poured himself a large cup he returned glanced again at the arguing writers or whoever they were and said okay this is so neat thanks she handed him a piece of paper and a crayola to who mom he scrawled some illegible words handed it back rune took it then gazed up at him he sniffled blew his nose with a linen handkerchief and asked anything else i can do for you miss rune he stood with a cocked hip looking at her waiting okay she put the autograph away i lied i figured that well i did want your autograph but i wanted to ask you a couple questions too i dont do casting give your resume to the i dont want to be an actress either he blinked then laughed well in that case youre the only woman under twentyfive in the whole city who doesnt im doing a film about an actress who auditioned for you shelly lowe did his eyes flutter like a startled squirrels so maybe had he recognized her now he said i dont recall a shelly lowe you must i heard you almost offered her a part in this play he laughed startled i must well young lady i dont she was going to be the lead there were hundreds of actresses who hoped to be the lead in this play we finally selected one it wasnt a ms lowe now if youll she was killed his attention wavered he studied some of the construction im sorry to hear that which he wasnt rune could see she remained silent staring up at him schmidt finally said and youre doing her life story something like that heres her picture rune handed him a publicity still that nicole had given her he studied it with the detached interest of a bored traffic cop reading a drivers license and handed it back to her dont recall her why do you think she auditioned for us i heard she did ah schmidt said smiling again theatrical gossip never to be trusted then maybe you can set the record straight you really dont remember her miss rune youve got to understand first of all i do none of the preliminary casting myself we have a casting director for that whats his who is no longer with the company and i dont know where he is second most of the people who say they interview or audition with michael schmidt do nothing more than have their agent send a head shot and a copy of their resume to us or stand in line for an epa or epi that lasts ten seconds did this ms lowe ever really audition for us i doubt it did she ever audition for me no disrespect to the dead but if your friend said she almost had the parthe turned his palms upwardshe lied there was a loud crash nearby a stagehand had knocked over a huge stack of twobyfours schmidt turned to him the producers face twisted in fury what are you doing sorry mr schmidt i were behind schedule because cretins like you dont know what on earth youre doing one more mistake and youre out of here i said i was sorry the beefy young man said it was an accident schmidt turned back to rune idiots all around me next time you want to talk to me call my office make an appointment althoughhe turned and walked toward the stairsi sincerely hope there wont be a next time rune watched him for a moment saw that as far as michael schmidt was concerned she had ceased to exist she slipped backstage and paused watching the young stagehand angrily restack the lumber that had fallen to the floor she yawned so hard that her jaw shivered and from her eyes sprang thick tears it was ten pm rune sat in the l ampr studio at the moviolaan old flatbed film editing machinerewinding the footage for the house o leather commercial larryd shot about an hour of the homely daughter doing retakes against the pimply backdrop rune was editing together chunks of the film following bobs notes mary janewho rune decided would have made someone a wonderful administratorhad left a note of her own a long list of corrections to the estimate she signed off with please aim for ish and remember big day tomorrow lets all be brighteyed ciao mj c the door opened bob came in and walked right over to the gray machine staring at the screen he didnt say anything to her for a moment owre they coming luv ill have them for you in the morning he waved her hand away from the crank and turned it himself studying the jerky scenes in the small screen rune watched his karat gold bracelet as she said i didnt know you did daily rushes when its just a commercial were being a little morewhatsa worddiligent with this one the budget and all you know how was the client dinner guys an old fart and his daughter christ she ad er foot up to no good you know what i mean on me thigh wanted a drink after just the two of us i ad to plead bloody exhaustion get away from the crazy bird and then mary bleedin janetheres an iceberg for you he spun the knob he frowned add two more seconds of er before the fade her old man thinks shes some kinda princess di ive already finished her sequence well finish it again did you think about me sitting here hungry while you were eating a gourmet meal ah brung you a present he handed her a paper bag with a grease spot on it yeah she opened it inside was a foil swan hey you brought me something to go well yeah she opened the swans back she stared down at it its leftovers isnt it bob this isnt a swan bag its a doggy bag thought you might like something rune was poking at the contents with a pencil its green beans and potatoes thats all thats left what went with it dunno mayve been a steak he stretched and for a moment looked like the cute innocent boy he had never in his life been and walked out the door eightthirty for tomorrow doll e likes croissants so pick up some on your way in could you the door shut behind him she wadded the cold potatoes up and was about to throw them out when she felt her stomach rumbling her hand hesitated double damn rune opened the foil and then with a glance out the window to make sure bob had left cued up her own videocassette on the sony video editor next to the moviola and started the tape she watched it as she ate the potatoes and beans using two pencils like chopsticks the shots of danny traub told her nothing other than that the porn producer was a stupid egotistical horny bastard the shots of michael schmidttaken with the hidden video cameratold her that he was a smart insincere egotistical bastard who may or may not have been horny but at least didnt let it get in the way of his job rune replayed the flicker in his eye when she mentioned shelly lowes name a tiny motion what was he thinking what was heremembering she couldnt tell as larry had told her cameras dont lie luv but that doesnt mean they tell the whole truth no schmidts tape told her very little but the tape of arthur tucker that was different the first thing she noticed shellys acting coach had spent several minutes casually covering up something on his desk as he talked to her it might have been a pile of papers or a manuscript hed been very subtle she hadnt even noticed him doing it in the office what didnt he want her to see rune rewound the tape and freezeframed the image she couldnt make out anything but then she glanced at a plaque on the wall behind him it held a set of medals but not those mailorder medals that commemorate stupid events like great moments in the industrial revolution franklin mint stuff these were reallooking military medals along with other mementos including a gold cross she squinted as she studied them recalling one of her favorite movies a blackandwhite film made by metropolitan studios in the fifties the fighting rangers a world war two film one of the main charactersthe nice kid from a midwestern town played by somebody like audie murphyis terrified of battle hes never sure if his courage is going to break but in the end he sneaks up on an enemy bridge and blows it to bits all by himself to keep the enemy from sending reinforcements she remembered the little crescent name badgethe simple wordrangers on the heros shoulderwhen he lay dying in the last scene of the movie it looked just like the tag arthur tucker had in his plaque of medals hed been a ranger too the other thing she remembered was the scene earlier in the movie when another soldier had asked the hero if he knew how to rig the explosives on the bridge and hed answered sure sarge all rangers know how to blow up things its what they teach us in training chapter eleven arthur tucker was feeling old sitting in his dusty times square office he dropped a dullwhite heater coil into a chipped cup of water it sputtered fiercely when the water boiled he removed the coil and dropped in a twiceused crusty lipton tea bag the sunlight came through the curtains which were faded in waves that marked the suns passage over the year outside the sounds of construction were like the noises of battle feeling old sometimes watching one of his young proteges on stage he felt anything but old he almost believed he was still the twentyfiveyearold dressed in the musty costume of rosencrantz or benvolio or young prince hal waiting for his cue to enter from stage right but not today something had triggered this morbid feeling of antiquity as hed climbed off the eighth avenue train at fiftieth street and walked in a slow zigzag to his office looking at the marquees of the theaters many of them were now on the ground floors of highrise buildings they werent separate structures like the grand old helen hayes the martin beck the majestic he thought that said somethingthe theaters being parts of office buildings when he remembered the old marqueesthe huge jutting trapezoids of dotted lightshe remembered mostly the logos of musical comedies why did he picture those a form of theater he did not enjoy and rarely attended more easily than the marquees announcing the plays of miller and oneill and ibsen and strindberg and mamet all of whom he believed to be geniuses it must be because he was getting old he figured he thought of his students where were they all a dozen on or off broadway six or seven on television sitcoms or adventure shows two dozen in hollywood and hundreds and hundreds that had gone into accounting or law or carpentry or advertising or plumbing hundreds and hundreds who were good but werent good enough for the system the star system that goddamn inverted pyramid with so little room for people at the top arthur tucker sipped the tea and wondered if his life had been a failure and now the incident with shelly lowe he wasnt sure if his phone rang a jarring metallic blare he picked it up said hello and heard some breathless young girl talking a mile a minute checks she was saying something about a problem with the mail she was on the first floor of the building and some checks addressed to him had been misdelivered to her office tucker didnt believe he was expecting any checks most of his students paid in cash at the end of their lessons handing him the crisp precious twenties straight from the chase atm well they look like checks im all alone here i cant bring them up you want me to leave them outside my door tonight in which case theyd vanish in five minutes he knew ill come down what office oneohthree if i dont answer right away i might be on the phone she said ill just be a minute tucker pulled on his tweed jacket with its leather elbow patches and torn satin lining he forwent his hat he walked into the dark corridor locking the door after him he pressed the big black button to summon the elevator and waited for three minutes until it arrived he stepped inside and began the grinding journey down to the first floor rune tried a dental pick shed bought it at a pharmacy from a clerk who didnt seem particularly curious why someone wearing dayglo keds and a miniskirt printed with pterodactyls would be interested in a dental tool then shed gone back to the houseboat shed practiced on the locks to some of the interior doors and got them open pretty fast she hadnt graduated to the front door which had a doorknob cylinder and a medeco because she got impatient anyway she figured the theory was undoubtedly the same it wasnt sweating the panic growing she worked at arthur tuckers door for five minutes nothing happened shed get the pick in and twist it and turn it and hear clicking and snapping and unlocking sounds all of which was real satisfying but nothing happened the door remained snugly locked she stood back there was no time tuckerd be back in three or four minutes she estimated she looked up and down the corridor there were only two other tenants on this floor a lawyers office with signs in english and korean and an import company there were no lights under either door oh hell rune shoved her elbow through the glass a large triangular piece fell inside she reached in and turned the latch four minutes youve only got four minutes but it turned out she didnt need even that much time because right in the middle of tuckers desk was what she was looking forthe stack of papers hed been going to great lengths to cover up but it wasnt just any stack of papers it was a play the title wasdelivered flowers tucker it seemed had been making notes in the marginadditions deletions stage directions not many a few words here and there one change was pretty radical though rune thought not in the play itself but on the cover page tucker had crossed outby shelly lowe and written his own name in the copyright line had been changed too his name substituted for hers on the cover was another note haymarket theater chicago interested shellys been dead a few days rune thought angrily and this pricks already stolen her script and sold it to somebody take it she told herself its evidence but then tucker would see it was gone she looked behind the desk there were piles of other plays also loosebound like this one on his credenza she rummaged through them and found another one on which tucker had crossed off shellys name and put his own in its place she tossed it into her leopardskin bag and left the office there was a loud click behind her up the corridor shed been wrong tucker hadnt waited at the door downstairs for as long as shed hoped or maybe someone had told him the company had moved months ago in any event the elevator opened just as she got into the stairwell she heard his footsteps heard them stop heard his muttered oh no as he saw the broken glass she eased through the fire door and took the stairs two then three at a time down to the ground floor outside she saw a cop up the street her first inclination was to bolt but then she remembered that no way would arthur tucker call the police at best he was a thief at worst a killer the lights were brilliant dots of pure sun rune thirty feet away standing behind greasy pillars felt the heat from the lights and wondered two things why had the lighting man decided to use four watt redhead lamps which were way too big for the size of the set that was the first thing she wondered the second was what was going through the mind of nicole dorleans who was naked and grappling with a tall thin darkhaired man on a pink satin sheet her long perfect legs squeezing the guys waist with all their strength thats it baby yeah there there ooooo you know what i like you know what i want give it to me fuck me fuck me when she got tired of delivering dialogue like that nicole would simply wail and mew the man above her mostly grunted sweating furiously they changed position oftenmissionary seemed to be passe some of the poses were creative but seemed exhausting even to watch it was good that nicole and her partner were athletic jesus rune thought i couldnt get my legs up that high if you paid me the sounds of their lovemaking sailed into the dark crevices of the lame duck studio the tshirted cameraman moved in close as if the probing lens of the ikegami video camera was the third member of a menage a trois the rest of the crew was bored leaning on light stands and tripods sipping coffee outside the hot glow surrounding the mattress danny traubtoday acting as directorgestured impatiently and ordered the cameraman around the set you miss the come shot your ass is grass i wont miss it yesterday sharon s leg was in the way you couldnt see diddly i wont miss it the cameraman responded and moved closer to the action rune returned to her meditation what would nicole be thinking about theyd been at it for half an hour she seemed aroused but was it fake was she concentrating on then a disturbance the actor had stopped his pumping and was standing up dazed bleary breathing heavily nicole glanced down at his crotch and saw the problem she leaned forward and went to work with her mouth she looked pretty skillful but the man didnt respond he suddenly retreated out of the lights nicole sat back and took the bathrobe that a young woman an assistant offered her the actor looked for a towel found one and pulled it around his waist thats it the actor called gesturing palms out with a shrug danny traub sighed then barked orders the lights went out the camera shut off the grips and gaffers walked off the set third time this week johnny traub whispered the actor was deeply inhaling on a camel its too fucking hot in here whats with the air conditioner the air conditioner traubs head swiveled to his imaginary mezzanine he needswhatthirtytwo degrees before he can get it up johnny was looking at the floor but focusing six inches beneath it im tired im paying you a thousand dollars for a hard dick this film shoulda been in the can a week ago so shoot around me put in some stock inserts johnnylike traub was talking to a sixyearold people save up their pennies to rent tapes of you and your footlong they want to see the wand do its magic thing you understand imtired youre strung out is what you are you

porn cant do as much as youre doing just give me a couple of hours no im giving you the fucking boot get out nicole had been watching from the side of the bed she stepped toward them danny traub ignored her johnny muttered something he walked to the corner of the set from a leather shoulder bag he took a blue glass vial traub stepped up and slapped it from his hand it hit the wall and fell spinning fuck danny why he shoved johnny up against the wall hard gave a vicious smile looking around he thinks im joking yeah he does the man thinks im joking i cant afford to carry you anymore cut it out shut up the words were jarring pitched high frantic everyone on the set mustve heard but they all looked awayat scheduling sheets or invoices or scripts or they stared at the coffee and tea they stirred compulsively johnny pulled away he sat on the bed looking absently for his clothes nicole walked to the fallen coke shaker picked it up and offered it tentatively to johnny traub stepped forward and pulled it from her hand you dumb bitch didnt you hear what i just said i was just traub had turned back to johnny i paid you up front for this week i want half back nicole said danny leave him alone come on traub turned on her said viciously a real actressd know how to get him up youre fucking useless nicole was obviously frightened of him she swallowed and looked away from his tiny piercing eyes dont fire him danny come on hes you know had trouble getting jobs traubs face broke into a dark simian grin an impotent porn star having trouble getting work youre shitting me hes having a rough time is all traub said to johnny fuck the money just get outa here johnny turned abruptly and walked off the set asshole nicole whispered traub spun around and grabbed her teased hair he pulled her head close to his dont you ever nicole whimpered im sorry im sorry im sorry anger swept through traub he drew his hand back in a fist but he looked around a beefy tshirted assistant stirred the cameraman took a step toward them traub waited a moment and released her hair nicoles hand rose to her head and massaged her scalp traub gave her a fake smile again and patted her cheek she flinched waiting for a slap he laughed and slipped the vial of coke between her breasts theres my she tossed her hair and walked away traub called after her good girl shoes nicole said to rune a lot of times i think about shoes shoes like on your feet yeah you know just shoes rune and nicole were sitting in one of the dressing rooms at lame duck which wasnt a room at all but just an area set off from the rest of the studio with cracked and mousegnawed sheetrock they were on the fourth floor the floor above the bombing nicole had said the company had decided not to move which she thought was real tacky what with shelly being killed just below them danny says were got a sweetheart deal with the landlord whatever that means rune had snuck up to the dressing rooms after the incident with traub there shed set up the camera and zoomed in for a closeup of nicoles face shed lowered her voice to sound like faye dunaways innetwork and asked when youre on the set with the cameras rolling and youre with a man doing it what do you think about just one man i mean with anyone danny likes to shoot with two men a lot rune said okay say youre on the set with two men nicole nodded to show she understood the question and started talking about shoes i think about ferragamos a lot today before that thing with johnny i was picturing this great pair it has a nifty bow on the side real small and cute nicole was dressed in a shiny silver jumpsuit with a wide white belt she wore cowboy boots with metal rivets on the side her hair was teased up high rune noticed that her scalp was slightly red from where traub had grabbed her i love shoes i have about sixty pairs i dont know they calm me down for some reason sixty rune whispered in astonishment that was one difference between shelly and me i spend everything i make she put it all in mutual funds and stocks things like that but hey i like clothes what can i say i saw a couple of your films you looked like you were really turned on really into it and you were just faking nicole shrugged im a woman ive had lots of practice faking you must think about something other than shoes well theres technical stuff to worry about am i at the right angle am i looking at the camera did i shave my underarms am i repeating the same words all the time who writes the dialogue nicole glanced nervously at the camera she cleared her throat we make up most of it only the thing is youd think itd be easy you just look at the camera and talk but it isnt like that you kind of freeze up you know what to say the words and all but the how to soy it part thats whats so hard for me rune said you sounded okay to me and ive seen a couple of your films yeah nicole turned her face glowing with purple and beige makeup toward rune which ones bottoms up andsex wars oh and lusty cousins that was an old one lusty cousins kind of a classic i got mentioned in hustler i have to say i was kinda happy with the way it worked out i rehearsed that one for a week shelly made us rune glanced outside into the empty corridor did shelly ever write plays plays yeah that was another one of her hobbies shed send them out and theyd come back with a rejection letter did she ever have anything produced naw i dont think so but one she wrote a few months ago was supposed to be real good some theater was interested in it the haymarket theater chicago rune bet recalling the note on the copy of the play in tuckers office deliveredflowers yeah think so that might have been it you know what it was about naw rune said i interviewed danny traub i was talking to him about shelly uhhuh and he said that he really loved her that they were this like team danny said that yep hes lying nicole said thats sort of what i thought too he didnt give a shit for shelly or for anybody else except himself did he like tell you about the times he propositioned herwhich was every other day no why dontyou nicole looked at the camera maybe if you could shut that off rune clicked the switch he was always harassing her nicole shrugged as if there was a fine line between coming on to some woman and harassing her it wasnt like he was stalking her but he was pretty hung up she thought he was a little toad she hated him hed come parading onto the set and start putting everybody down wisecracking and insulting everyone you know how he does that talkingabout you not to you even when youre right in front of him and since he pays them and man he pays goodthey all put up with it but not shelly oh no way not shelly hell she laughed at him a couple weeks ago danny was ordering the director around on the set and shelly called him a pissant i dont know what that is exactlyyou ever hear of it anyway she called him that then walked off the set boy was he mad all these veins and stuff stood out on his face i thought he was going to have a heart attack i saw the fight you guys just had me and danny you saw that thats not even a fight hardly she took a brush and started working on her hair it was hard workthere was a lot of spray johnnys a sweetheart hes just not doing too well right now hes an alcoholic and he does way too much coke he oughtaretire he was really a star in the seventies hes kind of big you know rune said i saw but dannys right hes no good anymore lame ducks the only place he can work nobody elsell hire him i guess even dannys lost patience i mean thats pretty much one thing you need with a guytheyve got to get it up nicole shrugged sort of in the job description you know rune paused water dripped somewhere outside a motorcycle driver ran through his gears in a tenor roar she leaned forward and whispered do you think he could have killed shelly danny nicole laughed started to shake her head then she stopped the smile faded and she rummaged around in her purse you want some blow the blue vial appeared johnny always has good stuff rune shook her head nicole inhaled a line sniffed after a moment she said why would he do that rune was studying the sheetrock the uneven angles the bent nails the ragged sawing job after a moment she asked you know whats kind of odd what that when i said thatabout danny killing shelly you didnt seem really shocked nicole considered that for a moment i dont like danny hes obnoxious and all he thinks about is women and coke and his cars but im like all i think about is clothes and coke so i cant really you know cast stones her eyes darted she was debating go on rune said keeping her voice low i have this feeling theres something you want to tell me she looked at her watch then leaned close rune smelled perfume and ponds cold cream and listerine dont tell anyone but i want to show you something nicole rose and shoved open the warped paneling that served as the door they stepped into the gritty hallway and walked to a service elevator were going to the basement nicole said closing the accordion grate she pressed the firstfloor button they got out in a filthy lobby and walked to a door that opened onto a flight of stairs descending into the dark rune said looks like it goes down to a pit like a dungeon nicole gave a cold laugh thatsexactly what it is she stared into the dark for a few seconds then started down the stairs i dont think anyones down here i hope not it was a long descent they walked a full minute with just a rickety wooden handrail for support the only light came from two dim bulbs screwed into huge wirecage fixtures meant for lamps much larger the steps were spongy from rot from the foot of the stairs a corridor led to a dark low tunnel made of rock and uneven smears of concrete pools of greasy water mottled the floor iron rods stuck out of the stone at various points someone years ago had poured red paint like blood around the rodsprobably as warnings cobwebs and the feathery carcasses of insects filled the corners rune coughed several times the air stank of fuel oil and mold they continued down the tunnel this used to be a boiler room or storeroom nicole said stepping through a doorway and clicking on a light switch fluorescent tubes flickered overhead then burst into light the two women squinted in the brilliance it was a square room twenty by twenty the walls were the same stained sloppy concrete and stone as the tunnel rings hung from the ceiling on chains stained leather vaulting horses sat in the corner and there was a complicated wooden rack covering one wall a gym rune asked she walked over to a trapeze made of wood and chromed steel i keep thinking i should work out but i dont really feel motivated i think basically exercise should have a purposelike running from somebody who wants to beat the hell out of you this isnt a workout room rune nicole said softly no the actress walked to a tall battered metal locker and opened it took a long thin stick from it it looked like the sort of pointer a teacher would use see in the movies i make sometimes we do a little fake s and m we take a catoninetails made out of yarn or a riding crop thats wrapped in foam rubber some guys get off watching girls in leather bras and garters and black stockings making men lick their high heels but thats all silly stuff somebody really into s and md take a tape like that back and ask for a refund real s and m uses things like this nicole whipped the thin stick down onto a vault it whistled and bounced with a slap like a gunshot rune blinked hickory nicole said doesnt look bad but it raises welts itll break the skin you could kill somebody with this if you hit them enough times ive heard about it happening and youre telling me that dannys into that i came down here one time and saw him making one of those flicks he sells them privately i dont think the regular tapes lame duck makes do it for him anymore he needs something like this to get it up what was he doing it was terrible he was beating this girl and using needlesi mean theyre sterile and everything but still jesus and what happened was she started begging him to stop but he just went crazier when he heard that he was like totally out of control i think he wanted to kill her she passed out and a couple assistants grabbed danny and took the girl to the hospital she was going to go to the cops but he paid her off nicole looked around the room so you like asked if hed kill shelly i dont know but can tell you he likes to hurt people rune picked up a thin chain with sharp alligator clips on each end the clips were crusted with blood she set them down nicole shut off the lights and they walked down the corridor to the stairs which is when rune heard the noise she whispered there what was that nicole paused on the second step what i heard something back there are there other rooms like that a couple of them in the back but they were dark remember we didnt see any lights they waited a moment nothing nicole was halfway up the stairs before rune put her foot on the lower step then she heard it again the noise no she decided it was actually two noises one was similar to what shed heard before the ominous swishing of the hickory stick as it swung down on the leather bench the second was maybe just the sound of air escaping from a pipe or steam or distant traffic or maybe it was what rune thought it sounded like the sound of a mans restrained laugh chapter twelve the watering can leaked but aside from that rune decided it was a pretty good idea she rang the bell at danny traubs town house and wasnt surprised to find a stunning brunette in a silk teddy opening the door she had breasts so high and jutting that rune could have walked underneath them bimbos from the amazon lord help us rune walked past her the woman blinked and stepped aside sorry we couldnt make it yesterday had a load ol rhododendraniums to deliver to an office in midtown one of trumps buildings and the whole crew was busy you mean rhododendrons rune nodded yeah shed have to be careful a bimbo with some intelligence careful the woman said your can leaks you dont want to you know hurt the wood got it rune started to work watering traubs plants and trimming the leaves with a pair of scissors she carefully stuffed them into her pocket the green jacket she wore had saidmobil on it when shed bought the thing at a secondhand store but shed cut the logo off and replaced it with a us department of forestry patch shed called lame duck and the studio receptionist had reported that traub would be on the set for a couple of hours and couldnt be disturbed her only concern had been running into the woman whod brought them the martinis the other day well it was a risk coming here but what in life isnt traubs only guest however appeared to be this brunette basketball player the woman didnt seem too suspicious she was moreinterested in what rune was doing watching everything she did whichas far as rune knewwas to murder every plant she touched she didnt know zip about gardening did it take you a long time to learn all that stuff about plants the amazon asked not too long oh she said and watched rune cut through the roots of an african violet rune said you want to give themsome water but not too much andsome light but not too much of that either right the woman nodded and recorded that fact somewhere beneath her shiny hennaenriched mass of hair never cut too many leaves off and always make sure you use the proper type of scissors that is extremely important sharp ones a nod the womans mental computer disk whirred you make a living doing that rune said youd be surprised is it hard to learn you need some talent but if you work hard im an actress amazon said then did a line of cocaine and sat down in front of the tv to watch a soap opera ten minutes later rune had defoliated half of traubs plants and had worked her way upstairs into his office it was empty she looked up and down the corridor and saw nobody she stepped inside and swung the door shut there was no file cabinet inside but traub did have a big desk and it wasnt locked inside she found bills catalogs from glitzy gadget companies a dildo missing its batteries dozens of german s amp m photo magazines roach clips and parts of water pipes matchbooks pens casino chips nothing that could help her want another martini the voice asked coldly rune froze then turned slowly the blonde the same woman who had served her and traub the other daythe one shed been hoping she didnt run intostood in the doorway well it was a risk coming here the woman walked sullenly past her and pulled open another drawer it held maybe a thousand in crumpled tens and twenties help yourself she turned and walked out of the office rune closed the drawer wait can i talk to you the blonde kept walking when rune caught up to her in the corridor she said im crystal youre rune you want to get into films or just robbing my boyfriend is he really your boyfriend she didnt answer crystal led the way to the roof outside she took off her bathrobe and bikini top and stretched out on a lawn recliner covered with thick pink towels she rubbed aloe vera sunscreen on her chest and arms and legs and lay back closing her eyes rune looked around nifty place crystal shrugged wondering it seemed what was nifty about a gray sundeck she said hes not she pulled on sunglasses with dark blue lenses looked at rune my boyfriend i mean she didnt speak for a moment then she said every once in a while you see these big cruise ships come down the river i wonder where theyre going sometimes have you ever been on a cruise rune said i took this neat cruise around the city once the circle line i pretended i was a viking a viking with the helmets right i mean a real cruise no i never have either id like to go sometime rune said you have a wonderful figure thank you she said as if no one had ever told her you want some blow no thanks crystal s head lolled toward the sun her arms draped over the edges of the recliner even her breathing was lethargic id like to live in the caribbean i think i was in st barts once and ive been to club med a couple times paradise island i met a guy only he was married and was separated and after we got back to new york he went back to his wife funny he had a kid and he didnt even tell me about it i saw him on the street you dont want to get into movies i know i dont i could do exotic dancingi dont have to make films but the thing is with the dancing you stand in a little room and guys look at you and well you know what theyre doing its not really disgusting its more whats the word she searched for a while but couldnt find it she gave up put on more lotion what were you looking for upstairs did you know shelly lowe the head turned but where the eyes might be looking under the gunmetalblue reflections rune couldnt tell she saw only two identical fisheye images of herself crystal said i met her once or twice i never worked with her did she and danny get along crystal eased onto her stomach not too bad not too good hes a you know asshole nobody gets along with danny very much are you like a private detective or something just between you and me sure was the response so lazy that rune believed her im doing a film about shelly lowe she was a real actress you know were all real actresses crystal said quickly as if shed been conditioned to respond this way but she didnt sound defensive or angry i want to do a film about her career she wasnt happy she didnt like the business you know what business adult films crystal seemed surprised didnt she why not she could have anything she wanted i make fifty a year cash for working two times a week and shelly could get twice that only what peoplere scared now though with this aids thing i keep getting tested everybody does but you never know john holmes died of aids he said he slept with ten thousand women she rolled onto her back again the glasses tilted toward the hot disk of a sun crystal finally continued she was good shelly was we get a lot of fan letters some are kind of weirdlike menll mail us their underwearbut mostly its just i love you i think about you i rent all your movies i get asked for a lot of dates danny told me that shelly used to get things like airline tickets and checks so she could come visit guys who watched her movies she was one of the companys big stars rune watched the circle linedayliner chugging along in the hudson hey thats my viking ship you gotta ride it sometime crystal glanced quickly danny doesnt talk to me much about business stuff he thinks im not real you know bright the glasses lifted i went to college did you community college i was going to be a dental technician and look what ive got now everything i could want rune said you wont mention that i was crystal took off the sunglasses and shook her head you still havent told me what you were looking for rune couldnt see past the blue lenses but she had an odd feeling that this was someone she could trust could dannyve hurt shelly killed her you mean a hesitation thats what i mean her answer was as drowsy as the rest of her conversation i dont know even if i did i wouldnt like testify against him you know what hed do to me i did that she knew something a long moment passed as crystal rubbed more sunscreen on finally she dropped the tube on the roof you were looking in the wrong place what do you mean hes not stupid traub hes not he doesnt keep the important things in his desk he doesnt keep important papers there for instance why would i be interested in his papers he keeps them where he keeps his stash theres a safe in the kitchen under the sink he doesnt think i know the combination but i figured it out want to know what it is what its forty right twentynine left back around to thirtyfour see thats his idea of a perfect woman her measurements he tells us girls that all the time the perfect woman whats in the safe rune asked you know i have to tan my back now and when i do that i fall asleep goodbye thanks rune said but the woman didnt respond she hurried downstairs and found the safe the combination worked inside were dozens of ounce bags of coke some crack too but that didnt interest rune very muchshe already knew about traubs likes what interested her was the insurance policy a thin binder from new york accident amp indemnity rune opened it up there were a lot of strange words all capitalized likedouble indemnity and key man andnamed insured andowner of the policy she couldnt figure out what they meant but it didnt take her long at all to figure out that the policy was on shelly lowes life and that because of her death danny traub was going to be richer rune had called sam healy and asked him to meet her she was going to tell him about tucker and traub but before they could get together she got a phone call at l ampr and that was why she was now in a coffee shop on west fortysixth street restaurant row in the heart of the theater district im one of a very unelite corps the man said theater people whove been betrayed fired or assaulted by michael schmidt i dont know why you want to do a film abouthim therere so many decent people in the business its not really about him good franklin becker poured another sugar into his coffee stirred he was a former casting director for michael schmidt after shed had her talk with the producer at the theater shed approached the stagehand schmidt had dressed down about dropping the load of lumber shed bought the poor man a cup of coffee and delicately extracted from him the names of several people who might be willing to dish on schmidt becker was the first one whod called her back rune explained its about shelly lowe the actress who was killed in that bombing and you know about her connection with schmidt right becker reminded her somewhat of sam healy tall thinning hair unlike the cops stone face though beckers broke frequently into curls of emotion her impression too was that he wouldnt have any wives in his past only boyfriends what can you tell me about themshelly and schmidt he laughed well i can tell you quite a story what she did it was astonishing ive been casting on broadway for almost twenty years but ive never seen anything like it we had a number of epis michael preferred interviews to epasauditions hes a funny fellow you ever talk to him you know hes got very definite ideas usually the producer couldnt care less about the hired helpthe actors i mean he leaves that to the director as long as the principals get good reviews and pull in a crowd thats enough for them but not for michael he rides herd on everybody director principals walkons arrangers musicians everybody rune wasnt sure where this was going but she let the casting director continue at his own pace so when it came time for casting michael kept his beady little eyes over my shoulder we read resumes we saw tapes we talked to talent agencies he shook his head everybody went through the standard interview everybody but shelly thats the astonishing part somehow shed gotten her hands on a copy of the script for the new play i cant guess how michael treated them like gold ingots there just werent any copies floating around but shed gotten one and had memorized the leading role so its time for her interview she walks into michaels office and doesnt say anything she just starts walking around whats she doing i dont know he doesnt know but then i catch on ive crossread the play enough during auditions shes doing one of the crucial scenes following the stage directions for the beginning of act three then she gives the first line of dialogue in that act and looks at melike a prima donna looking at a conductor whos dropped the beat so i start feeding her the lines thought michael was going to be royally pissed he doesnt like people to do clever things he hasnt thought of but after a minute hes impressed my god hes beside himself and so was i shelly was amazingly good we tell her great thank you well be in touch which is what we always say and michael was his typical noncommittal michael only shes got this look in her eye because she knows shes blown everybody else out of the water after she leaves we read her resume again strange you know she doesnt have any formal training some respectable offbroadway productions some lort thats regional theater some summer stock and some performance pieces at brooklyn academy and local repertory groups either she shouldnt be as good as she is or we shouldve heard of her something was fishy rune said and he did some investigating right michael found out what kind of movies shelly made and that was it for her hes got a thing about dirty movies oh yes see hes very religious what she laughed im not kidding the pornography thingit was a moral issue and the funny thing is he was furious because she was perfect for the part but he wouldnt let himself hire her he was quite um vocal when he found out but the way he behaved this poor stagehand the one who gave me your name i thought he was going to kill the guy ah but not one foul word passed his lips did it i dont remember hes very active in his church he prays before each performance rune said well so what the bibles full of begatting isnt it hell therere actresses on broadwayve slept with as many menand womenoff camera as shelly lowe did on film but michaels a deacon of his church a newspaper storyoh the post would love itabout michael schmidts leading lady being a porn queen beckers eyes brightened as appealing as that thought is to those of us whod like to scuttle the bastard so you see why he couldnt let that happen she must have been heartbroken becker shrugged she was an adult and she made a choice to make those films nobody forced her to but she didnt give up without a fight and what a fight it was what happened after i called her to give her the bad newsi felt i owed her thatshelly made an appointment to see him wed already cast somebody else by then but i guess it halfcrossed my mind that she was going to try tocharm if you want to be euphemistic michael into giving her the part after all shelly wouldnt do that becker looked at her with his eyebrow raised not to get a part rune said she wasnt like that it doesnt make sense but i know that about her now there were some lines she wouldnt cross in any case thats what occurred to me but that wasnt what happened his voice faded i probably shouldnt be telling you this rune squinted just pretend its gossip i love gossip a terrible fight really vicious what could you hear not much you read poetry robert frost rune thought something about horses standing around in the snow when they should be going somewhere becker said ah does anybody read anymore well frost coined this term called thesound of sense it refers to the way we can understand words even though we cant hear them distinctly like through closed doors i got a real sense of their conversation ive never heard michael so mad ive never heard him so scared either scared scared he comes out of the meeting then paces around a few minutes later he calms down then he asks me about the new lead for the play and whether the equity contract has been signed and i tell him it was and i can tell hes thinking about casting shelly again even though he doesnt want to what happened do you think i noticed something interesting about shelly becker said she really did her homeworkgetting the script in the first place for instance see we get a lot of young intense hopefuls in here they know chekhov and ibsen and mamet cold but they dont have a clue about the business of the theater they think producers are gods but as creative as shelly was she also had a foot in the real world she was a strategist for the first epi shed found out everything there was to know about michael personal things as well as professional becker gave rune a meaningful smile and when she didnt respond he frowned dont you get it uh not exactly blackmail blackmail shelly was blackmailing him nobody here knows for certain but therere rumors about michael a few years ago he was traveling through some small town in i dont know colorado nevada and we think he got arrested for picking up a high school boythe story was that he was just seventeen ouch uhhuh also around that time there was an announcement that michael had paid two hundred thousand for the rights to a play nobody pays that kind of money for a straight nonmusical play it had tove been a phony transactionim sure he used company money to pay off locals and keep out of jail i thought he was a deacon in his church this was before he saw the light you think shelly found out about it like i say she did her homework rune said he fired you youre a little prejudiced against him becker laughed i respect medeas strength can i forgive her for killing her children i respect michael for what hes done for new york theater personally think hes a pompous ass draw your own conclusions about what i tell you one last question was he in vietnam or was he ever a soldier michael becker laughed again that would have been a delightful sight when youre in the army i understand you have to do what other people tell you that doesnt sound very much like the michael schmidt we all know and love now does it chapter thirteen his eyes squint picking up golden light from the sun as he gazes over the sagebrush and arroyos for signs of indians or buffalo or strays his a is alwayson his hip rune was using her fingers as an impromptu camera viewfinder to frame sam healy she waved to him and he ambled slowly toward her hed be great in her film there was something different about him today two things in fact one he wasnt somber anymore and two he gave off some kind of quiet strength she hadnt seen before in his face then rune looked past him and she realized why the change the tenyearold boy who rune had thought just happened to be walking beside him was undoubtedly adam his son healys face revealed the protective authoritative aware nature of a parent sam seemed to stop just short of a hug and a kiss and nodded to her thanks for meeting me well us sure she answered wondering why he hadnt told her he was bringing the boy maybe because hed been afraid she wouldnt show up healy introduced them and they shook hands rune said nice to meet you adam the boy said nothing just looked at rune critically healy said come on son what do you say the boy shrugged theyre getting younger all the time rune laughed and healy blushing a bit did too the successful joke had been delivered so smoothly she knew hed used it before they started down the sidewalk in lower manhattan you like u adam asked rune as they walked along broadway past the federal building theyre so totally awesome love that guitar chunga chunga chunga oh yeah rune said but im mostly into older music like bowie adam ant sex pistols talking heads david byrne yeah hes like your megagenius even if hes old i still listen to the police a lot rune said i kinda grew up with them adam nodded i heard about them my mom used to listen to them stings still around healy said um crosby stills and nash rune and adam looked at him blankly jimi hendrix the jefferson airplane when he got a stare in response to the doors healy said quickly hey how bout some lunch they sat across from the ornate woolworth building rune and healy adam replenished by two hot dogs and a yoohoo chocolate soda chased squirrels and shadows and scraps of windblown paper sam she began say you have a couple different suspects and you know one of them did it but you dont know who in a bombing say any crime like youre an ordinary movable investigating something portable not movable but itd probably be a detective evaluating suspects okay a detective with three suspects what would you do to figure out who the perp is perp he said see i said you were a born cop in a thick slavic accent i learned english from kojafe reruns she grew serious come on sam what would you do in order to make an arrest you need probable cause whats that something that shows your suspect is more likely than not tove committed the crime a witness conflicting alibis physical evidence at the scene connecting the suspect and the crime fingerprints genetic marker test a confessions always good how do you get confessions we put the suspect in a room turn the camera on and ask them questions you dont arrest them because then their lawyers show up and tell them not to say anything they can leave at any time but we encourage them to stay you ever trick somebody into a confession sure thats part of the game but no more answers till you tell why youre curious about police procedures okay ive got three suspects what suspects in the shelly lowe killing three suspects you mean you know three people in the sword of jesus why didnt you tell begley or somebody in homicide oh there is no sword of jesus its a coverup somebodys making it look like its a religious thing but its not but she continued before he could ask what would undoubtedly be some questions that would result in either awkward answers or outright lies see shelly didnt just do those movies theres this guy named arthur tucker he was shellys acting coach only you know whats interesting her voice faded and she looked at him whats the matter rune you werent going to do this i was just interviewing people about her for my film and i found some funny things she grew quiet looking up at the gargoyles twothirds of the way up the skyscraper she wondered if she and healy were about to have their first fight that was really a bad signto have a fight before youd spent some time seriously kissing someone healy glanced at adam stalking a mangy pigeon twenty feet away and rested his large hand tentatively on her knee rune stared at the gargoyles they were smiling not leering she thought it seemed that was an important omen but she couldnt tell what it meant healy didnt speak for a second he clicked his tongue okay funny things go ahead and tell me shelly was a legitimate actress and she wrote plays okay she and her coach this arthur tucker had a big fight when he found out about her movie career oh ohhe also was a commando in the war so he knows about bombs but you need a motive to ive got one he stole a play that shelly wrote he took it and put his name on it he told me hed never gotten anywhere with his career and i think he couldve killed her and stolen that play pretty damn speculative who else is a suspect michael schmidt healy was frowning its familiar whos he the broadway producer the famous one him right he told me he didnt remember shelly but he was lying it turns out hed almost offered her a role in one of his plays then he found out she did porn and withdrew the offer she was going to blackmail him into getting the part you dont kill someone hes a deacon in the church she couldve brought down his whole career hes also an obnoxious son of a bitch that doesnt violate the penal code of the state of new york being obnoxious who else is on the list another asshole danny traub hes part owner of lame duck shellys company and you heard about an insurance policy on the building no on her this got healys attention go on shelly told me that she had a terrible fight with someone she worked with i think it mightve been him he was always flirting with her and she was rejecting him and hes really into s and m he gets off on beating women so i broke into his town house healy put his face in his hands rune no no no you cant do these things its okay one of his girlfriends said it was all right she also let me go through his safe healy sighed at least you didnt steal anything he looked at her tell me you didnt steal anything what i look like a thief rune asked anyway what i found was this insurance policy on shelly almost a halfmillion dollars no exclusion for murder nope his girlfriend made a copy of it for me youve got three suspects could any of them been the one who attacked you theyre all about the same build oh and schmidts eyes were all red like hed been teargassed recently teargassed what does that have to do with anything the man in the windbreaker she said sheepishly i sort of teargassed him sort of selfdefense she pointed out in a lame voice but healy didnt lecture her about illegal weapons in the city of new york he just shrugged i dont know tear gas burns disappear within twelve hours or so how bout the other two theyre all built about the same not muscle builders did any of them look really shocked to see you i mean if theyd tried to kill you there wouldve been some recognition in their faces i dont think so she said frowning in disappointment of course healy added the smart thing would be to hire a strongarm a hit man healy was nodding absently thats good its not enough for probable cause but then he laughed and shook his head as if coming out of a daydream hey forget this whole thing he held up his handnot the one that was still resting on her knee im not even in homicide i dont want to know any of this just tell me about the explosives from the second bombing no i thought you were having them traced i am well no results yet and when i get them im writing them in my report and sending it upstairs and thatll be that she said defiantly ill just have to keep looking i guess rune healy was debating tell you what ill steer a couple guys from homicide over to check outwhat was his namethe acting coach hes the only one seems to know anything about explosives really only promise you wont arrest him till im there i want to film the bust i think you know we cant make any promises like that well just try please rune wrote tuckers name on a mustardstained napkin and handed it to healy she asked what about the other two you want my opinion the insurance angle with whats his name traub thats too obvious and michael schmidt doesnt seem a celeb like himd risk a murder conviction because of a blackmail threat oh but hes got an ego like the grand canyon healy looked at the napkin lets do one at a time no rush theres no statute of limitations on murder see i told you wed make a great team team he was saying only in a softer voice he leaned toward her his head tilted slightly his eyes darted to where adam had been just a moment before the boy wasnt visible quickly healy bent closer to her youre very pretty you know that she didnt know it at all but it didnt matter she was perfectly happy to know thathe felt that way rune found her eyes closing her head tilting back lifting up to meet his lips he reached over and took her hand and she was surprised that his was shaking slightly dont do it adam said scaring the hell out of them both as he climbed on top of the bench from behind it where hed been stalking them youll scar me for life healy jerked back the boy grinned and motioned for rune to help him chase pigeons she squeezed healys knee and ran into the park where do i apply the receptionist on the fourth floor of the lame duck studio looked up at rune scanned her figure and went back to her occult paperback we dont need no secretaries i want to be in films she said you know what kind of films we make here i figuredthe erotic adventures oj bunny blue isnt an army training film rune said todayafter another phone callrune had found that danny traub was at home entertaining some prospective actresses if that verb worked with traub the woman whod blown the whistle on the insurance policy had assured her that the producer would be busy for hours the lame duck receptionist marked her place and looked up from underneath a sheen of brown eye makeup rune had decided she wasnt as content as sam healy was to forget about the other two suspects so she was going to find more evidenceeither for or against danny traub and michael schmidt the receptionist continued the thing is the people they hire are a certain kind of person certain kind a little well what rune was frowning the girl glanced at her chest more are you trying to tell me something voluptuous like runes eyes went wide dont you know about the constitution the horror novel was a loss the girl folded it over without marking her place like the ship that was a ship in the civil war whats that got to do with rune said you cant discriminate against anyone just because they arent dolly parton dolly parton all i want to do is audition if you dont want me because i cant act okay but you cant deny me a chance to try out because i dont have big boobs thats like a federal lawsuit federal there was a pause the woman debated within herself rifling pages of the paperback rune asked can i have an application they dont have applications all they do is like they look at a reel you bring in of yourself or else you go into the studio here and you know do it they tape it and if they like it they call you back let me see if theres anybody around the girl stood up and walked into the back part of the office swaying her independently connected hips wait here she returned a minute later go on back the second office on the right she looked at her novel with disappointment realizing shed have to find her place again the rooms were divided off with the same clumsily cut sheetrock rectangles that she remembered from nicoles socalled dressing room the walls had been recently painted but the surfaces were already scuffed and dirty the posters and shades were from discount import stores the sort where newlyweds and nyu students buy wicker bamboo and plastic to furnish first apartments there was no carpet the second office on the right contained more or less what shed been expecting a fat bearded man in a tshirt and black baggy slacks he looked up and smiled in a curious way it wasnt lecherous wasnt provocative wasnt friendly the odd thing about this smile was that the face it was etched into didnt seem to understand he was looking at another human being im gutman ralph gutman youre who uh dawn yah dawn what dawn felicidad i like that are you what hispanic or something you dont look it well doesnt matter so you want a job im a tough guy to work for im a ballbuster but im the best producer in the business i think i mayve heard of you his second office on the right glance said well ofcourse youve heard of me where you from gutman asked jersey right ohio youre

do that sure you have a reel all i know about reels is they go on fishing rods ha rods he laughed and it seemed that shed made some kind of joke then he explained samples of your work ive never been in film before but i do this little act kind of a strip do you have a place where i can change change youll be taking your clothes off in front of twenty people every day you shoot you want to go someplace and change no i want you to get the full effect she nodded toward her bag ive got this outfit i think youll like it just an office or something itll take five minutes gutman was moderately interested he looked her over again then waved his arm find an office change ill be here she found danny traubs office right up the hallway she walked in closed the door behind her she glanced around quicklyat the walls done in ace home center wood paneling the big fakeebony desk more plants a leather couch and two file cabinets rune started through the first one she was looking for evidence a piece of wire a book on explosives a letter from shelly telling him he was a son of a bitch abible where traub mightve gotten the quote about the angels destroying the earth anything that might link him to the bombing physical evidence thats what healyd said she needed for probable cause she didnt find any just contracts correspondence just like any other businessman would keep in his office she turned to the second cabinet and started through it this one contained more contracts and legal documents she didnt find anything significant until she got to the ls and saw the file labeled shelly lowe but she didnt have a chance to read it because just then the door swung open and danny traub walked inside he froze then recovered he swung the door shut and never one to neglect his invisible audience said well this kiddos looking in my drawers wonder if shes found anything interesting chapter fourteen rune closed the file cabinet checking distances checking exits she was on the fourth floor that was forty feet would a jump through the window kill her might traub stepped toward her shaking his head gosh here we are in new york crime capital of the world i mean there are people from iowa hold on to their wallets when they flyover new york in an airplane this citys got such a bad rep i cant believe it i was just and what do we have here a young lady stealing iles my god does she realize that those manila folders cost a couple cents each steal a hundred thousand of them i was and she could buy herself a set of tupperware or a big mac feast for her and her friends trying to fence them thoughs a little tricky the smile faded the audience was gone okay what the fuck you doing here he walked over to where she was standing and lifted the file out of her hands glanced at the name on the folder he nodded knowingly tossed it back into the cabinet as he was turning to her rune dropped to her knees and pulled the tear gas canister out of her purse but traub moved faster he grabbed the cylinder ripped it out of her hand and shoved her into the couch he looked at it closely amused it seemed rune sat up whats this all about and dont gimme this cute nancy drew shit i had a fucking bomb take out my star and a floor of my company im not in the mood rune didnt say anything traub pointed the tear gas spray at her face remembering the terrible sting she cringed looked away answer me breathlessly she said you didnt tell me you had a policy on shelly lowe he frowned a policy an insurance policy thats right i didnt but you didnt ask me if i had one now did you it seems like thatd be a pretty normal thing to mention i tell you im doing a film about one of your stars traub glanced again at the tear gas weighed it in his hand youre asking all this shit for your film is that it he leaned up against the door rune saw his muscles stand out sinewy and pale he reminded her of one of the flying monkeys inthe wizard of oz the characters that scared her the most even more than the wicked witch the police know im here traub laughed thats like on dday yelling to the germans ike knows im here he looked her over and the motion of his eyes was like his tongue coursing over her body she pulled away from him crossed her arms glanced down at the desk for paperweights there was a letter opener she might go for so you think i killed shelly do you that i planted a bomb so id get the insurance money i didnt say that traub paced intermission was over he was looking around once more thats pretty good detective work this cookies done dont you think shes a star shes a regular little sherlock holmes well you got me honey yep yep the insurance company paid off i got myself a check for five hundred thousand dollars rune didnt answer traub set the tear gas down he looked at rune then took a key out of his pocket and walked behind his desk rune leaned forward putting her weight on the balls of her feet he was going for a gun he could just shoot her like a burglar and the police wouldnt do anything traub glanced at her on your mark get set i dont think she can make it in time he grinned and pulled out the black pistol enjoyed the sight of her eyes widening heres a present for our little ms detective rune winced when it looked like he was going to pull the trigger shed just dive forward grab the tear gas and hope for the best then traubs other hand emerged with a piece of paper neither of them moved for a moment i dont know about her but the suspense is killing me is she going to read it is she going to make a paper airplane rune took the sheet of paper and read dear mr traub with intense heartfelt gratitude we acknowledge receipt of your check in the amount of your generosity will go very far in supporting research to find a cure for this terrible affliction and in easing the burden of those whose lives have been affected byit the letter was signed by the director of the new york aids coalition oh traub dropped the gun in the drawer oh she says oh well you know theres still a hundred of the insurance proceeds unaccounted for but since i personally take home a hundred fifty a year cash off the books you can probably deduce that i aint gonna kill my biggest star to pick up fucking chicken feed oh by the way my personal property insurance has a hundred thousand deductible so with the repairs to the floor downstairs this whole thing was a wash for me im sorry he tossed the tear gas to her i think its time for our little detective to leave lets give her a big round of applause throughout the interview arthur tucker never quite got over the shock that two police officers were questioning him as a suspect in a murder case they were polite as they asked him questions about shelly lowe they tried to make it seem casual but there was something they were trying to get at something they knew what he thought desperately he felt vulnerableas if they could see into his mind but he had no clue as to what they were thinking one of the officers glanced up at tuckers medals you in the service sir i was in the rangers you ever do demolition he shrugged we all knew how to use bangalore torpedoes grenades but that was forty years ago are you suggesting that i had anything to do with those bombs nosir were just looking into what happened to ms lowe tucker looked perplexed confused and asked them about the sword of jesus they continued to be evasive but it was more than evasion they were grasping at straws and even then they came away holding nothing at all he wondered how on earth they had come to think he might be the killer he supposed that shelly had written his name in a daytimer or a wall calendar maybe she kept a diaryhe told all of his students to keep oneand shed written about one of their lessons maybe about one of their fights that could have brought them here but as he thought about shelly his mind wandered and with his strong will and talents at concentration he brought his attention back to the policemen she was a fascinating person officer tucker explained with the sorrow and reverence one should have in his voice when speaking of a fascinating person who had just died i hope youre close to catching these people i cant condone her careeryou know how she made her living i supposebut violence like this he closed his eyes and shuddered inexcusable it makes us all barbarians tucker was a good actor but they didnt buy it they looked at him blankly as if he hadnt said a word then one officer said i understand you write plays too sir is that correct he believed his heart stopped beating for a moment ive done just about everything there is to do in the theater i started out as a but about the writing you do write plays yes and ms lowe did too isnt that correct she may have but she was your student isnt that something youd talk about with her i think she did yes we were more concerned with acting than writing in our but lets stick with the writing for a minute do you have in your possession any plays that she wrote no tucker answered managing to keep his voice rockfirm can you account for your whereabouts the night ms lowe was killed at around eight pm i was attending a play so i guess thered be witnesses about fifteen hundred of them do you want me to give you some names tucker asked that wont be necessary the other cop added not at this time you mind if we look around the office yes i do youll have to get a warrant for that youre not cooperating i have been cooperating but if you want to search my office youll have to get a warrant simple as that this didnt evoke any emotion at all in their faces okay thank you for your time when they were gone tucker stood at his window for five minutesmaking sure theyd left the building he turned back to his desk and with unsteady hands found the script fordelivered flowers he put this into his battered briefcase he then began looking through the manuscripts on his credenza throwing the ones shelly had written into the briefcase too but wait one was missing he searched again no it wasnt there he was sure hed left it there jesus what had happened to it then he looked up and saw the glass door to his office the replacement for the one that was broken the other day in that abortive robbery hedthought nothing had been stolen in the breakin tucker sat down slowly in his chair the house o leather filming had been arduous larry had taken rune off catering detail for the time being and actually let her operate the camera during one session it had been a long shoot daughter had needed eighteen takes before she could get two lines of dialogue in the can but rune didnt carethe camera was a real arriflex a beautiful piece of precision machinery and feeling the mechanism whir beneath her fingers made up for a lot of the recent grief shed been put through at the company mr walletshe justcouldnt remember his namehad turned out to be not so bad he thanked rune whenever she brought him something to eat or drink and on a break theyd shared a few words about recent movies he had pretty good taste ad director mary jane though was a different story she hovered over the set wearing a distracting blueandred suit with shoulder pads like a linebackers wanting to correct the light wanting to look through the arris eyepiece and when rune wasnt behind the camera the woman would ask her to make copies and retype memos shewondered a lot her favorite phrase seemed to be i wonder if it might not be better to the second was i would have thought you her saving grace was that unlike mr wallet she didnt ask rune to fetch coffeewhich told her that in her preann taylor incarnation mary jane had been a putupon secretary the resentments of servitude run deep rune knew the shoot was finished and rune was in the office late checking props for the dramatic logo scene to be shot in a day or two this was bobs idea it would be a tracking cua moving closeup shotof dominoes falling over followed by a pullback to reveal that the dominoes had formed the companys name and logo it had been runes job to find and rent thousands of white dotfree dominoes rune heard a noise she looked up and saw sam healy standing in the doorway she said if youre here in a like official capacity im hauling ass outa this building right now she said so you reallydo have a job thats a real liberal use of the wordjob sam he walked inside and she opened the massive refrigerator and gave him a beer weve got one more shot for this stupid commercial then the boys collect a nifty two hundred gs and thats profit phew healy whistled not a bad line of work beats civilservant pay grades at least you have your dignity sam she showed him the studio then ran some of the rushes from the house o leather shoots on the moviola i can set you up with the daughter you want thats all right think ill pass they walked back to the office and sat down he said a couple buddies from the sixth precinct checked up on tucker he looked guilty they said but so do most people when theyre being interviewed by two cops he continued but heres the gist of it they checked out his military history he hardly ever saw combat and once he was discharged never had anything to do with the military again was in theater all his life no criminal record no apparent contact with criminals attends church regularly he but he still knows how hey hey let me finish they also checked out what an original play by an unknown playwright is worth youre talking in the thousands tops unless a miracle happens and it takes offlike cats or something like that and thats a oneinamillion chance believe me nobodys going to risk a murder conviction for a couple of thousand dollars but the play i saw hed changed the name sure he did she was killed and he figured hed steal them and make a little money her estate wouldnt even know about it thats larceny but who cares healy looked into one of the hundred of boxes of dominoes that surrounded rune so so you out of the detective business totally and completely im really glad to hear that i have some information the young womans voice said sitting at his oak desk michael schmidt held the phone receiver in one hand and with his other tapped on the unopened lid of the carton of clam chowder the voice a womans and disguised somehow continued it links you to shelly lowes death he poked his finger listlessly against the cello packet of saltines until each cracker popped into crumbs who is this i think its information youd be interested in tell me who you are youll meet me soon enough if youre not afraid to what do you want you want money are you trying to blackmail me blackmail its funny you should mention that word maybe i am but i want to meet you in person facetoface come to my office no way where there are plenty of people around okay where meet me at noon at lincoln center you know the tables they have set up there the restaurant outside yeah there meet me there and dont bring anybody with you got it the line went dead schmidt sat staring at the glossy blackandgray phone for a full minute before he realized he was still holding the silent receiver he hung it up angrily he felt like swearing though he knew that if he did hed immediately regret saying the cuss word he was proud of the fact that he was both a tough moneymaking businessman and a deeply religious man who abhorred the use of obscenities with his thumb he continued to crush the crackers into dust his appetite for the soup was gone and he pitched it into his wastebasket the lid came off and the soup spilled into the plastic bag lining the garbage can the smell of fish and onions wafted up which made him even more angry but he remained completely still as he folded his hands together and prayed until he was calm that was one thing he had learned to dohe never made a decision when he was in what he called a secular state in five minutes the spirit of the lord had calmed him his decision was to do exactly what hed thought of doing when hed hung up after speaking to the girl he picked up the phone and gently pressed out a number chapter fifteen you can use l amprs camera its got a telephoto built in stu the cookeditorfood stylist from belvedere postproduction said why exactly do you want to film this guy im going to get a confession im going to trick him isnt it illegal to film people if they dont know about it no not if theyre in a public place thats what public dominion means public domain and thats something different the copyright law oh rune was frowning well i dont know but im sure its okay and im doing it what kind of camera is it betacam have you i know how to use one ampex deck right rune said youll be up on the balcony at lincoln center shooting down thats all you have to do just tape me talking to this guy you still havent told me why what kind of confession ill have a tape recorder she said quickly you dont even have to worry about audio im not going to do it you dont tell me what youre up to trust me stu i hate that phrase dont you like adventures no i like cooking i like eating id like money if i had any but one thing i definitely dont like is adventures ill give you a credit on my film great just be sure to put my prison number after my name its not illegal thats not the problem so there is a problem what is it getting beat up or killed will you dedicate the film to my memory you arent going to get killed you didnt say anything about not being beat up you wont get beat up it sounded to me stu said that there was a tacitprobably attached to that last sentence was there look youdefinitely wont get beat up i promise feel better no lincoln center why there rune slung the battery pack over her shoulder so that if you do get beat up therell be plenty of witnesses rune had flashed an id to the security guard of avery fischer hall his eyes went wide for a moment then he let her into the quiet hall were doing some surveillance she told him yes maam he answered and returned to his station you need any more help you give me a call whats that stu asked that you just showed him an identification card iknow that what kind sort of fbi he said what how did you get that i kind of made it on l amprs word processor then i had it laminated waitwhy did you tell me i dont want to know things like that forget i asked they continued up the stairs on the walls were dozens of posters of operas and plays that had been performed at lincoln center rune pointed at one wild look it was for offenbachsorpheus in the underworld stu glanced at it i prefer easy listening whats the significance rune was quiet for a moment she felt like crying thats eurydice that woman she reminds me of someone i used to know they climbed the top floor and stepped out on the roof rune set up the camera now dont pan im worried about strobing dont get fancy keep the camera on me and the guy im going to be talking to i want a twoshot most of the time but you can zoom in on his face if i give you the signal ill scratch my head hows that to zoom you just ive used a betacam before good you got an hours worth of tape two hours of batteries and thisll probably be over in fifteen minutes about the length of time of an execution any final words rune smiled nervously my first starring role break a leg stu said shed thought that maybe he wouldnt show and shed thought that even if he did show hed sit way off to the side where he could pull out a gun with a silencer on it and shoot her in the heart and get away and it would be half an hour before anybody noticed her thinking that shed just fallen asleep in the hot sun shed seen that in an old filmapeter lorre film she thought but michael schmidt was obliging he sat in the center of the outdoor restaurant around the huge fountain in the middle of lincoln center he was scanning the crowd nervously and when he saw rune he glued his eyes on her recognition preceded fury by a millisecond she paused slipped her hand into her jacket and started the tape recorder he noticed the gesture and leaned back probably thinking she had a gun he was clearly afraid rune continued to the table you he whispered youre the one in the theater rune sat down you lied to me you didnt tell me you offered shelly the part then broke the deal so why should i tell you anything you interrupted me in the middle of a very important meeting my mind doesnt work like other peoples i dont have little mundane facts at my beck and call i know all about the fight you had with her i fight with a lot of people im a perfectionist what do you want money his eyes scanned the crowds once again he was still nervous as a deer just answer she began how much just tell me please why did you have to kill her rune asked viciously schmidt leaned forward why do you think i killed her because she tried to blackmail you into giving her the part schmidt muttered angrily and youre going to do what go to the police with that story there was something about the sweep of his skittish eyes that warned her twice now hed glanced at an adjoining table rune followed his eyes and saw that two men were sitting in front of plates of fancy sandwiches that neither had touched jesus they were hit men schmidtd hired hit men maybe the skinnier of them was the man in the red windbreaker they didnt give a shit about being in public or not they were going to rub her out right here or follow her and kill her in an alley blasting away at her as if she were marlon brando in thegodfather schmidt swung his eyes forced them back to her face the two men shifted slightly now tell me how much you want oh hell no more games time to leave rune stood up schmidt glanced at her pocket the tape recorder his eyes were wide the heads of the two hit men swiveled toward her then schmidt pushing back sliding to the ground yelling get her get her the diners gasped and pushed back from their tables some ducked to the pavement the hit men stood quickly the metal chairs bouncing to the stone ground she saw guns in their hands screams people diving to the pavement drinks falling salads spinning lettuce and tomatoes and croissants flew to the ground rune sprinted to columbus avenue and ran north she glanced behind her the hit men were closing in they were in great shape you two assholes are surrounded by witnesses what the hell are you doing her chest was screaming her feet stung rune lowered her head and ran full out at seventysecond street she looked behind her and couldnt see them any longer she stopped running and pressed against a chainlink fence around a vacant lot trying to fill her lungs her fingers curled tight in the mesh a bus pulled into the stop she stepped toward it and the hit men waiting behind a truck ran toward her she screamed and rolled to the ground then crawled under a gap in the chain link she staggered to her feet and sped toward the building across the lot a school a vacant school she ran to the door locked she turned they were coming at her again trotting now looking nonchalant trying to be inconspicuous the guns in their hands at their sides nowhere to go except down a long alley thered have to be an exit to the street a door a window something rune ran to the end of it it was a dead end but there was a rickety door she threw herself against it the wood was much more solid than it seemed she bounced off the thick oak and fell to the ground and she knew it was over the hit men guns in the open now looked around cautiously and walked toward her rune got up on her knees and looked for a brick a rock a stick there was nothing she fell forward sobbing no no no they were on top of her she felt the muzzle of the gun at her neck rune whimpered and covered her head no that was when one of the hit men said youre under arrest you have the right to remain silent you have the right to an attorney and to have the attorney present during questioning if you give up the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in court the th precinct looked a lot like the new york state unemployment office except there werent so manyoras manywriters and actors here a lot of scuffed lucite a lot of typed announcements pinned up on bulletin boards cheap linoleum overhead fluorescents civilians milling about and cops a lot of big cops handcuffs were heavier than shed thought they werent like bracelets at all she rested her hands in her lap and wondered if shed be out of prison in a year one of the hit men a detective yalkowsky deposited her in an orange fiberglass chair one of six bolted together into a bench a woman officer in a ponytail like runes the desk sergeant asked him whatve you got here attempted grand larceny extortion attempted assault fleeing resisting arrest criminal trespassing hey i didnt assault anyone and i was only trespassing to get away fromhim i thought he was a hit man yalkowsky ignored her she hasnt made a statement doesnt want a lawyer she wants to talk to somebody named healy rune saiddetective healy hes a policeman why do you want to see him hes a friend the detective said honey the mayor could be a friend of yours and youd still be in deep shit you tried to extort michael schmidt thats big stuff youre gonna be potato chips for the newspapers just give him a call please the detective hesitated then said put her in a holding cell until we talk to him a holding cell the desk sergeant looked rune over and frowned we dont want to do that rune looked at her concerned face shes right you dont want to do that yalkowsky shrugged yeah i think we do chapter sixteen rune and sam healy made their way along central park west past the knoll where dogwalkers gathered poodles and retrievers and akitas and mutts tangled leashes and pranced on the dusty ground healy was silent rune kept looking up at him he turned and walked into the park they climbed to the top of a huge rock thirty feet high and sat down sam rune it isnt that they couldve prosecuted you sam i they couldnt have made the extortion case and yeah they didnt identify themselves as cops and somebody found a fake fbi id but nobodys connected it to you yet but what they could have done is shot you fleeing felon if they thought you were dangerous they could have shot im sorry i do something risky for a living rune but there are procedures and backup and a lot of things we do to make it less dangerous but you you get these crazy ideas about killers and blackmail and you dive right in they watched a softball game in the meadow for a minute the heat was bad and the players were lethargic puffs of dust rose up from the yellow grass as the ball skipped into the outfield there were some rumors about schmidt and this teenage boy in colorado i thought shelly found out about it and was blackmailing him to get the part did the facts lead you to that conclusion or did youimagine thats what happened and shoehorn the facts into your idea i i shoehorned okay rune said sam i have this notebook at home i write all kinds of stuff in it its sort of like a diary you know what i have written on the first page i wont grow up if id thought about it yeah it probably would say that but what i wrote is believe in what isnt as if it were until it becomes crack ahome run the pitcher watched the ball sail toward the portable toilet a hundred feet from home plate sam this movie is important to me i didnt go to college i worked in a video store i did storewindow design i worked in restaurants ive sold stuff on the streets i dont want to keep doing that forever he laughed youve got a few years worth of false starts ahead of you at the film company they treat me like a kid well okay sometimes iact like a kid but i mean they dont think im capable of anything more i know this film about shelly is going to work i can feel it what you did back there with schmidt that wasnt bright he was the last of my suspects i thought he was the one a suspect doesnt call the cops to know i was wrong its just that well i cant point to anything in particular i just had a i dont know hunch yeah that somebody killed her and it wasnt this stupid sword of jesus i believe in hunches too but do us both a favor forget about this movie of yours or just tell the story about a girl who got killed and let it go at that forget about trying to find the killer leave a little mystery in it people like mystery thats what my name means in celtic your real name reality she said is highly overrated no i mean rune he nodded and she couldnt tell whether he was sad or angry with her or whether he was just being a silent cowboy i dont think youre going to see any more bombings healy said the profile is they get tired after a while too risky to be a serial criminal nowadays forensics are too good youll get nailed rune was silent healy said ive got watch in a couple of minutes i was thinking you want maybe you could stop by the bomb squad see what its like really oh yeah but ive got to get to work now todays the last shot for this stupid commercial healy nodded ill be there all night he gave her directions to the th precinct dominoes all she could see was dominoes come on luv larry was cajoling you get to be the one to knock em over rune was still setting them up i thought you were going to hire another couple of pas for the shoot youre all the assistant we need for this one luv you can do it rune was working from a piece of paper on which hed drawn the pattern she reluctantly admitted to herself that it was probably going to be a hell of a shot ow many we have four thousand three hundred and twelve larry i checked them all good for you once halfway through the assembly two hours into the process she set them off accidentally the rows of rectangles clicked against one another with the sound of chips around a las vegas roulette wheel double shit i wouldve thought youdve started from the other side mary jane contributed that way you probably wouldntve bumped into them as easily doing good larry said quickly is this art a fuming rune asked him as she crawled over the twentyfoot sweep of gray seamless backdrop paper to set them up again dont start finally hours later she got the little army of dominoes arranged and backed off the paper without breathing she crawled to the first one and nodded to larry rune glanced at the camera operator a nerdish bearded guy who sat in the seat of the luma crane boom it looked like earthmoving equipment make sure you got film rune said to him im not doing this again lights larry liked playing director the lighting man turned the lamps on the set was suddenly bathed in ovenhot white light roll were rolling then larry nodded to rune she reached toward the first domino the dominoes fell and clicked as they spread over the paper the camera swept over the set like a carnival ride and larry murmured with the preoccupation of a man who was getting paid two hundred thousand dollars for five days work click the last one fell the camera backed off for a longer angle shot of the entire logo a cow wearing a top hat cut larry yelled sternly save the lights the lights went out rune closed her eyes thinking that shed still have to get all the little rectangles packed up and returned to the prop rental store before six larry and bob wouldnt want to pay another days fee then the voice came from somewhere above them one thing it was mary jane whod watched the whole event from a tall ladder on the edge of the set whats that mr wallet asked im just wondering do you think the logos a little lopsided she climbed down from the ladder mr wallet climbed up surveyed the set it does look a little that way he said mary jane said the cows horns arent even the left one and the right one mr wallet looked at the fallen dominoes we cant have a lopsided logo mary jane walked forward and adjusted the design she stood back see thats what it should be like i wouldve thought youd tried a test first as rune took a breath to speak the words that would send her straight to unemployment larry squeezed her arm ey rune could you come out here for a minute please in the hall she turned to him lopsided shes lopsided what does she think it is oil paint its not the sistine chapel larry its a cow with a fucking top hat sure its going to be lopsided shes on some kind of a power trip rune we do it again the hornsll be fine but the hatll be wrong i want to knock her ive got a distributor for your film buck teeth out i larry repeated patiently a distributor she paused for a minute you what i found somebody who said e might want to handle your film looking for gritty noirish stuff its not a big outfit but theyve placed at public tv stations and some of the bigger locals were not talking network but sometimes good films you know they get picked up in syndication oh larry she hugged him i dont believe it right now then were going to go back in there and make nice with the ice lady okay rune said that woman is a totally airborne bitch but theyre our clients rune and in this business the customer is always what he raised an eyebrow she walked toward the door dont ask me questions you dont want to hear the answers to runes favorite part was the dogs the rest was pretty neatthe artillery shells the hand grenades the sticks of dynamite wired to clocks silver cylinders of detonators which all turned out to be phony but the really audacious part was the three labrador retrievers that nosed their way up to her and rested their big snouts on her knees when she crouched down to pet them they wheezed as she scratched their heads healy and rune stood in the bomb squad headquarters upstairs at the th precinct on tenth street it wasnt easy to miss the office in the corridor over the door hung a bright red army practice bomb stenciled withbomb squad in gothic lettering in the main room were eight battered desks the walls were light green the floor linoleum one woman in a dark sweater sat at a desk intently reading a technical manual she was pretty with long brunette hair and still eyes she was the only woman in the unit the others were men mostly in their thirties and forties wearing white shirts and ties trim guns rested in hip holsters they read talked among themselves stretched back spoke quietly on the phone a few acknowledged healy with waves or raised eyebrows no one looked at rune weve got the biggest civilian bomb disposal unit in the world thirtytwo officers mostly detectives a few waiting for the rank on the wall was an old wooden board mounted with formal portraits of policemen rune caught the words in memory of the board was the largest display in the room she bent down and patted a dogs head edc healy said thats a weird name rune said standing up that what he is an explosive detection canine the initials again saves time healy said youd run out of breath you had to say im taking the explosive detection canine for a walk you could trydog one rolled onto his back rune scratched his stomach they sniff out explosives labradorsve got the best noses in the business weve used computerized nitrate vapor detectors but the dogs work faster they can sniff out plastic dynamite tnt tovex semtex computers dont pee though one cop offered or lick their balls in public another one said healy sat down at a tiny desk one detective said to him howd you rate missing the abortion clinic detail lucky i guess healy turned to rune you want some coffee sure healy walked into the locker room three officers sat at a fiberboard table eating chinese food he rinsed out a china mug and poured coffee rune stood at the bulletin board looking at color snapshots of explosions she pointed to a photo of a red truck that looked like a huge basket whats that the pikela guardia truck we dont use it much anymore it was built in the forties got its name because it was built when a guy named pike was co of the bomb squad and la guardia was mayor see that mesh there thats cable left over from the triborough bridge they used to put ieds in there and take them to the disposal grounds if it went off the mesh stopped the shrapnel still a lot of flame escaped though now we use a totalcontainment vehicle rune said a tcv right healy nodded rune picked up a thick plastic tube about a foot long filled with a blue gelatin printed with the words dupont she squeezed it grinned this is kinda kinky sam he glanced at it youre holding enough tovex to turn a pretty goodsize boulder into gravel she set it down carefully if it were live thats just for training sos everything else in here that too she pointed to an artillery shell about two and a half feet long well its not live but we picked that up a year or so ago what happened was a woman calls and says she got hit by a bullet so emergency services shows up and they go into the apartment they find her on the floor they ask wheres the shooter wheres the gun she says theres no gunjust the bullet she points to the shell then says i opened the closet door and it fell out it broke her toe her husband collected artillery shells and a voice shouted sam he stepped into the main room a heavy squarejawed man with trim blond hair was leaning out of the commanders office he glanced at rune briefly then looked at healy sam esu just got a tenthirtythree at a porn theater in times square somebody found a box looked inside saw a timer in there and maybe a wad of something might be plastic seventh avenue near fortyninth rubin you go with him no more bombings hed said but before she could comment to him healy and another cop a thin man of about fortyfive who looked like he belonged more in an insurance office circa than in the bomb squad were racing to the locker room they opened their lockers and pulled out battered canvas bags then ran for the door healy snagged his attache case as he disappeared into the corridor hey rune was saying healy didnt even glance back where does he get off rune thought speeding into the dark green corridor downstairs the men disappeared into the station house an officer in a blue turtleneck stopped her wouldnt let her follow by the time she went outside their blueandwhite van was disappearing down eleventh street the roof lights playing crack the whip the vehicle gave a bubble of electronic siren then sailed north on hudson street she ran to the corner waving for cabs that failed to materialize sam healy had the procedure down that was one talent he had the ability to memorize hed look at a list or circuit schematic once or twice and that would be itit was in the mental vault which was a good thing because there was a lot to remember when you were a bomb squad cop he wondered if that had anything to do with why hed chosen bomb detail in the first place it was different from being a beat cop or an esu cop in emergency services you had to make fast decisions they improvised healy preferred to plan every detail out then work step by step slowly the van clattered north hudson became eighth avenue and they passed fourteenth street the procedure set up a frozen zone for a thousand feet around the theater and evacuate everybody as best you can easy in a long island strip mall impossible in densely populated manhattan then you get the robot with its gripping claws and tvcamera eyes to stroll up to the damn thing and take a look at it then you pick it up in the claws the van rocked to a stop in the showroom of emergency vehicles on seventh avenue they jumped out of the van and wheel it out nice and easy because the cable on the robot is only fifty feet long and you can get killed as fast by chunks of robot as you can by ied shrapnel then you go up the ramp and into the containment vehicle and pray that the damn thing goes off in the vessel so you dont have to go inside and pick it up when you get to rodmans neck but also pray that if itdoes go off in the vessel it doesnt have such a high brisance and isnt so big that it turns the containment truck into a huge hand grenade and then you just pray thats if you can use the robot of course assuming the bomb wasnt in some place the bulky crawler looking like a moonlander car couldnt go under a theater seat for instance which is of course where the bomb turned out to be they learned as they deployed at the scene healy looked at his partner jim rubin and nodded ill do a hand entry lets get the suit ill do it you want rubin said and he would have because that was the way they all were if healyd said yeah you take this one rubin wouldve done it but healy didnt the game didnt quite work that way it was who was there first who took the call who said ill go before anybody else any of themwould go it came down to it but healyd claimed this one he didnt know why but he felt it was his you just did that sometimes for the same reason you sometimes didnt say ill go quite as fast as somebody else tonight healy felt about as invincible as anybody picking up a box that could destroy the average house could possible feel sam rune called as she climbed out of the cab he looked at her only for an instant she glanced at his eyes and fell silent he understood that she was looking at someone she didnt know at all he whispered to rubin keep her the hell away cuff her you have to but i dont want her close sam he glanced at her once more she put the camera on the ground which was a message he thought telling him she wasnt here for the movie or because of shelly lowe or for any reason other than that she was worried about him but he still turned away from her as rubin drove the robot out of the vantheyd drive it as far as they couldhealy put on the heavy green bomb suit thick with kevlar panels and steel plates he put the helmet on and started the circulator pump to get air into the helmet rubin stopped just inside the theater doors and drove the robot down the aisle the supervisor had marked with yellow plastic tape he wore a headset and a microphone on the tip of a thin armature that ended in front of his mouth his eyes were distorted behind thick goggles healy walked past him then past the robot he said into the helmets mike how you reading me homes good sam lucky you got the hatthis place fucking stinks healy walked farther into the theater his feet shuffling aside empty crack vials and kleenex wads and liquor bottles talk to me sam talk to me but healy was counting on his fingers the manager had said the bomb was in aisle m was that the fifteenth letter of the alphabet man he hoped not fifteen wasnt a good number for him cheryl had left on the fifteenth of march wasnt that the ides of march his only car crash had been a rearender on the merritt parkwayroute j k l m good m was thethirteenth letter of the alphabet he felt unreasonably cheered at this news okay i see it he said smelling the stale air sweating terribly already feeling breathless cardboard box shoe box lid off he knelt for stabilitythe suit was very heavy if you fell over you sometimes couldnt get up by yourself he leaned over the box said into the radio im looking at c or c maybe six ounces timer face up if its accurate we got ten leisurely minutes dont see any rocker switches rocker switches were the problem little switches that set off the bomb if its moved but not seeing them didnt mean there werent any he probed into the box with a pencil you going to render safe rubin asked no looks like the timers pretty fanqy im betting theres a shunt but i can see the circuitry im not going to cut anything im going to bring it out okay here we go he reached down the gloves were plated but healy knew he was looking at enough plastic to snap a steel beam the theory was that there wasnt much you could do about your hands anyway at least if anything happened youd be alive afterward to retire on disability even if somebody else had to endorse the checks for you healy squintedpointlesslyand lifted the box off the ground you had to be carefulyou tended to think that explosives were going to be heavy as iron weights they werent the whole thing didnt weigh more than a pound no rocker he said to the microphone the smell of his own sweat was strong he breathed slowly or maybe ive got steady hands doing good sam the timer on the clock showed seven minutes until detonation healy backed out into the aisle sliding his feet behind slowly to feel the way he set the box into the arms of the robot this place is gross healy said okay well take over rubin told him healy didnt argue he dropped his hands to his side and walked backward until he felt rubin tap him on the shoulder rubin drove the robot out of the theater and up the ramp to the containment chamber which fellow bomb squad officers had driven up from the garage connected to the th precinct it looked like a small diving bell on a platform he gingerly manipulated the remote controls to get the box inside the robot backed away and healy approached the open door from the side he pulled a wire to close the door most of the way then quickly stepped in front and spun the lever he stepped back rubin helped him out of the suit whatsa time rubin asked i make it about a minute to go rune broke through the police line and ran up to healy she squeezed his arm he pushed her around behind him sam are you all right shh listen i shhhh healy said suddenly a loud pingit sounded like a hammer on a muffled bell smoke and fumes began to hiss out of the side of the changer a sour teargassy smell filled the air c healy said id know that smell anywhere what happened rune asked it just exploded you mean that thing you were bringing out it just blew up oh sam you could have been killed for some reason rubin was laughing at that healy himself was fighting down a grin he looked at her im going to be here for a while sure i understand she didnt like the glazed wild look on his face it scared her ill call you tomorrow he turned and began speaking to a man in a dark suit she started back to the sidewalk and then glanced at the tailgate of the bomb squad station wagon sam healys briefcase was resting on it she wasnt exactly sure why she did it maybe because hed scared her looking the way he did maybe because shed spent the day setting up little squares of plastic and enduring smallminded people maybe because it was just in her nature never to give up a questjust like it was in sam healys to go into buildings like this and find bombs in any case rune quickly flipped open healys briefcase and examined the contents until she found his small notebook this she thumbed through until she found what she was looking for she memorized a name and address she glanced toward healy standing in a cluster of other officers no one noticed her their attention was on a clear plastic envelope healy held a moment later runes voice theatrical and low filled the theater the third angel blew his trumpet and a great star fell from heaven blazing like a torch and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the fountains of water chapter seventeen look ill talk to you but you cant use my name they sat on the deck of runes houseboat that night drinking michelob light the skinny young man continued i mean my mother thinks i was in a car crash if she ever found out warren hathaway was the witness whose name shed found in sam healys notebook hed been in the velvet venus theater when the first bomb blew rune had called him and asked if she could interview him im the only person in the world who got blown up my first time in a porno theater then he caught her amused look well okay maybe not my first but i dont go all that often hathaway was about five six early thirties pudgy he had bandages on his neck and his arm was taped he spoke loudly toojust like rune after shed witnessed the bombingand she guessed the explosion in the velvet venus had temporarily deafened him how did you find me the policeman who interviewed you detective healy i got your name from him the camera was set up hathaway looked at it uneasily you can mask my face out cant you so nobodyll recognize me sure dont worry she started the camera just tell me what you remember okay i was doing an audit at a publishing company on fortyseventh im an accountant and financial advisor and what happened was i had a couple hours off and i walked to eighth avenue to this deli id seen they had greatlooking fruit cupsthey seemed nice and fresh you know lots of watermelonand there was this theater right in front of me and i thought hell why not he took a sip of the beer so i walked in what was your impression filthy first of all it smelled like you know urine and disinfectant and there were these toughlooking guys they were well black mostly and they looked me over like i was i dont know dessert so i hurried down to a seat there were about ten people in the whole place is all and some of them were asleep i sat down the picture was awful it wasnt a movie at all but this videotape you could hardly see anything it was so fuzzy after a while i decided to leave i stood up there was a big flash and this incredible roar and the next thing i know im in the hospital and i cant hear how long were you in the theater total maybe a half hour did you get much of a look at the other people in there sure i was looking around you know to make sure i didnt get mugged there were some folks there some dockworker sorts and transvestitesyou know prostitutes he looked away from both rune and the camera rune nodded sympathetically and it crossed her mind that warren hathaway might know more about transvestite prostitutes than he wanted to admit did you maybe see somebody in a red windbreaker hathaway thought for a moment well there was somebody in a red jacket i think and a hat with a wide brim yeah it looked funny he moved kind of slow i got the impression he was older older rune wondered she asked he was leaving the theater maybe i couldnt swear to it any idea how old sorry couldnt say could you describe him at all hathaway shook his head sorry i wasnt paying attention whatre you exactly a newspaper reporter im doing a film about that girl who was killed in the second bombing shelly lowe a motorboat went past and they both watched it hathaway asked but she wasnt in a movie theater was she no it was in a studio that made adult films its terrible what people do to make a point isnt it that they feel lives are less important than politics or a statement his voice faded and hathaway smiled then said i get too serious my mother tells me all the time i get too serious i should loosen up imagine your mother telling you that mine sure doesnt he looked at the camera so youre going to be a film maker squinted in curiosity you have any idea what the average roi is in that industry roi return on investment accountants might have been as bad as cops when it came to initials rune said i sort of do the creative part and leave the money stuff to other people whats the market for a film like yours and she told him about the independent circuit and art film houses and public tv and the new but growing cable tv market and it wouldnt be a large investment hathaway considered for films like this you can probably control costs pretty easily indirect overhead would probably be pretty low i mean look at fixed assets virtually nonexistent in your case you can lease equipment wouldnt have to amortize much only the more expensive items if you were smart the netnet could be great hathaway gazed off into the evening sky seeing a huge balance sheet in the stars if youve got a success youre looking at pretty much pure profit they finished their beers and rune got up to get more she shut the camera off he said i wasnt much help was i an older man in a red windbreaker no you were real helpful rune said as she returned with the beers she felt his eyes on her and she knew the question was coming she didnt know exactly what form it would take but as a single woman in new york shed have bet a thousand dollars that hathaway was about to ask her the question he took a sip of beer and asked so hey you want to get a pizza or something the pizza version of the question a pretty common one im really beat tonight which was one of the classic answers but she added i really am exhausted but how bout a rain check he smiled a little bashfully which she liked got it you uh going with anybody she thought for a moment then said i have absolutely no idea he stood up shook her hand like the gentleman his mother had probably always instructed him to be he said im going to check out some numbers about documentary films he considered something and smiled you know even if its a flop hell youve got a great tax writeoff im not much help im afraid nicole dorleans said to rune the next morning somebody wearing a red windbreaker or jacket anybody at all wearing a hat like a cowboy hat maybe hanging around the set maybe a fan of shellys or something maybe somebody she knew nicole shook her head he attacked me at my loft just after i first interviewed shelly then i saw him just after shelly was killed outside lame duck and i talked to a witness in the first bombing he thinks he saw him leaving the theater just before the bomb went off he could be young or old you have any idea sorry i the front buzzer rang and nicole went to answer the door she returned with tommy savorne shellys former boyfriend the first thing rune noticed was a belt buckle in the shape of texas she thought of sam healy who still hadnt called no dont think about him now tommy absently polished the buckle with his thumb the metal tongue went right through dallas hey he smiled he squinted meaning sorry ive forgotten your name she stuck her hand out and as they shook she said rune right sure hows your film coming slow but moving along then he said to nicole youre looking pretty good today there was silence for a moment odd woman out rune stood up i better be going im late for work naw stay stay tommy said i only stopped by for a minute i wanted to ask nicole something but maybe youre interested too rune want a job i better not take on another one im not doing too well with the one ive got rune said like doing what nicole asked tommy im doing a tape on how to make vegetarian appetizers i need a chef rune shook her head unless they come in a boilpouch youre talking to the wrong person i dont know nicole said would i have to you know talk not on camera all youve got to do is mix up stuff garlic and avocado and sprouts and peanut butter well not all together i mean theyre great recipes come on honey itll be a snap its for one of my infomercials she said youre sure i wouldnt have to like memorize dialogue tommy said naw its all voiceover you just make the food then we record the vocal track after do as many takes as you want nicole looked at rune youre sure you dont want to tommy said to her i really could use two full plate right at the moment nicole asked and id get paid oh sure we arent talking union but the clientll cough up a hundred bucks an hour for talent should be about three hours tops with the prep time and any reshoots what about my fingernails she held them upan inchlong and glossy burntumber come on he chided grinning youre looking for excuses go for it nicole rune encouraged a smile spread across her glossy lips a movie with my clothes on my mothers been after me for years to try that she shoved her hand with its lethal nails toward tommy deal she said and they shook as if theyd just signed a milliondollar contract tomorrow night he said and the next day well sure as long as its at night im shooting in the day wheres your studio i dont rent studios its all location we can do it right here youve got a great kitchen he looked at rune come on cant we talk you into it some other time all right see you then he said to nicole and kissed her on the cheek he waved to rune and let himself out rune said hes cute hes available he cooks thats a combination you cant beat but nicole was looking off rune said whats the matter nothing what she hesitated then said this job the one tommys doing yeah i hope it works out i hope i dont blow it youll do fine id give anything to get out of the business i thought you liked it nicole walked to the couch and sat down did you watchcurrent events last night that tv program there were these women protesting porn theaters picketing some of the theaters they said some terrible things my name was on the marquee i mean they didnt say anything about me specifically but you could see my name and this lady is like all this porn makes women get raped and children get molested and this other woman goes theyve set back the womens movement twenty years yada yada yada i felt so guilty suddenly she was crying rune debated for a second or two her hand slipped to the trigger of the video camera the lens was pointed directly at nicole looking off nicole said i dont mean to do anything bad i dont want to hurt people but i mean people came to see me and got killed in that theater and maybe after one of my films some guy goes out and picks up a hooker and gets aids thats terrible she looked at rune and the tears were coming steadily now these movies the thing is its all i can do i make love good but im such a failure at anything else ive tried it doesnt work its such a hard feeling to hate the one thing youre good at rune touched nicoles arm but she did so carefully she wanted to make sure her own hand didnt slip into the field of view of the whirring sony the owner of the theater on fortyseventh street between broadway and eighth was a fiftytwoyearold indian immigrant from bombay who had come to this country twelve years earlier he and his wife and children had worked hard at the small businesses hed ownedfirst a newsstand then a fastfood stand then a shoe store in queens hed made a bad investment an electronics store in brooklyn and had lost most of the family nest egg a year ago a friend had told him about a movie theater that was for sale after some introductions and cumbersome negotiations and paying amazing sums to an attorney and an accountant hed bought out the lease and acquired the fixtures and what the lawyer called the theaters goodwill an asset he was completely unable to comprehend the diminutive man became the owner of the pink pussycatan eighthundredseat movie theater in times square although at one time the theater used typical industrystandard mm dual projectors all the movies were presently shown via a video projector which was never quite in focus and gave the actors and actresses auras like fuzzy rainbows he had experimented with pricing finding that the most he could charge during the day was although after ten pm the price went up to since the theater which was open twentyfour hours doubled as an impromptu hotel for the homeless he found that men were willing to cough up the extra two dollars so they could sleep to the earthy lullaby ofsex kittens or lust at first bite there were no tickets patrons paid their money refused the offered penny change and were clicked through a turnstile they walked into the theater proper past a soda machine that had stopped working in there was some cruising despite warning signs about illegality and aids but liaisons were discreet and the transvestites and the mostly black and hispanic female hookers who picked up twenty bucks for their halfhearted services would usually take their clients up to the balcony where even the vice cops didnt like to go despite the unpleasant conditions the theater did make money rent was the highest expense the owner and his wife and an occasional cousin from the huge inventory of relatives overseas took turns in the box office thus keeping salary expenses down and because of the video system they didnt need a union projectionist the owner also bypassed the largest expenses of movie theaters under the copyright laws he was supposed to pay license fees for each theatrical showing of a filmyes even porn this however he didnt do he would buy three vhs cassettes for each from an adult bookstore on eighth avenue show the films for one week then return them the owner of the store who happened to be a pakistani immigrant gave him a fivedollar credit for each film and then resold them for the full this was of course a violation of federal law both civil and criminal but neither the fbi nor the producers of the films had much inclination to go after a small business like his when the man considered the type of films that his theater showed he was not particularly proud but he wasnt much ashamed either thekama sutra after all had been written in his native country and personally he was no stranger to sex hed come from a family of twelve children and he and his wife had seven no his major embarrassment about the business was the low profit margin of the theater he would have been much happier if his return on investment had been five or six percent higher today the owner was sitting in the ticket booth smoking and thinking of the lamb kurma that his wife would be making in their queens apartment for dinner he heard angry words coming from the theater that was one thing that scared himhis patrons there were a lot of crack smokers a lot of men working on their third or fourth fosters these were big men and could have broken his neck before they even thought about it he called the cops occasionally but hed gotten their message unless somebody had a knife or a gun the police didnt want to be bothered now when the dispute didnt seem to be vanishing he rummaged under the ticket booth and found a footlong pipe capped at both ends and filled with bbs a homemade cudgel he walked into the theater the blonde on the screen was saying something about there being one kind of love she hadnt tried and would the actor please accommodate her he seemed agreeable but no one could tell exactly what he was saying to the woman the voices from the front row were louder the fuck you think youre doing smine man fuck that shit i lef it here an fuck that wha you mean you lef it man you sitting three seats over maybe four man i seen it the owner said you must be quiet what is it i call police you dont sit down there were two of them both black one was homeless wearing layers of tattered clothes matted with dirt the other was in a brown deliverymans uniform he was holding a paperwrapped box about the size of a shoe box they looked at the indianthey both towered over himand pled their cases as if he were a judge the homeless man said he be stealing mah package i lef it i wenta take a leak and fuck man he dint leave no box i seen some guy come in watcha movie for ten minutes and leave it was there when he left man i seen it he left it and its mine thats the law the homeless man grabbed for the box a shoe box the deliverymans long arms kept it out of reach get the fuck outa here the owner said somebody leave it hell be back give it to me who was it left it the deliveryman said howm i supposed to know who the fuck he was some white guy i found it swhat the law say man i find it i get to keep it the owner reached out no no give it to me the homeless man said i said i lef it give it they were in that pose all three sets of arms extended and gesturing angrily when the fourteen ounces of c plastic explosive inside the box detonated exploding outward at a speed of almost three thousand miles an hour the bomb instantly turned the men into fragments weighing no more than several pounds the theater screen vanished the first four rows of seats shredded into splinters and shrapnel the floor rocked with a thud that was felt a mile away mixed with the roar of the explosion was the whistle of wood and metal splinters firing through the air as fast as bullets then almost as quickly silence returned accompanied by darkness filled with smoke no lightbulbs remained in the theater but from the ceiling came a tiny green light swinging back and forth it was an indicator light on the videotape player a large black box dangling from a thick wire where the projection booth had been it blinked out and a second light a yellow one flickered on indicating thatcaught from behind part iii had finished and highschool cheerleaders was now playing chapter eighteen detective sam healy lying on his couch was thinking about the women hed had in his life there hadnt been a lot a couple of typical college romances then hed lived with one woman before he met cheryl and had one affair just before theyd gotten engaged a little flirtation after hed been marrieda few drinks was alland only after cheryl had mentioned for probably the hundredth time what a nice sensitive man the contractor doing the addition to the bedroom was though cheryl hadnt been unfaithful he was sure about that in a way he wished that she had been that wouldve given him an excuse to do a john wayne number kick in the door slap her around and in the aftermath give them a chance to pour out their hearts and express their fiery love for each other nowadays that wouldnt work think aboutthe quiet man maureen oharad call the cops the minute john wayne touched her and hed be booked on seconddegree assault firstdegree menacing times were different now ah cheryl he stopped the vcr when he realized he hadnt been watching the tape for the past ten minutes the problem was that lusty cousins was just plain and simple boring he found the other remote controlthe one for the tvand turned on the ball game time for lunch he walked into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator he took out one of the thirtysix rolling rocks it contained and popped it on a piece of arnolds whole wheat bread he laid four slices of kraft american cheese four of the hundred and twentyeight and added mayonnaise from a quart jar then topped it with another slice of bread sam healy had been groceryshopping that morning he walked back to the living room he gazed out the window at quiet queens silhouettes showed on window shades in the houses across the street seeing them depressed him he couldnt concentrate on the game either the mets were having less luck than both of the lusty cousins he looked at the cover to the cassette of the film and decided he didnt like adult films in the first place they were as interesting as watching a film about someone eating a steak dinner he also didnt like the weird slutty makeup and lingerie contraptions the actresses wore they looked prosthetic and artificial the fingerless lace gloves the garters the black leather bras the orange fishnet stockings and he didnt like silicone boobs he liked women like cheryl he liked women like rune were they similar he didnt think so why would he be so interested in both of them he liked innocence he liked pretty but how innocent was rune shed loaned him lusty cousins and what was the message for him there but whatever he liked sam healy didnt think he had any business being involved with somebody like rune when hed seen her the other night hed promised to call her but each of the dozen times hed thought about picking up the phone hed resisted it seemed like the better thing to do the more stoic and safer for him it was ridiculous the weird clothes she wore the three wristwatches she only had one name and it was fake of course like a stage name on top of that she was probably fifteen years younger than he was oh nothat damn number fifteen again no business at all add to that she was playing detective which really upset him good citizens wound up to the excitement of police work by the cotton candy of tv often tried to play cop and ended up getting themselves or someone close to them killed in the process so why was he thinking about rune so much why was he seeing her because he wanted to make cheryl the soontobe exwife who dated regularly jealous because she was sexy because he liked younger women because he the phone rang he answered it lo sam it was the th precincts ops coordinator the second in command at the station brad whats up we got another one sword of jesus yep fortyseventh near eighth blew just a while ago christ they were coming more quickly now only a day apart on these how bad nobody outside the theater but inside its a fucking mess mo the same seems to be you get on it get on it big healy hesitated didnt feel like he wanted to mince words i thought you wanted lowprofile there was a second of silence the ops coordinator hadnt anticipated that question its kind of what it is its kind of embarrassing now embarrassing you know we need a perp in custody thats from the mayor you got it healy said any witnesses the response was a bitter laugh parts of em yeah those pricks mustve used a pound of plastic this time sam healy hung up the phone and pulled his bluejean jacket on he was all the way out to the elevator when he remembered his pistol he went back and got it and had to wait three long minutes for the elevator the door opened he got in he looked at his watch at least the timing was right rune would be at work and wouldnt hear about the bombing until later hed have time to finish the postblast and seal the site before she found out it was one problem hed never had with a girlfriend before intruding at a crime scene rune sitting on the subway thought about men older men younger men her most recent boyfriend richard had been close to her age just a few years older tall skinny with that narrow dark french face that you found everywhere in straight and gay new york city shed leave him alone in bars to go to the john and come back and find bartenderettes leaning forward dreamily pouring him free drinks they were together about six months shed enjoyed the time but toward the end she knew it wasnt going to work hed gotten tired of her ideas for dates picnicking next to the huge air conditioner vents on the roof of a midtown office building playing with the dobermans in her favorite queens junkyard wandering through the city looking for the sites of famous gangland rubouts they talked about getting married but neither of them was real serious about it richard had said the thing is i think im changing im not into weird anymore and youre becoming weirder no it isnt that i think id say youre becoming more you which she took as a compliment but they still broke up not long afterward they still talked some on the phone had a beer now and then she wished him well though shed also decided that if he married the tall blonde advertising account executive hed been dating their wedding present was going to be the fourfoot stuffed iguana shed seen in a resale shop on bleecker street young old but naw it isnt the age its the state of mind her mother had told herduring one of the womans pretty much incoherent factsoflife lectures that ran from ages twelve to eighteenthat there was only one thing that older men would want from her runes experience though was that it was pretty muchall men who wanted that one thing and older men were a lot safer because you usually could stay up later than them and if worse came to worst you usually could scare them into submission by talking about your recent twentyyearold lover who kept you up all night with sexual acrobatics not that she was inclined to scare off healy hell she thought he was totally sexy she just wished hed hurry up and get the preliminary pass over with then get down to some serious moves maybe it was out of line loaning him lusty cousins there was a lot of gentleman in him though and she wanted to see what was underneath that but what do you do with a sexy gentleman who doesnt call you the train pulled into the station and she got off climbed the steep stairs and began walking west wondering if there was maybe something weird or freudian about what she felt for him father image something like that that oedipus thing okay he was older okay he was a cop okay her mother would shit a brick when she heard still at a deli she bought a chocolate milk and a package of oreoslunchthen walked up the street a half block and sat on a fire hydrant sipping the milk out of the carton through a bent straw healys wife she reflected that was probably the problem why he hadnt called he was attracted to runeoh she could tell thatbut he was still in love with this wife that was a weird thing about men love was like a business to them they get it into their heads that they invest so much time in somebody its like a total bummer to give it up too fast the wife what was her name cheryl shed be a bitch of course shed eat him alive oh already the shifty lawyers were working on gouging him for alimony while she dressed up in silky oriental dresses and had affairs she neglected adam locked him in the basement while she had sex with her lovers on the recroom floor vampire vampire he should dump her fast the last of the milk was slurping through the straw when she saw the station wagon turn the corner and cruise past slowing down it stopped fast and screeched backward stopping quickly in front of her the engine idled for a moment then went silent sam healy got out he looked at rune then at the smoldering front of the pink pussycat then back to rune she picked up the video camera and walked over to him how he began rune held up a small black box these guys are great police radio receiver reporters use them to get the scoop i heard the call code tenthirtythree the smile began low and wouldnt stay down you shouldnt be here but im getting tired of telling you that so i dont think i will sorry to hear about the trouble at home he frowned shook his head what trouble about your phone breaking so you couldnt make calls maybe he was blushing but if so he didnt look embarrassed im sorry i should have no excuses she liked that id be mad she said except you actually look kind of glad to see me maybe i am a voice called from beside the shattered box office hey sam they turned rune was glad to see it wasnt brown suit a uniformed cop waved lazily he shouted the battalion commander says its okay to go in weve rigged lights for you not much to see though can i rune asked healy kept his face on the front of the building please he said you get hurt in there i could lose my job i wont get hurt im tough i bounce his lips twisted slightly sam healys concession to a sigh and he nodded his head in a way that might have meant anything but that rune knew meant shut up and get your ass inside no taping aw no okay you win together for an hour they sifted through the debris rune kept running to healy every few minutes with bits of metal and wire and screws in her hand and hed explain they were chair hardware or wires from the wall or the plumbing but theyre all burnt i thought everythings burnt thats true she said and went back to sifting healys own pile of significant junk which is how rune thought of it was growing nestling in a stack of plastic bags under the exit sign zip is what ive got zip no note this time rune pointed out he said the mos the same as the first modus operandi rune said the bomb was c timed detonator you know these last two bombs dont help your theory about someone covering up shellys murder nobodys going to keep bombing just to cover up a crime sure they are if theyre smart theyd both begun to cough the fumes were thick healy motioned her to follow him outside as they stepped into the air breathing deeply rune looked up at the crowd she saw a flash of color red it looked like a red jacket look its him she couldnt see his face but it seemed that he saw her the man turned and disappeared east down fortyseventh im going after him rune healy called but she ducked under the yellow tape and ran through the mass of spectators pressing forward to get a look at the disaster by the time she broke through them though he was two blocks away still she could see that hat she started across broadway but the light was against her and she couldnt get through the trafficthere were small gaps between cars but the drivers were accelerating fast and she couldnt squeeze through no one let her by it was as frustrating as a toothache the man in the red windbreaker stopped looked back resting against a building he seemed winded then he crossed the street and vanished into a crowd of pedestrians rune noticed that he was walking stifflyand rune remembered warren hathaways observation that the man who planted the bomb seemed to be older she returned to healy panting it was him the guy in the jacket she nodded healy seemed somewhat skeptical and she thought about telling him that hathaway had confirmed that hed been in the velvet venus but that would involve a confession about rifling healys attache case and she wasnt prepared for what the fallout fromthat might be he was debating he walked to a uniformed cop and whispered something to him the cop trotted off toward his cruiser hit the lights and drove off healy returned to rune he said go on home sam home tightlipped she looked at him making him seetryingto make him seethat goddamn it this really wasnt a game to her not at all he must have seen some of this he breathed out a sigh and looked around for an invisible audience like the kind danny traub carried around with him healy said all right come on he turned and walked quickly back inside the theater rune trotting to keep up with him suddenly he stopped and turned he spoke as if the words were lines in a high school play and he was an actor of nicoles ability i know i didnt call like i said i would and you dont have to if you dont want to but i was thinking tomorrow nightits my day offmaybe we could go out what a place to ask her out on a date a bombedout porno theater she didnt give him time to be embarrassed about his delivery she smiled and said ah graciously accept yo chahming invitation nahn shall we say he stared at her totally lost rune said nine oh sure good and smiling while he tried not to he walked back into the theater banging a plastic evidence bag against his leg chapter nineteen rune spent the day assembling the reels of exposed footage for the house o leather commercial and stuffed it along with the editing instructions into a big white envelope sam picked her up at l ampr and drove to a postproduction house where the technicians would edit the raw footage into a rough cut rune dropped it off with instructions to deliver cassettes to l ampr and the client as soon as possible even if it meant overtime then she said okay works done time to party lets go to the club and she gave him directions to the west side piers where healy asked dubiously i dont think theres anything there oh youd be surprised she gave him credithe was a sport healy put up with the place for a couple of hours before he managed to shout i dont feel quite at home here how come rune shouted he didnt seem sure maybe it was the decor black foam mounds that looked like lava flashing purple overhead lights a sixfoot plexiglas bubble of an aquarium or the music he asked her if the sound system was broken and she had to tell him that the effect was intentional also he wasnt dressed quite right rune had said casual and so shed dressed in yellow tights a black miniskirt andon top of a purple tank topa black tshirt as holey as jarlsberg sam healy was in blue jeans and a plaid shirt the one thing he shared with most of the other clubbies was a pair of black boots his however were cowboy boots i think i got it wrong he said well you may start a trend maybe not but he wasnt being eyed like a geek either rune noticed two pageboy blonds lifted their sleek faces and fired some serious wanna get laid vibrations his way rune took his arm sunken cheeks like that you see them theyre a sign of mental instability she grinned lets dance some more and began to gyrate in time to the music dancing healy said and mimicked her ten minutes later he said ive got an idea i know that tone youre not having a good time healy wiped his forehead and scalp with a wad of bar napkins anybody ever dehydrate in here thats part of the fun you sure like to dance dancing is the best im free im a bird well if youre really into dancing lets try this place i know youre pretty good doing this stuff rune drank down half of her third amstel as she continued to move in time to the music oh you think this is good try my place i know all the clubs whats this one called youve never heard of it its real exclusive yeah you need a special pass to get in you need to know the password all right lets go the password was howdy and the girl at the door checking ids and stamping hands with a tiny map of texas responded with the countersignhow yall doing tonight they were shown into the clubwhich for having a fourpiece swing band was incredibly quiet or maybe it just seemed that way after the deafening roar of runes place they were seated at a small table with a gingham plastic tablecloth two lone stars healy ordered rune looked at a girl sitting next to them a tight white sweater a blue denim skirt stockings and white cowboy boots very very weird she said you hungry you mean thiss a restaurant too what you get to pick your own cow out of the pen in the back the ribs are great very weird i liked that other place he said but i kind of have to watch the noise pointing to his ears she remembered that bomb blasts had affected his hearing they drank the beers and were still thirsty so they ordered a pitcher you come here much rune asked used to with your wife healy didnt answer for a minute some its not like it was a special place for us you still see her at all mostly just when i pick up adam mostly she noticed healy continued therere books she left she comes by to pick up kitchen things stuff like that i never asked you if youre going with anybody rune said im sort of between boyfriends really im surprised yeah its not as unbelievable as some things like talking dogs or aliens id think youd have them lined up men have these strange feelings about me mostly they ignore me the ones who dont ignore me a lot of them just want sex and then the chance to ignore me afterward sometimes they want to adopt me you see people in laundromats saturday night doing their underwear and reading twoweekoldpeople magazines thats me from what ive learned during the rinse cycle i could write a biography of cher or vanna white or tom cruise lets dance he said rune frowned and looked out over the dance floor healy said its called the twostep best dance in the world let me get this straight she said you hold on to each other and you dance at the same time healy smiled its a whole new idea tommy savorne pressed the buzzer of nicole dorleanss apartment and thought of how strange it was going to be to see her standing there and not shelly he had triedoften latelyto remember the first time he saw shelly he couldnt that was another odd thing he had a good memory and there didnt seem to be any reason why he shouldnt remember shelly shed been a person you could picture clearly maybe it was the poses she struck she was neverwhat was the wordrandom about anything she did she was never careless in the way she stood or sat or spoke or in what she decided to do he had recent images shelly on asilomar beach in pacific grove or at point lobos on the bluffs where the park rangers were always telling you to stay away from the edge man he could picture her clearly there he pictured her in bed but the first time they met no he couldnt see that at all hed tried a lot lately nicole opened the door hey there she said hi babe he took off his cowboy hat kissed her cheek and hugged her and felt that wonderful presence of a voluptuous woman against your body she looked good a pale blue silk dress with a high neckline high heels hair teased up and back the makeupwell she was a little overtheline there but he could tone it down with some gels on the lights he picked up his camera bags and carried them inside he noticed her dangling zirconia earrings they were pretty but hed get lens flare off of them theyd have to go you look nice he said thanks come on in you want a drink sure juice mineral water so youve like completely stopped drinking yep he said good for you you mind if i oh god no go right ahead nicole poured two orange juices added vodka to hers the bottle vibrated slightly in her hand as she poured he smiled what you nervous a little i guess isnt that weird i do a sex film and no big deal im on camera with my clothes on and i get butterflies in my tummy ah itll be a piece of cake they clinked glasses to your new career she sipped the drink then set the glass down her eyes swiveled shed been thinking about something it seemed she decided to say it if this works out tommy you think therell maybe be others i could do tommy drank down half the juice i dont see why not then i ought to start getting set up can you show me the kitchen she led him into the large tiled room it was chrome and white in the center of the ceiling was a large steel rack hanging from chains dozens of heavy copper pans and bowls hung from it thisll work just fine we had it redone last year he looked over the room we can use those pans copper looks good on camera together they began assembling the camera and lights nicole asked was it hard for you to you know get out of the business out of porn yeah financially it was a pain what i did was assist at some film companies for a while like what runes doing rune oh that girl yeah like her and eventually i started getting some jobs as a cameraman then i directed some documentaries id like to act i keep thinking i could take lessons i mean how hard can it be shelly had a good coach arthur tucker she said he helped her a lot i dont know why he hasnt been around he didnt go to the memorial service i thought he wouldve called the coach yeah i dont know tommy said when somebody dies it makes people feel funny they cant deal with it he turned to her examined her closely you should act you should be always in front of the camera youre very beautiful their eyes met for a moment a copper bowl paused in nicoles hand she looked away he finished assembling the camera and lights nicole watched him the smooth efficient way he handled the equipment she leaned against the island absently spinning the roundbottomed copper bowl she looked down at its hypnotizing motion i know shelly got some kind of kick out of the porn films she made but all in all i dont see why she didnt give it up because tommy said stepping next to her she was a whore just like you and he brought the long lead pipe down on the back of nicoles head chapter twenty they ended up at her houseboat first after the countrywestern club they were drenched with sweat so they decided itd make sense to go for a walk then a cool night breeze came up as they were walking in the west village and that made healy suggest coffee nearby and they went to a cappuccino place on hudson street with a fountain where water spit out of a goats head into a trough filled with coins one of the coins was an indian head nickel and rune spent a couple minutes nonchalantly fishing the coin out while healy tried to distract the waitress hmm healy muttered petty larceny and im an accessory she retrieved the coin and then wrung the slimy fountain water out of her sleeve it was in deeper than id thought after that theyd walked another five or six blocks and found themselves not far from her boat i only live three blocks away where he asked in the river he looked at her for the standard five seconds before asking the standard question in the river i have a houseboat i dont believe you nobodys got a houseboat in new york this ive got to see which was a line thatd been tried on her before not that it mattered she was going to invite him home anyway after the tour of the houseboat rune looked for something to offer him beer didnt seem right after coffee and her only bottle of brandy had been capped with foil a year or two ago and a dark residue floated in the bottom sorry she held up the bottle buds fine they stood on the deck looking over at new jersey feeling the nerves in their legs click from all the dancing and feeling tired and energized at the same time she wasnt quite sure what started it she remembered saying something about the stars which you couldnt see very well because of the city lights but they were both looking up and then there was his face filling the sky as it moved toward her and they were kissing pretty serious kissing too she felt the slight prickle of his mustache then his lips and she felt his arms going around her shed expected hed maybe be more cautious like feeling his way along a pipe bomb ready to jump back at any moment but he wasnt that way at all no reluctance no hesitation she guessed maybe she was the first girl hed kissed like this since cheryl had left she knew he wanted her her arms went tight around his neck she maneuvered them into the bedroom a huge stuffed dragon sat in the middle of the bed a monster he said a friendly monster whats his name her name is persephone my apologies rune picked up the dragon and held the mouth up to her ear she forgives you she even likes you for a moment nothing moved neither of them spoke then he knelt on the bed her arms went around him kissing hard pressing hands hungry the dragon was still in between them she considered making a joke about it about something coming between them ha ha but he was kissing her fast urgently rune grabbed the toy and dropped it on the floor when nicole dorleans opened her eyesgasping gulping in air mouth widewhen she came to she was naked her arms were over her head her wrists tied to the ends of the pot and pan rack her feet just touched the ground good he was worried that hed hit her too hard he looked at the knots tied expertly not cutting off circulation but no way could she pull free from the binding no whatre you doing she was crying tommy was wearing a black ski mask he was naked to the waist bending down under her tying her feet the same waywith precision care devotion he tied one ankle to a chromium rack on the bottom of the island noooo a long wail rising at the end she kicked at him with her free foot he dodged away easily why are you doing this tommy why the camcorder was trained on her and was running the camera lights were hot and she was sweating from the heat as well as the fear patiently he bound her other foot he was irritated though that there was nothing to tie it to he had to wrap it around a cabinet hinge doesnt look right he stepped back and adjusted the camera upward to avoid shooting the clumsy jerryrigged job what are you going to do he had his hands on his hips with his chest naked his tight blue jeans the mask he was a medieval executioner what do you want she squealed leave me alone it often got him how stupid some people were what did he want it was pretty fucking obvious to him he told her just making a film honey just what you do all day long only theres one difference you tease this is for real this films going to show your soul youre her voice was soft shook with sickening terror this is a snuff film isnt it oh god he pulled more rope out of his bag he paused for a moment studying her nicole began to scream tommy took an s amp m gaga lather strap with a red ball attached to itand shoved it into her mouth he tied it tight behind her head they sell so much garbage you know leather panties face masks jockstraps out of latex you ask me its too complicated i go for the simple stuff myself you got to get it just right its sort of a ritual you do it wrong they dont pay this customer of mineim making twentyfive thousand for this by the wayhe likes the knots to be just right theyre very important the knots one time this guy wanted redheads only man thats not easy so i cruised two three days along highway finally found this student from some community college get her into this shack and made the film i thought it was pretty good but the customer was pissed know why she wasnt a natural redhead her pussy hair was black i only got five thousand and whatm i gonna do sue he finished the elaborate knotting then rummaged through his bag he found a whip a leather handle with a dozen leather strips hanging from it he took a long pull of vodka from the bottle he checked the time the customer was paying for a twohour tape tommyd make it last for two hours he believed in the adage that the customer is always right chapter twentyone sam healy and rune lay in bed watching the lights on the ceiling reflecting off the hudson river healy was feeling pretty good he wanted to say not bad for an old guy or something like that but he was remembering about times like thisand that was one thing he remembered clearly you didnt talk about yourself now for this moment maybeonly for this moment there were two of them and that was all that mattered he could talk about her or about both of them but then he remembered something else sometimes its best not to say anything at all rune was curled against him twirling his chest hair into piggy tails ouch he said do you think people live happily ever after no she didnt react to that and he continued i think its like a cycle you know happy sometimes unhappy others she said i think they can a tug went by healy pulled the sheet over him they cant see in she pulled the sheet down and kept twisting hair why do you disarm bombs im good at it she grinned and rubbed her head against his chest youre good at other things too but i hope not professionally there she was talking abouthim that was okay it sets you apart not many people want to disarm bombs ieds rune corrected whyd you become a cop in the first place gotta make a living doing something rune disappeared for a moment and came back with two beers the icy condensation dripped on him hey she kissed him he said you want a present i like herkimer crystals and blue topaz gold is always good silver if its thick how about information rune sat up you found a suspect in a red windbreaker nope you found fingerprints on one of the angel letters nope but i did find out something about the explosives in the second bombing and youre going to tell me yep why she asked smiling he didnt know but at least this was somethinghe was saying abouther and it seemed to make her happy because what about them she asked they were stolen from a military base a place called fort ord in monterey whoever did it got away with california rune asked sitting up pulling the sheet off healy and around herself right she was frowning monterey is where shelly and tommy used to live who tommy savorne her old boyfriend he still lives there healy tugged back more of the covers so well its just kind of a coincidence doesnt it seem the explosives were stolen over a year ago i guess rune lay back down a moment later she said hes in town you know tommy she nodded hes been in town since before the first bombing a tug hooted one of the trump helicopters cruised low making its run from atlantic city rune and healy looked at each other healy stood at the pay phone across from the dock while rune tugged at his arm he might have been in nam hes about that age hed know how to shhh healy motioned at rune then began speaking into the phone officer twofivefive on a landline patch me into ops coordinator at the sixth roger twofivefive hes in the field give me your number well have him call back on landline negative central this is urgent i need that coordinator now a long pause then static then a voice saying hey sam its brad whasshappenin i may have a suspect in the porn bombings check catch national crime database and army cid tell me what you got on a thomas or tommy savorne ill wait spelled healy looked at rune spelled she shrugged guess two minutes later the ops coordinator came back on the line got yourself a bad boy homes thomas a savorne private first class lka fort ord in california present whereabouts unknown dishonorably discharged a year and a half ago as part of plea bargain with jas office for an agreement to drop courtmartial proceedings the charge was theft of government property a codefendant was courtmartialed and served eleven months on one count of theft and one count of weapons possession sam the codefendant still lives out there and is believed to be dealing in arms fbi hasnt been able to nail him yet damn whatd savorne do in service engineer so he knows demolition something about it id guess healy spun to rune where is he you have any idea no and then she remembered oh jesus samhe was going over to shellys friends place tonight maybe hes going to hurt her too she gave him nicoles name and address okay brad listen up healy said got a possible tenthirty in progress onefourfive west fiftyseventh apartment he looked at rune who said i dont remember her last names dorleans healy repeated the name subject probably armed maybe with plastic and it looks like a possible hostage situation ill get esu rolling one other thing the guys probably emotionally disturbed oh some kind of fucking wonderful sam an edp with plastic and a hostage ill doyou a favor someday tenfour twofivefive out rune was getting her arguments readyto talk him into letting her come with him but there was no problem with that healy said come on lets hustle ill get a squad car at the sixth west fiftyseventh street was lit up likea carnival flashing lights blueandwhite cars and emergency service unit trucks parked in the street the big bomb squad truck with its tcv chamber on a trailer was parked near the canopied entrance but there wasnt much of a sense of urgency two of the esu guys holding those black machine gunslike they used in vietnamleaned against the doorway smoking their hats were on backwards they looked awfully younglike stickball players from the bronx so rune understood theyd gotten here in time theyd moved fast and caught tommy it was all over she looked for nicole what a surprise shed have had the knock the door bursting open cops pointing guns at tommy hed been the one all along the killer how had she read him so wrong how had he looked so innocent the one in the red windbreaker ah the cowboy hat too and the ruddy facenot from a tan at all but from the tear gas jealousy hed killed her out of jealousy healy stopped her as they got close to the building hold up here this isnt for you but he just waved his hand and she stopped he vanished into the building the night was punctuated with radio messages broadcast over the police cars loudspeakers lights whipped around in elliptical orbits rune turned on the camera and opened the aperture to take naturallight shots of the scene of them bringing tommy out motion men appeared she aimed the camera toward the door but he wasnt in handcuffs god theyd shot him tommy was dead on a gurney covered with a bloody sheet she felt her legs weaken as she kept the camera on the door trying hard for a steady shotthe matteroffact attendants wheeling tommys body down from the apartment a grim moving end to the film and shelly lowes murderer died just the same way he had killedviolently it is a fitting epitaph from the biblefitting for someone who concocted religious fanatics to cover up his crimes he who lives by the sword dies by the sword the image through the viewfinder went black as a figure from the crowd walked up to her rune looked up sam healy said softly im sorry sorry we didnt make it in time rune didnt understand you mean to get a confession but rune nodded with her head toward the back of the ambulance tommy was gone when they got here rune thats nicoles body chapter twentytwo another cop stood next to healy he wore a light suit that was mostly polyester and he stood with the tired unrushed posture of a government worker thin humorless his eyelids were heavy from fatigue and boredom heavy from years of interviewing reluctant witnesses from years of kneeling over bodies in their graves of gutters and car seats and sro hotels from seeing what hed witnessed upstairs rune whispered shes dead the other cop was answering but to healy dcds what rune asked healy said deceased confirmed dead at scene deceased the cop kept speaking to healy as though rune werent there she thought maybe healy had introduced her to this somber man she wasnt sure she thought shed heard a name but all she remembered was homicide looks like torture strangulation then mutilation there was some dismemberment he shook his head and finally showed some emotion what that goddamn business does to people porn like any other addiction keep having to go for more and more to get a high then homicide turned to rune could you tell us what you know miss a rambling explanation she did her best and the mans narrow fingers wrote quickly in a small dimestore notebook but she stopped quite a bit and had to throw in a lot of uhs and no waits she thought she knew the story of nicole dorleans better than this but a distraction kept intruding it was an image of nicole there was somedismemberment she told him about her film how shed known shelly about the film company then about how tommy had been in love with shelly and shed dumped him and moved to new york and how hed been a demolition expert and had stolen explosives from the armyhealy had broken in here with details and how he must have been so furious at shelly for leaving him and so crazy that he had contrived the idea of the sword of jesus and the bombings to cover up his murder hed probably figured shelly and nicole were lovers and picked her to ritually murderagain from jealousy rune finished the story and gave him a description of tommy the detectives cheap pen danced in blotching ink over the paper he took it all down in sweeping handwriting a man who didnt understand a thing about her documentary about nicole about shelly about the movies they made he wrote without a flicker of emotion on his thin gray inflexible face he wrote down her answers then looked around homicide waved to a scrawny hispaniclooking wreck of a man wearing a blue headband to keep his black curls at bay healy asked acu he was working the crowd didnt know we had a positive suspect ill send him back with a description homicide nodded to rune he walked to the acu man and they began talking their heads bent toward the ground neither looked in the others eyes as they spoke hes a cop rune asked staring at him hes anticrime unit undercover todays acu color is bluesee his headband they wear that so we know hes one of us after a murder they go into the crowd and eavesdrop ask questions now that we know the suspects id though hell just show his shield and interview them yo bus is coming through a voice shouted the ems ambulance eased forward healy stepped aside rune shouldered the sony and taped the boxy orangeandblue truck as it wound through the crowd carrying nicoles body to the morgue healy walked with her to the corner she leaned against an express mailbox and squeezed her eyes shut we were talking together tommy and me i was two feet away from him as close as you and me a man like that a killer and he seemed so normal healy was silent looking back at the revolving lights though he wasnt as calm as homicide had been not at all hed seen her nicole and it shook him it occurred to rune that one of the advantages of bomb detail was that you dealt with machines and chemicals more than people in a soft voice rune said i was supposed to be there tonight he wanted me to come too you he said he was making a film a legitimate film christ sam why did he do it i just dont understand guy blows up a dozen people just to cover up killing his girlfriend then slaughters somebody like that i dont have any answers for what makes him tick when did he leave do they think there was no postmortem lividity no rigor mortis probably twenty minutes a half hour before we got here so hes still in town doubt it people know him people can place them together my bet is he got a car andll drive to some small airport then grab a connecting flight to california hartford albany white plains youve got to call them get a description we cant lock up every airport in the northeast rune theyve got a citywide out on him now but hell probably make it out of the area theyll get him when he gets homewhere is it monterey the mpsll be after him too and theft of government property and interstate flightll bring in the fbi oh sam she pressed her head against his chest he held her which made her feel good but what made her feel even better was that they were standing in front of a half dozen of the guys he worked with and he was still hugging her not glancing around or making it look like she was just an upset witness he held her tight and she felt some of the horror shift away to him and she let it go he knew what to do he could dispose of it that was his job they walked south into the theater district then through the geometric shapes of cold neon in times square down broadway past a wolf pack of four black kids wearing throwaways with round heads and shavercut streaks in their hair looking innocent and sour past businessmen and businesswomen in running shoes past hawkers past a couplegerman or scandinavian touristsdressed in nylon running suits carrying nikons their heads covered with stringy blond hair looked around them their expressions asking this is new york past the billboards on which the fiftyfoot models reclining sexily sold liquor and jeans and vcrs past a porn theater that gave off the smell of lysol maybe shelly or nicole was performing on screen at that moment there was no way of knowing what the movies were the marquee promised only that there were three superhot hits showing you know rune said speaking her first words since theyd started to walk her voice snagged you know that thirtyfourth street used to be the big entertainment strip all the theaters and burlesque shows im talking turn of the century a long time ago i didnt know that times squares pretty recent they walked past a big monument a statue of a woman in wings and robes she gazed down at pigeons and a dozen homeless people who was she a greek or roman goddess rune thought of eurydice then of shelly a captive in the underworld there was no orpheus and his lyre nearby though the only music was from a scratchy rap song on a tinny boom box when they came to the flatiron building they stopped rune said i should go home you want some company she hesitated i dont need i didnt askneed i askedwant rune said your house its small ugly but homey tonight i think i could go for homey ive got to help with some of the paperworkyou want to meet me there ill give you the keys he wrote down the address she took the slip of paper and the keys i oughta go pick up some things at my place i shouldnt be any longer than an hour or so you all right rune tried to think of something funny and flippant to say something a tough lady newscaster would sling out but she just shook her head and gave him an anemic smile no im not he bent down quickly and kissed her you want a cab i walk i feel better he turned away she said sam he paused but there was nothing at all she could think of to say in the houseboat rune stacked up the tapes shed shot the rough footage forepitaph for a blue movie starand set them on her shelf but put the script for the narration in her bag that was something she could ask sam about tell him to pretend he was in the audience and read it to him but not tonight in the morning that would have to wait till the morning she glanced into her purse and saw the scriptthe one shed stolen from arthur tuckers office she picked it up flipped through it hell shed forgotten all about it and now that he wasnt a suspect she ought to get it back to him mail it anonymously she tossed it on the table and walked into the bedroom to her dresser she packed a skirt tshirt blouse socks underwear no disney characters girl go for the lacy uncomfortable pair she added her toothbrush and makeup and began turning out lights rune paused at the living room window looking out at the lights of the city nicole of the twonicole and shellywasnt nicoles the more tragic death she wondered rune felt sorrier for her shelly because she was smarter more talented an artist was also the risktaker she could choose to walk right to the edge hell shed chosen to date tommy nicole wouldnt appreciate the risks so much she was sweet anddespite her line of workinnocent shed do her nails shed fuck shed dream about opening the shoe store dream about the advertising executive she could marry she the smell rune sensed it suddenly though she understood in that instant that she had been aware of it for a long time ever since shed returned to the houseboat it had a familiarity about it but a scary one like the sweetsick chemical scent that bothers you an instant before you remember its the smell of a dentists office cleanser no cologne maybe perfume runes thoughts began jumping and she didnt like where they arrived incense sandalwood the smell of tommy savornes apartment she thought run or get the tear gas rune turned fast toward the front door but tommy got there first and leaned up against it he was smiling when he locked the latch chapter twentythree she fought him knees elbows palms everything rune remembered about selfdefense from a tape shed watched over and over again because the blackbelt tae kwon do instructor was so cute but she didnt get anywhere tommy was very drunkshe realized why warren hathaway had thought he was older and why hed been so winded as shed chased him from the pink pussycat theater and she was able to dodge away from his groping hands she grabbed a pole lamp and hit him so hard it made the flesh on his arm shake but even though it made him uncoordinated the liquor also anesthetized him and tommy just grunted knocked the pole aside then swiped his forearm across her face she went to the floor hard she tried for the tear gas but he slung her bag across the room bitch he grabbed her by the ponytail and pulled her over to a straightback chair then shoved her down into it and wound brown doorbell wire around her wrists and ankles no she screamed the wire dug into her flesh and hurt terribly he sat back on his heels rocking slowly and studied her his hair was greasy the tiny crevices and cracks in his fingers were stained dark red like chinese crackle pottery his shirt was stained with sweat and his jeans were dark with black shapes that rune knew were nicoles blood he leered at her was she good what do you want was it worth it what are you talking about making love to shelly you were her girlfriend werent you you and nicole both were his eyes were unfocused she slept with nicoleive seen the movies i could see in her face how much she liked it did she like it with you too didyou enjoy it tommy squinted then asked calmly will you think about it while you die i didnt take shelly away from you i hardly knew her i just he opened his bag and took out a long knife there were dark stains on the wooden handle something else was in his hand a videocassette he looked at runes tv set and vcr started them both and after three tries slipped the tape in a crackle then a hum and the screen became a fuzzy blackandwhite he watched the set almost incidentally as he began mumbling reciting a mantra way i see it pornography is art what is art exactly its creation the making of something where there was nothing before and what does pornography show fucking the act of creation he tried to find the fast forward on her vcr but couldnt he turned back to her when i figured that out it was like a revelation a religious experience you write about fucking and its not real but with movies you cant fake it you are watching like the whole act of creation in front of you fucking amazing oh god no rune staring at the screen began to cry watching nicole hanging from the rack nicole twisting futilely away from the swinging whip but with film its so different the artist cant lie no way i mean its all right there youve got the beginning of life right in front of you nicole begging with her eyes maybe screaming through the gag nicole crying tears that sloughed off her makeup in brown and black stripes across her face nicole closing her eyes as tommy walked forward with a knife also religious in the beginning godcreated see created thats a fucking wild coincidence wouldnt you say god and the artist and pornography brings it all together nicole dying rune surrendered to her sobbing savorne watched the tape with sad hungry eyes i really loved shelly he said in his slurred voice when she left me i died i couldnt believe that shed actually gone i didnt know what to do id wake up and there would be the whole day ahead of me without her hours and hours without her ididnt know what to do i was paralyzed at first i hated her then i knew she was sick shed gone crazy and i knew it wasnt all her fault no it was other people too people like nicole people like you people who wanted to seduce her i didnt seduce her runes words didnt register tommy set up his camcorder then he paused im tired im so tired its hard people dont understand how hard it is its like working in a slaughterhouse you know ill bet those guys get tired of it sooner or later but they cant quit theyve got a job to do thats how i feel he switched the lights on the sudden brilliance made rune scream when they die he said softly part of me dies too but nobody understands he looked at her and touched her face rune smelled the metallic scent of blood tommy said when you die part of me will die its what an artist has to go through there was one nighthe seemed to forget his train of thought he sat down his hand on the small camera staring at the floor rune squirmed the wire was thin but it didnt give he finally recalled his thought there was one night we were living in pacific grove then not far from the beach it was a weird night wed been doing okay with the movies making some good money i was directing then we were watching a rough cut shelly and me and what usually happened was she got turned on watching herself and wed have a wild time only this time something was wrong i put my arms around her and she didnt respond she didnt say anything she just looked at me in this eerie way she looked like shed seen her own death it wasnt long after that she left me i spent hours and hours thinking about it seeing her that way the expression on her face he gazed at rune a sincere face intense a man talking about important things and i finally understood about sex and deaththat theyre really the same he was lost in a memory for a moment then he focused on rune almost surprised to see her he dug the vodka bottle out of his bag and took another hit he smiled lets make a movie tommy turned on the camera and focused it at rune the sweat from the heat of the lights ran down from his eye sockets and he made no attempt to wipe it away rune was sobbing he caressed the knife i want to make love to you he stepped forward and rested the blade on runes forearm he pressed it in and cut a short stroke she screamed again another cut shorter he looked at it carefully hed made a cross they like this he explained the customers they like little details like this he lifted the knife to her throat i want to make love to you i want to make love to the first shot was low and wide it took out a lamp tommy was spinning looking around confused panic in his eyes the second was closer it snapped past his head like a bee and vanished through the window somewhere into the dark plain of the hudson the third and fourth caught him in the shoulder and head and he just dropped collapsing slumping from the waist like a huge bag of grain dumped off a truck sam healy breathing hard his service smith amp wesson still pointed at the mans head walked up slowly his gun hand was shaking his face was pale oh sam rune said sobbing sam you all right tommy had fallen against rune his head resting on her foot she was trying to pull away she said panicky through her tears get him away get him off me please get him off healy kicked him over made sure he was dead then began undoing the bell wire god im a lousy shot he was trying to joke but she could hear the quaver in his voice when rune was free she fell against his chest he kept repeating its okay its okay its okay he was going to kill me he was going to tape it what he did to nicole he was going to do that to me healy was speaking into a motorola walkietalkie twofivefive to central go ahead twofivefive i have a dcds on houseboat in the hudson river at christopher send homicide an ems bus and a tour doctor from the mes office roger twofivefive just the dcds you have injuries too healy turned to rune and asked you all right you need a medic but she was staring at tommys body and didnt hear a word he said it was very domestic that was the eerie part rune had wakened at seventhirty shed been having a nightmare but it wasnt about tommy or shelly just some kind of forgettingtostudy nightmare she had those a lot but she relaxed at once seeing sam asleep next to her shed watched him breathing slowly the slight motion of his chest then climbed out of bed and walked into the house pure burbs pure domestic she made coffee and toast and looked at all the beer bottles and cheese slices and junk food in the refrigerator why did he refrigerate fritos no this whole thing didnt seem right she ate junk food sure but he was a man and a policeman it seemed that he ought to eat something more substantial than beer and corn chips in the freezer were tv dinners three stacks each different he must work his way from right to left she figured so he wouldnt have the same thing twice in a row she walked around an ugly yellow kitchen with huge daisies pasted on the refrigerator and pink rubbermaid things all over the placewastebaskets drying racks papertowel holders dish drains pictures of adam were everywhere rune studied it all as she made coffee and burned bread into toast was this what it was like to be a wife probably what it was like to be a cheryl rune wandered through the onestory house as she sipped coffee from a white mug that had cartoons of cows on it one bedroom was a study there were odd gaps in the room where furniture should have been cheryl had done okay it seemed from the looks of what was left shed taken the good stuff in the white shagragged living room she looked at the bookcases popular paperbacks textbooks from school interior design explosive ordnance disposal chemical weapons the claymore mine operations and tactics the last one was pretty battered it was also waterstained and she wondered if hed been reading it in the bathtub improviseddetonation techniques was right next to masteringthe art of french cooking sam healy might be an easy person to fall in love with and have fun with but rune could see itd be tough to be married to him she walked back into the kitchen and sat at the table which was covered with diseased formica and stared out into the backyard nicole nicole suckered in by the glitz and bucks and hot lights the coke god that teased hair the glossy makeup the dangerous fingernails the aerobic thighs a sweet simple girl who had no business doing what she did shelly and nicole the lusty cousins well they were both gone now it seemed awful to rune to stumble into your death like that itd be better to face death headon to meet it even insult it or challenge it some rather than have it grab you by surprise for a moment rune regretted the whole businessher film shelly nicole these porn filmsit was a shitty little business and she hated it not a good attitude dear you want to make documentaries but goddamn it thats how she felt images from last night returned tommys face nicolesworse the redstained sheet the network of blood on tommys hands the heat of the lights the steady terrifying eye of the camera lens aiming at her as tommy walked forward the sound of the bullet hitting his head she felt her hand shaking and a terrible spiraling churn begin deep inside her no no no sam healys sleepy voice called from the other room and broke the spell rune its early come back to bed time to get up i made breakfast she was about to add like a good wife but figured why give cheryl a plug we do the final cut of that house o leather job today the one i told you about ive got to be at work in an hour rune healy called again come here theres something i want to show you i burned toast just for you rune she hesitated then stepped into the bathroom and brushed her hair then sprayed on perfume rune knew a lot about men in the morning chapter twentyfour she didnt intend her life to be violent she certainly didnt intend to die violently but shelly lowe was an addictaddicted to the power that the films she made brought her addicted to that raw urge that perhaps all artists feel to expose herself in every sense to her audiences and just like for all addicts shelly ran the risk that that power would overwhelm her she understood that risk and she didnt back away from it she met it and she lost caught between art and lust between beauty and sex shelly lowe died carved into her simple grave in a small cemetery in long island new york is the single line she lived only for her art which seems a fitting epitaph for this blue movie star fade out to credits what do you think rune asked sam healy you wrote that rune nodded it took me a hundred tries is it too you know flowery healy said i think its beautiful he put his arm around her is it ready to go not hardly rune laughed ive got to find a professional announcer to do the voiceover then spend about three weeks editing it all together and cutting about ten hours of tape down to twentyeight minutes shooting was the fun part now the work begins hey sam i was thinking anybody ever done a documentary about the bomb squad he kissed her neck why dont you call in sick today we can talk about it she kissed him quickly then rolled out of bed im already in the doghouse with larry and bob i didnt bring in fresh croissants the other morning this is for house o leather is that name for real i just make the commercials im not responsible for the clients poor taste she finished her coffee she sensed him looking at her no it was more of a stare no it was worse than that it was one of those sappy gazes that men give women occasionallywhen they get overcome with thisfeeling which they think is love though it usually means theyre horny or guilty or feeling insecure you can die of suffocation under one of those gazes rune said gotta go and started toward the door with a coquettish smile that sometimes had the effect of throwing cold water on men who were sloppy drunk on love hey he said in a low way that made him sound like a cop im not going to stop keep it cool keep the distance theres no hurry rune she stopped what ill do is wink at him on my way out the door all flirty and bitchy come here for a minute wink girl come on but instead she walked back to him slowly deciding that she wasnt reallythat late rune sensed it the moment she walked into the office and what she noticed was not a good feeling rune hung her coat up on the peeling varnished rack and glanced around what was it well first the mail was still on the floor larry usually carried it to cathys deskwell runes desk nowand looked through it and there was the coffee machine which larry always got going right away but which was now unplugged and wasnt giving off its usual sour scorched smell and there was bob who was already in the officeat rune could see him though the bubblyglass partition something big was up two heads moved distorted by the flyseye effect of the glass larry was in too butthat wasnt unusual larry always got in early he was afraid client checks would dissolve if he didnt pick them up early its er the voice was soft but came clearly over the partition her that tone was not good right less ave a talk the door opened and larry motioned to her rune you come in for a minute she walked into the office they both looked tired and rumpled she began an inventory of recent screwups it was a long list but included mostly minor infractions rune sit down she sat bob looked at larry who spoke whats happened is we got us a call from the client both of us bob threw in at nine this morning mr wallet son of a bitch the postpro house missed the shipment she said i told the postpro to ship it right away i threatened him he absolutely guaranteed me the tape got delivered to the client rune the problem was they didnt like it they want me to take a cut in pay thats what it is house o leathers talked down the fee and theyre going to cut my salary she sighed what was it he didnt like it was the dominoes right come on i did the setup three times i larry was playing nervously with a coin in his hand no i think the dominoes were okay e said the logo was still a bit you know dodgy but e could live with that rune said the transitions i did the dissolves real carefully bob said to larry show er what he wasnt too appy about larry hit the play button of the sony threequarterinch tape player a colorful copyright slate appeared the countdown from ten began each second marked off with an electronic beep at three the screen went blank then fade in the smiling daughter explaining how house o leather wallets were handcrafted from the finest cowhide treated and dyed according to old family traditions cut to factory workers making wallets and billfolds and purses cut to the daughter caressing a wallet model hiv dissolve to the dramatic domino shot cut to two women performing oral sex on a water bed as the closing credits forlusty cousins come on the screen rune said oh fade out larry said e fired us rune they arent paving the fee they arent paying expenses rune said i guess something kind of got mixed in kind of larry said bob added so were out the profits and also out of pocket about seventyfive thousand oh larry said i know it was an accident im not suggesting it wasnt but rune youre a sweet kid youre firing me arent you they didnt even bother to nod you better pick up whatever you got ere and ead out now we wish you the best of luck bob said he didnt mean it rune could tell but it was nice of him to at least make the effort didnt mean she was no good rune walked along the hudson staring at the olivedrab shadows stretching outward into the rippled texture of the water seagulls stood on one leg and hunched against the cool morning breeze after all didnt einstein get kicked out of school for failing math didnt churchill fail government they went on to show everybody the difference was though that they had a second chance so that was it no distributor and no money for editing voiceovers titles sound track rune had thirty hours of unedited tape whose value would go to zero in about six monthsthe time when the world would stop caring about shelly lowes death she went home to her houseboat and stacked up all the tape cassettes on her shelf tossed the script on top of them and walked into the kitchen she spent the afternoon sipping herbal tea as she sat on the deck browsing through some of her books one that she settled on for some reason was her old copy of dantesinferno wondering why that volumenot the one about purgatory or the one about paradisewas the bestseller wondering about the levels of hell people descend to mostly she meant tommy as she thought this but there were others too danny traub who even if he donated money to a good cause was a son of a bitch who liked to hurt women michael schmidt who thought he was god and destroyed a fine actresss chance for no good reason arthur tucker who stole shellys play after shed died rune wondered why descent seems the natural tendency why its so much harder to go upward the way shelly was trying to do like theres some huge gravity of darkness she liked that gravityof darkness and she wrote it down in her notebook thinking she wished she had a script to use the phrase in if she hadnt died would shelly ever have climbed out of the underworld like eurydice rune dozed and woke at sunset the orange disk squeezing into the earth over the jersey flatlands rippling in the angle of the dense atmosphere she stretched and took a shower and ate a cheese sandwich for dinner afterward she walked to a pay phone and called sam healy i got fired she told him the story oh no im sorry my one regret is that we didnt ship it to the networks she joked can you imagine lusty cousins on an ad during prime time boy would thatve been wholly audacious you need any money aw this is no big deal i get fired all the time i think i get fired more often than people hire me probably doesnt work that way but it seems so well you want to go out and get drunk naw ive got plans she said lets make it tomorrow fair enough my treat they hung up and rune took a couple dollars in quarters out of her pocket called directory assistance she needed most of the coins it took her quite a while to find a dance school that promised to make her an expert texas twostepper in just one night the place didnt exactly live up to that promise it took a while to convince them she wasnt interested in signing up for a series of latin dances or the chic to chic fred and ginger special but after the lessons got under way she picked up the moves pretty fast and she figured she could hold her own the next night she surprised healy by showing up at his place in a gingham skirt and blue blouse i look like raggedy ann ill never be able to show myself south of bleecker streeti hope youre happy they went to his texas club again and danced for a couple hours rune impressing the hell out of him with what shed learned then an amateur caller got on stage and started an impromptu square dance enough is enough rune said they sat down and started working on a plate of baby back ribs at eleven a couple of cops healy knew came in and in a half hour the place was so crowded that they all left and went to another bar a dive of a place on greenwich avenue she expected them to talk about guns and dead criminals and bloodstains but they were just normal people who argued about the mayor and washington and movies she had a great time and forgot they were cops until one time there was a truck backfire out on the street and three of them sam wasnt one halfreached for their hips then a second later when they understood it was just a truck dropped their hands never missing a beat of the conversation and not laughing about what theyd done but that made rune think of tommy and that reminded her of nicole and the evening went sour she was happy to get home and into bed the next day she applied for unemployment at the office on sixth avenue where she knew most of the clerks by name the lines werent longshe took that as a barometer reading of a good economy she was out by noon over the next week she saw healy three times she sensed he wanted to see her more but one of her mothers warnings was about men on the rebound and getting too involved with anolder man on the rebound didnt seem real wise at all still she missed him and on thursday when she called she got a pleasing jolt when he said tomorrows my day off how about we go blow things up i was going to say have a picnic someplace oh yeah id love to get out of the city the streets smell like wet dogs and its supposed to hit ninetyseven the only thing is ive got this interview at a restaurant he said youre making a movie about a restaurant sam im applying for a job as a waitress postpone it for a day well get out of the city youre twisting my arm ill call you tomorrow with details i havent said yes tomorrow he hung up yes she said chapter twentyfive kent was a small town in putnam county sixtyseven miles north of new york city near the connecticut state line the population was the town hadnt changed much since the day it was incorporated in it was too far from new york or albany or hartford for commuters though a few people drove to and from poughkeepsie for work at vassar the residents mostly made their money from farming and tourism and the staples of smalltown economics insurance real estate and building trades travel books about the area generally didnt mention kent the mobilguide gave the restaurant in the travellodge near the interstate a couple of stars the farming museum got mentioned so did a spring flower festival it was a quiet place outside of the small downtown about a mile from the last of the seven protestant churches in kent was an old rock quarry the huge pit did double duty a saturday night hangout for teenage boys who had either dates or sixpacks of bud and an informal shooting range during the day this afternoon three men stood at a disintegrating wooden board that served as a table for benchresting rifles and for holding ammo and targets and extra magazines all three were in the nraaccepted standing firing positionright foot back parallel to the target left forward and pointed downrange they were tall men with shortcut hair sprayed into place two of the men had graying hair and were thin the other a younger man with black hair had a beer belly though his legs were thin and his shoulders broad they all wore lightcolored shoes light slacks two pink and one gray and shortsleeved dress shirts with ties kept in place with a tack or bar in the shirt pocket of the fatter man was a plastic penandpencil caddy they all wore teardropshaped shooting sunglasses tinted yellow and made out of impactresistant glass in their ears were fleshcolored earplugs one thin man and the fat man held kalashnikov assault rifles whose clips they had just finished emptying at paper targets feet away they rested the guns on the ground muzzles up and began picking up the empty brass cartridges which they would reload themselves on the weekend the third man held a square ungainly israeli uzi which he fired in twosecond bursts the muzzle ended in a teninch sound suppressor and the gun made a sound like a hushed chain saw all three guns were fully automatic and therefore in violation of federal and state law the suppressor was a separate offense none of the men however had ever even seen an agent from the fbi or batf in this part of the county and they werent any more secretive with these guns than they were with their favorite deer rifle or remington sidebyside the man with the uzi aimed carefully and emptied the clip he took his earplug out and said cease fire although the others had already laid the guns on the bench muzzles downrange there were just the three of them present but theyd been raised in the protocol of firearms and adhered to formalities like thisthe same as when theyd arrived an hour before and this man had glanced at the others and said ready on the left ready on the right ready on the firing line commence fire these were rituals they respected and enjoyed he set down the uzi and went downrange to pick up targets when he walked back to the shooting stations they picked up their guns pulled out the clips opened the bolts put the safeties on and started toward the parking lot the guns disappeared into the trunk of a cadillac el dorado the ride took only ten minutes the car pulled into the black gravel driveway of a white colonial which had been built with money from the mans insurance business the three men walked around a fieldstone path to the entrance of a den inside the large room decorated with dark green carpeting and wormwood walls they rolled a gray tarpaulin out on the floor and laid the guns on the thick canvas battered metal cleaning kits appeared and the sweet smell of solvent filled the room in thirty seconds the guns were stripped down into their component parts and the three men were swabbing the bores with patches threaded through eyelets in the tips of aluminum rods they lovingly cleaned their weapons one of the thin men john looked at his watch and walked to the deskthis was his houseand sat down in seven seconds the phone rang and he answered he hung up and returned to the blanket he began to rub oil on the sling of his kalashnikov gabriel asked harris the darkhaired man the fatter one john nodded has he figured out what happened yes he has john said the third man william said who climbed on our bandwagon it seems there was a man who wanted that girl killed the one in those filthy movies he planted the second bomb he was killed by the police the press thinks he was behind all the bombings william asked it seems so to cover up what he did media said harris blessing and a curse john finished assembling the kalashnikov closed the bolt put the safety on and stacked the gun on a rosewood rack next to a thompson submachine gun a remington pump shotgun an enfield an m carbine and a boltaction what do you two think harris said all gabriels work is wasted if they think someone else did the bombings you know though itis a good smoke screen theres no pressure on him now its a good thing we picked up the count with the passage about the third angel after the second bomb william used a tiny periscope to study the bore of his gun looking for any bits of gunpowder hed missed we cant just stop brother harris is right no we cant just stop john said slowly he poured water into a mr coffee and began to brew a pot of decaf like the others here he felt caffeine was a sinful stimulant but im not sure i agree about gabe the police arent going to ignore the other bombings the experts will finish their reports and theyll find out that someone else was behind them harris said gabriel will stay to see things through he wont hesitate to sacrifice himself john said but he shouldnt hes too valuable then lets give up on new york william said send him to los angeles hollywood ive said all along we should have begun there nobody knows gabriel in california all his connections are in manhattan with all respect john said i think weve got to finish what we started he spoke softly as if it pained him to disagree johns aura of gentleness was misleading harris and william hunted for deer and geese with that excited hungry love of the hunt john did not john had been a marine in nam and had never once spoken about his tours of duty harris and william knew that the ones who didnt talk about killing were the ones who had the most personal relations with it john said we cant leave new york yet he shrugged thats how i feel william hawked and spit into a linen handkerchief all right how does gabriel feel harris snapped home the bolt of his machine gun hell do whatever we want him to but he should act fast john poured coffee into mugs and handed them to william and harris oh he will william nodded then said whats the target going to be johns eyes flickered to an illuminated crucifix above his desk then he looked at the other men i sometimes feel great temerity at times like this harris said deciding who should live who should die he told me about someone gabriel did i think its an interesting idea lets go with his thoughts then harris said nodding agreed lets pray for his successful mission their eyes closed tightly as they dropped to their knees and the three men that made up the council of elders of the new putnam pentecostal church of christ revealed knownthough only to themselvesas the sword of jesus prayed and they prayed so fervently their grim lips moved with silent words and tears came into their eyes ten minutes later they rose from the floor feeling refreshed and cleansed and john placed a call to gabriel waiting for their message in the terrible city of sodom sam healy didnt sound quite right rune wasnt sure what it was maybe he was standing next to a fivepound wad of c or a land mine so whats it going to be sunshine and sand mountains i need fresh air and wildlife skunks and badgers even worms and snakes wherere we going the rushhour traffic sped past the phone booth it was eight am uh rune oh boy do i knowthat tone somethings sort of come up sort of yeah what you on an assignment silence healy said i want to be honest with you oh shit she hated that word honest it was like sitdown dear right up there withtheres something we have to talk about cheryl called healy said hey not the end of the world not so far is adam okay is anything wrong no everythings fine another pause she wanted to see me

honesty sam thats very important they hung up fuck honesty she said out loud he shouldve lied through his teeth told me he was dismantling bombs that he had to have his gallbladder out that he had tickets to take adam to the mets she leaned against the phone stall for a moment looking at the graffiti sprayed on the clear glass sides of the booth a motorcycle went past a voice called wanna ride but the honda didnt slow down sweat ran tickling in streams down her face she wiped it away and walked west toward the river she stepped in a blob of tar that grabbed her shoe it came away with thick black strings attached rune sighed and sat down on the curb wiping off what she could picnic she was thinking beach mountains he could have told me he had a headache or he got a stomach flu talk about their situation dump her healy rune thought shes no good for you she knew though where it would end up hed go back to the wife it was so hyperobvious back to cheryl with her daisy contact paper cheryl with her white silk blouses and big boobs the darlingimmakingeggplantcasserolefortheandersons cheryl who was probably a perfectly fine person and who only walked out after he refused her tearful and perfectly reasonable request to get out of bomb detail shed be decent sweet a good person a perfect mother how i hate her rune had canceled the restaurant interview thinking shed be on her way to the beach she didnt have any money to work on her film she was stuck in deserted new york over a blistering hot august weekend and her only boyfriend was going to shack up with his wife that night aw sam it was then that she glanced up to a storefront window and saw an old sign faded and warped that advertised tax return preparation by a cpa rune looked at the sign smiled and said thank you lord she stood up and left black footprints of tar all the way back to the phone rune opened the door of her houseboat and let warren hathaway carrying several beach bags inside in sports clothesshorts a dark green izod shirt and tennieshe was much less of a nerd than he had been in the suit hey warren youre looking pretty crucial crucial jazzed you know cool well thanks hathaway laughed you like rune did a pirouette she wore a miniskirt and red tank top over her bikini youre looking pretty crucial yourself what are those on your skirt electric eels she looked down at the squiggly lines radiating from larger squiggly lines its from south america i think theyre landing pads for spaceships ah spaceships sure rune slung her leopardskin bag over her shoulder and locked the front door i was really glad to hear from you i was going to call i mean idid at that place you used to work but they said you didnt havea phone at home im glad you called i didnt know if id ever hear from you again no way was she going to say that shed been stood up orat least until he had a few drinks in himthat she needed some backing for her film and had he thought any more about the investment idea so she just said i thought it might be fun to get some fresh air i didnt mean to wheedle a trip to fire island you have a place out there they walked down the wharf to his car i wish im in a summer share a lot of the people from the firm go in together when you said you wanted to get out of the city i thought about the island ive never been there why do they call it that i wonder fire island hathaway shrugged im not sure ill look it up and give you a call rune looked at the frown on his face as he memorized his task seemed like he still needed a little work at loosening up according to mothers instructions they loaded their bags into the trunk and got into the car put your seat belt on he said yessir he started the car and drove out onto the highway heading south rune didnt even have to bring up the topic before theyd gone a half mile hathaway said ive run a lot of numbers on documentary films theyre kind of encouraging its not a gold mine but it looks like theres money to be made well go over the details if you want well sure he signaled and checked his blind spot as he cautiously changed lanes in two hours they climbed off the ferry and trekked over the sandy sidewalks to his vacation house halfway between kismet and ocean beach on fire island the place was a cheap assembly of sharpangled gray wood and glass and yellow pine with polyurethane so thick the grain was distorted by the lens of the coats when warren finally got the door openhe had key troublerune was disappointed the windows were filthy the grit of sand and salt was everywhere the stench of lysol and the sour scent of mold fought for supremacy a crummy house a romantic beachand an accountant thanks tons sam but hey life could be worse at least he was a rich accountant almost ready to invest in her documentary film and besides they had a fierce yellow sun and a case of budweiser and potato chips and cheez whiz and twinkies and the restless atlantic ocean who needed anything but that arthur tucker no longer dressed in his workaday suit but in an old work shirt and slacks and rubbersoled shoes sat forward in the back of a taxicab and told the driver to go slower they were cruising along the west side highway whatre we looking for the man asked in a thick accent a houseboat ha you kidding slower here he said stop here you sure the driver asked here tucker didnt answer the chevy pulled to a stop he climbed out of the cab picked up the heavy canvas bag beside him and paid the driver he made a point of not asking for a receipt the less evidence he knew the better chapter twentysix harris said these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb john ran his finger along his tattered king james god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain the two men along with william said a perfunctory amen john sipped his lemonade and marked the passage there were no priests in their church since gods terrible and just will touched every soul every believing nonsinning white soul that is equally there was no need for ordination laymen gave sermons and conducted services john was a favorite speaker he looked at his watch and glanced at the other two who nodded he then made a longdistance phone call on the fourth ring it was answered gabriel how are things good so pleased to hear it brothers harris and william and i are here together our thoughts are with you were ready to do what you asked john listened nodding his graying eyebrows lifted and his face flushed with excitement whats the number he jotted down a phone number in new york he hung up the phone and turned to harris hes had a brilliant thought since no one believes we exist he said hes decided to create a living testament to the will of god he looked at the phone number and began to dial the room seemed smaller with his wife in it healys impression was that shed grown but maybe it was just that rooms are always smaller with your ex in them how you doing healy asked not bad you cheryl responded youve gained weight i dont work out like i used to youre not spending three nights a week at the gym he didnt answer and she didnt comment further adam tells me you have a girlfriend not a girlfriend really shes young he says you were the one oops watch that im not saying anything i didnt expect you to be celibate were just friends friends cheryl was wearing a pink dress she looked like she could be in a betty crocker commercial cheerful and efficient smacking a sifter to dislodge bits of flour healy thought she should look more well suicidal about the breakup they sat close together on the couch healy decided hed have to get more furniture he asked you want anything a drink nope he said i havent gotten the divorce papers yet i havent had my lawyer serve them i thought you were in a hurry he said im not sure im in a hurry oh the sunlight fell in a familiar pattern on the white rug he remembered the day they bought it theyd bought shag because it seemed ritzier even though it was cheaper than pile he remembered the salesman a young man with razorcut black hair and eyebrows that formed a single band across his face he and cheryl had gone out to the food court in paramus mall afterward and made love when they got home on the old carpet today they talked for an hour healy wasnt sure how the words were going it seemed familiar terrain though the tone was different this time he didnt feel defensive he wasnt desperate or confused maybe it was because hed been seeing rune maybe because he felt that somehow the equilibrium of the house had shifted and it was now his home more than it wastheirs every so often theyd fall back into the roles of adversaries boy that was familiar hey that was you not me if youd said anything i could have that wasnt my fault sure say it all you want you know its not true the old arguments id rather deal with a pipe bomb any day but neither of them had the urge to go for the throat and once that harmless sparring was done they were just having a good time healy got some beers and they began to reminisce cheryl was talking about the time an old friend called up to say they couldnt make it for dinner because his wife just left him but could he come tomorrow only without the casserole because he didnt know how to make one and healy mentioned the time they came home and found the dog standing in the middle of the dining room table peeing on the candlestick and they both laughed about the night they were staying at cheryls parents house and remember on the billiard table in the rec room like i could forget then there was silence and it seemed that they had come to the point where a decision was supposed to be made healy didnt know what the choices were though and he was stalling he left it to cheryl but she wasnt much help either she sat with her hands together looking out the window shed cleaned a thousand times at the yard hed mowed a hundred healy finally said honey you know i was thinking the phone rang he wondered if it would be rune and how to handle it it wasnt sam the ops coordinator from the squad asked we got a live one tell me a call from those sword of jesus assholes the device is in a bag on a houseboat in the hudson houseboat where his heart thudded around christopher maybe eleventh thats my friends he whispered what that girl who was in here yeah well dont panic weve got a clean frozen zone and the boats empty shes not there where is she i dont know but we searched the boat whats the device different this time the portable got a look at it before he called us looks like its a bit of c or c embedded with ball bearings not much charge only a few ounces so antipersonnel ball bearings or coins were added to explosive to cause the most damage to human flesh right can the robot get it nope its on the deck too narrow healy pictured runes boat knew it would have to be a hand entry hell get a bomb blanket over it and let it detonate only one problem your girlfriend didnt realize it i assume but shes docked right next to a barge thats filled with five thousand cubic yards of propane that bomb goes and takes out the bargethatll ignite three square blocks of the west side hell tow it out there i made a call and itll take two hours to get a tug there and get the barge rigged to move its bolted to offloading pumps on shore you cant just move the damn thing and how much time do we have till the device goes fortyfive minutes ill be right there one thing sam its weird whats that the sword of jesus they didnt just call in a threat they said get the bomb squad over to this houseboat in the hudson at christopher its like that was the most important thing getting somebody from the detail there thats why its antipersonnel you think yep i think its directed at us noted healy said he hung up turned to cheryl whod heard the conversation he wondered if she was going to give him one of her exasperated looks the herehegoesagain look the shield against his stubbornness and selfishness but no cheryl was standing up letting her white patentleather purse fall to the floor then walking straight to him she eased her arms around him be careful he was surprised at how tightly he found he was holding her breathing hard in the bomb suit walking up the gangplank onto runes houseboat trying not to think about the last time he was here about them lying in bed together about the stuffed toy persephone falling to the floor he saw the bag peeked inside okay problems it was one of the most sophisticated bombs hed ever seen there was an infrared proximity panel so that if a hand got close it would detonate and it had a cluster shunttwenty or thirty fine wires running from a shielded power source to the detonator with a typical twowire shunt if you cut them simultaneously you might be able to disarm but it was impossible to cut this many shunt wires the timer was digital so there was no way to physically gum up the mechanism and to top it off there was a mercury rocker switch in the middle of the shuts great a rocker switch in a bomb on a houseboat healy gave these details to the ops coordinator who along with rubin and several other members of the squad huddled behind sandbags at the end of the pier theyd made the decision to bring only a few officers here if the propane barge went up whoever was within two blocks would be killed and they couldnt risk losing the majority of the squad i could cut the rocker switch he said breathing heavily it wasnt shunted but i cant get into the bag the proximity platell set it off how sensitives the rocker rubin asked through the radio pretty he replied looks like anything over three or four degreesll close the switch could you freeze the mercury i cant get anything into the bag the prox switch oh right ill just have to move it out slowly healy surveyed the scenario hed move the bomb to the gap in the houseboat railing where the gangplank was that would be all right the bag would stay relatively flat but then hed have to pick it up and carry it by hand down the gangplank and then to the tcv which had been driven out onto the pier ten feet from the houseboat thatll be the longest ten feet of my life he glanced at the timer seventeen minutes left i need some oil what kind rubin asked any kind hold up fifteen minutes he was startled when rubin appeared beside him with a can of inone oil healy shook his head in thanksrubin wasnt wired into the radio any longerand poured the oil on the painted deck of the houseboat to minimize the friction when he moved the bag he tossed the can aside and then reached out and gripped a corner of the canvas thought of adam thought of cheryl thought of rune he started to pull it toward him rune watched warren hathaway walk down the path to the beach where she was sunning on a large towel ive just been on the phone with some investors heres what ive arranged not great but considering you dont have a track record making films i think youll be happy the way it would work was this warren hathaway would loan her the money to finish the editing and postproduction work it would be a straight loan at just eight percent interest hed said prime is twelve but since youre a friend shed hugged him id go lower but the irs imputes income if the interest isnt market value whatever then he explained theyd do something called a joint venture a phrase rune had never heard before and that started her giggling when shed caught her breath hed told her that hed underwrite the cost of finding a distributor then theyd split the profits shed get eighty percent hed get twenty was that okay with her more than okay hey this sounds like real business adult grownup business ill go let them know then hed gone into the house and left her on the wide beach dozing thinking about sam healy then about her film then dozing again then trying not to think about sam healy she heard the water crash and the gulls hover overhead squawking rune fell asleep to that sound an hour later she woke up with the first sting rune looked at her arm oh brother i have dark hair and dark skin and ive got a half inch of sunscreen on me theres no way i should have a thirddegree burn but she felt the blisters forming on her backa crawling chill damp sensation she slowly sat up dizzy and threw a blanket over her shoulders she walked toward the house maybe she could ask warren to rub some solarcaine on her but she decided that one thing would lead to another not that he wasnt cute not that she wouldnt love to make sam healy a little jealous but with warrens interest in her film she figured that no sex made the most sense keep it professional her back pricked with an infuriating itching and she danced over the hot concrete of the patio into the house warren was inside looking into his gym bag i hope youve got solarcaine in there she said or bactine im lobster woman i think ive got something to fix you right up she looked around didnt you have two bags yeah he said matteroffactly i left one at your houseboat oh too bad no i did it on purpose he rummaged squinting into the bag you did why to keep the bomb squad busy and he took a red windbreaker from the bag unwrapped it carefully and set a fistsized wad of plastic explosive and detonator on the tacky driftwood table chapter twentyseven she got as far as the glass door hathaway looked soft but he was tougher than coathanger wire he latched onto her wrists and wouldnt let go then dragged her back into one of the woodpaneled bedrooms just like on the pier he was the one whod followed he was the one whod attacked her he slapped her hard and she spiraled down to the ground she couldnt get her hands up for protection her head hit first she lay for a moment stunned the pain radiating from her eyes back into her skull she felt a punch of nausea warren gabriel hathaway said as cheerfully as if hed just picked her up at a church social he stepped out of the bedroom to collect the bag and the explosive as he walked back sipping his iced tea he said to her you can call me gabriel rune whispered the sword of jesus there really is a sword of jesus and were very upset that people think we were just the creation of some psychotic murderer we have you to thank for that you and that film of yours what do you want what are you going to do to me hathaway began taking tools and wire and small boxes out of his canvas bag you have to understand i dont feel we can eliminate sin and evil thereve always been whores theres always been sin but there have also been those who fight against it even if they have to sacrifice their own life he looked at her carefully and when he spoke the reasonable tone in his voice was somehow as terrifying as tommy savornes craziness had been were like advertising in a way we get the message across what people do with that message is up to them rune said you werent a witness at all the first bombyou planted it as i was leaving the theater a man stopped me he called me brother he had a kind face i thought i could help him i could get him to repent and accept jesus even if we both died in the blast hed be entering the kingdom of god that would have been such a marvelous thing unfortunately what he was looking for wasnt salvation at all but twenty dollars for a blow job as i turned to leave the bomb went off it removed most of his head but what was left of his body saved my life thats ironic i suppose god works in strange and wonderful ways and the injuries on her facepart of that was the tear gas rune realized too that hed lied about the man in the red windbreaker being olderto shift suspicion away from himself and hed worn the hat to cover up his bald head hathaway continued i saw you outside the theater saw you with the camera i thought you were one of those sinners was going to kill you but then i thought maybe we could use you he nodded around the room and i guess i was right what are you going to do with me make you a living testament to the will of god why me i dont make those movies you were doing this film about a pornographic actress youre idealizing her no im not im showing what the business did to her she got exactly what she deserved you should make your movies about missionaries about the glory of god ill show you my film theres nothing glamorous about it hathaway looked at her and smiled rune we all have to make sacrifices you ought to be proud of whats going to happen to you i think the press coverage should last a year youre going to be famous he sat down on the small bed spreading out the components of the bomb examining each one carefully she eased forward her feet sliding under the bed slightly hathaway said dont think about jumping at me the box cutter she remembered from the first attack on the pier was in his hand i can hurt you in very painful ways its why i wear ared windbreakeri sometimes have to hurt people they sometimes bleed rune sat back on the bed hathaway spoke in a soothing tone as he pressed a white cylinder into the middle of the wad of explosive this is about three ounces of c he looked up i wouldnt go into this detail normally but since youre going to be my partner in this project i thought youd like to know a little about what to expect its not fair to let you think you can just pull the wires out and wait for help he held up a black plastic box which he pressed the explosive into and what we have here is very clever a rocker box it has a liquid mercury switch if you pick it up and try to pull the detonator out the switch sets off the explosive the batterys inside so you cant cut the power he ran wires to another small black box with a clock on it the timer its set and armed electronically theres a shunt if you disconnect the wire or cut it the detonator senses a drop in voltage and sets off the bomb he smiled god gave men such miraculous brains didnt he please ill do whatever you want do you want me to make a movie about god i can do that hathaway looked at her for a moment you know rune there are clergy that will accept repentance at any time whether the sinners acting of his own will or whether hes say being tortured he shook his head but im funny i need a little more sincerity than this situation warrants so in answer to your question no i dont want a little whore like you to make a movie about god rune said yeah and what do you thinkyou area good christian bullshit youre a killer thats all you are hathaways eyes lifted to her as he picked up the wire swear all you like god knows who his faithful are he stood back there we go he placed the assembly of boxes and wires on the night table and slid it into the middle of the room now let me tell you whats going to happen he was proud he looked critically at the ceiling and walls the explosion will take out most of the inner wallstheyre only sheetrockand the floor and ceiling too the outer wall is structural and shouldnt collapse on the other hand you wouldnt want to be caught between that wall and the bomb hathaway bounced on the floor near the bomb wood he shook his head hadnt counted on that splinters are going to be a problem fire too but youll just have to hope for the best now theres easily enough explosive here to kill you in fact id say youve got a twenty percent chance of getting killed outright so i would suggest you take the mattresses and springs and lay them over you he looked around in that corner there youll be blown into the living room its hard to know exactly whatll happen but i can guarantee that youll be permanently deafened and blinded when c goes off it spreads poisonous fumes so even if you arent blinded by the explosion you will be by the smoke i think youll probably lose an arm or leg or hand lung bums from the fumes cant tell for sure like i was saying the splinters are going to be a problem thats how most sailors were killed in nineteenthcentury naval warfare by the way splinters not cannonballs did you know that why are you doing this to me whats the point so youll tell everyone about us people will believe us and theyll be afraid youll live off charity youll live off gods grace you might die of course in fact you can always choose that just pick it up he gestured to the box but i hope you wont i hope you realize what kind of good you can do what kind of message you can leave for our poor sinful world i know who you are i can tell you know warren hathaway which isnt of course my name and how are you going to pick me out of a lineup without eyes he laughed then nodded at her and said you have thirty minutes may god forgive you rune stared back at him hathaway smiled and shook his head and left the room she heard a halfdozen nails slamming into the frame of the door then there was silence a moment later the black box clicked and a red light came on the hand of the clock started moving she ran to the window and drew her hand back to smash through the glass with her palm suddenly the window went black and she gave a soft whimper as hathaway began nailing the thick plywood sheet over the glass no no she was crying afraid the huge booming of the hammering would set off the bomb ten minutes the canvas bag was at the gap by the gangplank sam healy took a deep breath looked at the containment vehicle the longest ten feet how you doing buddy the ops coordinator asked through the radio headset never been better healy replied you got all the time in the world breathing in out in out he bent over the canvas bag and carefully closed the top he couldnt keep it level holding it by the strap so hed have to grip the base with both hands and pick it up he backed down the gangplank then went down on one knee breathe breathe breathe steadiest hands in the business someone had once said about healy well he needed that skill now fucking rocker switches he bent forward oh jesus christ came the staticky voice in the radio healy froze looked back the ops coordinator rubin and the other men from the squad were gesturing into the river waving madly healy looked where their attention was focused shit a speedboat doing thirty knots was racing along close to the shore churning up a huge wake the boater and his passengera blonde in sunglassessaw the bomb squad crews gesturing and waved back smiling in ten seconds the huge wake would hit the boat jostle it and set off the rocker switch sam get the fuck outa there just run but healy was frozen staring at the registration number of the speedboat the last two numbers were a one and a five fifteen oh christ run but he knew it would be pointless you cant run in a bomb suit and besides the whole dock would vanish in the fiery hurricane of burning propane the wake was twenty feet away he bent picked up the bag with both hands and started down the gangplank ten feet from the houseboat halfway down the gangplank five feet go sam two steps and hed be on the pier but he didnt make it just as he was about to step onto the wood of the pier the wake hit the houseboat and it hit so violently that when the boat rocked the gangplank unhooked and fell two feet to the pier healy was caught off balance and pitched forward still clutching the bomb sam he twisted to the side to get his body between the bag and the propane barge thinking im dead but maybe the suitll stop the shrapnel with a thud he landed on the pier eyes closed waiting to die wondering how much pain hed feel it was a moment before he realized that nothing had happened and a moment after that before he realized he could vaguely hear music he sat up glanced at the sandbags behind which the squad stood immobilized with shock healy unzipped the bag and looked inside the rocker switch had closed the circuit what it had set off though wasnt the detonator but apparently a small radio he pulled the helmet off the bomb suit sam whatre you doing he ignored them yeah it was definitely music some kind of easy listening he stared at it unable to move feeling completely weak more static then he could hear the disc jockey this is wjes your home for the sweetest sounds of christian music he looked at the explosive pulled off the glove and dug some out with his fingernail smelled it hed have recognized that smell anywherethough not from his bomb disposal training from adam the explosive was playdoh rune didnt waste any time trying to break through the walls she dropped to her knees and retrieved what shed seen under the bed when hed first dragged her into the room a telephone when hathaway had seen her ease forward on the bed it wasnt because she was about to leap it was because shed seen an old black rotary dial phone on the floor with her feet she pushed it back into the shadows under the bed she now pulled it out and lifted the receiver silence no it wasnt working then her eyes followed the cord hathaway or somebody had ripped the wire from the wall she dropped down to the floor and with her teeth chewed off the insulation revealing four small wires inside white yellow blue green for five minutes she stripped the four tiny wires down to their thin copper cores against the wall was a telephone input box with four holes in it rune began shoving the wires into the holes in different order she was huddled cramped on the floor the receiver shoved under her chin finally with the last possible combination she got a dial tone the timer on the bomb showed twelve minutes she pressed and what the hell good is that going to do did they evenhave a fire department on fire island and how could she even tell them where she was shit she depressed the button and dialed healys home number no answer she started to slam it down then caught herself and cautiously pressed the button againfeeling as if she had only a few dial tones left and didnt want to waste them this time she called the operator and told her in a breathy voice that it was an emergency and asked for the th precinct in manhattan she was astonished in five seconds she was connected its an emergency i need to speak to sam healy bomb squad static someone near the switchboard telling a polish joke more static patch it through rune heard more static the punch line of the joke static oh please then healys voice the operator was saying central to twofivefive ive got a landline patch for you emergency she says you available im in the field who is it what does she want sam she shouted but he didnt hear chapter twentyeight tell him rune she shouted to the dispatcher hurry a moment later the condition of the line improved though it was still filled with static sam she was crying hes got me in a room with a bomb the sword of jesus bomber where are you a house on fire island fair harbor i think hes put a bomb here seven minutes wheres the guy who set it he left its that warren hathaway the witness in the first bombing hes going back to bay shore on the ferry okay ill get a copter on its way describe the house she did healy broke the line for a terrifyingly long twenty seconds okay whatve we got a big handful ofwhat is itc theres a timer its set to go off in about six minutes christ rune get the hell out hes nailed me in a pause for a moment was he sighing when he spoke his voice was soothing as a valium okay were going to get through this just fine listen up okay what do i do tell me about it rune told him what hathaway had said about the bomb it seemed he whistled when she explained it but that may have been just static fiveminutes how big is the room maybe twenty by fifteen a pause all right heres the deal you get far enough away and cover yourself up with mattresses or cushions youll probably live but he said itll make me deaf and blind there was silence yeah he said it may four minutes twenty seconds the thing is you try to disarm it yourself and it goes itll kill you sam im going to do it how tell me how he was hesitating finally he said dont pull the detonator out of the explosive theres a pressure switch in it youll have to bypass the shunt and cut the battery cord you need enough electricity to keep the galvanometer fooled into thinking the cord isnt cut i dont know what that means listen carefully look at the bomb therell be a little box near the battery its gray i see it with two metal posts on it right healy said you have to run a piece of wire thats very narrow gauge whats gauge she was crying sorry i mean its got to be real thin run a piece from one lead of that box to the main terminal connecting the battery to the cable see what im saying right then you cut the wires to the timer three minutes thirty okay she said find a piece of wire strip the insulation off and wrap one strandnot all of them just one strandaround the terminal of the gray box and then the other around the terminal on the timer then cut the other wires from the timer okay ill do it she stared at the plastic components picturing it healy said remember you cant override the rocker switch so dont move the bomb itself through her tears she said theyre called ieds sam not bombs the helicopters on its way therell be county police meeting the ferry in bay shore and well send one out to fair harbor oh sam should i just hide under the mattress he paused the static rose up like a storm between them then he said believe in what isnt as if it were until it becomes two minutes ill see you soon sam rune yanked the wires from the phone then with her teeth stripped the insulation off one of themthe white wireand wound one strand around the two terminals the way healy had told her ninety seconds now cut through the battery cables she bent to the bomb smelled the oily scent of the explosive just inches from her face and took one of the black wires in her teeth she began chewing tears fell on the plastic it was thicker than she thought fifty seconds a tooth chipped and she felt an electric jolt of pain and surprise her breath hissed inward forty thirty the wire snapped no time for the other one had he said to do both of them she thought he had shit she backed away from the bomb pulled the mattress and springs off the bed and lay down on the floor in the corner the way hathaway had told her blind and deaf thirty twentynine twentyeight twentyseven she prayedto a god she hoped was a lot different from the one the sword of jesus claimed as theirs fourteen thirteen twelve eleven rune tucked her head against her chest warren hathaway was proud of his precision when not building bombs he was in fact a bookkeeperthough not a cpaand he enjoyed the sensuality of the act of filling in the numbers on the pale green paper with a fountain pen or a finetipped markerone that did not leave indentations on the sheet he enjoyed the exactness and detail he also enjoyed watching big explosions so when the windows of the beach house did not disintegrate in a volley of shards and the sandy earth did not jerk beneath him from the huge jolt of the bomb he felt his stomach twist in horror he didnt swearthe thought never would have entered his mind what he did was pick up the hammer and walk the hundred yards back into the house the trials of job he knew hed set the system properly there was no doubt that he knew his equipment the cap was buried in just the right thickness of plastic the c was in good condition the battery was charged the little whore had ruined his handiwork he walked inside and then slammed the hammer down on the wooden boards barring the door he struck them near the nails to lift their heads and then caught them in the claw with a loud hauntedhouse creak the nails began coming out with the first nail he heard the girls voice in a panic asking who was there the second nail she was screaming for help how silly and desperate they were sometimes women whoring women the third nail silence he paused listening he heard nothing hathaway pulled the rest out the door opened rune stood inside the room in front of the table looking at him defiantly her hair was stuck to her face with sweat her eyes were squinting she drew the back of her hand across her mouth and swallowed in her other hand was a leg wrenched from a table or chair he laughed at it then frowned looking past her at the bomb he studied it with professional curiosity shed bypassed the shunt he was frowning you did that how did you know she held up the club hathaway said you whore you think thats going to stop me he stepped forward toward her he got only six inches before he tripped over the taut strands of telephone wire rune had strung across the bottom of the doorway hathaway fell heavily he caught himself but his wrist bone snapped with a loud crack as it struck the floor he shouted in pain and struggled to his feet as he did rune brought the club down on his shoulders as she ran past him through the doorway it hit hard and he fell forward on his bad hand with a cry hathaway was trying again to stand supported by one knee and one foot planted on the floor reaching into his pocket with his good hand for the box cutter staring at her as if she were the devil come to earth he started to his feet rune waited for just a moment then flung the leg of the table past hathaway after that the images were just a blur runes diving fall as she threw herself to the floor against the baseboard in the living room hathaways awkward panicked attempt to grab the leg before it hit its intended target thenwhen he failed to stop itthe cascading flash and ball of flame as the leg struck the bomb and the rocker switch set off the c then the whole earth joined in the blur sand splinters chunks of sheetrock smoke metalall tossed in a cyclone of motion hathaway had been right about the walls the outer one held it was the interior walls that shattered and whistled around rune like debris in a hurricane the floor dropped six inches there was no fire though the smoke was as irritating as hed promised she lay curled up in a ball until her throat tightened and the coughing became too violent then she rose to her feetwithout looking into the bedroomand staggered outside deafened eyes streaming she dropped to her knees and crawled slowly to the beach coughing and spitting out the bitter chemical smoke fire island was empty on weekdays there was no one even to be enticed by the bang the beach here was completely deserted rune dropped to the sand and rolled onto her back hoping that the surf would rise closer and closer and touch her feet she kept urging it on and didnt know why she felt an obsession for the touch of the water maybe it was primal therapeutics maybe she needed to feel the motion of something that seemed to be alive at the first brush of the cold water rune opened her eyes and scanned the horizon a helicopter she saw it coming in low then another then a dozen more all cruising directly toward her coming in for an urgent rescue then she was laughing a deep laugh she couldnt hear but which ran through her whole body as the helicopters turned miraculously into fat seagulls that didnt pay her the least attention as they cruised down for their ungainly landings on the firm sand chapter twentynine rune spent the next couple weeks by herself that was the way she wanted it she saw sam healy a few times but she thought it was best to keep things a little casual and professional thered been some followup rune had told the police that shed heard hathaway on the phone not long before hed locked her in the bedroom he might have been talking to the others in the sword of jesus the new york state police traced the call and started an investigation of their own three days after gabriel was blown to pieces three senior members of the sword of jesus were arrested there was also the matter of arthur tucker when rune arrived back at her houseboat from fire island she saw that it had been broken into nothing was missing she thought at first until she noticed that the script she had lifted from arthur tuckers office was gone shed called him threatened to call the police and tell them that hed stolen a dead womans plays the crotchety old man had told her call away its got your fingerprints on it and ive already got a police report filed about a breakin a week agojust after you came to interview me and im not very happy that you told half the world i was a suspect in the case thats slander their compromise was that neither would press charges and that if he made any money from the plays hed donate a quarter of it to the new york aids coalition then something odd happened larrythe larry who was half of l amprhad appeared at the door of her houseboat no bloody phone what good are you larry ive had my abuse for the week its a bleedin ouseboat want a drink cant stay i came by to tell you es an arse mr house o leather what can i tell you i still lost you the account larry you cant give me my job back he snorted an australian laugh well luv that wasnt ever gonna appen but truth is theres this guy called me es got some ins at pbs and seems theres this series on new documentary filmmakers theyre looking to do larry all right i recommended you and they got a budget not much ten thousand per film but you cant bring it in under that you got no business being a film maker he wrote down the name she got her arms most of the way around him and hugged him hard i love you you fuck it up i dont know you oh and dont tell bob what e does is e as this little doll and its got your name on it and every night e sticks pins thats a load of codswallop larry rune thats brit not aussie work on your foreign languages some right five minutes after hed left rune was on the phone the distributor had been pretty aloof and said real noncommittally to submit a proposal and theyd make their decision on funding proposal ive got rough footage in the can you do he sounded more impressed than a film person ought to everybody else has these onepage treatments two days later when she called he told her hed soldepitaph for a blue movie star to pbs it was slotted for september on a program about young film makers a check for all her postproduction work would be sent shortly sam healy emerged again and began spending more and more nights on the houseboat he complained about the rocking motion for a while though that was mostly for effect rune figured something inside of him felt it was better for the woman to move into his homestead rather than the other way around he saw cheryl some too he told rune about it honesty goddamn honesty but it seemed that their gettogethers were to discuss the sort of nittygritty details appropriate for people on the verge of divorce nonetheless dear cheryl still hadnt filed papers and once or twice when rune stayed over at his place he took calls late at night and talked for thirty forty minutes she couldnt hear what he said but she sensed that it wasnt police central he was talking to adam decided he liked rune a lot and asked her advice on which rock groups were current and where to get good chic secondhand clothing its all right sam you dont want him to be a geek do you the two of them went to a mets game once after healyd bought tickets but couldnt make it because of a travel alarm ticking away in a suitcase in a port authority locker rune and adam had a great time when somebody had tried to pick her up by telling her what a cute brother she had adam had said dont talk about my mom that way they laughed about the guys reaction for a good portion of the trip home tonight was sunday and sam healy had stayed the night he was watching the ball game as rune looked through thetimes working up the courage to actually cook breakfast and wondering how risky it would be to make waffles she noticed an article read it sat up suddenly healy looked at her she pointed to the story that guy they found in the trunk of the car at la guardia a couple of days ago somebody with the family yeah what about it healy asked the medical examiner said the autopsy showed hed been dead for a week healy turned back to the game the yankeesre behind by seven and youre worried about dead hit men the assistant medical examiner who did the autopsyhis name is andy llewellyn but healy was directing all his attention to help the boys from the bronx rally back in the eighth ive got a couple errands to run rune said youll be here when i get back he kissed her they can do it healy said she looked at him the yankees he said ill keep my fingers crossed rune said sincerely rune went for a long walk and ended upsurprised to find herself therein times square she walked into the old nathans famous and ordered a coke and a cardboard carton of crusty french fries which she covered with sauerkraut and ketchup and mustard and ate as best she could with the little red skewer they give you instead of a fork she hadnt quite finished when she got up suddenly and went outside to a pay phone she made two longdistance phone calls and in five minutes was in a cab on the way back to her houseboat wondering if sam would loan her the money for a plane ticket beneath the the sheet of lake michiganso much bluer than new york harbormet the north shore somewhere near wilmette the fragile lattice dome of the bahai temple rose just above the dark green sponge of latesummer trees rune looking through the viewfmder of the little jvc video camera lost sight of the temple as the plane eased out of its bank she released the shutter the wheels lowered with a quivering rush of protest against the slipstream bells sounded and lights came on and in five minutes they were on the ground at ohare with the roar of the reverse thrusters the finalapproach thoughts of mortality vanished welcome to chicago the steward said i dont know about that rune thought and unbuckled her seat belt this city is flat its not like new york where all the energy is crowded onto a rocky island its a sprawl it stretches out its weak its runes voice faded the miniature tape recorder sagged dissipated the cabdriver offered dissipatedclick she shut off the recorder rune glanced at his head balding on top but hair pulled back from the sides and tied into a long ponytail in the rearview mirror she noticed he had a demonic goatee diffused he tried click its weak and diffused great expanses of land stretch between the pockets of how about extend the driver said you usedstretch earlier i did the train of her poetic thought vanished rune dropped the tape recorder in her bag what are you a writer he asked im a film maker she said which she wasnt exactly she figured if being something had to do with making regular money while you did it on the other hand filmmaker had a lot more class thanoccasional waitress at abagel restaurant on sixth avenue a job shed just accepted anyway who was going to check the driveractually parttime student parttime driverloved movies and concluded by the time the cab cruised past lawrence avenue that rune should do a film on chicago he shut off the meter and for the next half hour took her on a tour of the city chicago means wild onion he said thatd be a good way to open the film he told her about captain streeter the haymarket riots colonel mccormick william wrigley carl sandburg sullivan and adler the sox and the cubs the eastland boat disaster the water tower steve goodman big bill thompson mayor daley the ugly picasso monkey woman snow and wind and humidity saul bellow and polish german and swedish food kielbasa he said with admiration in his voice he talked a lot about the great fire and showed her where it began west near the river and where it ended up north hey thatd be great he looked back at her a film about city disasters san francisco dresden nagasaki they arrived at her hotel rune thanked him and decided that while she appreciated his thoughts it was a film shed never make shed had enough cataclysm they exchanged names and phone numbers he wouldnt take a tip but she promised to get some footage of him to use for atmosphere if she ever needed to rune checked into the small hotel just off lincoln park the room overlooked the lake and she sat looking at it for a while the bathroom was fantasticenough towels so she could dry every limb with a different one enough mirrors so that she found she had a birthmark in the small of her back that shed never known she had rune used the tiny scented cake of soap to wash her face then the little bottles of shampoo and conditioner that was a real treat at home she used an old bar of ivory for everything including dishes she stole the complimentary shower cap after the shower rune put on her one dressa blue silk number her mother had sent her four years ago but since shed only worn it three times she figured it still qualified as new she looked at herself in the fulllength mirror me in a dress staying in a hotel that overlooks a beautiful lake with rocking bluegreen waves in a city that burned down and has come back from the ashes rune then turned on the desk lamp and took out her makeup kit she began to do something she hadnt done for almost a yearput on nail polish a dark red she wasnt quite sure why shed picked this shade but it seemed sophisticated culturedthe color youd want to wear if you were going to the theater thats where john dillinger bought the big one a squarejawed sandyhaired young man told her she was eating a hamburger in a halfdeserted folk music club hed leaned along the bar and pointed to the old biograph movie house across the street he was betrayed by a woman in a red dress the man said adding some flirt to his voice but rune scared the guy off when she asked with gleaming eyes if you could still see the bloodstains the haymarket theater was in a small twostory victorian building on lincoln avenue just north of fullerton up the street from the biograph she picked up her ticket at the box office and wandered into the small auditorium she found her seat and thumbed through the program at one minute after eight the lights went down and the curtain rose rune wasnt sure what to think about the play as much as she loved movies she generally didnt like plays very much just when you started to believe the painted sets and the funny way everyone talked and walked the two hours were up and you had to go back to reality it could be very jarring but this wasnt bad at all at least unlike a lot of modern plays it had a story you could follow it was about a young womanplayed by a pretty brunette actress named rebecca hansonwho kept postponing her romantic life because of her family the major incident in the play was her decision to leave home at the age of thirtytwo there was some very clever stuff in it like the scene where one actors talking to another actor who suddenly becomes someone else in a flashback it was funny in parts then sad then funny again rune cried when the actress left her smalltown boyfriend and headed off for europe the audience loved it and about half of them gave the star a standing ovation the play was long by the time the curtain calls were over it was the audience all except for rune left soon after the lights came up she waited until the actors and actresses had disappeared then strolled backstage no one stopped her rebecca hansons dressing room was at the end of the corridor rune paused in front of it collected herself then knocked yes rune opened the door shelly lowe finished wiping the cold cream off her face and gave rune a smile it was pretty bleak rune decided i thought i saw you in the audience she said well i guess we better have a little talk chapter thirty the two women walked down lincoln avenue past the closed shops and mostly empty bars to the broad intersection at halsted and fullerton then they turned east in front of them the street and apartment lights disappeared into an expanse of blackness rune wondered if that void was the lake or the park or the sky she glanced at shelly who was wearing blue jeans a silk blouse and reeboks you dont quite look the same close though a little plastic surgery eyes and nose always wanted it bobbed arthur tucker knew all along didnt he rune asked it was his idea in a way about six months ago he found out about my movie careerof course i didnt exactly keep it a secret we had this terrible fight i met him he doesnt like pornography very much no but it wasnt the morality of it he thought making the movieswhats the worddiminished me thats what he said that it was holding me back from being great it dulled me creatively like drinking or drugs i thought about it he was right i told him though i couldnt afford just to quit cold i wasnt used to being poor i said id have to be crazy to quit what im doing crazy or dead he said so die well i thought about disappearing the way gauguin did but every city that was big enough to have good theater would also have a porn market there was a risk id be recognized unless she smiled unless i was actually dead a week later that religious group set off the first bomb in the theater the news report said some bodies had been unidentified because the blast was so bad i got into fantasizing about what if someone had mistaken that body for me i could go to san francisco la even london i began to obsess over the idea it became a consuming thought then i decided it might actually work you got the bomb from tommys army buddy in monterey the one who was courtmartialed with him shelly cocked a single eyebrow it was hard to see her as a brunette blonde had definitely been her color how did you know that she asked connections he sells blackmarket munitions hed been a demolition expert i paid him to make me a bomb he explained to me how it worked then you waited for someone like me a witness she didnt speak for a moment the park was ahead of them off to their left couples were walking through the trim grass and oaks and maple trees then i waited she said softly i needed someone to see me in the room where the explosion was you tried to get me to tape it i remember you asking that then it went off only you were gone and the body that andy llewellynd gotten for you was next to the phone shelly smiled and rune thought it was a smile of admiration you know about him you found that out too i saw his name on your calendar then i saw a story in the paper the other day about a murder it mentioned that he was a medical examiner i figured hed be a good source for a body after a moment shelly said the body i remembered this guyandywhod picked me up at a bar one time he was really funny a nice guyfor someone who does autopsies all day he was also making a nice low salary so he was happy to take thirty thousand cash to get me a body and arrange to do the autopsy and fake the dentalsto identify the corpse as me they arent all that hard to come up with did you know dozens of unidentified people die in the city every year she shook her head that night i was on some kind of automatic pilot the body was in the room at lame duck where andy and i had put it that evening before i came over to your place for the taping session the bomb was in the telephone you were outside i called to you then went into the back of the studio and pressed a couple of buttons on this radio transmitter the bomb went off in my bag i had what was left of my savings in cash an originaledition moliere play a ring of my mothers some jewelry that was it all my credit cards drivers license citibank cash card letters were in my purse in the room at lame duck arent you afraid somebody here will recognize you yes of course but chicagos different from new york there are only a couple adult theaters here a few adult bookstores no shelly lowe posters like you see in times square no shelly lowe tapes in the windows of the bookstores and i had the surgery and dyed your hair no this is my natural color shelly turned to her besides youre talking to me now a few feet awaywhat do you think do i seem like the same person you interviewed on your houseboat no she didnt she didnt at all the eyesthe blue was there but they werent laser beams any longer the way she carried herself her voice her smile she seemed older and younger at the same time rune said i remember when i was taping you you started out being so tough and i dont know controlled shelly lowe was a ballbuster but you slipped toward the end you became someone else i know thats why she looked away they started walking again and rune grinned thats why you broke into my houseboat and stole the tape it gave away too much im sorry you know we thought tommy was the killer i heard about it about nicole that was so sad her voice faded danny and ralph gutman and all the othersthey were just sleazy but tommy was frightening thats why i left him it was those films of his he started doing real s amp m films i left him after that i guess when he found he couldnt get off on just pain alone he started doing snuff films i dont know they walked for a few minutes in silence shelly laughed sadly then said how you tracked me down ill never understand here in chicago i mean it was your play delivered flowers i saw it on arthur tuckers desk hed crossed out your name and written his in i thought well i thought hed killed youto steal your play he really had me fooled hes an acting coach remember and one of the best actors youll ever meet he gets an oscar for that performance rune said i remembered the name of the theater the haymarket it was written on the cover of the play i called the theater and asked what was playing they saiddelivered flowers shelly said that was his idea the play he said that wed pretend he wrote it a play by arthur tucker would be a lot more likely to be produced than one by becky hanson he sends me the royalties none to the aids coalition no should he rune laughed and said probably he should but thingsve changed since we made our deal thinking damn that man was a good actor arthur got the company here to produce it and arranged for me to get the lead i thought about it afterward it was very strange here id had the chance to direct my own death my god what an opportunity for an actress think of it alla chance to create a character in the ultimate sense create a whole new person they walked along clark street for a few minutes until they came to a victorian brownstone shelly took her keys out of her purse rune said i dont know a whole lot about plays but i liked it i didnt you know understand everything but usually if i dont understand stuff all the way that means its pretty good the reviewers like it theyre talking of taking a road company to new york itll hurt like hell but i wont be able to go with them not now not for a few years thats my plan and ill have to stick to it let shelly rest in peace for a while you happy here rune asked she nodded her head upward im nearly broke living in a thirdfloor walkup i pawned my last diamond bracelet last month because i needed the cash shelly shrugged then grinned but the acting what im doing yeah im happy rune looked at the twisty wroughtiron gate weve got kind of a problem whats that theres a film about you the one you were working on when i was killed shelly looked at her curiously but after the bombing well there was nothing more for you to make a film about you stopped working on it didnt you rune leaned against the grille and turned to face shelly its slotted on pbs shellys eyes went wide oh rune you cant pbs is national someone here could see it you dont look like you i look enough like me so people could make the connection rune said you used me you werent honest with me i know i dont deserve to ask you didnt want to help me make my film at all you just used me please rune all my plans theyre just starting to work out for the first time in my life im happy no one knows what i didthe films i cant tell you how wonderful it is not to be looked at like a thing its so wonderful not to be ashamed rune said but this ismy one big chance ive lived with this film for months its gotten me fired and nearly gotten me killed a couple times its all ive got shelly i cant let it go tears formed in the actresss eyes remember in your houseboat we were looking through the mythology book the story about orpheus and eurydice shelly lowe is dead rune dont bring her back please dont shellys eyes were round and liquid with tears her hand closed on runes arm look at me rune please like orpheus look at me and send me back to the underworld the hudson was choppy a storm was coming rune was afraid shed lose electricity thats all i need tonight my television premiere and all of new york has a blackout a flash of lightning over jersey froze the image of sam healy opening two cans of beer at once the rain began whipped against the side of the houseboat by fast surprised sweeps of wind i hope the moorings hold rune said healy looked out the window then back at the dinner resting on runes blue formica coffee table the cold anchovy pizza seemed to bother him more than an unplanned voyage into new york harbor they pay you much for your film naw this is public televisionyou do it for love rune said turning on the tv and because if im lucky a lecherous producer with a ton of money hes dying to give away is gonna be watching you use your real name you dont believe runes my name no he sipped the miller is it the credit line is irene dodd simons classy so thats your real name maybe maybe not rune smiled mysteriously and sat back in the old couch shed bought from a goodwill shop it was still uneven from the time shed cut through a lot of the stuffing looking for hidden money but if you settled yourself enough it got to the point where it was pretty comfortable healy tried the couch then sat on the floor picking anchovies off half the pizza and dropping them onto the other half you disarm bombs rune pointed out youre scared of a few little fish the screen coalesced into the dense fuzzy color of old tv sets and with just a hint of reverberation the sound boomed into the room from the huge speakers they sat through previews of future programsa science show on amniocentesis and a nature program that showed grownup vultures feeding something red and raw to baby vultures healy gave up on the pizza the young filmmakers program was introduced by a middleaged englishman he referred to irene dodd simons as a young upandcoming film maker from manhattan who never had any formal film training but whod gotten her experience doing television commercials if they only knew rune said the camera closed on him as he said and now our first feature epitaph for a blue movie star the fade from black emerged slowly as a gaudy mosaic of times square at dusk men in raincoats walked past a womans voiceadult films some people pornography excites some people it repulses and some are moved by it to acts of perversion and crime this is the story of one talented young woman who made her living in the world of pornography and was pulled down by its gravity of darkness did you write that healy asked shhh times square dissolved into abstract colors which faded and became a blackandwhite high school graduation picture nice effect a young actress who searched and never found who buried her sadness in the only world she understood the glitzy world of fantasy the camera closed in on the high school picture slowly coming into focus this isthe story of nicole dorleans the life and death of a blue movie star a cut to nicole sitting in her apartment looking out the window tears on her face recorded by the unsteady unseen camera she was speaking softlythese movies the thing is its all i can do i make love good but im such a failure at anything else ive tried it doesnt work its such a hard feeling to hate the one thing youre good at cut back to the high school picture as the opening credits rolled healy asked whos doing the narration shes great rune didnt answer for a moment then she said i got a pro to do it an actress in chicago a pro anybody id know naw i doubt it rune tossed the pizza on the table and moved closer to healy resting her head against his chest as the opening credits ended and nicoles picture faded into the grimy coldlit marquee of a movie theater on eighth avenue about the author jeffery deaveris the internationally bestselling author of thirteen suspense novels includingthe empty chair
