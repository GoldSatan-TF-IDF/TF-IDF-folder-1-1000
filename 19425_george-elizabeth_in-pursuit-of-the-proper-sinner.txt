elizabeth george in pursuit of the proper sinner the tenth book in the inspector lynley series in loving memory of my father robert edwin george and with gratitude for rollerskating on todd street trips to disneyland big basin yosemite big sur air mattress rides on big chico creek the shakespeare guessing game the raven and the fox and most of all for instilling in me a passion for our native language how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child king lear june the west end prologue what david kingryder felt inside was a kind of grief and a secondary dying he felt overcome by a gloom and despair completely at odds with his situation below him on the stage of the agincourt theatre horatio was reprising hamlets divinity that shapes us while fortinbras countered with o proud death three of the four bodies were being borne off the stage leaving hamlet lying in horatios arms the castthirty strongwere moving towards one another norwegian soldiers coming from stage left danish courtiers coming from stage right to meet upstage from horatio as they began the refrain the music swelled and the ordnancewhich hed initially argued against because of the risk of begging comparisons to the boomed out in the wings and at that precise moment the stalls began rising beneath davids box they were followed by the dress circle then the balconies and over the music the singing and the cannons thundered applause this was what he had craved for more than a decade a complete vindication of his prodigious talent and by god he had it before him he had it below him and everywhere round him as well for that matter three years of mindcrushing bodynumbing labour were at this moment culminating in the standing ovation that had been denied him at the conclusion of his two previous west end productions for those extravaganzas the nature of the applause and what followed the applause had said it all a polite and perfunctory recognition of the cast members had preceded a hasty exodus from the theatre which itself had been followed by an opening night party not unlike a wake after that the london reviews had finished what the first night wordofmouth had begun two hugely expensive productions sank like concrete battleships and david kingryder had the dubious pleasure of reading countless analyses of his creative decline life without chandler was the sort of headline hed read from the reviews of the one or two theatrical critics possessing an emotion akin to sympathy but the rest of themthe types who crafted vituperative metaphors over their morning weetabix and spent months waiting for the opportunity to plug them into a commentary more noted for its vitriol than its informationhad been merciless hed been called everything from an artistic charlatan to a vessel buoyed by past glories with those glories ostensibly burgeoning from a single source michael chandler david kingryder wondered if other musical partnerships had undergone the scrutiny that his collaboration with michael chandler had he doubted it it seemed to him that musicians and lyricists from gilbert and sullivan to rice and lloydwebber had bloomed had faded had risen to prominence had flourished had failed had vanquished critics had stumbled and had gloried all without the accompanying baying of the jackals that had snapped at his own heels the romance of his association with michael chandler had called for this analysis naturally when one partner of a team who mounted twelve of the west ends most successful productions dies in such a ghastly stupid way then a legend is going to be born from that dying and michael had died just that sort of death becoming lost in an underwater florida cave that had claimed three hundred other divers violating every rule of diving by going alone going at night going inebriated and leaving only an anchored fifteenfoot boat to mark the spot where hed entered the water he left behind a wife a mistress four children six dogs and a partner with whom hed dreamed of fame fortune and theatrical success from their shared childhood in oxford sons of assemblymen at the austinrover plant so there had been a logic to the interest that the media had displayed in david kingryders emotional and artistic rehabilitation following michaels untimely death and while the critics had battered him for his first solo attempt at pop opera five years later theyd used fleececovered clubs as if in the belief that a man who lost both his longtime partner and his lifelong friend in one fell swoop deserved at least a single opportunity to fail without being publicly humiliated in his effort to find the muse by himself these same critics hadnt been so merciful upon his second failure however but that was over now that was the past next to him in the box ginny cried out we did it david we bloody well did it as she doubtless realised thatall charges of nepotism be damned when hed chosen his wife to direct the productionshed just risen to the sort of heights occupied by artists like hands nunn and hall davids son matthewas his fathers manager knowing only too well how much they had at stake in the productiongrabbed davids hand hard and said gruffly damn well done dad and david wanted to warm to those words and to what they implied a firm withdrawal of the initial doubts that matthew had expressed when told of his fathers intention to turn shakespeares greatest tragedy into his own musical triumph youre sure you want to do this hed asked and the rest of his remarks had remained unspoken arent you setting yourself up for a final deadly fall he was indeed david had confirmed at the time if only to himself but what other option did he really have than to try to restore his name as an artist hed managed to do just that not only were the audience on their feet not only were the cast members ecstatically applauding him from the stage but the criticswhose seat numbers he had memorised the better to blow them up matthew had noted sardonicallywere also standing making no move to depart and joining in the sort of approbation that david had come to fear was as lost to him as was michael chandler that approbation only grew in the ensuing hours at the opening night party at the dorchester in a ballroom creatively converted into elsinore castle david stood at his wifes side at the end of a receiving line comprising the productions leading actors along that line stepped londons foremost glitterati stars of stage and screen gushed over their colleagues and privately gnashed their teeth to conceal their envy celebrities from all walks of life pronounced kingryder productions hamlet everything from top notch and just fab darling to kept me on the absolute edge of my seat it girls and sloanesslinkily attired displaying an astonishing degree of cleavage and famous either for being famous or for having famous parentsdeclared that someone finally made shakespeare fun representatives from that notable drain on the nations imagination and economythe royal familyoffered their best wishes for success and while everyone was pleased to press the flesh of hamlet and his thespian cohorts and while everyone was happy to congratulate virginia elliott for her masterful direction of her husbands pop opera everyone was particularly eager to talk to the man whod been vilified and pilloried for more than a decade so there was triumph to be felt in spades and david kingryder wanted to feel it he was starved for a sensation that would tell him life was opening before him instead of closing but that was the feeling that he couldnt escape its over boomed in his ears like the cannon if he had been able to talk to her about what he had been going through since the curtain call david knew that ginny would tell him his feelings of depression anxiety and despair were normal its the natural letdown after opening night she would have said she would have pointed out that she had far more reason to be let down than he had anyway as director her job was over now true there were various components of the production to be tweakedit would be satisfying if the lighting designer would cooperate and get the last scene right wouldnt itbut by and large she had to let go to begin the process all over again on another production of another play in his case the morning would bring a flood of congratulatory phone calls requests for interviews and offers to mount the pop opera all over the world thus he could dig into another staging of hamlet or go on to something else she didnt have that option if he had confessed that he just didnt have it in him to go on to anything else she would have said of course you havent at the moment thats normal david how could you right now give yourself some leeway to recover wont you you need time to refill the well the well was the wellspring of creativity and if hed pointed out to his wife that she never seemed to need to refill her own supplies she would have argued that directing was different from creating the product in the first place she at least had raw materials to work withnot to mention a score of fellow artists with whom to knock heads as the production took shape he had only the music room the piano endless solitude and his imagination and the worlds expectations he thought morosely they would always be there as the price of success he and ginny left the dorchester as soon as they were able to manage it surreptitiously shed protested at first when hed indicated that he wanted to leaveas had matthew who always his fathers manager had argued that it wouldnt look good for david kingryder to depart the party before the partys end but david had claimed exhaustion and strungout nerves and matthew and virginia had accepted that selfdiagnosis after all his complexion was jaundiced and his demeanour throughout the productionalternating between standing sitting and pacing in their boxstrongly suggested a man whose personal resources had finally been depleted they rode from london in silence david with a vodka curved into his palm and his thumb and forefinger pressed into his eyebrows ginny making several attempts to draw him into conversation she suggested a holiday as a reward for their years of endeavour rhodes she mentioned capri and crete the jollyhockeysticks tone of her voice told david that she was becoming increasingly concerned with her failure to reach him and considering their history togethershed been his twelfth mistress before hed made her his fifth wifethere was good reason for her to suspect that his condition had nothing to do with firstnight nerves letdown after triumph or anxiety about critical reaction to his work the past few months had been rough on them as a couple and she knew quite well what hed done to cure himself of the impotence hed experienced with his last wife since hed done it by moving on to ginny herself so when she finally said darling it happens sometimes its nerves thats all itll all come right at the end of the day he wanted to reassure her but he didnt have the words he was still trying to find them when their limousine entered the tunnel of silver maples that characterised the woodland in which they lived here not an hour from london the countryside was thickly grown with trees and footpaths trod by generations of foresters and farmers disappeared into an undergrowth of ferns the car turned between the two oaks that marked their drive twenty yards along an iron gate swung open the road beyond curved beneath alders poplars and beeches skirting a pond where the reflection of stars made a second sky it climbed a slight rise swung past a row of silent bungalows and pooled out into the alluvial fan of the entrance to the kingryder mansion their housekeeper had laid out supper for them assembling an array of davids favourite foods mr matthew did phone portia explained in her quiet dignified voice a runaway from the sudan at the age of fifteen shed been with virginia for the last ten years and she had the melancholy face of a beautiful sorrowing black madonna my warmest congratulations to both of you she added david thanked her he stood in the dining room where the windows stretched from floor to ceiling and reflected all three of them in the glass he admired the epergne that spilled white roses onto plaits of ivy he fingered one of the thin silver forks he used his thumbnail against a drip of candle wax and he knew he wouldnt be able to force a crumb of food past the constriction in his throat so he told his wife that he needed a bit of time alone to unwind from the evening he would join her later he said he just needed a while to decompress one always expected an artist to retreat to the heartbeat of his artistry so david went to his music room he flipped on the lights he poured another vodka and placed the tumbler on the unprotected top of the grand piano he realised as he did it that michael would never have done such a thing michael had been careful that way understanding the value of a musical instrument respectful of its boundaries its dimensions its possibilities hed been careful about most of his life as well it was only on one crazy night in florida that hed got careless david sat at the piano without thinking or planning his fingers sought out an aria he loved it was a melody from his most auspicious failuremercyand he hummed as he played it trying and failing to recall the words to a song that had once held the key to his future as he played he let his gaze travel the walls of the room four monuments to his success shelves held awards frames enclosed certificates posters and playbills announced productions that even to this day were mounted in every part of the world and photographs by the silverframed score documented his life michael was there among them and when davids glance fell on his old friends face his fingers shiftedof their own accordfrom the aria hed been playing to the song he knew was destined to be the hit of hamlet what dreams may come was its title taken from the princes most famous soliloquy he played it only halfway through before he had to stop he found that he was so monumentally tired that his hands fell from the keys and his eyes closed but still he could see michaels face you shouldnt have died he told his partner i thought a success would make everything different but it only makes the prospect of failure worse he took up his drink again he left the room he tossed back the vodka set the tumbler next to a travertine urn in a recessed alcove and didnt notice when he failed to push the glass in far enough and it fell to the carpeted floor above him in the enormous house he could hear a bath running ginny would be soaking away the stress of the evening and the tension of the months that had preceded it he wished that he could do the same it seemed to him that he had so much more cause he allowed himself to relive those glorious moments of triumph a final time the audience rising to its feet before the curtain call had begun the cheers the hoarse shouts of bravo all that should have been enough for david but it wasnt it couldnt be it fell if not on ears that were deaf then on ears that were listening to another voice entirely petersham mews and elvaston place ten oclock but where where are they oh youll work that out and now when he tried to hear the praise the excited chatter the paeans that were supposed to be his air his light his food and his drink all david could hear were those last four words youll work that out and it was time he climbed the stairs and went to the bedroom beyond behind the closed door to the bathroom his wife was enjoying her soak she was singing with a determined happiness that told him how worried she actually was about everything from the state of his nerves to the state of his soul she was a good woman virginia elliott david thought she was the very best of his wives it had been his intention to stay married to her till the end of his days he simply hadnt realised how abbreviated that time would turn out to be three quick movements did the job neatly he took the gun from a drawer in the bedside table he raised it he pulled the trigger september derbyshire chapter julian britton was a man who knew that his life thus far had amounted to nothing he bred his dogs he managed the crumbling ruin that was his familys estate and daily he tried to lecture his father away from the bottle that was the extent of it he hadnt been a success at anything save pouring gin down the drain and now at twentyseven years of age he felt branded by failure but he couldnt allow that to affect him tonight tonight he had to prevail he began with his appearance giving himself a ruthless scrutiny in his bedrooms cheval glass he straightened the collar of his shirt and flicked a piece of lint from his shoulder he stared at his face and schooled his features into the expression he wanted them to wear he should look completely serious he decided concerned yes because concern was reasonable but he shouldnt look conflicted and certainly he shouldnt look ripped up inside and wondering how he came to be where he was at this precise moment with his world a shambles as to what he was going to say two sleepless nights and two endless days had given julian plenty of time to rehearse what remarks he wished to make when the appointed hour rolled round indeed it was in elaborate but silent fantasy conversations tinged with no more worry than was enough to suggest that he had nothing personal invested in the matterthat julian had spent most of the past two nights and two days that had followed nicola maidens unbelievable announcement now after fortyeight hours engaged in endless colloquies within his own skull julian was eager to get on with things even if he had no assurance that his words would bring the result he wanted he turned from the cheval glass and fetched his car keys from the top of the chest of drawers the fine sheen of dust that usually covered its walnut surface had been removed this told julian that his cousin had once again submitted to the cleaning furies a sure sign that shed met defeat yet another time in her determined course of sobering up her uncle samantha had come to derbyshire with just that intention eight months previously an angel of mercy whod one day shown up at broughton manor with the mission of reuniting a family torn asunder for more than three decades she hadnt made much progress in that direction however and julian wondered how much longer she was going to put up with his fathers bent towards the bottle weve got to get him off the booze julie samantha had said to him only that morning you must see how crucial it is at this point nicola on the other hand knowing his father eight years and not merely eight months had long been of a liveandletlive frame of mind shed said more than once if your dads choice is to drink himself silly theres nothing you can do about it jules and theres nothing that sam can do either but then nicola didnt know how it felt to see ones father slipping ever more inexorably towards debauchery absorbed in intensely inebriated delusions about the romance of his past she after all had grown up in a home where how things seemed was identical to how things actually were she had two parents whose love never wavered and shed never suffered the dual desertion of a flowerchild mother flitting off to study with a tapestryclad guru the night before ones own twelfth birthday and a father whose devotion to the bottle far exceeded any attachment he might have displayed towards his three children in fact had nicola ever once cared to analyse the differences in their individual upbringing julian thought she might have seen that every single one of her bloody decisionsat that he brought his thoughts up short he would not head in that direction he could not afford to head in that direction he could not afford to let his mind wander from the task that was immediately at hand listen to me he grabbed his wallet from the chest and shoved it into his pocket youre good enough for anyone she got scared shitless she took a wrong turn thats the end of it remember that and remember that everyone knows how good the two of you always were together he had faith in this fact nicola maiden and julian britton had been part of each others life for years everyone who knew them had long ago concluded that they belonged together it was only nicola who it appeared had never come to terms with this fact i know that we were never engaged hed told her two nights previously in response to her declaration that she was moving away from the peaks permanently and would only be back for brief visits henceforth but weve always had an understanding havent we i wouldnt be sleeping with you if i wasnt serious about come on nick damn it you know me it wasnt the proposal of marriage hed planned on making to her and she hadnt taken it as such shed said bluntly jules i like you enormously youre terrific and youve been a real friend and we get on far better than ive ever got on with any other bloke then you see but i dont love you she went on sex doesnt equate to love its only in films and books that it does hed been too stunned at first to speak it was as if his mind had become a blackboard and someone had taken a rubber to it before he had a chance to make any notes so shed continued she would she told him go on being his girlfriend in the peak district if thats what he wanted shed be coming to see her parents now and again and shed always have timeand be happy she saidto see julian as well they could even continue as lovers whenever she was in the area if he wished that was fine by her but as to marriage they were too different as people she explained i know how much you want to save broughton manor shed said thats your dream and youll make it come true but i dont share that dream and im not going to hurt either you or myself by pretending i do thats not fair on anyone which was when he finally repossessed his wits long enough to say bitterly its the god damn money and the fact ive got none or at least not enough to suit your tastes julian it isnt not exactly shed turned from him briefly giving a long sigh let me explain hed listened for what had seemed like an hour although shed likely spoken ten minutes or less at the end after everything had been said between them and shed climbed out of the rover and disappeared into the dark gabled porch of maiden hall hed driven home numbly shellshocked with grief confusion and surprise thinking no she couldnt she cant mean no after sleepless night number one hed come to realisepast his own painhow great was the need for him to take action hed phoned and shed agreed to see him she would always she said be willing to see him he gave a final glance in the mirror before he left the room and he treated himself to a last affirmation you were always good together keep that in mind he slipped along the dim upstairs passage of the manor house and looked into the small room that his father used as a parlour his familys increasingly straitened financial circumstances had effected a general retreat from all the larger rooms downstairs that had slowly been made uninhabitable as their various antiques paintings and objets dart were sold to make ends meet now the brittons lived entirely on the houses upper floor there were abundant rooms for them but they were cramped and dark jeremy britton was in the parlour as it was half past ten he was thoroughly blotto head on his chest and a cigarette burning down between his fingers julian crossed the room and removed the fag from his fathers hand jeremy didnt stir julian cursed quietly looking at him at the promise of intelligence vigour and pride completely eradicated by the addiction his father was going to burn the place down someday and there were timeslike nowwhen julian thought that complete conflagration might be all for the best he crushed out jeremys cigarette and reached into his shirt pocket for the packet of dunhills he removed it and did the same with his fathers lighter he grabbed up the gin bottle and left the room he was dumping the gin cigarettes and lighter into the dustbins at the back of the manor house when he heard her speak caught him at it again julie he started looked about but failed to see her in the gloom then she rose from where shed been sitting on the edge of the drystone wall that divided the back entrance of the manor from the first of its overgrown gardens an untrimmed wisteriabeginning to lose its leaves with the approach of autumnhad sheltered her she dusted off the seat of her khaki shorts and sauntered over to join him im beginning to think he wants to kill himself samantha said in the practical manner that was her nature i just havent come up with the reason why he doesnt need a reason julian said shortly just the means i try to keep him off the sauce but hes got bottles everywhere she glanced at the dark manor house that rose before them like a fortress in the landscape i do try julian i know its important she looked back at him and regarded his clothes youre looking very smart i didnt think to dress up was i supposed to julian returned her look blankly his hands moving to his chest to pat his shirt searching for something that he knew wasnt there youve forgotten havent you samantha said she was very good at making intuitive leaps julian waited for elucidation the eclipse she said the eclipse he thought about it he clapped a hand to his forehead god the eclipse sam hell id forgotten is the eclipse tonight are you going somewhere to see it better she said with a nod to the spot from which shed just emerged ive got us some provisions cheese and fruit some bread a bit of sausage wine i thought we might want it if we have to wait longer than youd thought to wait oh hell samantha he wasnt sure how to put it he hadnt intended her to think he meant to watch the eclipse with her he hadnt intended her to think he meant to watch the eclipse at all have i got the date wrong the tone of her voice spoke her disappointment she already knew that she had the date right and that if she wanted to see the eclipse from eyam moor she was going to have to hike out there alone his mention of the lunar eclipse had been a casual remark at least thats how hed intended it to be taken hed said conversationally one can see it quite well from eyam moor its supposed to happen round half past eleven are you interested in astronomy sam samantha had obviously interpreted this as an invitation and julian felt a momentary annoyance with his cousins presumption but he did his best to hide it because he owed her so much it was in the cause of reconciling her mother with her unclejulians fatherthat shed been making her lengthy visits to broughton manor from winchester for the past eight months each stay had become progressively longer as she found more employment round the estate either in the renovation of the manor house proper or in the smooth running of the tournaments fetes and reenactments that julian organised in the grounds as yet another source of britton income her helpful presence had been a real godsend since julians siblings had long fled the family nest and jeremy hadnt lifted a finger since hed inherited the propertyand proceeded to populate it with his fellow flowerchildren and run it into the groundshortly after his twentyfifth birthday still grateful as julian was for sams help he wished his cousin hadnt assumed so much hed felt guilty about the amount of work she was doing purely from the goodness of her heart and hed been casting about aimlessly for some form of repayment he had no available money to offer her not that she would have needed or accepted it had he done so but he did have his dogs as well as his knowledge of and enthusiasm for derbyshire and wanting to make her feel welcome for as long as possible at broughton manor hed offered her the only thing he had occasional activities with the harriers as well as conversation and it was a conversation about the eclipse that she had misunderstood i hadnt thought he kicked at a bare patch in the gravel where a dandelion was shooting up a furry stalk im sorry im heading over to maiden hall oh funny julian thought how a single syllable could carry the weight of everything from condemnation to delight stupid me she said i cant think how i got the impression that you wanted to well anyway ill make it up to you he hoped he sounded earnest if i hadnt already planned you know how it is oh yes she said mustnt disappoint your nicola julian she offered him a brief cool smile and ducked into the hollow of the wisteria vine she hooked a basket over her arm another time julian said whatever she didnt look at him as she walked past slipped through the gateway and disappeared into the inner courtyard of broughton manor he felt the breath leave him in a gusty sigh he hadnt realised hed been holding it back sorry he said quietly to her absence but this is important if you knew how important youd understand he made the drive to padley gorge swiftly heading northwest towards bakewell where he spun across the old mediaeval bridge that spanned the river wye he used the journey for a final rehearsal of his remarks and by the time hed reached the sloping drive to maiden hall he was fairly assured that before the evening was out his plans would bear the fruit he wanted maiden hall sat midway up a slope of woodland here the land was thick with sessile oaks and the incline leading up to the hall was canopied with chestnuts and limes julian cruised up this drive negotiated the serpentine turns with the skill of long practise and chugged to a stop next to a mercedes sports car in the graveled enclosure that was reserved for guests he skirted the main entrance and went in through the kitchen where andy maiden was watching his chef put the flame to a tray of créme brulée the chefone christianlouis ferrerhad been brought on board from france some five years previously to enhance the solid if not inspired reputation of maiden halls food at the moment however with culinary blow lamp in hand ferrer looked more like an arsonist than un grand artiste de la cuisine the expression on andys face suggested that he was sharing julians thoughts only when christianlouis had successfully turned the coating into a perfect thin shell of glaze saying et la voila andee with the sort of condescending smile one gives to a doubting thomas whos once again had his doubts proven groundless did andy look up and see julian watching ive never liked flame throwing in the kitchen he admitted with an embarrassed smile hello julian whats the news from broughton and regions beyond this constituted his usual greeting julian made his usual response alls well with the righteous but as for the rest of mankind forget it andy smoothed down the hairs of his greying moustache and observed the younger man in a friendly fashion while christianlouis slid the tray of créme brûlée through a service hatch to the dining room he said maintenant on en a fini pour ce soir and began removing the white apron that was stained with the evenings sauces as the frenchman disappeared into a small changing room andy said vive la france wryly and rolled his eyes then to julian join us for a coffee weve one group left in the dining room and everyone else in the lounge for the afterdinners any residents tonight julian asked an old victorian lodge once used as a hunting retreat by a branch of the saxecoburg family maiden hall had ten bedrooms all had been individually decorated by andys wife when the maidens had made their escape from london a decade previously eight were let out to discerning travelers who wanted the privacy of a hotel combined with the intimacy of a home fully booked andy replied weve had a record summer what with the fine weather so whats it to be coffee brandy hows your dad by the way julian winced inwardly at the mental association implied in andys words doubtless the whole blasted county paired his father with one type of booze or another nothing for me he said ive come for nicola nicola why she isnt here julian not here shes not left derbyshire already has she because she said no no andy began storing the kitchen knives in a wooden stand sliding them into slots with a neat snick as he continued talking shes gone camping didnt she tell you she set out midmorning yesterday but i spoke to her julian thought back reaching for a time early yesterday morning she wouldnt have forgotten that quickly looks like she has women you know what did you two have on julian sidestepped the question did she go alone always has done andy replied you know nicola how well he did where did she take the proper gear andy turned from storing his knives obviously he heard something worrying in julians tone she wouldnt have gone without her gear she knows how fast the weather changes out there at any rate i helped her stow it in the car myself why whats going on did you two have a row julian could give a truthful answer to the last question they hadnt had a row at least not what andy would have considered a row he said andy she shouldve been back by now we were going to sheffield she wanted to see a film at this time of night a special showing julian felt his face getting hot as he explained the tradition behind the rocky horror picture show but andys time undercover in what he always referred to as his other life had exposed him to the film long ago and he waved the explanation off this time when he reached for his moustache and stroked it thoughtfully he frowned as well youre certain about the night she couldnt have thought you meant tomorrow i should have preferred to see her last night julian said it was nicola who set the date for tonight and im certain she said shed be back this afternoon im certain andy dropped his hand his eyes were grave he looked beyond julian to the casement window above the sink there was nothing to see but their reflections but julian knew from his expression that andy was thinking about what lay beyond them in the darkness vast moors populated only by sheep abandoned quarries reclaimed by nature limestone cliffs giving way to screes prehistoric fortresses of tumbling stone there were myriad limestone caves to entrap one copper mines whose walls and ceilings could collapse cairns whose hotchpotch of stones could snap the ankle of an unwary hiker gritstone ridges where a climber could fall and lie for days or weeks before being found the district stretched from manchester to sheffield from stokeontrent to derby and more than a dozen times each year mountain rescue was called to bring in someone whod broken an arm or a legor worsein the peaks if andy maidens daughter was lost or hurt somewhere out there it was going to take the effort of more than two men standing in a kitchen to find her andy said lets get on to the police julian julians initial impulse also was to phone the police upon reflection however he dreaded the thought of everything phoning the police implied but in this brief moment of his hesitation andy acted he strode out to the reception desk to make the call julian hurried after him he found andy hunched over the phone as if he intended to shelter himself from potential eavesdroppers still only he and julian stood in reception while the halls guests lingered over coffees and brandies in the lounge at the other end of the corridor it was from this direction that nan maiden approached just as andys connection to the buxton police went through she came out of the lounge bearing a tray that held an empty cafetiére and the used cups and saucers of coffee for two she smiled and said why julian hullo we werent expecting but her words petered out as she took in her husbands surreptitious appearancehuddled over the phone like an anonymous callerand julians accomplicelike hovering nearby whats going on at her question julian felt as if the word guilty were tattooed on his forehead when nan said whats happened he said nothing and waited for andy to take the lead nicolas father however spoke in a low voice into the phone saying twentyfive and completely ignoring what his wife had asked but twentyfive seemed to tell nan what julian wouldnt put into words and what andy avoided nicola she breathed and she joined them at the reception desk sliding her tray onto its surface where it dislodged a willow basket of hotel brochures that tumbled to the floor no one picked them up has something happened to nicola andys answer was calm julian and nick had a date this evening which shes apparently forgotten he told his wife left hand over the mouthpiece of the phone were trying to track her down he offered the lie ingenuously with the skill of a man whod once made falsehood his stockintrade i was thinking that she might have gone to see will upman on her way home to pave the way for another job next summer everything all right with the guests love nans quick grey eyes darted from her husband to julian exactly whore you talking to andy nancy tell me he didnt do so on the other end of the line someone spoke and andy looked at his watch he said unfortunately were not altogether sure no thanks fine i appreciate it he rang off and picked up the tray that his wife had placed on the desk he headed towards the kitchen nan and julian followed christianlouis was just leaving his chefs whites changed for jeans trainers and an oxford university sweatshirt with its sleeves cut off he grabbed the handlebars of a bicycle that was leaning against the wall and taking a moment to measure the tension among the other three people in the kitchen he said bonsoir dermain and he quickly left them through the window they saw the white glow of his bicycle lamp as he pedaled off andy i want the truth his wife planted herself in front of him she was a small woman nearly ten inches shorter than her husband but her body was solid and tightly muscled the physique of a woman two decades younger than her sixty years youve had the truth andy said reasonably julian and nicola had a date nicks forgotten julians got himself into a twist and hed like to track her down im helping him out but that wasnt will upman on the phone was it nan demanded why would nicola be seeing will upman at she glanced at the kitchen clock a functional and institutional timepiece that hung above a rack of dinner plates it was eleventwenty and all of them knew that the hour was unlikely for paying a social call on ones employer which was what will upman had been to nicola for the last three months she said she was going camping dont tell me you actually think she stopped to have a chat with will upman in the middle of a camping trip and why would nicola fail to show up for a date with julian shes never done that nan shifted her sharp gaze have you two had a row she asked julian his immediate discomfort came from two sources having to answer the question another time and concluding that nicola hadnt yet told her parents of her intention to leave derbyshire permanently she would hardly have been seeking her next summers employment if shed been planning to leave the county actually we talked about marriage julian decided to say we were sorting out the future nans eyes widened something akin to relief wiped the worry from her face marriage nicolas agreed to marry you when i mean when did all this happen and she never said a word why this is wonderful news its absolutely brilliant heavens julian it makes me feel giddy have you told your dad julian didnt want to lie outright but he couldnt bring himself to tell the full truth he settled on the precarious middle ground actually were just at the talking stage in fact we were supposed to talk again tonight andy maiden had been watching julian curiously as if he knew very well that any talk of marriage between his daughter and julian britton would be as unlikely as a discussion on raising sheep he said hang on i thought you were going to sheffield right but we planned to talk on the way well nicola would never forget that nan declared no woman is likely to forget she has a date to talk about marriage and then to her husband which is something you ought to know very well she was silent for a moment dwellingso it seemedon that final thought while julian dwelt on the uneasy fact that andy still had not answered his wifes questions about the phone call hed made nan reached her own conclusion about this god youve just phoned the police you think that somethings happened to her and you didnt want me to know about it did you neither andy nor julian replied this was answer enough and what was i to think when the police arrived nan demanded or was i just supposed to keep serving coffee i knew youd worry her husband said there may be no cause nicola could easily be out there in the dark lying hurt or trapped or god knows what else and youboth of youdidnt think i should know because i might worry youre working yourself into a state right now thats why i didnt want to tell you till i had to it may be nothing its probably nothing julian and i agree on that well have it all sorted out in an hour or two nan attempted to shove a handful of hair behind her ear cut in a strange fashion that she called a beretlong on the top and clipped on the sidesit was too short to do anything but flop back into place well set out after her she decided one of us must start looking for her at once one of us looking for nicola isnt going to do much good julian pointed out theres no telling where she went but we know all her haunts arbor low thors cave peveril castle nan mentioned half a dozen other locations all of them inadvertently serving to underscore the point that julian had been attempting to make there was no correlation between nicolas favourite spots and their locations in the peak district they were as far north as the outskirts of holmfirth as far south as ashbourne and the lower part of the tissington trail it was going to take a team to find her andy pulled a bottle out of a cupboard along with three tumblers into each he poured a shot of brandy he handed round the glasses saying get that down nans hands circled her glass but she didnt drink somethings happened to her we dont know anything thats why the police are on their way the police in the person of an ageing constable called price arrived not thirty minutes later he asked the expected questions of them when had she left how was she equipped had she set off alone what seemed to be her state of mind depressed unhappy worried what had she declared as her intentions had she actually stated a time of her return who spoke to her last had she received any visitors letters phone calls had anything happened recently that might have prompted her to run off julian joined andy and nan maiden in their efforts to impress upon constable price the gravity of nicolas failure to reappear at maiden hall but price seemed determined to go his own way and a painstaking hairtearingly slow way it was he wrote in his notebook at a ponderous pace taking down a description of nicola he wanted to know about her equipment he took them through her activities during the last two weeks and he seemed terminally fascinated by the fact that on the morning before shed left for her hike shed received three phone calls from individuals who wouldnt give their names so that nan could pass them along to nicola before she came to the phone one man and two women price asked four times i dont know i dont know and what does it matter nan said testily it may have been the same woman calling twice what difference does it make whats that got to do with nicola but just one man constable price said god in heaven how many times am i going to have to one man andy interposed nan pressed her lips into an angry line her eyes bored holes into prices skull one man she repeated it wasnt you who phoned this to julian i know julians voice nan said it wasnt julian but you have a relationship with the young lady mr britton theyre engaged to be married nan said not exactly engaged julian quickly clarified and he cursed in silence as the damnable heat rose from his collarbone to suffuse his cheeks yet again had a bit of a quarrel price asked voice shrewd another man involved where you didnt like it jesus julian thought why did everyone assume theyd rowed there hadnt been a single harsh word between them there hadnt been time for that they hadnt quarreled julian reported steadily and he knew nothing about another man absolutely nothing he asserted for good measure they had a date to talk about their wedding plans nan said well actually dyou honestly know any woman whod fail to show up for that and you are certain she intended to return by this evening constable price asked andy he shifted his eyes over his notes going on to say her gear suggests she might have intended a longer outing i hadnt thought much about it till julian stopped by to fetch her to sheffield andy admitted ah the constable eyed julian with more suspicion than julian felt was warranted then he flipped his notebook closed the radio receiver that he wore from his shoulder buzzed with an incomprehensible stream of babble he reached up and turned down the volume easing his notebook into his pocket he said well shes done a runner before and thiss no different to that i expect well have ourselves a wait till whatre you talking about nan cut in this isnt a runaway teenager were reporting shes twentyfive years old for heavens sake shes a responsible adult she has a job a boyfriend a family she hasnt run off shes disappeared at present prhaps she has the constable agreed but as shes bunked off beforeand our files do show that madamtill we know shes not doing another runner we cant send a team out after her she was seventeen years old when she last ran off nan argued wed just moved here from london she was lonely unhappy we were caught up getting the hall in order and we failed to give her the proper attention all shed needed was guidance so that nancy andy put his hand gently on the back of her neck we cant just do nothing no choice in the matter the constable said implacably weve got our procedures ill make my report and if shes not turned up by this time tomorrow well have ourselves another look at the problem nan spun to her husband do something phone mountain rescue yourself julian interposed nan mountain rescue cant begin a search unless they have an idea he gestured towards the windows and hoped she would fill in the blanks as a member of mountain rescue himself hed been on dozens of cases but the rescuers had always had a general idea of where to begin looking for a hiker since neither julian nor nicolas parents could even generalise about nicolas point of departure the only avenue left to them was to wait until first light when the police could request a helicopter from the rae because of the hour and their lack of information julian knew that the only possible activity that actually could have grown from their midnight meeting with constable price would have been a preliminary phone call to the closest mountain rescue organization telling them to assemble their volunteers at dawn but clearly they had failed to impress upon the constable the gravity of the situation mountain rescue responded only to the police and the policeat least at the moment and in the person of constable pricewerent themselves responding they were wasting time talking to the man julian could see from andys expression that hed arrived at this same conclusion he said thank you for coming constable and when his wife would have protested andy went on well phone you tomorrow evening if nicola hasnt turned up andy he put his arm round her shoulders and she turned into his chest he didnt speak until the constable had ducked out of the kitchen door gone to his panda car switched on the ignition and flicked on the headlamps and then he spoke to julian not nan she always likes camping in the white peak julian therere maps in reception would you fetch them please well each want to know where the others searching chapter it was just after seven the next morning when julian returned to maiden hall if he hadnt explored every possible site from consall wood to alport height he certainly felt as if he had torch in one hand loud hailer in the other hed gone through the motions hed trudged the leafy woodland path from wettonmill up the steep grade to thors cave hed scoured along the river manifold hed shone his torchlight up the slope of thorpe cloud hed followed the river dove as far south as the old mediaeval manor at norbury at the village of alton hed hiked a distance along the staffordshire way hed driven as many as he could manage of the single lane roads that nicola favoured and hed paused periodically to use the loud hailer in calling her name deliberately marking his presence in every location hed awakened sheep farmers and campers during his eight hours search for her at heart hed believed there was no chance that he would find her but at least hed been doing something instead of waiting at home by the phone at the end of it all he felt anxious and empty he was hungry as well he could have eaten a leg of lamb had one been offered it was odd he thought just the previous nightwrought up with anticipation and nerveshed barely been able to touch his dinner indeed samantha had been a bit put out at the manner in which he merely picked at her fine sole amandine shed taken his lack of appetite personally and while his father had leered about a man having other appetites to take care of sam and wasnt their julie about to do just that with weallknowwho this very night samantha had pressed her lips together and cleared the table hed have been able to do justice to one of her tablegroaning breakfasts now julian thought but as it was well it didnt seem right to think about foodlet alone to ask for itdespite the fact that the paying guests in maiden hall would be tucking into everything from cornflakes to kippers within the half hour he neednt have worried about the propriety in hoping for food under the circumstances however when he walked into the kitchen of maiden hall a plate of scrambled eggs mushrooms and sausage sat untouched before nan maiden she offered it to him the moment she saw him saying they want me to eat but i cant please take it i expect you could do with a meal they were the early kitchen staff two women from the nearby village of grindleford who cooked in the mornings when the sophisticated culinary efforts of christianlouis were as unnecessary as they would be unwanted bring it with you julian nan put a cafetire on a tray with coffee mugs milk and sugar she led the way into the dining room only one table was occupied nan nodded at the couple whod placed themselves in the bay window overlooking the garden and after politely inquiring about their nights sleep and their days plans she joined julian at the table hed chosen some distance away by the kitchen door the fact that she never wore makeup put nan at a disadvantage her eyes were troughed by bluegrey flesh her skin which was lightly freckled from time spent on her mountain bicycle when she had a free hour in which to exercise was otherwise completely pallid her lipshaving long ago lost the natural blush of youthbore fine lines that began beneath her nose and were ghostly white she hadnt slept that much was clear she had however changed her clothes from the night before apparently knowing that it would hardly do for the proprietress of maiden hall to show up to greet her guests in the morning wearing what shed worn as their hostess at dinner on the previous night so her cocktail dress had been replaced by stirrup trousers and a tailored blouse she poured them each a cup of coffee and watched as julian tucked into the eggs and mushrooms she said tell me about the engagement i need something to keep from thinking the worst when she spoke tears caused her eyes to look glazed but she didnt weep julian made himself mirror her control have you heard from andy not back yet she circled her hands round her mug her grip was so tight that her fingerstheir nails habitually bitten to the quickwere bleached of colour tell me something about the two of you julian please its going to be all right the last thing julian wanted to force upon himself was having to concoct a scenario in which he and nicola fell in love like ordinary human beings realised that love and founded upon it a life together he couldnt face attempting that lie at the moment shes an experienced hiker and she didnt go out there unprepared i know that but i dont want to think about what it means that she hasnt come home so tell me about the engagement where were you when you asked her what did you say what kind of wedding will it be and when julian felt a chill at the double direction nans thoughts were taking in either case they brought up subjects he didnt want to consider one set led him to dwell upon the unthinkable the other did nothing but encourage more lies he went for something that both of them knew nicolas been hiking in the peaks since you moved from london even if shes hurt herself she knows what to do till help arrives he forked up a portion of egg and mushroom its lucky that she and i had a date if we hadnt god knows when we mightve set out to find her nan looked away but her eyes were still liquid she lowered her head we must be hopeful julian went on shes well equipped and she doesnt panic in a tough situation when things get dicey we all know that but if shes fallen or got lost in one of the caves julian it happens you know that no matter how well prepared someone is the worst still happens sometimes theres nothing that says anythings happened i looked only in the south part of the white peak therere more square miles out there than can be covered by one man in total darkness in an evening she could be anywhere she could even have gone to the dark peak without our knowing he didnt mention the nightmare mountain rescue faced whenever someone did disappear in the dark peak there was after all no mercy in fracturing nans tenuous hold on her calm she knew the reality about the dark peak anyway and she didnt need him to point out to her that while roads made most of the white peak accessible its sister to the north could be traversed only by horseback on foot or by helicopter if a hiker got lost or hurt up there it generally took bloodhounds to find him she said shed marry you though nan declared more to herself than to julian it seemed she did say that shed marry you julian the poor woman seemed so eager to be lied to that julian found himself just as eager to oblige her we hadnt quite got to yes or no yet thats what last night was supposed to be about was she did she seem pleased i only ask because shed seemed to have well shed seemed to have some sort of plans and im not quite sure carefully julian speared a mushroom plans id thought yes it seemed so he looked at nan nan looked at him he was the one to blink he said steadily nicola had no plans that i know of nan the kitchen door swung open a few inches the face of one of the grindleford women appeared in the aperture she said mrs maiden mr britton in a hushed voice and she used her head to indicate the direction of the kitchen youre wanted the motion implied andy was leaning against one of the work tops facing it his weight on his hands and his head bowed when his wife said his name he looked up his face was drawn with exhaustion and his growth of peppery whiskers fanned out from his moustache and shadowed his cheeks his grey hair was uncombed looking windblown although there wasnt any wind to speak of this morning his eyes went to nan then slid away julian prepared himself to hear the worst her cars on the edge of calder moor andy told them his wife drew her hands into a fist at her breast thank god she said still andy didnt look at her his expression indicated that thanks were premature he knew what julian knew and what nan herself might well have acknowledged had she paused to probe for the possibilities that were indicated by the location of nicolas saab calder moor was vast it began just west of the road stretching between blackwell and brough and it comprised endless expanses of heather and gorse four caverns numerous cairns and forts and barrows spanning time from paleolithic through the iron age gritstone outcroppings and limestone caves and fissures through which more than one foolish tripper had crawled for adventure and become hopelessly stuck julian knew that andy was thinking of this as he stood in the kitchen at the end of his long nights search for nicola but andy was thinking something else as well andy was knowing something else in fact that much was evident from the manner in which he straightened and began slapping the knuckles of one hand against the heel of the other julian said andy for gods sake tell us andys gaze fixed on his wife the cars not on the verge like youd think it should be then where its out of sight behind a wall on the road out of sparrowpit but thats good isnt it nan said eagerly if she went camping she wouldnt want to leave the saab on the road not where it could be seen by someone who might break into it true he said but the cars not alone and with a glance towards julian as if he wished to apologise for something theres a motorcycle with it someone out for a hike julian said at this hour andy shook his head it was wet from the night as wet as her car its been there just as long nan said then she didnt go onto the moor alone she met someone there or she was followed julian added quietly im calling the police andy said theyll want to bring in mountain rescue now when a patient died it was phoebe neills habit to turn to the land for comfort she generally did this alone shed lived alone for most of her life and she wasnt afraid of solitude and in the combination of solitude and a return to the land she received consolation when she was out in nature nothing manmade stood between her and the great creator thus on the land she was able to align herself with the end of a life and the will of god knowing that the body we inhabit is but a shell that binds us for a period of temporal experience prior to our entering the world of the spirit for the next phase of our development this thursday morning things were different yes a patient had died on the previous evening yes phoebe neill turned to the land for solace but on this occasion she hadnt come alone shed brought with her a mixed breed dog of uncertain lineage the noworphaned pet of the young man whose life had just ended shed been the one to talk stephen fairbrook into getting a dog as a companion during the last year of his illness so when it had become clear that the end of stephens life was fast approaching she knew that shed make his passing easier if she reassured him about the dogs fate stevie when the time comes im happy to take benbow shed told him one morning as she bathed his skeletal body and massaged lotion into his shrunken limbs youre not to worry about him all right you can die now was what went unspoken not because words like die or death were unmentionable round stephen fairbrook but because once hed been told his disease been through countless treatments and drugs in an effort to stay alive long enough for a cure to be found watched his weight decline and his hair fall out and his skin bloom with bruises that turned into sores die and death were old companions to him he didnt need a formal introduction to guests who were already dwelling within his house on the last afternoon of his masters life benbow had known that stephen was passing and hour after hour the animal lay quietly next to him moving only if stephen moved his muzzle resting in stephens hand until stephen had left them benbow in fact had known before phoebe that stephen was gone hed risen whimpered howled once and was silent hed then sought out the comfort of his basket where hed stayed until phoebe had collected him now he raised himself on his hind legs his plumed tail wagging hopefully as phoebe parked her car on a layby near a drystone wall and reached for his lead he barked once phoebe smiled yes a walk shall make us right as rain old chap she clambered out benbow followed leaping agilely from the vauxhall and sniffing eagerly nose pressed to the sandy ground like a canine hoover he led phoebe directly to the drystone wall and snuffled along it until he came to the stile that would allow him access to the moor beyond this he leapt over easily and once on the other side he paused to shake himself off his ears pricked up and he cocked his head he gave a sharp bark to tell phoebe that a solo run not a walk on a lead was what he had in mind cant do it old boy phoebe told him not till we see whats what and whos who on the moor all right she was cautious and overprotective that way which made for excellent skills when it came to nursing the housebound dying through their final days particularly those whose conditions required hypervigilance on the part of their caregiver but when it came to children or to dog ownership phoebe knew intuitively that the natural hovering born of a cautious nature would have produced a fearful animal or a rebellious child so shed had no childalthough shed had her opportunitiesand shed had no dog till now i hope to do right by you benbow she told the mongrel he lifted his head to look at her past the scraggly kelpcoloured mop of fur that flopped into his eyes he swung back round towards the open moor mile after mile of heather creating a purple shawl that covered the shoulders of the land had the moor consisted of heather alone phoebe would not have given a second thought to letting benbow have his romp unrestrained but the seemingly endless flow of the heather was deceptive to the uninitiated ancient limestone quarries produced unexpected lacunae in the landscape into which the dog could tumble and the caverns lead mines and caves into which he could scamperand where she could not followserved as a siren enticement for any animal an enticement with which phoebe neill didnt care to compete but she was willing to let benbow snuffle freely through one of the many birch copses that grew in irregular clumps on the moor rising like feathers against the sky and she grasped his lead firmly and began heading northwest where the largest of the copses grew although it was a fine morning there were no other walkers about yet the sun was low in the eastern sky and phoebes shadow stretched far to her left as if it wished to pursue a cobalt horizon that was heaped with clouds so white they might have been giant sleeping swans there was little wind just enough of a breeze to slap phoebes windcheater against her sides and flip benbows tangled fur from his eyes there was no scent on this breeze that phoebe could discern and the only noise came from an unkindness of ravens somewhere on the moor and a flock of sheep bleating in the distance benbow snuffled along investigating nasally every inch of the path as well as the mounds of heather that edged it he was a cooperative walker as phoebe had discovered from the thricedaily strolls she and he had taken once stephen had been completely confined to bed and because she didnt have to tug him along or pull him back or encourage the little dog in any way their jaunt on the moor gave her time to pray she didnt pray for stephen fairbrook she knew that stephen was now at peace quite beyond the necessity of an interventiondivine or otherwisein the process of the inevitable what she prayed for was greater understanding she wanted to know why a scourge had come to dwell among them felling the best the brightest and frequently those with the most to offer she wanted to know what conclusion she was meant to draw from the deaths of young men who were guilty of nothing of the deaths of children whose crime was to be born of infected mothers and of the deaths of those unfortunate mothers as well phoebe had at first believed that there had to be a message in the symphony of death that shed been taking part in for the past years but she was beginning to find that this kind of death had too many tentacles and those tentacles sought to curl tenaciously round victims too diverse to form a pattern from years of experience she knew that death was perfectly impartial claiming great and small important and utterly insignificant rich and poor strong and weak no matter ones power prestige or potential one did not bargain when the reaper came but this death this particular ending during which the medical fire brigade put out one inferno only to be confronted by another this was the worst so she walked and she prayed and when benbow wanted to pick up the pace she was willing to do so in this manner they strode into the heart of the moor ambling along one path forking off onto another phoebe wasnt worried about becoming lost she knew that theyd begun their walk southeast of a limestone outcrop that was called agrícolas throne it comprised the remains of a great roman fort a windswept outlook shaped not unlike an enormous chair that marked the edge of the moor anyone sighting off the throne during a hike was unlikely to get lost theyd been trekking for an hour when benbows ears pricked up and his stance altered from shuffling along happily he came to a sudden halt his body elongated back legs stretching out his feathery tail stiffened into an immobile quill a low whine issued from his throat phoebe studied what lay before them the copse of birches shed intended to allow benbow to gambol in gracious me she murmured arent you the clever one bennie she was deeply surprised and just as touched by the mongrels ability to read her intentions shed silently promised him freedom when they reached the copse and here the copse was he knew her mind and was eager to be off the lead cant blame you a bit phoebe said as she knelt to unhook the lead from his collar she wound the rope of braided leather round her hand and rose with a grunt as the dog shot ahead of her into the trees phoebe walked after him smiling at the sight of his compact body bouncing along the path he used his feet like springs as he ran bounding off the ground with all four legs at once as if it was his intention to fly he skirted a large column of roughly hewn limestone on the edge of the copse and vanished among the birches this was the entrance to nine sisters henge a neolithic earthbanked enclosure that encircled nine standing stones of varying heights assembled some thirtyfive hundred years before the time of christ the henge and the stones marked a spot for rituals engaged in by prehistoric man at the time of its use the henge had been standing in open land that had been cleared of its natural oak and alder forest now however it was hidden from view buried within a thick growth of birches a modern encroachment on the resulting moorland phoebe paused and surveyed her surroundings the eastern skywithout the clouds of the westallowed the sun to pierce unimpeded through the trees their bark was the white of a seagulls wing but patterned with diamondshaped cracks the colour of coffee leaves formed a shimmering green screen in the morning breeze which served to shield the ancient stone circle within the copse from an inexperienced hiker who didnt know it was there standing before the birches the sentry stone was hit by the light at an oblique angle this deepened its natural pocking and from a distance the shadows combined to effect a face an austere custodian of secrets too ancient to be imagined as phoebe observed the stone an unaccountable chill passed through her despite the breeze it was silent here no noise from the dog no bleating of a sheep lost among the stones no call of hikers as they crossed the moor it was altogether too silent phoebe thought and she found herself glancing round uneasily overcome by the feeling that she was being watched phoebe thought herself a practical woman to the very core one not given to casual fancies or an imagination run riot nonetheless she felt the sudden need to be away from this place and she called for the dog there was no response benbow she called a second time here boy come nothing the silence intensified the breeze stilled and phoebe felt the hair stirring on the back of her neck she didnt wish to approach the copse but she didnt know why shed walked among nine sisters before shed even had a quiet picnic lunch there one fine spring day but there was something about the place this morning a sharp bark from benbow and suddenly what seemed like hundreds of ravens took to the air in an ebony swarm for a moment they entirely blocked out the sun the shadow they cast seemed like a monstrous fist sweeping over phoebe she shuddered at the distinct sensation of having been marked somehow like cain before being sent to the east she swallowed and turned back to the copse there was no further sound from benbow no response to her calling concerned phoebe hurried along the path passed the limestone guardian of that sacred place and entered the trees they grew thickly but visitors to the site had trod a path through them over the years on this the natural grass of the moor had been flattened and worn through to the earth in spots to the sides however bilberry bushes formed part of the undergrowth and the last of the wild purple orchids gave off their characteristic scent of cats in the tough moor grass it was here beneath the trees that phoebe looked for benbow drawing nearer to the ancient stones the silence round her was so profound that the very fact of it seemed like an augur mute but eloquent all at once then as phoebe drew near the circles boundary she finally heard the dog again he yelped from somewhere then emitted something between a whine and a growl it was decidedly fearful worried that hed encountered a hiker who was less than welcoming of his canine advances phoebe hastened towards the sound through the remaining trees and into the circle at once she saw a mound of bright blue at the inner base of one of the standing stones it was at this mound that benbow barked backing off from it now with his hackles up and his ears flattened back against his skull what is it phoebe asked over his noise whatve you found old boy uneasily she wiped her palms on her skirt and glanced about she saw the answer to her question lying round her what the dog had found was a scene of chaos the centre of the stone circle was strewn with white feathers and the detritus of some thoughtless campers lay scattered about everything from a tent to a cooking pot to an opened rucksack spilling its contents onto the ground phoebe approached the dog through this clutter she wanted to get benbow back on the lead and get both of them out of the circle at once she said benbow come here and he yelped more loudly it was the sort of sound shed never heard from him before she saw that he was clearly upset by the mound of blue the source of the white feathers that dusted the clearing like the wings of slaughtered moths it was a sleeping bag she realised and it was from this bag that the feathers had come because a slash in the nylon that served as its cover spat more white feathers when phoebe touched the bag with her toe indeed nearly all the feathers that constituted its stuffing were gone what remained was like a tarpaulin it had been completely unzipped and it was shrouding something something that terrified the little dog phoebe felt weakkneed but she made herself do it she lifted the cover benbow backed off giving her a clear look at the nightmare vignette that the sleeping bag had covered blood there was more in front of her than shed ever seen before it wasnt bright red because it had obviously been exposed to air for a good number of hours but phoebe didnt require that colour to know what she was looking at oh my lord she went lightheaded shed seen death before in many guises but none had been as grisly as this at her feet a young man lay curled like a foetus dressed head to toe in nothing but black with that same colour puckering burnt flesh from eye to jaw on one side of his face his cropped hair was black as well as was the ponytail that sprang from his skull his goatee was black his fingernails were black he wore an onyx ring and an earring of black the only colour that offered relief from the blackaside from the sleeping bag of bluewas the magenta of blood and that was everywhere on the ground beneath him saturating his clothes pooling from scores of wounds on his torso phoebe dropped the sleeping bag and backed away from the body she felt hot she felt cold she knew that she was about to faint she chided herself for her lack of backbone she said benbow and over her voice she heard the dog barking hed never stopped but four of her senses had deadened with shock heightening and honing her fifth sense sight she scooped up the dog and stumbled from the horror the day had altered completely by the time the police arrived in the way of weather in the peaks a morning that had been born into sunshine and perfect sky had reached its maturity in fog it slithered over the distant crest of kinder scout creeping across the high moors from the northwest when the buxton police set up their crime scene tape they did it with the mist falling on their shoulders like spirits descending to visit the site before he went out to join the scenes of crime team detective inspector peter hanken had a word with the woman whod stumbled upon the body she was sitting in the back of a panda car a dog on her lap hanken normally liked dogs a great deal he was the master of two irish setters who were almost as much his pride and joy as were his three children but this patheticlooking mongrel with his unkempt coat of mangy fur and his sludgecoloured eyes looked a likely candidate for the dog meat factory and he smelled like a dustbin left in the sun not that there was any sun which lowered hankens spirits even further on every side of him he encountered greyin the sky on the landscape and in the grizzled hair of the old woman before himand grey had long had the capability of sinking his ship faster than the dawning knowledge of what a murder investigation was going to do to his weekend plans over the top of the car hanken said to patty stewarta wpc with a heartshaped face and breasts that had long been the objects of fantasy for half a dozen of the younger dcsname stewart filled in all the blanks in her typical competent manner phoebe neill shes a home nurse from sheffield what the hell was she doing out here her patient died yesterday evening she took it hard she brought his dog out here for a walk it helps she said hanken had seen plenty of death in his years of policing and in his experience nothing helped he slapped his palm against the roof of the car and opened the door saying to stewart get on with it then he slid inside is it miss or missus he said after introducing himself to the home nurse the dog strained forward against her hands which shed placed on his chest just above his legs she held him in position firmly she said hes friendly if youd just let him smell your hand and she added miss when hanken obliged he excavated the particulars from her trying to ignore the mongrels rank odour when he was satisfied that shed seen no other sign of life besides the ravens whod fled the scene like the marauders they were he said you didnt disturb the area and narrowed his eyes when she flushed i know whats appropriate in the situation one does watch police dramas on the television occasionally but you see i didnt know there would be a body beneath the blanket only it wasnt a blanket at all was it it was a sleeping bag thatd been slashed to bits and as there was rubbish all round the site i suppose that i rubbish hanken interrupted impatiently papers camping things lots of white feathers there were bits and pieces everywhere the woman smiled with a pitiful eagerness to please you didnt disturb anything did you hanken asked no of course she hadnt done that except for the blanket which shed moved except that it hadnt been a blanket had it but a sleeping bag which was where the body was beneath the bag as shed just said right right right hanken thought she was a real aunt edna this was probably the most excitement shed had in her life and she was determined to prolong the experience and when i saw it him she blinked as if afraid to cry and recognising correctly how little stock hanken put in women who shed tears i believe in god you know in a greater purpose behind all that happens but when someone dies in such a way it tests my faith it surely does she lowered her face to benbows head the dog squirmed round and licked her nose hanken asked her what she needed if she wanted a wpc to take her home he told her that there would likely be more questions she was not to leave the country if she traveled from sheffield she was to let him know where she could be reached not that he thought hed need her again but there were some parts of his job that he did by rote the actual murder site was irritatingly remote and inaccessible by any means other than foot mountain bike or helicopter given these options hanken had called in a few favours at mountain rescue and had managed to hijack an raf chopper that was just concluding a search for two lost hikers in the dark peak he used the waiting helicopter now to ferry himself to nine sisters henge the fog wasnt heavyjust wet as the dickensand when they made their approach he could see the popped lightning of flash bulbs as the police photographer documented the crime scene to the southeast of the trees a small crowd milled forensic pathologist and forensic biologists uniformed constables evidence officers equipped with collection kits they were waiting for the photographer to finish his work they were also waiting for hanken the di asked the helicopters pilot to hover above the birch copse for a minute prior to landing from two hundred and fifty feet above the groundsufficient distance so as not to disturb the evidencehe saw that a campsite had been set up within the perimeter of the old stone circle a small blue tent domed against the northern face of one stone and a fire ring burned black like the pupil of an eye in the circles centre on the ground lay a silver emergency blanket and nearby a square sit mat coloured bright yellow a black and red rucksack spat out its contents and a small camping cook stove tumbled onto its side from the air it didnt look like the nasty piece of business that it was hanken thought but distance did that to you giving a false assurance that all was well the chopper set him down fifty yards to the southeast of the site he ducked beneath the blades and joined his team on the ground as the police photographer strode out of the copse he said ugly mess hanken said right and wait here to the team he slapped his hand against the limestone sentry marking the entrance to the copse and alone he started down the path beneath the trees where the leaves dripped condensation from the fog onto his shoulders at the entrance to nine sisters proper hanken paused and let his gaze roam where it would from the ground now he saw that the tent was a size suitable for one and that fact was in keeping with the rest of the gear scattered round the circle one sleeping bag one rucksack one emergency blanket a single sit mat what he hadnt seen from the air he saw now a map case gaped open with its contents half torn a single ground cloth crumpled against the solitary rucksack one small hiking boot toppled into the charred remains of the central fire and another lay nearby discarded white feathers clung wetly to everything when at last he moved from the entrance hanken engaged in his usual preliminary observation of a crime scene he stood over each noticeable physical item and considered it with his mind clear of possible explanations most officers he knew went directly to the victim but hanken believed that a bodybrought to its death through human brutalitywas traumatic enough to deaden not only the senses but also the intellect leaving one incapable of seeing the truth when it lay openly before him so he went from one object to the next studying it without disturbing it and thus he made his initial examination of the tent the rucksack the mat the map case and the rest of the equipmentfrom socks to soapthat was tossed round in the inside of the circle he took the most time over a flannel shirt and the boots and when hed seen enough of these objects he turned to the body it was a gruesome corpse a boy of not more than nineteen or twenty he was thin almost skeletal with delicate wrists dainty ears and the waxlike skin of the dead although one side of his face was badly burnt hanken could still tell that the boy had a finely bridged nose and a wellshaped mouth and an overall appearance of femininity that he seemed to have tried to alter by growing a wispy black goatee he was drenched with blood from numerous wounds and beneath the mess he wore only a black tshirt with no jersey or jacket of any kind his jeans had faded from black to grey in spots where the wearing was most apparent along the seams the knees and in the seat and he wore heavy boots on his overlarge feet doc martens by the look of them beneath these boots half hidden now by the sleeping bag which had been carefully moved to one side by the police photographer in order to document the body a few sheets of paper lay stained with blood and limp with fogborn condensation crouching hanken examined these separating them carefully with the tip of a pencil which he removed from his pocket the papers he saw were anonymous letters crudely written creatively spelled and assembled with letters and words cut from newspapers and magazines thematically they were all of a piece they threatened death although the means that were suggested differed each time hanken directed his gaze from these papers to the boy on the ground he wondered if it was reasonable to conclude that the recipient of them had met the end augured by the messages left at the scene the deduction would have seemed reasonable had not the interior of the old stone circle told another tale hanken strode out of it along the path beneath the birches start a perimeter search he told his team were looking for a second body chapter new scotland yards barbara havers took the lift up to the twelfth floor of tower block this housed the extensive library of the metropolitan police and among the scores of reference books and police reports she knew that she would be safe she very much needed safety at the moment she also needed privacy and time to recover in addition to more volumes than anyone had time to countmuch less to look atthe library offered the finest view of london in the entire building this view spread to the east encompassing everything from the neogothic spires of the houses of parliament to the south bank of the river thames it spread to the north where the dome of st pauls dominated the city skyline and on a day like this one when the bright hot sunlight of summer was finally altering to the subtle glow of autumn the sheer scope of the view became secondary to the beauty of everything touched by that light here on the twelfth floor barbara thought that if she concentrated on identifying as many of the buildings below her as she could she might be able to calm herself and forget the humiliation through which shed just lived after three months of a suspension from work shed finally received a cryptic phone call at half past seven that morning it was an order thinly disguised as a request would detective sergeant barbara havers join assistant commissioner sir david hillier in his office at ten am the voice was scrupulously polite and even more scrupulously careful to betray no knowledge of what lay behind the invitation barbara however had little doubt about the purpose of the meeting shed been the object of an enquiry by the police complaints authority for the last twelve weeks and once the crown prosecution service had declined to instigate legal proceedings against her the machinery of the metropolitan polices internal affairs division had begun to grind witnesses to her behaviour had been called statements from those witnesses had been taken evidencea highpowered motorboat one mp carbine and a glock semiautomatic pistolhad been examined and evaluated and barbaras fate had long been due to be revealed so when the phone call had finally come interrupting her increasingly fitful sleep she should have been prepared after all she had known all summer that two aspects of her behaviour as an officer were under scrutiny facing criminal charges of assault and attempted murder facing disciplinary charges that ran the gamut from abuse of authority to failure to obey an order she should have begun the process of putting her professional life in order prior to what anyone with a teaspoonful of sense would have called its ineluctable demise but police work had been barbaras life for a decade and a half and she couldnt imagine her world without it so she had spent her suspension telling herself that every day that passed without her being sacked made it more likely that she would emerge from the investigation unscathed that hadnt been the case of course and a more realistic officer would have known what to expect when she walked into the assistant commissioners office shed dressed with care eschewing her usual drawstring trousers for a skirt and jacket she was hopeless with clothes so the colour didnt suit her and the faux pearl necklace was a ludicrous touch that merely emphasised the thickness of her neck her shoes at least were polished but getting out of her old mini in the yards underground car park shed scraped her calf on a rough edge of door metal and a ladder in her tights had been the result not that perfect tights a decent piece of jewellery and a suit of a hue more flattering to her complexion would have altered the inevitable because as soon as shed entered ac hilliers office with its four windows indicating the olympian heights to which hed risen shed seen the writing on the wall still she hadnt expected the castigation to be so vituperative ac hillier was a pighad always been and would be to the end of his daysbut barbara had never before been on the receiving end of his particular brand of discipline hed seemed to feel that a vigorous upbraiding wasnt sufficient to relay his displeasure with her comportment nor was sufficient a blistering letter that utilised such terms as disgracing the reputation of the entire metropolitan police and bringing the service of thousands of officers into disrepute and a disgraceful brand of insubordination unlike anything in the history of the force which would be placed in her permanent file and left there through the years for every officer with suzerainty over barbara to see ac hillier had also felt the need to interject his personal commentary on the activities that had brought about her suspension and knowing that without witnesses he could be as free as he wanted to reprimand barbara in whatever language he chose hillier had included in that commentary the sort of risky invective and innuendo that another subordinate officerwith less at stakemight well have taken as crossing over the line that separated the professional from the personal but the assistant commissioner was nobodys fool he was perfectly aware that thankful her punishment did not include being sacked barbara would adopt the wise course of action and take whatever he chose to dish out to her but she didnt have to like hearing herself referred to as a bloody stupid slag and a sodding minge bag and she didnt have to pretend that she was unaffected by having her physical appearance her sexual proclivities and her potential as a woman brought into hilliers ugly monologue so she was shaken and as she stood by the window in the library and observed the buildings that rose between new scotland yard and westminster abbey she tried to control the trembling of her hands she also tried to eliminate the waves of nausea that kept causing her breath to come in great gulps as if she were drowning a cigarette would have helped but in coming to the library where she wouldnt be found shed also come to one of the many locations in new scotland yard where smoking was prohibited and while at one time she would have lit up anyway and damned the consequences she wouldnt do that now once more out of order and youre finished hillier had shouted in conclusion his florid face grown as maroon as the tie that he wore with his bespoke suit that she hadnt been finished alreadyconsidering the level of hilliers animositywas a mystery to barbara throughout his speech shed prepared herself for her inevitable sacking but it hadnt materialised shed been dressed down slagged off and vilified but the peroration of hilliers remarks hadnt included her termination that hillier wanted to sack her as much as he wanted to abuse her was clear as could be that he didnt do so told her that someone of influence had taken her part barbara wanted to be grateful indeed she knew she ought to be grateful but at the moment all that she could feel was a monumental sense of betrayal that her superior officers the disciplinary tribunal and the police complaints authority hadnt seen things her way when the facts are in shed thought everyone would see that shed had no choice but to take up the nearest weapon to hand and fire it in order to save a life but that wasnt the way her actions had been viewed by those in power except for someone and she had a fairly good idea who that someone was detective inspector thomas lynley had been on his honeymoon during the birth of barbaras troubles her longtime partner hed come home with his bride from ten days on corfu to find barbara suspended with an investigation mounted into her conduct understandably confounded hed driven across town that same night seeking an explanation from barbara herself while their initial conversation hadnt gone as smoothly as she would have wished barbara had known at heart that at the end of the day di lynley would never stand by and let an injustice be done if there was any way that he could prevent it hed be waiting in his office now to hear about her meeting with hillier as soon as she recovered from that meeting shed go to see him someone came into the quiet library a woman said im telling you he was born in glasgow bob i remember the case because i was at the comprehensive and we were doing reports on current events bob replied youre daft he was born in edinburgh the woman said glasgow ill prove it proving it meant having a browse through the library proving it meant that barbaras solitude was at an end she left the library and descended by the stairs buying more time to recover and to come up with the words to thank inspector lynley for interceding she couldnt imagine how hed done it he and hillier were at each others throats most of the time so he must have asked a favour of someone above hilliers head she knew that doing so would have cost him dearly in professional pride a man like lynley wasnt used to going cap in hand to anyone going cap in hand to those who openly begrudged him his aristocratic birth would have been especially trying she found him in his office in victoria block he was on the phone with his back to the door his chair swung round to face the window he was saying lightly darling if aunt augustas declared that a visits in order i dont know how we can actually avoid it its rather like trying to stop a typhoon hmm yes but we should be able to keep her from rearranging the furniture if mothers agreed to come with her shouldnt we he listened then laughed at something his wife said on the other end of the line yes all right well announce the wardrobes offlimits in advance thank you helen yes she does mean well he rang off and swiveled his chair to face his desk he saw barbara in the doorway havers he said surprise in his tone hullo whatre you doing here this morning she entered saying i had the word from hillier and a letter in my file and a quarter of an hours speech that id like to forget cast your thoughts to hilliers propensity for seizing the moment and throttling it and youll have a good idea of how things played out hes a flamer our dave im sorry lynley said but that was all a lecture and a letter in your file not all ive been demoted to detective constable ah lynley reached for a magnetic container of paper clips sitting on his desk restlessly his fingers explored the tops of the clips while he apparently gathered his thoughts he said it could have been worse it could have cost you everything right yes i know barbara tried to sound expansive well hillier had his fun no doubt hell replay his speech for the big boys at lunch with the commissioner i thought about telling him to screw himself about halfway through but i held my tongue you wouldve been proud of me at this lynley moved his chair away from the desk and stood at the window looking out at its indifferent view of tower block barbara saw a muscle move in his jaw she was about to venture into the arena of gratitudehis uncharacteristic reserve suggested the price hed paid interceding on her behalfwhen he finally spoke introducing the topic himself by saying barbara im wondering if you know what had to be gone through to keep you from getting the sack the meetings the phone calls the agreements the compromises i reckoned as much which is why i wanted to say and all of it to keep you from getting what half of scotland yard think you richly deserve barbara shifted uncomfortably on her feet sir i know you put yourself out for me i know i would have been given the sack if you hadnt interceded and i just wanted to tell you how grateful i am that you recognised my actions for what they were i wanted to tell you that you wont have any reason to regret taking my part i wont give you a reason or anyone else for that matter i wont give anyone a reason i wasnt the one lynley said turning back to her barbara looked at him blankly you what i didnt take your part barbara to his credit after making the admission he kept his eyes on hers she would think of that later and grudgingly admire it those brown eyes of hisso kind and so at odds with his head of blond hairsettled on hers and just stayed there openly barbara frowned trying to assimilate what hed said but you you know all the facts i told you the story you read the report i thought you just now said the meetings and the phone calls they werent mine he cut in in conscience i cant let you think that they were so shed jumped to a conclusion shed presumed their years of partnership meant that lynley would automatically take her part she said are you with them then them who the half of the yard that thinks i got what i deserve i only ask because i spose we ought to know where we stand with each other i mean if were going to work her words were starting to tumble together and she forced herself to slow down to be deliberate so are you with them that half sir lynley went back to his desk and sat he regarded her she could easily read the regret on his face she just couldnt tell where it was directed and that frightened her because he was her partner he was her partner she said again sir he said i dont know if im with them she felt deflated just a shriveled bit of her skin remained lying quietly on the office floor lynley must have read this because he continued his voice not unkind ive looked at the situation from every angle all summer long ive examined it barbara thats not part of your job she told him numbly you investigate murders not not what i did i wanted to understand i still want to understand i thought if i went at it on my own i could see how it happened through your eyes but you couldnt manage that barbara tried to keep the desolation from her voice you couldnt see that a life was at stake you couldnt get your mind round the fact that i wasnt able to let an eightyearold drown thats not the case lynley told her i understood that much and i understand it now what i couldnt get round was that you were out of your jurisdiction and given an order to so was she barbara broke in so was everyone the essex police dont patrol the north sea and thats where it happened you know that on the sea i do know that all of it believe me i know how you were chasing a suspect how that suspect dropped a child from his boat what you were ordered to do when he took that action and how you reacted when you heard the order i couldnt just toss her a life belt inspector it wouldnt have reached her she would have drowned barbara please hear me out it wasnt your placeor your responsibilityto make decisions or to reach conclusions thats why we have a chain of command arguing about the order youd been given would have been bad enough but once you fired a weapon at a superior officer i expect youre afraid ill do that to you next given half a chance she said bitterly lynley let the words hang there between them in the silence barbara found herself wanting to reach into the air and unspeak them so untrue did she know them to be sorry she said feeling that the huskiness in her voice was a worse betrayal than any action she herself had taken earlier that summer i know he said i do know youre sorry im sorry as well detective inspector lynley the quiet interruption came from the door lynley and barbara swung to the voice dorothea harriman secretary to their divisional superintendent stood there wellcoifed with a helmet of honeyblonde hair welldressed in a pinstriped suit that would have done service in a fashion advert barbara all at once felt what she always was in the presence of dorothea harriman a sartorial nightmare what is it dee lynley asked the younger woman superintendent webberly harriman replied hes asked for you as soon as you can make it hes had a call from crime operations somethings come up and with a glance and a nod at barbara she was gone barbara waited she found that her pulse had begun throbbing painfully the request from webberly couldnt have come at a more terrible time somethings come up was harriman shorthand for the fact that the game was afoot and in the past that summons from webberly had generally preceded an invitation from the inspector to accompany him in his discovery of what the game was barbara said nothing she just watched lynley and waited she knew very well that the next few moments would constitute the stand he took on their partnership outside his office business went on as usual voices echoed in the linofloored corridor telephones rang in departments meetings began but here inside it seemed to barbara as if she and lynley had taken themselves into another dimension altogether one into which much more than merely her professional future was tied he finally got to his feet ill need to see what webberly has going she said shall i despite his use of the singular pronoun that had already said it all but she found that she couldnt complete the question because she couldnt face the answer at the moment so she asked another what would you like me to do sir he thought about it looking away from her at last seeming to study the picture that hung by the door a laughing young man with a cricket bat in his hand and a long rip in his grassstained trousers barbara knew why lynley kept the photo in his office it served as a daily reminder of the man in the photo and what lynley had done to him on a longago drunken night in a car most people put what was unpleasant out of their minds but di thomas lynley didnt happen to be most people he said i think its best that you lie low for a while barbara let the dust settle let people get past this let them forget but you wont be able to will you she asked silently what she said however was a bleak yes sir i know that isnt easy for you he said and his voice was so gentle that she wanted to howl but i havent got any other answer to give you at the moment i only wish that i had and again the few words she could manage were sir i see yes sir demotion to detective constable lynley said to superintendent malcolm webberly when he joined him thats marks to you isnt it sir webberly was ensconced behind his desk smoking a cigar mercifully hed kept the door to his office closed to spare the other officers the secretaries and the clerks from the fumes emanating from the noxious tube of tobacco this consideration however did little to deliver anyone who had to enter from experiencing and breathing the fug of smoke lynley tried to inhale as little as possible webberly used his lips and tongue to move the cigar from one side of his mouth to the other it was the only response he gave can you tell me why lynley asked youve gone out on a limb for officers before no one knows that better than i but why in this case when it seems so cut and dried and whatre you going to have to pay for having saved her we all have favours the superintendent said i called a few in havers was in the wrong but her heart was in the right lynley frowned hed been trying to work himself round to this same conclusion from the moment hed learned about barbara havers disgrace but he hadnt been able to manage the feat every time he came close the facts reared up at him demanding acknowledgement and hed gathered a number of those facts himself driving out to essex to talk to the principal officer involved having talked to her he couldnt understand howlet alone whywebberly was able to condone barbara havers decision to fire a rifle at dci emily barlow disregarding his own friendship with havers even disregarding the very basic issue of chain of command werent they responsible for asking what sort of professional mayhem they were encouraging if they failed to punish a member of the force whod taken part in such an egregious action but to shoot at an officer even to pick up a rifle in the first place when she had no authority webberly sighed these things just arent black and white tommy i wish they were but they never are the child involved the dci ordered a life belt thrown to her but there was doubt as to whether the girl could swim and beyond that webberly removed the cigar from his mouth and examined its tip as he said shes someones only child evidently havers knew it and lynley knew what that fact meant to his superintendent webberly himself had a single light in his life his one daughter miranda he said barbara owes you on this one sir ill see that she pays webberly nodded at a yellow pad that lay before him on the desk lynley glanced at it to see the superintendents scribbling rendered in black felttip pen webberly said andrew maiden dyou remember him at the questionthe namelynley sat in a chair near webberlys desk and said andy of course id not be likely to forget him i thought not one operation in so and i made a hash of it what a nightmare that was so was the crime operations group the most secret and secretive collection of officers in the met they were responsible for hostage negotiation witness and jury protection the organisation of informants and undercover operations lynley had once aimed to work among them in the latter group but at twentysix he hadnt possessed either the sangfroid or the performance ability to adopt a persona other than his own months of preparation went straight down the drain he recalled i expected andy to string me up andy maiden hadnt done so however that wasnt his style the so officer was a man who knew how to cut his losses and thats what hed done not assigning blame where it was owed but instead matching his moves to the moments need he quickly withdrew his men from the undercover operation and waited for another opportunity to introduce them months later when he could join them and assure that no outrageous faux pas such as lynleys could undermine their efforts again hed been called dominoandy maidenso adept had he been at assuming the character of everyone from hit men to american backers of the ira his primary field had ultimately become drug operations but before he arrived there he made his mark in murder for hire and organised crime as well i used to run into him from time to time on the fourth floor lynley told webberly but i lost track of him once he left the met that was when ten years ago just over nine maiden webberly said had taken early retirement and moved his family to derbyshire in the peaks hed poured his life savings and his energy into the renovation of an old hunting lodge it was a country hotel now called maiden hall quite the spot for walkers holidaymakers mountain bikers or anyone looking for an evening out and a decent meal webberly referred to his yellow pad andy maiden brought more louts to justice than anyone else in so tommy it doesnt surprise me to hear that sir yes well hes asking for our help and we owe him whats happened his daughter was murdered in the peaks twentyfive years old and some bastard left her in the middle of nowhere in a place called calder moor christ thats rough im sorry to hear it there was a second body as wella boysand no one knows who the devil he is no id on him the girlnicolahad gone camping and she was geared up for the works rain fog sun or anything else but the boy at the site hadnt got any gear at all do we know how they died no word on that and when lynley raised an eyebrow in surprise webberly said this is coming our way via so name the time those bastards made fast and free with their information lynley couldnt do so webberly went on what i know is this buxton cids got the case but andys asking for more and were giving it to him hes asked for you in particular me thats right you may have lost track of him over the years but it seems he hasnt lost track of you webberly plugged his cigar into his mouth clamping it into the corner and referring to his notes a home office pathologist is on his way up there for a formal bythebooks with scalpel and recorder hes set to do the postmortem sometime today youll be on the patch of a bloke called peter hanken hes been told that andys one of us but thats all he knows he removed the cigar from his mouth again and looked at it instead of at lynley as he concluded tommy ill make no pretence about this it could turn dicey the fact that maidens asked for you by name webberly hesitated before finishing with just keep your eyes open and move with caution lynley nodded the situation was irregular he couldnt remember another time when a relative of a victim of a crime had been allowed to name the officer who would investigate it that andy maiden had been allowed to do so suggested spheres of influence that could easily encroach upon lynleys efforts to manage a smooth investigation he couldnt handle the case alone and lynley knew that webberly wouldnt expect him to do so but he had a fairly good idea of what officer the superintendent given half the chance would assign as his partner he spoke to circumvent that assignment she wasnt ready yet neitherif it came down to itwas he id like to see whos on rota to take with me he told webberly since andys a former so officer were going to want someone with a fair amount of finesse the superintendent regarded him directly fifteen seconds ticked by before he spoke you know best who you can work with tommy he finally said thank you sir i do barbara havers made her way to the fourth floor canteen where she bought a bowl of vegetable soup which she took to a table and tried to eat while all the time imagining that the word pariah hung from her shoulders on a sandwich board she ate alone every nod of recognition she received from other officers seemed imbued with a silent message of contempt and while she tried to bolster herself with an interior monologue informing her shrinking ego that no one could possibly yet know of her demotion her disgrace and the dissolution of her partnership every conversation going on round herparticularly those flavoured by lighthearted laughterwas a conversation mocking her she gave up on the soup she gave up on the yard she signed herself outgoing home ill would doubtless be welcomed by those who clearly saw her as a form of contagion anywayand made her way to her mini one half of her was ascribing her actions to a mixture of paranoia and stupidity the other half was trapped in an endless repetition of her final encounter with lynley playing the game of whaticouldhavewouldhaveandshouldhavesaid after learning the outcome of his meeting with webberly in this frame of mind she found herself driving along millbank before she knew what she was doing not heading for home at all her body on automatic pilot she came up to grosvenor road and the battersea power station with her brain engaged in a mental castigation of di lynley she felt like a shattered mirror useless but dangerous with broken edges how easy it had been for him to cut her loose she thought bitterly and what an idiot she had been believing for weeks that he was on her side obviously it hadnt been enough for lynley that shed been demoted and humiliated by a man whom both of them had loathed for years it seemed now that hed also needed an opportunity to do some disciplining on his own as far as she was concerned he was wrong wrong wrong taking the direction hed chosen and she needed an ally straightaway who would agree with her point of view spinning along the river thames in the light midday traffic she had a fairly good idea where to find just such a confederate he lived in chelsea little more than a mile from where she was driving simon st james was lynleys oldest friend his schoolmate from eton a forensic scientist and an expert witness he was regularly called upon by defence counsel as well as crown prosecutors to bolster one side or the other of a criminal case that was relying on evidence rather than eyewitnesses to win a conviction unlike lynley he was a reasonable man he had the ability to stand back and observe disinterested and dispassionate without becoming personally embroiled in whatever situation was roiling round him he was exactly the person she needed to talk to hed see lynleys actions for what they were what barbara didnt consider in the midst of her turbulent mental gymnastics was that st james might not be alone in his house in chelseas cheyne row however the fact that his wife was also at homeworking in the darkroom that adjoined his own top floor laboratorydidnt make the situation nearly as delicate as did the presence of st jamess regular assistant and barbara didnt know that st jamess regular assistant was there until she was climbing the stairs behind joseph cotter fatherinlaw housekeeper cook and general factotum to the scientist himself cotter said all three of thems at work but its time to break for lunch and lady helen for one be glad of the diversion likes her meals regular always as done no change there married or not barbara hesitated on the second floor landing saying helens here she is cotter added with a smile s nice to know some thingss the same as ever was isnt it damn barbara muttered under her breath for helen was also countess of asherton titled in her own right but also the wife of thomas lynley whoalthough he made no bones about preferring it otherwisewas the other half of the asherton equation the official belted velvetandermineclad earl barbara could hardly expect st james and his wife to join her in a round of denigration doodah with the wife of the object of denigration in the room she realised that retreat was in order she was about to beat a hasty one when helen came onto the top floor landing laughing over her shoulder into the lab as she said all right all right ill fetch a new roll but if youd claw your way into the current decade and replace that machine with something more uptodate we wouldnt be out of fax paper at all id think youd notice these things occasionally simon she turned away from the door began to come down the stairs and spied barbara on the landing below her her face lit it was a lovely face not beautiful in any conventional sense but tranquil and radiant framed by a smooth fall of chestnut hair heavens what a wonderful surprise simon deborah heres a visitor for us so youll absolutely have to break for lunch now how are you barbara why havent you called round in all these weeks there was nothing for it but to join her barbara nodded her thanks to cotter who called up ill lay another place at the table then in the general direction of the lab and headed back down the way theyd come barbara climbed upwards and took helens extended hand the handshake turned into a swift kiss on the cheek a welcome so warm that barbara knew lynley hadnt yet contacted his wife about what had occurred at scotland yard that day helen said this is brilliant timing youve just saved me from a slog down the kings road in search of fax paper im famished but you know simon why stop for anything as incidental as a meal when one has the opportunity to slave for a few more hours simon detach yourself from the microscope please heres someone more interesting than fingernail scrapings barbara followed helen into the lab where st james regularly evaluated evidence prepared reports as well as professional papers and organised materials for his recently acquired position as a lecturer at the royal college of science today he appeared to be in expertwitness mode because he was perched on a stool at one of the work tables and he was assembling slides from the contents of an envelope that hed unsealed the aforementioned fingernail scrapings barbara thought st james was a largely unattractive man no longer the laughing cricket player but disabled now and hampered by a leg brace that made his movements awkward his best features were his hair which he always wore overlong with complete disregard for whatever current fashion dictated and his eyes which changed from grey to blue depending on his clothing which was itself nondescript he looked up from the microscope as barbara entered the lab his smile humanised a lined and angular face barbara hullo he eased himself off the stool and came across the room to greet her calling out to his wife that barbara havers had joined them at the far end of the room a door swung open in cutoff blue jeans and a olive tshirt st jamess wife stood beneath a line of photographic enlargements that hung from a cord running the length of her darkroom and dripped water onto the rubbermatted floor deborah looked quite well barbara noted renewing her commitment to her artinstead of brooding and mourning the string of miscarriages that had plagued her marriageobviously agreed with her it was nice to think of something going well for someone barbara said hullo i was in the area and she glanced at her wrist to see that shed forgotten her watch at home that morning in her haste to get to the yard for her meeting with hillier she dropped her arm actually i didnt think about what time it was lunch and everything sorry we were about to stop st james told her you can join us for a meal helen laughed about to stop what outrageous casuistry ive been begging for food these last ninety minutes and you wouldnt consider it deborah looked at her blankly what time is it helen youre as bad as simon was helens dry reply youll join us st james asked barbara i just had something she said at the yard all three of the others knew what that last phrase meant barbara could see the underlying connotation register on their faces it was deborah who said then youve finally had word as she poured chemicals from their trays into large plastic bottles that she took from a shelf beneath her photographic enlarger thats why youve come by isnt it what happened no dont explain yet something tells me you could do with a drink why dont the three of you go downstairs give me ten minutes to sort things out here and ill join you downstairs meant simons study and thats where st james took barbara and helen with barbara wishing that helen and not deborah had been the one to stay above and continue working she thought about denying that her visit to chelsea had anything to do with the yard but she realised that her tone of voice had probably given her away there was certainly nothing buoyant about it an old drinks trolley stood beneath the window that overlooked cheyne row and st james poured them each a sherry as barbara made much of inspecting the wall on which deborah always hung a changing display of her photographs today these were more of the suite shed been working on for the last nine months oversize enlargements of polaroid portraits taken in locations like covent garden lincolns inn fields st botolphs church and spitalfields market is deborah going to show them barbara asked gripping the sherry shed been given and stalling for time she nodded towards the pictures in december st james handed helen her sherry she slid out of her shoes and sat in one of the two leather chairs by the fireplace drawing her slender legs underneath her she was barbara noted watching her steadily helen read people the way other people read books so whats happened st james was saying as barbara wandered from the photo wall to the window and looked out at the narrow street there was nothing to hold her attention there just a tree a row of parked cars and a line of houses two of which were currently fronted by scaffolding barbara wished shed gone into that line of work considering how frequently it was employed in everything from gentrification projects to washing windows erecting scaffolding as a career would have kept her busy out of trouble and extremely welloiled with lolly barbara st james said have you heard something from the yard this morning she turned from the window a letter in my file and demotion she replied st james grimaced are you back on the street then which had happened to her once before in what had felt like another lifetime during the last three years of working with lynley she said not quite and went on to explain leaving out the nastier details of her meeting with hillier and mentioning lynley not at all helen did it for her does tommy know have you seen him yet barbara which brings us to the point barbara thought morosely she said well yes the inspector knows a fine line appeared between helens eyes she placed her glass on the table next to her chair ive a very bad feeling about whats happened barbara was surprised at her own response to the quiet sympathy in helens voice her throat tightened she felt herself reacting as she might have reacted in lynleys office that morning had she not been so stunned when hed returned from his meeting with webberly and explained that he was setting out on a case it wasnt the fact of his assignment to a case that stunned and struck her momentarily wordless however it was the choice hed made of a partner to accompany him a partner who was not herself barbara this is for the best hed told her gathering materials from his desk and shed gulped down what she wanted to say in protest and stared at him realising that shed never actually known him before that moment he doesnt seem to agree with the outcome of the internal investigation barbara concluded her story for st james and helen demotion and all i dont think he believes ive been punished enough im so sorry helen said you must feel as if youve lost your best friend the authenticity of her compassion stung the backs of barbaras eyelids she hadnt expected helenof all peopleto be the source so deeply did it touch her to have the sympathy of lynleys wife that she heard herself stammering its just that his choice to replace me with i mean she fumbled for the words and instead encountered that rush of pain all over again it felt like such a slap in the face all lynley had done of course was to make a selection among the officers available to work with him on an investigation that his choice was itself a wound to barbara wasnt a problem he was required to address detective constable winston nkata had done a fine job on two cases in town on which hed worked with both barbara and lynley it wasnt unreasonable that the dc would be offered an opportunity to demonstrate his talents outside london on the sort of special assignment that had previously gone to barbara herself but lynley couldnt have been blind to the fact that barbara saw nkata as the competition nipping at her heels at the yard eight years her junior twelve years younger than the inspector he was more ambitious than either lynley or barbara had ever been he was a selfstarter a man who anticipated orders before they were spoken and seemed to fulfill them with one hand tied behind his back barbara had long suspected him of showboating for lynley trying to outdo her own efforts in order to replace her at the inspectors side lynley knew this he had to know it so his choice of nkata seemed less a logical selection made by a man who weighed the respective gifts of his subordinates and used them according to the needs of a case than it appeared to be an instance of outright inyourface cruelty is this tommy in a temper st james asked but it hadnt been anger behind lynleys actions and desolate as she was barbara wouldnt accuse him of that deborah joined them then saying whats happened and fondly kissing her husband on the cheek as she passed him and poured herself a small sherry the story was repeated barbara telling it st james adding details and helen listening in thoughtful silence like lynley the others were in possession of the facts connected to barbaras professional insubordination and her assault on a superior officer unlike lynley however they appeared capable of seeing the situation as barbara herself had seen it unavoidable regrettable but fully justified the only course open to a woman who was simultaneously under pressure and in the right st james even went so far as to say tommyll doubtless come round to your way of thinking at the end of the day barbara its rough that you have to go through this though and the other two women murmured their agreement all of this should have been intensely gratifying after all their sympathy was what barbara had come to chelsea in order to gather but she found that their sympathy merely enflamed her pain and the sense of betrayal that had driven her to chelsea in the first place she said i guess it boils down to this the inspector wants someone he knows he can trust to work with him and no matter the ensuing protests of lynleys wife and lynleys friends barbara knew she was not at the present time anywhere close to being that someone chapter julian britton could picture exactly what his cousin was doing on the other end of the telephone line he could hear a steady thwack thwack thwack punctuating her sentences and that sound told him that she was in the old illlit kitchen of broughton manor chopping up some of the vegetables that she grew at the bottom of one of the gardens i didnt say that i was unwilling to help you out julian samanthas comment was accompanied by a thwack that sounded more decisive than the earlier ones i merely asked whats going on theres nothing wrong with that is there he didnt want to reply he didnt want to tell her what was going on samantha after all had never made a secret of her aversion for nicola maiden so what could he say little enough by the time the police in buxton had made the assessment that it might behoove them to phone the force headquarters in ripley by the time ripley had sent two panda cars to examine the location in which nicolas saab and an old triumph motorcycle were parked and by the time ripley and buxton in conjunction reached the obvious conclusion that mountain rescue was needed an old woman on a morning stroll with her dog had stumbled into the hamlet of peak forest pounded on a door and told a tale about a body shed come across in the ring of nine sisters henge the police had gone there at once leaving mountain rescue waiting at their meeting point for further directions when those directions came they were ominous enough mountain rescue would not be needed julian knew all this because as a member of mountain rescue hed gone to his teams rendezvous site once the call had come throughpassed along that morning by samantha who intercepted it in his absence at broughton manor so he was standing among the members of his team checking his equipment as the leader read from a dogeared checklist when the mobile rang and the equipment check was first interrupted and then canceled altogether the team leader passed on the information he was giventhe old woman her dog their morning walk the body nine sisters henge julian had returned immediately to maiden hall wanting to be the one to break the news to andy and nan before they heard it from the police he intended to say that it was only a body after all there was nothing to indicate that the body was nicolas but when he arrived there was a panda car drawn up to the front of the hunting lodge and when he dashed inside it was to find andy and nan in a corner of the lounge where the diamond panes of a large bay window cast miniature rainbows against the wall they were in the company of a uniformed constable their faces were ashen nan was holding on to andys arm her fingers creating deep indentations in the sleeve of his plaid flannel shirt andy was staring down at the coffee table between them and the constable all three of them looked up when julian entered the constable spoke excuse me sir but if you could give mr and mrs maiden a few minutes julian realised that the constable assumed he was one of the guests at maiden hall nan clarified his relationship to the family identifying him as my daughters fiancé theyve only just become engaged come julian and she extended a hand to him and drew him down onto the sofa so that the three of them sat together as the family they were not and could never be the constable had just got to the unsettling part a female body had been found on the moor it might be the maidens missing daughter he was sorry but one of them was going to have to accompany him to buxton to make an identification let me go julian had said impulsively it felt inconceivable that either of nicolas parents would have to be subjected to the grisly task indeed it felt inconceivable that the identification of nicolas body should fall to anyone but himself the man who loved her wanted her and tried to make a difference in her life the constable said regretfully that it had to be a member of the family when julian offered to go along with andy andy demurred someone needed to stay with nan he said and to his wife ill phone from buxton if if hed been as good as his word it had taken several hours for the call to come through owing to the time involved in getting the body from the moor to the hospital where the postmortems would be performed but when hed seen the young womans corpse hed phoned nan hadnt collapsed as julian thought she might do shed said oh no shoved the phone at julian and run from the lodge julian had spoken to andy only long enough to hear from his own mouth what julian already knew to be the fact then hed gone after nicolas mother he found her on her knees in christianlouiss herb garden behind the maiden hall kitchen she was scraping up handfuls of the freshly watered earth mounding them round her as if she wished to bury herself she was saying no no but she wasnt weeping she fought to break loose when julian put his hands on her shoulders and began to lift her to her feet hed never suspected how strong such a small woman could be and hed had to shout for help from the kitchen both of the grindleford women had come running together with julian theyd managed to get nan back into the lodge and up the staff stairs with their help julian got her to drink two shots of brandy and it was at this point that she began to weep i must do she cried give me something to do that last word rose on a chilling wail julian was aware of being out of his depth she needed a doctor he went to phone one he could have left it to the grindleford duo but making the decision to call in a doctor got him out of nan and andys bedroom a space suddenly so close and confined that julian felt in another minute he would be unable to breathe so hed descended the stairs and commandeered the telephone he rang for a doctor and then finally he rang broughton manor and spoke to his cousin whether they were appropriate or not samanthas questions were logical hed failed to come home on the previous night as his unusual absence at breakfast had no doubt telegraphed to his cousin it was now midday he was asking her to take on one of his responsibilities naturally she would want to know what had occurred to spur him to behaviour as uncharacteristic as it was mysterious still he didnt want to tell her talking to her about nicolas death was something he couldnt do at the moment so he said theres been an emergency at maiden hall sam i need to hang about so will you see to the puppies what sort of emergency sam come on will you do me this favour his prize harrier cass had recently whelped and the puppies as well as their dam needed to be monitored sam knew the routine shed watched him perform it often enough shed even helped him on occasion so it wasnt as if he were asking her to perform the impossible or even for that fact the unusual or the unknown but it was becoming clear that she wasnt going to accommodate him without being told why she was being asked to do so he settled on saying nicolas gone missing her mum and dad are in a state i need to be here what dyou meangone missing thwack served as punctuation she would be standing at the wooden work top beneath the kitchens ceilinghigh single window where generations of knives cutting up vegetables had worn a shallow trough into the oak shes disappeared she went hiking on tuesday she didnt turn up last night when she was supposed to more likely that she met up with someone samantha announced in that practical way of hers summers not over yet therere thousands of people still hiking in the peaks how could she have gone missing anyway didnt the two of you have a date thats just the point julian said we did have a date and she wasnt here when i came to fetch her hardly out of character samantha pointed out which made him wish she were standing in front of him so that he could punch in her freckled face damn it sam she must have heard how close he was to breaking she said im sorry ill do it ill do it which dog the only one with new puppies at the moment cass all right another thwack what shall i tell your father theres no need to tell him anything julian said the last thing he wanted was jeremy brittons thoughts on the topic well i take it you wont be back for lunch will you the question was tinged with that particular tone that bordered on accusation a blend of impatience disappointment and anger your dad is bound to ask why julie tell him i was called out on a rescue in the middle of the night a mountain rescue hardly explains your absence at the breakfast table if dad was hung overwhich as youve noticed is usually the casethen i doubt my absence at breakfast was noted if hes in any condition to realise im not there at lunch tell him mountain rescue called me out midmorning how if you werent here to take the call jesus samantha would you stop the bloody hair splitting i dont care what you tell him just see to the harriers all right the thwacking ceased samanthas voice altered its sharpness dissipated and left in its place were apology hollowness and hurt im just trying to do whats best for the family i know im sorry youre a brick and we wouldnt be able to cope without you i wouldnt be able to cope im always glad to do what i can so do this without making it a case for one of the bloody crown courts he thought but all he said was the record book for the dogs is in the top drawer of my desk thats the desk in the office not in the library the library desks been sold at auction she reminded him he received the underlying message this time the britton familys financial condition was a perilous one did julian truly wish to jeopardise it further by committing his time and his energy to anything other than the rehabilitation of broughton manor yes of course whatever julian said go easy with cass shes going to be protective of the litter i expect she knows me well enough by now do we ever know anyone julian wondered he rang off shortly thereafter the doctor arrived he wanted to give nan maiden a sedative but she wouldnt allow it not if it meant leaving andy to face the first terrible hours of loss alone so the doctor wrote out a prescription instead which one of the grindleford women set off to have filled in hathersage where the nearest chemist was julian and the second grindleford woman remained to hold the fort at maiden hall it was at best an effort patched together with sellotape there were residents wanting lunch as well as nonresidents whod seen the restaurant sign on the gorge road and had innocently followed the winding drive upwards in the hope of having a decent meal the serving girls had no experience in the kitchen and the housekeeping staff had the rooms to attend to so it was left to julian and his companion from grindleford to see to what andy and nan maiden usually did themselves sandwiches soup fresh fruit smoked salmon pâté salads julian knew within five minutes that he was out of his depth and it was only when a suggestion that christianlouis might be called in supervened upon julians dropping a plate of smoked salmon that he realised there was an alternative to trying to captain the ship alone christianlouis arrived in a flurry of incomprehensible french he unceremoniously threw everyone out of his kitchen a quarter of an hour later andy maiden returned his pallor was marked worse than before nan he asked julian upstairs julian tried to read the answer before he asked the question he asked it anyway what can you tell me andys answer was to turn to begin heavily climbing the stairs julian followed the older man didnt go to the bedroom he shared with his wife instead he went to the cubicle next to it a part of the attic that had been fashioned into a small study there he sat at an old mahogany kneehole it was fitted with a secretaire drawer which he pulled out and lowered into a writing surface he was taking a scroll from one of its three cubicles when nan joined them no one had been able to prevail on her to wash or to change so her hands were filthy and the knees of her trousers were caked with earth her hair was tangled as if shed been pulling at it by the fistful what she said tell me andy what happened andy smoothed the scroll against the secretaire drawers unfolded writing surface he weighed down the top end with a bible the bottom end he held in place with his left arm andy nan said again tell me say something he reached for a rubber it was stubby and marked with the blackened remains of hundreds of erasures he bent to work and when he moved julian was able to see the contents of the scroll it was a family tree at the top were printed the names maiden and llewelyn and the date at the bottom were the names andrew josephine mark and philip with them were the names of their spouses and below that their issue there was only a single name beneath those of andrew and nancy maiden although space for nicolas spouse had been provided and three small lines branching beneath nicolas name indicated andys hopes for the future of his immediate family andy cleared his throat he appeared to be regarding the genealogy in front of him or perhaps he was only garnering courage for in the next moment he erased those oversanguine marks reserved for a future generation and once hed done that he picked up a calligraphy pen dipped it into a bottle of ink and began to write beneath his daughters name he formed two neat parentheses inside them he penned the letter d he followed that with the year nan began to weep julian found that he couldnt breathe a fractured skull was all that andy said detective inspector peter hanken was less than chuffed when his cc at the buxton nick informed him that new scotland yard was sending up a team to assist in the investigation into the calder moor deaths a native of the peak district he possessed an inherent distrust of anyone who hailed from south of the pennines or north of deer hill reservoir the oldest son of a wirksworth quarryman he also possessed an inherent dislike of anyone whom their classweighted society told him he was supposed to consider his social better the two officers of the scotland yard team thus garnered his double animosity one was a di called lynley a bloke tanned and fit and with hair so gold that it had to be courtesy of the nearest bleach bottle he had an oarsmans shoulders and a posh public school voice he wore savile row jermyn street and the scent of old money like a second skin what the hell was he doing in the police force hanken wondered the other was a black a detective constable called winston nkata he was as tall as his superior officer but with a tensile rather than a muscular strength he had a long facial scar that put hanken in mind of the manhood ceremonies undertaken by african youths in fact aside from his voice which sounded like a curious mixture of african caribbean and southbankofthethames he reminded hanken of a tribal warrior his air of confidence suggested hed been through trials by fire and had not been found wanting aside from his own feelings in the matter hanken didnt particularly like the message it sent to the rest of his team having new scotland yard involved on their patch if there was a question about his competence or the competence of his officers then he would have vastly preferred to be told so to his face and no matter that having two more officers in on the action meant he could end up with time to put together bellas surprise swing set in advance of her fourth birthday next week he hadnt asked his cc for help and he was more than just a little annoyed to have help thrust upon him di lynley appeared to take the measure of hankens irritation within thirty seconds of meeting him which somewhat elevated hankens opinion of the man despite his upperten voice he said andy maidens asked for our help thats why were here inspector hanken your cc told you the dead girls father retired from the met didnt he the chief constable had done but what anyones working for the met in his salad days had to do with hankens ability to get to the bottom of a crime without assistance was an issue that hadnt yet been clarified he said i know smoke and he offered his packet of marlboros to the other two both demurred the black looked as if hed been offered strychnine my blokes arent going to like it much having london breathing and peeing for them i expect theyll adjust lynley said not bloody likely hanken lit his fag he took a deep drag and observed the other two officers over the cigarette theyll follow your lead yeah like i said lynley and the black exchanged a look it said kidglove treatment was called for what they didnt know was that kid gloves silk gloves or chain mail gauntlets wouldnt make a difference to their reception in hankens office lynley said andy maiden was an so officer did your cc tell you that this was news and the mild animosity hanken had felt towards the london officers was immediately redirected towards his superiors whod apparently and deliberately kept the information from him you didnt know did you lynley said he dryly directed his next comment to nkata politics as usual i expect the dc noddedhis expression disgustedand crossed his arms although hanken had offered both men chairs when theyd entered his office the black officer had chosen to stand he was lounging at the window from which he had a bleak view of the football grounds across silverlands street it was a stadium structure topped by barbed wire it couldnt have offered a less pleasing prospect lynley said to hanken sorry i cant explain why they hold back information from the officer in charge i expect its some sort of power game ive had it played on me once too often to like it he went on to fill in the missing information andy maiden had worked undercover hed been highly respected and exemplarily successful during a thirtyyear career so the yard feels an obligation to one of its own lynley finished were here to fulfill that obligation wed like to work as part of a team with you but winston and i will stay out of your way as much as possible if thats how you prefer it its your case and your patch were well aware that were the interlopers here each of the statements was graciously made and hanken felt a slight deicing of his attitude towards the other di he didnt particularly want to like him but two deaths and one unidentified body were unusual in this part of the world and hanken knew that only a fool would object to having two more minds sorting through the facts in the investigation especially if both minds in question were absolutely clear about who was giving the orders and making the assignments in the case besides the so detail was an intriguing one that hanken was grateful to have passed his way he needed to ponder it when he had a moment he twisted his cigarette down into a spotless ashtray which he then emptied and cleaned thoroughly with a tissue as was his custom he said come with me then and took the ondoners to the incident room where two of his uniformed wpcs were at computer terminalsapparently doing nothing save chatting to each otherand a third male constable was making an entry on the china board where hanken had neatly penned assignments earlier in the day this last constable nodded and left the room as hanken walked the scotland yard officers over to the china board next to it a large diagram of the murder site was hanging alongside two pictures of the maiden girlin life and in deathas well as several pictures of the secondand hitherto unidentifiedbody and a line of photos of the murder scene lynley put on a pair of reading spectacles to have a look at these as hanken introduced him and nkata to the others in the room hanken said to one of the wpcs the computer still down what else was her laconic response bloody invention hanken muttered he directed the londoners attention specifically to the diagram of nine sisters henge he pointed out the spot where the boys body had been found within the circle he indicated a second area some distance away from the henge to the northwest the girl was here he said one hundred and fiftyseven yards from the birch copse where the standing stones are shed had her head bashed in with a chunk of limestone what about the boy lynley asked multiple stab wounds no weapon left behind weve done a fingertip search for it but come up cold ive constables out scouring the moor right now were they camping together they werent hanken told them the girl had gone to calder moor alone according to her parents and the facts at the crime scene backed them up it was apparently her belongingsand here he indicated the photograph that would document his wordsthat were strewn round the inside of the stone circle for his part the boy seemed to have nothing with him aside from the clothes on his back so it appeared that setting out from wherever hed set out he hadnt intended to join her for his own night under the stars there was no identification on the boy lynley asked my super told me no one can place him were running the plates of a motorcycle through the dvla a triumph found near the girls car behind a wall on the road outside sparrowpit he pointed out this location using an ordnance survey map that was unfolded on a desk that abutted the wall holding the china board weve had the bike staked out since the bodies were discovered but no ones come to claim it it looks like it probably belongs to the kid once our computers are up and running again theyre saying any minute one of the wpcs called out right hanken scoffed and went on with well have the registration information from the dvla bike could be stolen nkata murmured then thatll be on the computer as well hanken fished out his fags and lit another one of the women officers said have a heart pete were in here all day an entreaty which hanken chose to ignore what are your thoughts so far lynley asked his inspection of each of the photographs complete hanken rustled under the ordnance survey map for a large manila envelope inside were photocopies of the anonymous letters found at the feet of the dead boy he kept one back said have a look at these and handed the envelope over to lynley nkata joined his superior officer as lynley began to flip through the letters there were eight communications in all each fashioned from large letters and words that had been clipped from newspapers and magazines and taped to sheets of plain white paper the message on each was similar beginning with your going to die sooner then you think continuing with how does it feel to know your days are numbered and concluding with watch your back because when your not ready for it i will be there and you will die theres noplace to run and noplace to hide lynley read every one of the eight letters before he finally raised his head removed his glasses and said were these found on either of the bodies inside the stone circle near to the boy but not on him they could have been directed to anyone couldnt they they may not even be related to the case hanken nodded my first thought as well except they appear to have come from an oversize envelope that was on the scene with the name nikki printed straight across it in pencil and they had blood on them thats what those dark smears are by the way places where our copy machine couldnt register red prints hanken shrugged labs going through the exercise lynley nodded and reconsidered the letters theyre threatening enough but sent to the girl why the whys our motive for murder do you see the boy involved i see some thick yobbo in the wrong place at the worst possible time he complicated matters but thats all he did lynley returned the letters to the envelope and handed the envelope over to hanken he said complicated matters how by making it necessary for reinforcements hanken had had the day to evaluate the crime scene to look over the photographs to view the evidence and to develop an idea of the events from what hed seen he explained his theory weve got a killer who knows the moors well and who knew exactly where to find the girl but when he got there he saw what he hadnt expected to find shed got someone with her he had only one weapon the missing knife nkata noted right so he had one of two choices either separate the boy from the girl somehow and knife them one at a time or bring in a second killer lynley finished is that what youre thinking it was hanken told him perhaps the other killer was waiting in the car perhaps heor sheset out to nine sisters henge in the company of the other in any case when it became clear that there were two ablebodied victims to dispose of instead of just one and only a single knife with which to do the job the second killer was called into action and the second weapona chunk of limestonewas used lynley went back for another look at the pictures and the site plan he said but why are you marking the girl as the main victim why not the boy because of this hanken handed over the single sheet of paper that hed held back from the anonymous letters in anticipation of lynleys question again it was a photocopy again it was taken from another note this one however had been scrawled by hand this bitch has had it snaked across the page the penultimate word underlined three times was this found with the others lynley asked it was on her body hanken said tucked into one of her pockets nice and neat but why leave the letters after the murders were done and why leave the note to send someone a message thats the usual purpose of notes ill accept that for a note on her body but what about the cutandpaste letters why would someone have left them behind consider the condition of the crime scene there was rubbish everywhere and i dare say it was dark when the killers struck hanken paused to crush out his cigarette they wouldnt even have known the letters were there in all the mess they made a mistake at the other end of the room the computer finally came to life one of the wpcs said about time that and began inputting data and waiting for responses the other constable did likewise working with the activity sheets and reports that the investigative team had already turned in hanken continued think about the killers state of mind the principal killer that is he tracks our girl to the stone circle all set to do the job only to find her with a companion hes got to bring in help which throws him off his stride the girl manages to run off which throws him off further then the boy puts up a hell of a fight and the camping site is turned into a shambles all hes worried aboutthis is the killer not our boyis dispatching the two victims when the plan doesnt go smoothly the last thing on his mind is whether the maiden girl brought his letters with her why did she like his superior nkata had gone back to look at the crime scene photos he turned from them now as he spoke to show the boy theres nothing to indicate that she knew the boy before they died together hanken said the girls dad saw the boys body but he couldnt put a name to him had never seen him he said and he knows her friends could the boy have killed her lynley asked and then inadvertently become a victim himself afterwards not unless my pathologist had the times of death wrong he puts them dying within an hour of each other how likely is it that two completely unrelated killings would occur in a single location on a tuesday night in september yet thats what appears to have happened isnt it lynley said he went on to ask where nicola maidens car had been in relation to the stone circle had plaster impressions of tyre prints been taken from that location what about footprints in the circle itself and the boys face what did hanken make of the burns hanken fielded the questions using the map and the reports that his men had compiled thus far in the case from the other end of the room wpc peggy hammerwhose countenance had always reminded hanken of a shovel with frecklescalled out pete weve got it heres the dvla she copied something from her terminals monitor at the far end of the room the triumph hanken said right got it she handed over a slip of paper hanken read the name and the address of the motorcycles owner and when he did so he realised that the london detectives were going to turn out to be a godsend for the address he was looking at was in london and using either lynley or nkata to handle the london end of things would save him manpower in these times of budget cuts belt tightening and the sort of fiscal responsibility that made him shout about not being a bloody accountant for gods sake sending someone out on the road was a manoeuvre that had to be defended practically all the way to the house of lords hanken had no time for such nonsense the londoners made such nonsense unnecessary the bike he told them is registered to someone called terence cole according to the dvla in swansea this terence cole lived in chart street in shoreditch and if one of the scotland yard detectives didnt mind taking on that end of things hed send him back to london straightaway to find someone at that address who could make an id of the second body from nine sisters henge lynley looked at nkata youll need to head back at once he said ill stay i want a word with andy maiden nkata seemed surprised you dont want london yourself youd have to pay me a bundle to stay up here if i was you hanken glanced from one man to the other lynley he saw was colouring slightly this surprised him until that moment the man had seemed utterly unflappable helen can cope for a few days without me i expect lynley said no new bride ought to have to do that was nkatas rejoinder he explained to hanken that thespector got himself married three months ago hes practically fresh from the honeymoon thatll do winston lynley said newlywed hanken acknowledged with a nod cheers im afraid thats quite a moot sentiment lynley replied obscurely he wouldnt have said so twentyfour hours earlier then he had been blissful while there were numerous rough edges of adjustment that had to be smoothed as he and helen established their life together nothing they had come across so far had seemed so scabrous that it couldnt be leveled through discussion negotiation and compromise until the havers situation had come along that is in the months since their return from the honeymoon helen had maintained a discreet distance from lynleys professional life and shed merely said tommy there must be an explanation when hed returned from his only visit to barbara havers and reported the facts behind her suspension after that moment helen had kept her own counsel relaying telephone messages from havers and others interested in the situation but always remaining an objective presence whose loyalty to her husband was beyond question or so lynley had assumed the case to be his wife had disabused him of the notion when shed returned from the st james house earlier that day hed been packing for the journey to derbyshire tossing some shirts into a suitcase and rooting out an old waxed jacket and hiking boots for using on the moors when helen had joined him in a departure from her usual more oblique manner of addressing herself to a delicate subject shed taken the bull directly by the horns saying tommy whyve you chosen winston nkata rather than barbara havers to work this case with you he said ah youve spoken to barbara i see to which she replied and she practically defended you although the poor womans heart was clearly breaking do you want me to defend myself as well hed asked mildly barbara needs to keep her head down at the yard for a while taking her along to derbyshire wouldnt have accomplished that winstons the logical choice if barbaras unavailable but tommy she adores you oh dont look at me that way you know what i mean you can do no wrong in barbaras eyes hed placed his last shirt into the suitcase stuffed his shaving gear in among his socks closed the case and draped his jacket on top of it hed faced his wife are you here as her intermediary then please dont patronise me tommy i hate that hed sighed he didnt want to be at odds with his wife and he thought fleetingly of the compromises one made in attaching another life to ones own we meet he told himself we want we pursue and we obtain but he wondered if the man existed who caught up in the heat of desire still managed to consider whether he could possibly live with the object of his passion before he was actually doing so he doubted it he said helen its a miracle that barbara still has her job considering the charges she was facing webberly went to the wall for her and god only knows what he had to promise give up or compromise on in order to keep her in cid at the moment she ought to be thanking her lucky stars that she wasnt sacked what she shouldnt be doing is looking for support in a grievance against me and frankly the last person on earth she should be trying to set against me is my own wife thats not what shes doing no she came to see simon not me she didnt even know i was there when she saw me she wanted to turn tail and run and she would have done had i not stopped her she needed someone to talk to she felt terrible and she needed a friend which is what you always used to be in her life what i want to know is why youre not being a friend to her now helen this isnt about friendship theres no place for friendship in a situation in which everything depends on an officer obeying an order barbara didnt do that and whats worse she nearly killed someone in the process but you know what happened how can you not see what i see is that theres a purpose to a chain of command she saved a life and it wasnt her place to determine that life was in danger his wife had moved towards him then coming to grasp one of the posts at the end of their bed she said i dont understand this how can you be so unforgiving shed be the first person to forgive you anything in the same circumstances i wouldnt expect it she shouldnt have expected as much of me youve bent the rules before youve told me so you cant think attempted murder is bending the rules helen its a criminal act for which by the way most people go to prison and for which in this case youve decided to be the judge the jury and the executioner i see do you he was beginning to get angry and he should have held his tongue why was it he wondered that helen could push his buttons in ways no one else ever could then ill ask you to see this as well barbara havers doesnt concern you her behaviour in essex the subsequent investigation and whatever medicine shes asked to swallow as a result of that behaviour and investigation are none of your business if youre finding your life so circumscribed these days that you need to champion a cause to keep yourself busy you might consider aligning yourself with me to be honest id appreciate coming home to support and not to subversion she was as quick to anger as was he and just as capable of expressing it im not that sort of woman im not that sort of wife if you wanted an obsequious sycophant to marry thats tautology he said and that terse statement finished their argument helen had snapped you swine and left him to gather the rest of his belongings when he had done so and had gone in search of her to say goodbye she was nowhere to be found hed cursed her himself and barbara havers for being the source of a disagreement with helen but the drive to derbyshire had given him time to cool off as well as time to reflect upon how often he hit below the belt this contretemps with helen was one of those times and he had to admit it now standing on the pavement in front of buxton police station with winston nkata lynley saw that there was a way to make amends to his wife nkata would be waiting for him to assign another officer to accompany him on any rounds he might have to make in london and both of them knew who the logical selection was yet lynley found himself temporising by turning the bentley over to his subordinate officer he couldnt commandeer a car from the buxton police for his dc to drive all the way to london he explained to nkata and the only alternative to having him take the bentley was directing him to return to london by plane from manchester or by train but by the time he got himself to the airport and caught a flight or waited for a train and changed from one line to another in god only knew how many towns between buxton and london he could have driven the distance lynley hoped nkata had more finesse behind the wheel than barbara havers had employed the last time she happily ran over an old milestone and threw out the cars front suspension he informed the younger man that he was to drive the bentley as if he had a litre of nitroglycerin in the boot nkata grinned dont think i know how to treat a motor this fine id just prefer it to survive its adventure with you unscathed lynley disarmed the cars security system and handed over his keys nkata cocked his head at the front of the station think hell play our game orre we playing his its too soon to tell hes unhappy about our begin here but i would be as well in his position well need to tread softly lynley glanced at his watch it was nearly five the postmortems had been scheduled for early that afternoon with any luck they would be completed by now and the pathologist would be available to share his preliminary findings what dyou think of his thinking nkata reached into his jacket pocket and brought out two opal fruits his vice of choice he examined their wrappers made his flavour selection and passed the other over to lynley how hanken sees the case lynley unwrapped the sweet hes willing to talk thats a good sign he seems able to shift gears thats good too something edgy about him though nkata said makes me wonder whats eating at him we all have private concerns winnie its our job not to let them get in the way nkata adroitly tagged a final question onto lynleys thought dyou want me working with someone back in town still lynley avoided you can call in help if you think you need it shll i make the choice or dyou want to do it yourself lynley regarded the other man nkata had made the queries so casually that it was impossible to read into them anything other than a request for direction and the request was perfectly reasonable considering the fact that nkata might well have to return to derbyshire shortly after his arrival in london bringing someone north with the purpose of identifying the second body if that happened someone else in london would be needed to look into terence coles background and business in town here was the moment then in front of lynley was the opportunity to take the decision that helen would approve of but he didnt take it instead he said im not up to date on whos available ill leave it up to you samantha mccallin had learned early into her extended stay at broughton manor that her uncle jeremy didnt discriminate when it came to drink he imbibed anything with the potential to obliterate his sensibilities quickly he seemed to like bombay gin the best but at a pinch when the nearest offlicence was closed he wasnt finicky as far as samantha knew her uncle had been drinking steadily since adolescence having taken a brief few years away from booze during his twenties to do drugs instead jeremy britton had beenaccording to family legendthe once shining star of the britton clan but his marriage to a fellow flowerchild who had what samanthas mother euphemistically and archaically called a past had caused him to fall into disfavour with his father nonetheless the laws of primogeniture couldnt prevent jeremys inheriting broughton manor and all its contents upon his fathers death and the realisation that shed lived her life as the good child for naughtwhile jeremy had the time of his life among fellow ingesters of hallucinogenic substanceshad planted in the breast of samanthas mother more seeds of disharmony between her and her brother that disharmony had only grown throughout the years as jeremy and his wife produced three children in rapid succession and drank and drugged broughton manor into the ground while in winchester jeremys only sister sophie hired investigators to provide her with periodic reports on her brothers dissolute life and wept wailed and gnashed her teeth when she received them someones got to do something about him she cried before he destroys our familys entire history the way hes carrying on therell be nothing left to pass on to anyone not that sophie britton mccallin needed her brother jeremys money which hed long ago run through anyway she herself was rolling in it since her own husband was working himself into an early grave to keep her supply line running during that period when samanthas father had been healthy enough to adhere to a schedule at the family factory that would have felled an ordinary mortal samantha herself had ignored her mothers soliloquies on the topic of her brother jeremy those soliloquies changed in both tone and content however when douglas mccallin was felled by prostate cancer faced with the grim reality of earthly mortality his wife had been reborn to a fervent belief in the importance of family ties i want my brother here shed wept in her widows weeds at the wake my only living blood relative my brother i want him it was so like sophie to forget that she had two children herselfnot to mention those belonging to her brotherwho served as blood relatives instead she seized on a rapprochment with jeremy as the only solace in her present grief indeed her grief became so present that it soon was apparent that sophie had set herself up to outdo victorias mourning for albert and when she finally saw this samantha decided that the only road to peace in winchester was decisive action so shed come to derbyshire to collect her uncle once she deduced from incoherent phone conversations with the man that he was in no condition to get himself south unaided and once shed arrived and had seen his condition for herself samantha knew that carting him down to his sister in his present state would probably send sophie to her grave besides that samantha found it a relief to be away from sophie for a time the drama of her husbands death had provided her with more fodder than she usually had and shed been using it with a gusto that had long left samantha too exhausted to deal with her not that samantha didnt mourn her fathers passing herself she did but shed long ago seen that douglas mccallins first love was the family biscuit factorynot the family itselfand consequently his death seemed more like an extension of his normal working hours than a permanent parting his life had always been his work and hed given it the dedication of a man whod had the luck to meet his one true love at the age of twenty jeremy on the other hand had chosen drink as his bride on this particular day hed started with dry sherry at ten in the morning during lunch hed worked his way through a bottle of something called the blood of jupiter which samantha assumed from its colour was red wine and throughout the afternoon hed plied himself with one gin and tonic after another the fact that he was still ambulatory was to samantha remarkable he usually spent his days in the parlour where he shut the curtains and used the ancient eightmillimeter projector to entertain himself with endless meanderings down memory lane in the months that samantha had been at broughton manor hed gone through the britton familys entire cinematic history at least three times he always did it the same way beginning with the earliest films that one britton or another had shot in and watching them in chronological order to the point at which there was no britton with sufficient interest in the family to record their doings so the pictorial record of fox hunts fishing expeditions holidays pheasant shoots birthdays and weddings ended round the time of julians fifteenth birthday which according to samanthas calculations would have been just the time that jeremy britton had fallen from his horse and compressed three vertebrae for which longago injury he religiously plied himself with painkillers as well as intoxicants hes going to kill himself mixing pills with booze if we dont watch him julian had told her soon after her arrival sam will you help me with you here to keep an eye on him i can get more work done on the estate i might even be able to put some plans in motion if youll help me that is and within days of meeting him samantha had known that she would do anything to help her cousin julian anything at all which was something that jeremy britton obviously knew as well because hearing her return from the vegetable garden in the late afternoon and clomp across the courtyard ridding her boots of soil hed actually emerged from the parlour and sought her out in the kitchen where she was beginning to prepare their dinner ah here you are my flower he leaned forward in that gravitydefying posture that seemed second nature to drunks he had a tumbler in his hand two small pieces of ice and a slice of lemon were all that remained of his latest gin and tonic as usual he was dressed up to the nines every inch of him the country squire despite the late summer weather he was wearing a tweed jacket a tie and heavy wool plus fours that he must have resurrected from a predecessors wardrobe he might have passed for an eccentric albeit welltodo landowner in his cups he placed himself at the old wooden work top precisely where samantha wished to be he jiggled the ice in his tumbler and drained what little liquid he was able to coax from the melting cubes that done he set the glass next to the large chefs knife that shed removed from its stand he looked from her to the knife to her once again and he smiled a slow happy inebriates smile wheres our boy he inquired pleasantly although it came out as whairshare boy his eyes were so light a grey that their irises might not even have existed and the whites of them had long since gone yellow a colour that was beginning to suffuse most of his skin havent noticed julie skulking about today dont you know fac tis i dont believe he was home last night at all our little julie because i dont recall seeing his mug at breakfast except it was hishmuggabrekkest and having said this much jeremy waited for her reaction to his remarks samantha began emptying the vegetable trug of its contents she placed lettuce a cucumber two green peppers and a cauliflower into the nearby sink she began to wash them free of soil to the lettuce she gave particular attention bending over it like a mother examining her infant child well jeremy went on with a sigh i spose we know what julie was up to dont we sam doewesham that boy wont see whats before his face i dont know what were going to do with him you havent taken any of your pills have you uncle jeremy samantha asked if you mix them with spirits you could be in trouble i was born for trouble jeremy saidish born ftroubleand samantha tried to discern if his slurring was any worse than usual an indication of an assault on his consciousness it was just past five oclock so hed be slurring anyway but the last thing julian needed to contend with was his fathers usual drunken slumber working its way into a coma jeremy sidled along the work top till he was standing next to samantha at the sink youre a goodlooking woman sammy he said his breath was a study in mixing his beverages dont you think im ever so many sheets to the storm that i dont notice what a looker you are thing is weve got to make our little julie see that no point showing off those legs of yours if the only one looking is this old sod not that i dont appreciate the sight mind you having a nice young thing like you running about the house in those tight little shorts is just the very thing that these are hiking shorts samantha interrupted i wear them because its been warm uncle jeremy which youd know if you ever left the house during the day and they arent tight jus a compliment girl jeremy protested got to learn to accept a compliment and who better to learn from than your own blood uncle christ its good to know you girl ve i mentioned that he didnt bother to wait for a response he leaned even closer for a confidential whispernow lets figure what to do about julie less figger whatta do bow julie what about julian samantha asked we know what were dealing with dont we hes been mounting the maiden girl like a randy donkey since he was twenty years old please uncle jeremy samantha could feel her neck getting prickly please uncle jeremy what we got to look at the facts so we know what to do with them and fact number one is that julies been tupping the padley gorge ewe every chance hes had or better said every chance shes given him for a drunk he was remarkably observant samantha thought but she said rather more primly than she intended i really dont want to talk about julians sex life uncle jeremy its his business not ours ah her uncle said too nasty a topic for sammy mccallin whys it i dont think thats the case sam thassacasesam i didnt say it was nasty she replied i said it wasnt our business and it isnt so i wont discuss it it wasnt that she felt odd about sexembarrassed shy or anything like that far from it shed had sex when it was available to her ever since getting past the awkward inconvenience of virginity by pressing one of her brothers friends into service when she was a teenager but this talking about her cousins sex life she couldnt afford to discuss it and run the risk of giving herself away girly girl listen jeremy said i see how you look at him and i know what you want im on your side hell keep the family for the family in the familys my motto you think i want him chained to the maiden tart when theres a woman like you hanging round waiting for the day when her manll wise up youre mistaken she said although the pounding just beneath her skin told her how her blood was giving the lie to her words im fond of julian who wouldnt be hes a wonderful man right he is and dyou actuallyackshullythink the maiden sees that in our julie not on your life she sees a bit of fun when shes hereabouts a bit of tumbleintheheatherandpokemeifyoucan but samantha went on firmly as if he hadnt spoken im not in love with him and i cant imagine ever being in love with him good grief uncle jeremy were first cousins i think of julian the way i think of my brother jeremy was silent for a moment samantha took the opportunity to move past him cauliflower and peppers in hand she placed them into the cutting trough where four hundred years of vegetables had been chopped she began breaking the cauliflower into florets ah jeremy said slowly but his tone was sly which told samantha for the first time that he wasnt as drunk as he seemed your brother i see yes i do see so he wouldnt interest you in the other way wonder how i got the idea but no matter give your uncle jer a touch of advice then about what she fetched a colander and scooped the cauliflower into it she turned her attention to the green peppers about how to cure him of what of her the cat the mare the sow what you will whachewill julian samantha said in a lastditch effort to divert her uncle from his course doesnt need to be cured of anything hes his own man uncle jeremy bollocks that hes a man on a string and we both know where its tied shes got him so he cant see up for down hardly hards the word all right hes been hard so long that his brains made a permanent journey into his dick uncle jeremy all he thinks about is having a suck on those pretty pink teats of hers and once he gets his prong inside and has her moaning like a all right samantha drove the chefs knife through the green pepper like a cleaver youve made your point thoroughly uncle jeremy id like to get on with making dinner now jeremy smiled slowly that inebriates smile youre meant for him sammy you know that as well as i swellseye he said so whatre we going to do to make it happen he was suddenly looking at her steadily quite as if he were not drunk at all what was the mythological creature that could fix you in its stare and kill you cockatrice she thought her uncle was a cockatrice i dont know what youre talking about she said but she sounded even to herself much less assured and far more afraid dont you he smiled and when he left the room he didnt walk the walk of a man who was remotely tipsy samantha kept determinedly chopping the peppers until she heard his footsteps on the stairs until she heard the kitchen door latch shut behind him then with a careful control that she was proud to be able to muster in the circumstances she set the knife to one side she put her hands on the edge of the work top she bent forward over the vegetables inhaled their scent directed her thoughts into a selfcreated mantralove fills me embraces me love makes me wholeand tried to regain a sense of serenity not that shed had any serenity since the previous night when shed realised what a mistake shed made in conjunction with the lunar eclipse not that shed had serenity at all once shed realised what nicola maiden was to her cousin but forcing herself to whisper the mantra was habit so she used it now despite the fact that love was the very last feeling of which she pictured herself capable at the moment she was still attempting the meditation when she heard the harriers barking from their kennels in the converted block of stables just to the west of the manor house the sound of their sharp excited yelping told her that julian was with them samantha looked at her watch it was feeding time for the adult harriers observation time for the newly born pups and rearranging time for the play runs in which the older puppies were beginning the socialisation process julian would be out there for at least another hour samantha had time to prepare herself she wondered what to say to her cousin she wondered what hed say to her and she wondered what it mattered anyway with nicola maiden to consider from the moment shed met her samantha hadnt liked nicola her dislike wasnt grounded in what the younger woman represented to her thoughprimary competition for julians affections it was grounded in what nicola so patently was her easiness of manner was an irritant suggesting a selfconfidence that was entirely at odds with the girls appalling roots the daughter of a little more than a publican graduate of a london comprehensive and a thirdrate university that was no better than an ordinary polytechnic college who was she to move so easily through the rooms of broughton manor decrepit as they were they still represented four hundred years of unbroken possession by the britton family and that was the kind of lineage that nicola maiden could hardly claim for herself but this knowledge didnt seem to faze her in the least indeed she never acted as if she was in possession of the knowledge at all and there was a single good reason for this the power that went with her englishrose looks the guinevere hairunnatural in colour though it doubtless wasthe perfect skin the darklashed eyes the delicate frame the seashell ears shed been given every physical advantage a woman could be given and five minutes in her presence had been enough to tell samantha that she bloody well knew it its brilliant to meet one of jules relatives at last shed confided to samantha on their first meeting seven months earlier i hope well become the best of friends half term for nicola shed come to spend her holiday with her parents shed rung julian on the morning of her arrival and the moment he pressed the telephone receiver to his ear samantha had seen which way the wind was blowing and for whom but she hadnt known how strong that wind was till she met nicola herself the sunny smile the frank gaze the shout of pleased laughter the artless conversation although shed rather more than mildly disliked her it had taken several meetings with nicola for samantha to make a full evaluation of her cousins beloved and when she did the realisation she reached did nothing but add to samanthas discomfort whenever they met for she saw in nicola maiden a young woman completely content with who she was offering herself to the world at large without the slightest care as to whether the offering would be accepted not for her were the doubts the fears the insecurities and the crises of confidence of the female in search of a male to define her which was probably why samantha thought she had julian britton so hot and bothered to do just that more than once in the time shed been at broughton manor samantha had come upon julian engaged in an act that was testimony to the thrall into which nicola maiden drew a man hunched over a letter he was writing to her sheltering the telephone receiver from unwanted eavesdroppers as he talked to her staring sightlessly over the garden wall at the footbridge that spanned the river wye as he thought of her sitting in his office with his head in his hands as he brooded about her samanthas cousin was little more than the prey of a huntress he couldnt begin to understand there was no way that samantha could make him see his beloved as she truly was however there was only the option of allowing his passion to play itself out to culminate in the marriage he was so desperate to attain or to lead to a permanent break between him and the woman he desired having to accept this as her only course had brought samantha facetoface with her own impatience and it accosted her at her every turn at broughton manor she fought her longing to beat the truth into her cousins head time and again she deliberately turned from the appetite for derogation that rose in her whenever the subject of nicola came up but these virtuous efforts at selfcontrol were taxing and the price she was beginning to pay was anxiety resentment insomnia and outright rage uncle jeremy didnt help matters by him samantha was daily regaled with lubricious innuendoes and direct assaults all circling or landing upon the subject of julians love life had she not quickly seen upon her arrival how necessary was her presence at broughton manor had she not needed a respite from her mothers incessant displays of lugubrious mourning samantha knew that she would have decamped months before but she maintained her position and held her peacemost of the timebecause shed been able to see the bigger picture jeremys sobriety the blessed distraction that a reunion with him would provide her mother and julians gradual awakening to the contribution samantha was making to his wellbeing his future and his hope of transforming the derelict manor house and the estate into a thriving business sam she raised her head so deeply had she been into her attempt to release the tension of having a conversation with her uncle shed failed to hear his son come into the kitchen stupidly she said arent you with the dogs julian short shrift he said in explanation they need more but i cant give it to them now i did see to cass do you want me to shes dead my god julian she cant be samantha cried i went out as soon as i spoke with you she was fine shed eaten the puppies were all asleep i made notes of everything and left them on the clipboard didnt you see it i hung it on the peg nicola he said tonelessly sam shes dead out on calder moor where shed gone camping nicolas dead samantha stared at him as the word dead seemed to echo round the room he isnt crying she thought what does it mean that he isnt crying dead she repeated careful with the word certain that saying it the wrong way would give an impression that she didnt want to give he kept his eyes on her and she wished he wouldnt she wished hed talk or scream or cry or do something to indicate what was going on inside so that she would know how to behave with him when he finally moved it was to walk to the work top where samantha had been chopping the peppers he stood examining them as if they were a curiosity then he lifted the chefs knife and inspected it closely finally he pressed his thumb firmly against the sharp blade julian samantha cried youll hurt yourself a thin line of crimson appeared on his skin i dont know what to call how i feel he said samantha on the other hand didnt have that problem chapter di peter hanken apparently decided to show mercy when it came to the marlboros the first actions he took when they were on the road from buxton to padley gorge were to lean over flip open the fords glove compartment and pluck out a packet of sugarless gum as he folded a stick of it into his mouth lynley blessed him for his willingness to abstain from tobacco the di didnt speak as the a began its course through wye dale hugging the placid river for several miles before dipping slightly to the southeast it wasnt until they passed the second of the limestone quarries scarring the landscape that he made his first comment newlywed is it he said with a smile lynley steeled himself for the ribald humour that was doubtless coming the price one generally paid for legitimising a relationship with a woman yes just three months thats longer than most hollywood marriages i expect its the best time you and the wife starting out theres nothing else like it your first marriage yes for both of us we got a late start all the better lynley glanced at his companion warily wondering if the fallout from his parting argument with helen could be read on his face acting on hanken as an inspiration for a tongueincheek panegyric to the blessings of the marital state but all he saw in hankens expression was the evidence of a man who seemed content with his life names kathleen the di confided weve got three kids sarah bella and pj thats peter junior our newest here have a look he pulled a wallet from his jacket pocket and handed it over in pride of place was a family photo two small girls cuddling a blueblanketed newborn on a hospital bed with mum and dad cuddling the two small girls familys everything but youll be finding that out for yourself soon enough i dare say lynley tried to picture himself and helen similarly surrounded by winsome offspring he couldnt do it if he summoned up his wifes image at all it was as it had been earlier that day palefaced as she left him he stirred uncomfortably in his seat he didnt want to discuss marriage at the moment and he offered a silent imprecation to nkata for having brought up the subject at all theyre brilliant he said handing the wallet back to hanken boys the image of his dad hanken said hard to tell from that snap of course but there you have it theyre a handsome group to lynleys relief hanken took this as sufficient closing comment on the subject he returned his full attention to the driving he gave the road the same concentration that he appeared to give everything else in his immediate environment a characteristic of the man that lynley had had little difficulty in deducing after all there hadnt been a paper out of place in his office he was running the most orderly incident room in lynleys memory and his clothes made him look as if his next destination were a photo shoot for gq magazine they were on their way to see the parents of the dead girl having just met the home office pathologist whod traveled up from london to perform the postmortems theyd had their conference with her outside the postmortem room where she was changing from trainers into court shoes one of which she was in the process of repairing by pounding its heel into the metal plate on the door announcing that womens shoesnot to mention their handbagswere designed by men to promote the enslavement of the female sex she had eyed the dis comfortable footwear with undisguised hostility and said i can give you ten minutes the reportll be on your desk in the morning which one of you is hanken by the way you fine i know what you want its a knife with a threeinch blade folding knifepocket knifemost likely although it could be a small one used in the kitchen your killers righthanded and strong quite strong thats for the boy the girl was done in with that chunk of stone you had off the moor three blows to the head righthanded assailant as well the same killer hanken asked the pathologist gave her shoe five final pounds against the door as she reflected on the question she said brusquely that the bodies could tell only what theyd told how theyd been robbed of life what sort of weapons had been used against them and whether a right or left hand had wielded those weapons forensic evidencefibres hairs blood sputum skin and the likemight tell a longer more precise story but theyd have to queue to get the reports back from the lab for that the naked eye could discern only so much and shed told them what that so much was she tossed her shoe onto the floor and introduced herself as dr sue myles she was a stout woman with shortfingered hands grey hair and a chest that resembled the prow of a ship but her feet lynley noted as she slid them into her shoes were as slender as a debutantes one of the boys back wounds was more of a gouge she went on the blow chipped the left scapula so if you find a likely weapon we can go for a match from the blade to the bone that wound didnt kill him hanken wanted to know the poor sod bled to death wouldve taken some minutes but once he took a wound to the femoral arterythats in the groin by the wayhe was done for and the girl lynley asked skull cracked like an egg the postcerebral artery was pierced which meant what exactly hanken enquired epidural haematoma internal bleeding pressure on the brain she died in less than an hour it took longer than the boy right but shed have been unconscious once she was hit could we have two killers hanken asked directly could have yes dr myles confirmed defensive wounds on the boy lynley asked none that were obvious dr myles replied she settled her trainers into a sports bag and zipped it smartly before giving the officers her attention again hanken asked for confirmation on the times of the deaths dr myles enquired what times his own forensic pathologist had given him thirtysix to fortyeight hours before the bodies had been discovered hanken told her i wouldnt argue with that and she scooped up her bag nodded a curt farewell and headed towards the hospital exit now in the car lynley reflected on what they knew that the boy had brought nothing with him into the camp site that there were anonymous and threatening letters left at the scene that the girl was unconscious for close to an hour that the two means of murder were entirely different lynley was dwelling on this last thought when hanken swung the car to the left and they headed north in the direction of a town called tideswell along this route they ultimately regained the river wye where the steep cliffs and the woods surrounding millers dale had long since brought dusk to the village just beyond the last cottage a narrow lane veered northwest and hanken steered the ford into it they quickly climbed above the woods and the valley and within minutes were cruising along a vast expanse of heather and gorse that appeared to undulate endlessly towards the horizon calder moor hanken said the largest moor in all the white peak it stretches from here to castleton he drove another minute in silence till they came to a layby he pulled into it and let the engine idle if shed gone camping in the dark peak wed have had mountain rescue going after her eventually when she didnt turn up no little old bat with a doggy to walk wouldve taken her constitutional up there and found the bodies but thishe swept his hand in an arc above the dashboardis accessible all of it therere miles and miles to cover if someone gets lost but at least those miles can be handled on foot not an easy walk and not entirely safe but easier to tackle than the peat bogs youll find round kinder scout if someone had to be murdered in the district better it happened here on the limestone plateau than the other is this where nicola maiden set off lynley asked there was no track that he could see from the car the girl would have had to fight her way through everything from bracken to bilberry hanken rolled down his window and spat out his chewing gum he reached over lynley and flipped open the glove compartment to fish out another stick she set off from the other side northwest of here she was hiking out to nine sisters henge whichs closer to the western boundary of the moor rather more of interest to be looked at on that side tumuli caverns caves barrows nine sisters henge is the highlight youre from this area lynley asked hanken didnt answer at once he looked as if he was considering whether to answer at all he made the decision at last and said from wirksworth and appeared to seal his lips on the subject youre lucky to live where your history is i wish i could say the same for myself depends on the history hanken said and changed gears abruptly with want to have a look at the site lynley was wise enough to know that how he met the offer to look over the crime scene would be crucial to the relationship he developed with the other officer the truth was that he did want to see the site of the murders no matter the point at which he joined an investigation there was always a time during the course of the enquiry when he felt the need to look things over himself not because he didnt trust the competence of his fellow investigators but because only through a firsthand viewing of as much as possible of what related to the case was he able to become a part of the crime and it was in becoming a part of the crime that he did his best work photographs reports and physical evidence conveyed a great deal but sometimes the place where a murder occurred held back secrets from even the most astute observer it would be in pursuit of those secrets that lynley would inspect a murder scene however inspecting this particular murder scene ran the risk of unnecessarily alienating di hanken and nothing hanken had said or done so far even hinted that he might overlook a detail there would be an occasion lynley thought when he and the other officer wouldnt be working this case in each others presence when that occasion arose he would have ample opportunity to examine the location where nicola maiden and the boy had died you and your team have covered that end of things as far as i can see lynley said it wastes our time for me to go over what youve already done hanken gave him another lengthy scrutiny chewing his gum in staccato wise decision he said with a nod as he put the car back into gear they cruised northwards along the eastern edge of the moor perhaps a mile beyond the little market town of tideswell they turned to the east and began to leave the heather bilberry and bracken behind they drove a short distance into a daleits gentle slopes dotted with trees that were only just beginning to display the foliage of the coming autumnand at a junction that was curiously signposted to the plague village they headed north again less than quarter of an hour took them to maiden hall situated in the shelter of limes and chestnut trees on a hillside not far from padley gorge the route coursed them through a verdant woodland and along the edge of an incision in the landscape made by a brook that tumbled out of the woods and cut a meandering path between slopes of limestone fern and wild grass the turnoff to maiden hall rose suddenly as they entered another stretch of woodland it twisted up a hillside and spilled out into a gravel drive that swung round the front of a gabled stone victorian structure and led to a car park behind it the hotel entrance was actually at the back of the building there a discreet sign printed with the single word reception directed them through a passage and into the hunting lodge itself a small desk stood just inside beyond this a sitting room apparently served as the hotel lounge where the original entrance to the building had been converted to a bar and the room itself had been restored with oak wainscoting subdued cream and umber wallpaper and overstuffed furniture as it was too early for any of the residents to be gathering for preprandial drinks the lounge was deserted but lynley and hanken hadnt been in the room for a minute before a dumplingshaped womanredeyed and rednosed from weepingcame from what appeared to be the dining room and greeted them with some considerable dignity there were no rooms available for the evening she told them quietly and as there had been a sudden death in the family the dining room would not be open tonight but she would be happy to recommend several restaurants in the area should the gentlemen require one hanken offered the woman his police identification and introduced lynley the woman said youll be wanting to speak to the maidens ill fetch them and she ducked past the officers hurried through the reception area and began climbing the stairs lynley walked to one of the lounges two alcoves where late afternoon light was filtering through leadpaned windows these overlooked the drive that curved round the front of the house beyond it a lawn had been reduced to a heatbaked mat of twisted blades in the previous months drought behind him he could hear hanken moving restlessly round the room a few magazines shifted position and slapped down onto table tops lynley smiled at the sound his fellow di was doubtless giving in to his restless need to put things in order it was absolutely quiet inside the hunting lodge the windows were open so the sound of birds and a distant plane broke the stillness but inside it was as hushed as an empty church a door closed somewhere and footsteps crunched across gravel a moment later a darkhaired man in jeans and a sleeveless grey sweatshirt pedaled past the windows on a tenspeed bicycle he disappeared into the trees as the maiden hall drive began to descend the hill the maidens joined them then lynley turned from the window at the sound of their entrance and hankens formal mr and mrs maiden please accept our sympathies lynley saw that the years of his retirement had dealt with andy maiden kindly the former so officer and his wife were both in their early sixties but they looked at least a decade younger andy had developed the appearance of an outdoorsman a tanned face a flat stomach a brawny chest all of which seemed suited to a man whod left behind a reputation for disappearing chameleonlike into his environment his wife matched him in physical condition she too was tanned and solid as if she took frequent exercise both of them looked as if theyd missed more than one nights sleep though andy maiden was unshaven in rumpled clothing nan was haggard beneath her eyes a puckering of skin that was purplish in hue maiden managed a grateful halfsmile tommy thank you for coming lynley said im sorry it has to be under these circumstances and introduced himself to maidens wife he said everyone at the yard sends condolences andy scotland yard nan maiden sounded dazed her husband said in a moment love he made a gesture with his arm indicating the alcove behind lynley where two sofas faced each other across a coffee table that was spread with copies of country life he and his wife took one of the sofas lynley the other hanken swiveled an armchair round and positioned himself just a few inches away from the central point between the maidens and lynley the action suggested that he would play a mediating influence between the parties but lynley noted that the di was careful to place his chair several inches closer to scotland yard of the present than to scotland yard of the past if andy maiden was aware of hankens manoeuvre and what it implied he gave no sign instead he sat forward on the sofa with his hands balanced between his legs left hand massaged right right massaged left his wife observed him doing this she passed him a small red ball that she took from her pocket saying is it still bad shall i phone the doctor for you youre ill lynley asked maiden squeezed the ball with his right hand and gazed at the spread fingers of his left circulation he said its nothing please let me phone the doctor andy his wife said thats not whats important how can you say nan maidens eyes grew suddenly bright god did i forget even for a moment she leaned her forehead against her husbands shoulder and began to cry roughly maiden put his arm round her lynley cast a look at hanken you or i he asked silently its not going to be pleasant hankens reply was a sharp nod its yours the nod said there isnt going to be an easy time to talk about your daughters death lynley began gently but in a murder investigationand i know that youre already aware of this andythe first hours are critical as he spoke nan maiden raised her head she tried to speak failed then tried again murder investigation she repeated what are you saying lynley looked from husband to wife hanken did likewise then they looked at each other lynley said to andy youve seen the body havent you youve been told what happened yes maiden said ive been told but i murder his wife cried out in horror oh my god andy you never said nicola was murdered barbara havers had spent the afternoon in greenford making the decision to use the rest of her sick day to visit her mother in hawthorn lodge an overnamed postwar semidetached where mrs havers had lived as a permanent resident for the last ten months in the way of most people who attempt to gain support from others for a position that might be untenable barbara had found that there was a price to pay for successfully cultivating advocates among inspector lynleys friends and relatives and because she didnt want to face any more pricepaying in one afternoon she sought a distraction mrs havers was nothing if not adept at providing escape hatches from reality since she herself no longer lived in that realm on a regular basis barbara had found her in the back garden of hawthorn lodge where she was engaged in putting together a jigsaw puzzle the puzzles box top had been propped up against an old mayonnaise jar that was filled with coloured sand holding seven plastic carnations in position on this box top a smarmy cartoon princeperfectly proportioned and demonstrating a sufficient amount of adoration for the occasionwas slipping a highheeled glass shoe onto the slender and curiously toeless foot of cinderella while the girls two cowlike and resentful stepsisters watched jealously to one side culling a richly deserved comeuppance with the tender encouragement of her nurse and keeper mrs floas florence magentry was called by her three elderly residents and their familiesmrs havers had managed successfully to assemble cinderella part of the stepsisters the princes shoewielding arm his manly torso and his bent left leg however as barbara joined her she was in the midst of attempting to pound the princes face onto one of the stepsisters shoulders and when mrs flo gently guided her hand towards the proper placement of the piece mrs havers shouted no no no and pushed the whole puzzle away knocking over the jar scattering its plastic carnations and spilling sand across the table barbaras intervention didnt help matters whether her mother recognised her during visits was always a matter of chance and on this day mrs havers clouded consciousness attached barbaras face to someone called libby orourke who apparently had been the school temptress during mrs havers childhood it seemed that libby orourke had operated in a female version of georgie porgie mode most of the time and one of the boys whom shed kissed was none other than mrs havers own beau an act of effrontery that mrs havers felt compelled to avenge on this very day by throwing puzzle pieces shouting invective coloured by the sort of language barbara wouldnt have thought part of her mothers vocabulary and ultimately crumpling into a weeping heap it was a situation that had taken some handling persuading her mother to leave the garden urging her upstairs to her room coaxing her to look through a family album long enough to see that barbaras round and snubby face appeared on its pages far too often for her to be the loathsome libby but i dont have a little girl mrs havers protested in a voice more frightened than confused when shed been forced to agree that libby orourkes being given a position of prominence in the family album made no sense considering the offence she had once given mummy wont let me have babies i cn only have dolls barbara had no answer for that her mothers mind made the tortuous journey into the past too often and with so little warning that shed long ago forgiven herself her inability to deal with it with any expertise so after the album was set aside she hadnt made any further attempts to argue persuade dissuade or appeal shed merely selected one of the travel magazines that her mother loved to thumb through and shed spent ninety minutes sitting shoulder to shoulder on the edge of the bed with the woman whod forgotten shed ever given birth looking at photographs of thailand australia and greece that was when her conscience finally gained some dominance over her resistance and the internal voice that had earlier decried lynleys actions was confronted by a voice that suggested her own actions might have been wanting what ensued was a nonverbal argument taking place in her head one side insisted that inspector lynley was a vindictive prig the other informed her thatprig or nothe didnt deserve her disloyalty and she had been disloyal trotting round to chelsea in order to denounce him to his intimates was not the behaviour of a steadfast friend on the other hand hed been disloyal as well taking it upon himself to amplify her formal punishment by overlooking her on a case hed more than illustrated whose side he was on in her battle to save her professional hide no matter what he claimed about her need to keep a low profile for a while such was the argument that raged within her it began as she leafed through the travel magazines and murmured comments about fantasy holidays her mother had taken to crete mykonos bangkok and perth it continued unabated on her drive from greenford back into london at the end of the day not even an ancient fleetwood mac tape playing at maximum volume could subdue the disputing parties inside barbaras head because throughout the drive singing harmony with stevie nicks was the mezzo soprano of barbaras conscience a sententious cantata that stubbornly refused to be excised from her brain he deserved it he deserved it he deserved it she silently screamed at the voice and where did giving him what he deserved get you my darling her conscience replied she was still refusing to answer that question when she pulled into steeles road and slid the mini into a parking space that was being conveniently vacated by a woman three children two dogs and what appeared to be a cello with legs she locked up and trudged in the direction of eton villas gratified that she was feeling tired because tired meant sleep and sleep meant putting an end to the voices she heard other voices however as she rounded the corner and came upon the yellow edwardian house behind which sat her mousehole dwelling these new voices were coming from the flagstone area in front of the ground floor flat and one of these voicesbelonging to a childcried out happily when barbara came through the gate of bright orange pickets barbara hullo hullo dad and i are blowing bubbles come and see when the light hits them just exactly right they look like round rainbows did you know that barbara come and see come and see the little girl and her father were seated on the solitary wooden bench in front of their flat she in the fastfading light he in the growing shadows where his cigarette glowed like a crimson firefly he touched his daughters head fondly and rose in the formal fashion that was his by nature youll join us taymullah azhar asked barbara oh do do do the child exclaimed after the bubbles were watching a video the little mermaid and weve got toffee apples for a treat well weve only got two but ill share mine with you ones too much for me to eat anyway she scooted off the bench and came to greet barbara dancing across the lawn with the bubble wand and creating a trail of round rainbows behind her the little mermaid is it barbara said thoughtfully i dont know hadiyyah ive never thought of myself as a disney sort of bird all those skinny sloanetypes being rescued by blokes in suits of armour this is a mermaid hadiyyah interrupted instructively hence the title yeah right so she cant be rescued by someone in armour cause hed sink to the bottom of the sea and anyways no one saves her at all she saves the prince now theres a twist i might be able to live with youve never seen it have you well tonight you can do come hadiyyah whirled round in a circle surrounding herself with a hoop of bubbles her long thick plaits flew about her shoulders the silver ribbons that tied them glittering like pale dragonflies the little mermaids prettiern anything she has auburn hair a good contrast to her scales and she wears the sweetest little shells on her chest hadiyyah demonstrated with two small dark hands cupped over two nonexistent breasts ah strategically placed i see barbara said wont you watch it with us please like i said weve got toffee apples coaxingly she drew out the last two words hadiyyah her father said quietly an invitation once extended neednt be repeated and to barbara nonetheless wed be most happy to have you join us barbara considered the proposition an evening with hadiyyah and her father offered the potential for more distraction and she liked the thought of that very much she could sit with her little friend comfortably lounging on enormous floor pillows their heads in their palms and their feet in the air swaying side by side as they kept time to the music she could chat to her little friends father afterwards when hadiyyah herself had been sent off to bed taymullah azhar would expect that much it was a habit theyd developed during the months of barbaras enforced leave from scotland yard and in the past few weeks especially their dialogue had moved from the banalities of relative strangers being polite to the initial delicate conversational probing of two individuals who might become friends but in that friendship lay the rub of the matter it called for barbara to reveal her encounters with hillier and lynley it required the truth of her demotion and her estrangement from the man shed sought to emulate and because azhars own eightyearold daughter was the child whose life had been saved by barbaras impetuous actions on the north seaactions that shed managed to keep from azhar in the three months since the chase had occurredhe would feel a responsibility for the fallout to her career that wasnt his to bear hadiyyah taymullah azhar said when barbara didnt answer i think weve had enough bubbles for the evening return them to your room and wait for me there please hadiyyahs small brow furrowed and her eyes looked stricken but dad the little mermaid we shall watch it as previously decided hadiyyah put the bubbles in your room now she gave barbara an anxious glance moren half the toffee apple she said if youd like barbara hadiyyah she smiled impishly and dashed into the house azhar reached into the breast pocket of his spotless white shirt and brought forth a packet of cigarettes which he offered barbara took one said thanks and accepted his light as well he observed her in silence until she grew so restive that she was compelled to speak im knackered azhar ill have to cry off tonight but thanks tell hadiyyah im happy to watch a film with her another time hopefully when the heroine isnt as skinny as a pencil with a silicone chest his gaze was unwavering he studied her the way other people studied the labels on tins in supermarkets barbara wanted to writhe away but she managed to restrain herself he said you must have returned to work today whyd you think your clothing has yourhe searched for a word a euphemism undoubtedlysituation been resolved at new scotland yard barbara there was no point in lying despite the fact that shed been able to keep from him the full knowledge of what had occurred to put her there he knew that shed been placed on suspension she was going to have to start dragging herself out of bed and down to work each morning beginning with the very next day so he would deduce sooner or later that she wasnt spending her waking hours feeding the ducks in regents park any longer yeah she said it was resolved today and she drew in deeply on her cigarette so that shed have to turn her head and blow the smoke away from his face thus hiding her own and but what am i asking youre dressed for work so it must have gone well right she offered him a spurious smile it did all the way im still gainfully employed still in cid still have my pension intact shed lost the confidence of the only person who counted at the yard but she didnt add that she couldnt imagine an occasion when she would this is good azhar said right its the best im happy to know that nothing from essex affected you here in london again that level gaze of his dark eyes the colour of chocolate drops in a face with nutbrown skin that was amazingly unlined on a man of thirtyfive yeah well it didnt she said everything worked out brilliantly he nodded looking past her finally above her head and up into the fading sky the lights from london would hide all but the most brilliant of the coming nights stars even those that shone would do so through a thick pall of pollution that not even the growing darkness could dissipate as a child i drew my greatest comfort from the night he told her quietly in pakistan my family slept in the traditional way the men together the women together so at night in the presence of my father my brother and my uncles i always believed that i was perfectly safe and secure but i forgot that feeling as i came into adulthood in england what had been reassuring became an embarrassment from my past i found that all i could remember were the sounds of my father and my uncles snoring and the smell of my brothers breaking wind for some time when i came to be alone i thought how good it was to be away from them at last to have the night for myself and for whomever i wished to share it with and thats how i lived for a while but now i find that i would willingly return to that older way when whatever ones burdens or secrets were there was always a senseat least at nightof never having to bear them or keep them alone there was something so comforting in his words that barbara found herself wanting to grasp the invitation to disclosure that they implied but she stopped herself from doing so saying prhaps pakistan doesnt prepare its children for the worlds reality what reality is that the one that tells us were all alone do you believe that to be the truth barbara i dont just believe it i know it we use our daytimes to escape our nighttimes we work we play we keep ourselves busy but when its time to sleep we run out of distractions even if were in bed with someone their act of sleeping when we cant manage it is enough to tell us that weve got only ourselves is this philosophy or experience speaking neither she said just the way it is but not he said the way it has to be at the comment alarm bells went off in barbaras head then quickly receded coming from any other bloke the remark could have been construed as a chatup line but her personal history was an illustration of the fact that barbara wasnt the type of bird blokes chatted up besides even if shed ever had the odd moments of aphrodisian allure she knew this wasnt one of them standing in the semidark in a rumpled linen suit that made her look like a transvestite toad she knew quite well that she was hardly a paragon of desirability so ever articulate when it counted she said yeah well whatever and tossed her cigarette to the ground where she mashed it with the sole of her shoe goodnight then she added enjoy the mermaid and thanks for the fag i needed it everyone needs something azhar reached into his shirt pocket again barbara thought he was going to offer his cigarettes another time but instead he extended to her a folded piece of paper a gentleman was here looking for you earlier barbara he asked me to make sure you got this note he tried to fix it to your door he said but it wouldnt stay in place gentleman barbara knew only one man to whom that word would automatically be applied by a stranger after a mere moments conversation she took the piece of paper scarcely daring to hope which was just as well because the writing on the notea sheet of paper removed from a small spiral notebookwasnt lynleys she read the eight words page me as soon as you get this a number followed them there was no signature barbara refolded the note doing so she saw what was written on the outside of it what azhar himself must have seen interpreted and understood the moment it had been handed over dc havers was printed in block capitals across it c for constable so azhar knew she met his gaze looks like im back in the game already she said as heartily as she could manage thanks azhar this bloke say where hed be waiting for the page azhar shook his head he said only that i should make sure you had the message okay thanks she gave him a nod and turned to walk away he called her namesounding urgentbut when she stopped and glanced back he was studying the street he said can you tell me and then his voice died away he drew his eyes back to her as if the effort cost him tell you what she asked though she felt apprehension dance along her spine when she said the words tell me how is your mother azhar asked mum well shes a bloody disaster when it comes to jigsaw puzzles but otherwise i think shes okay he smiled thats good to know and with a quiet goodnight he slipped into the house barbara went to her own lodgings a tiny cottage that sat at the bottom of the back garden sheltered by the limbs of an old false acacia it was not much larger than a potting shed with mod cons once inside she peeled herself out of her linen jacket tossed the string of faux pearls onto the table that served purposes as diverse as dining and ironing and went to the phone there were no messages on her machine she wasnt surprised she punched in the number for the pager punched in her own number and waited five minutes later someone phoned she made herself wait through four of the doublerings before she answered there was no reason to sound desperate she decided her caller she discovered was winston nkata and her back went up the instant she heard that unmistakable mellifluous voice with its mixed flavours of jamaica and sierra leone he was in the load of hay tavern just round the corner on chalk farm road he told her finishing up a plate of lamb curry and rice that was not do believe me something my mum would ever put on the table for her favourite son but its better than mcdonalds although not by much he would set off straightaway for her digs be there in five minutes he said and rang off before she had a chance to tell him that his mug was just about the last one she wanted to see putting in an appearance on her doorstep she hung up the phone muttered an expletive and went to the refrigerator to graze five minutes stretched to ten ten minutes to fifteen he didnt show up bastard barbara thought fine idea of a joke she went to the bathroom and turned on the shower lynley tried to adjust quickly to the astonishing fact that andy maiden hadnt told his wife that their daughter had been the victim of a crime since calder moor was a location replete with potential sites of accidents lynleys former colleague had apparently and unaccountably allowed his wife to believe that their daughter had fractured her skull in a fall when she learned otherwise nan maiden crumpled forward elbows pressed into her thighs and fists raised to her mouth either shocked too stricken with grief to comprehend or comprehending something only too well she didnt weep further she merely muttered a guttural oh god oh god oh god di hanken appeared to take a fairly quick measure of what was implied by her reaction he was observing andy maiden with a decidedly unsympathetic eye he asked no questions in response to nans revelation though like a good cop he merely waited in the aftermath of all this maiden waited as well still he apparently reached the conclusion that something was required of him by way of explanation for his incomprehensible behaviour love im sorry he said to nan i couldnt im sorry nan i could barely cope with the fact that shed died let alone tell let alone have to face have to begin to deal with he spent a moment rigidly marshaling the inner resources a policeman learned to develop in order to live through the worst of the worst his right handstill in possession of the ball his wife had given himclutched and released it spasmodically im so sorry he said brokenly nan nan maiden raised her head she watched him for a moment then her handshaking as it wasreached out and closed over his arm she spoke to the police would you her lips quivered she didnt go on until she had the emotion under control tell me what happened di hanken obliged with minimal details he explained where nicola maiden had died and how but he told them nothing more would she have suffered nan asked when hanken had concluded his brief remarks i know you cant be positive but if theres anything that might allow us to feel that at the end anything at all lynley recounted what the home office pathologist had told them nan reflected on the information for a moment in the silence andy maidens breath sounded loud and harsh nan said i wanted to know because dyou think would she have called out for one of us would she have hoped or needed her eyes filled she stopped talking hearing the questions lynley was reminded of the old moors murders the monstrous tape recording that myra hindley and her cohort had made and the anguish of the dead girls mother when the recording had been played at the trial and shed had to listen to her childs terrified voice crying out for her mummy in the midst of her murder isnt there a certain kind of knowledge he thought that shouldnt be revealed publicly because it cant be borne privately he said the blows to the head knocked her unconscious at once she stayed that way and on her body were there other had she been had anyone she wasnt tortured hanken cut in as if he too felt the need to show some mercy to the dead girls mother she wasnt raped well have a fuller report later but at the moment it seems that the blows to the head were all that shehe paused it seemed in the search for a word that connoted the least painexperienced maiden said she looked asleep white like chalk but still asleep i want that to make it better nan said but it doesnt and nothing will lynley thought andy weve got a possible identification on the second body were going to need to press forward we think the boy was called terence cole he had a london address in shoreditch is his name familiar to you she wasnt alone the glance nan maiden cast at her husband told the police that hed withheld this information from her as well she wasnt alone maiden said hanken clarified the situation for nan maiden explaining that the camping gear of one person onlywhich he would later ask maiden to identify as belonging to his daughterhad been within the enclosure of nine sisters henge along with the body of a teenaged boy who himself had no gear other than the clothes on his back that motorcycle by her car maiden pulled his facts together quickly it belonged to him to a terence cole hanken affirmed not reported stolen and so far not claimed by anyone coming off the moor its registered to an address in shoreditch weve a man heading there now to see whats what but it seems likely that weve got the right id is the name familiar to either of you maiden shook his head and said cole not to me nan i dont know him and nicola surely she would have talked about him if he was a friend of hers she would have brought him round to meet us as well when did she not thats it was her way andy maiden then spoke perspicaciously asking a logical question that rose from his years of policing is there any chance that nick he paused and seemed to prepare his wife for the question by laying a hand gently on her thigh could she just have been in the wrong place could the boy have been the target tommy and he looked to lynley that would have to be a consideration in any other case lynley admitted but not in this case why have a look at this hanken produced a copy of the handwritten note that had been found on nicola maidens body the maidens read the five words on itthis bitch has had itas hanken advised them that the original had been found tucked into their daughters pocket andy maiden stared long at the note he shifted the red ball to his left hand and clutched it jesus god are you telling us someone went there to kill her someone tracked her to kill her that this wasnt just a case of her meeting up with strangers a stupid argument breaking out over something a psychopath killing her and that boy for the thrill of it its doubtful hanken said but you know the procedure as well as we do i expect which was lynley knew his way of saying that as a police officer andy maiden would know that every avenue potentially related to the killing of his daughter was going to be explored he said if someone went out to the moor specifically to kill your daughter we must consider why but she didnt have enemies nan maiden declared i know thats what you expect every mother to say but in this case its the truth everyone liked nicola she was that kind of person not everyone apparently mrs maiden hanken said and he brought forth the copies of the anonymous letters that had also been at the site andy maiden and his wife read these in silence and without expression she was the one who finally spoke as she did so her husbands gaze remained locked on the letters and both man and woman sat still like statues its impossible she said nicola cant have received these youre making a mistake if you think that she did why because we never saw them and if shed been threatenedby anyone by anyoneshe would have told us at once if she didnt want to worry you please believe me that wasnt how she was she didnt think like that about worrying us and such she thought only about telling the truth if something had been going wrong in her life she would have told us thats how she was she talked about everything everything truly and with an earnest look at her husband andy with an effort he took his eyes off the letters his face which had appeared bloodless before was now even more so he said i dont want to think it but its the best possible answer if someone actually tracked her if someone wasnt with her already if someone didnt just stumble upon her and kill her and the boy for the sick fun of it what lynley asked so he said heavily looking as if the words cost him dearly there were so many cases over the years so many yobs put away killers drug dealers crime bosses you name them i rolled in the muck with them andy no his wife protested apparently understanding where he was heading this has nothing to do with you someone out on parole tracking us down hanging round long enough to get to know our movements he turned to her then you see how it could have happened dont you someone out for revenge nancy striking at nick because he knew that to hurt my daughtermy girlwas to kill me in stages to sentence me to a living death lynley said its a possibility that we cant rule out can we because if as you say your daughter had no enemies then were left with the single question who had if you put away someone whos out on parole andy were going to need the name jesus there were scores the yard can pull all your old files in london but you can help by giving us some direction if theres a particular investigation that stands out in your memory you could halve our work by listing the players ive got my diaries diaries hanken asked i once thought maiden shook his head selfderisively i thought of writing after retirement memoirs ego but the hotel came along and i never got round to it ive got the diaries though if i have a look through them perhaps a name a face he seemed to crumple then as if the weight of responsibility for his daughters death bore down on him heavily you dont know this for certain nan maiden said andy please dont do this to yourself hanken said well follow whatever leads turn up so if then follow julian nan maiden spoke as if determined to prove that there were other avenues to explore beyond the one that led to her husbands past maiden said nancy dont julian lynley said julian britton nan told them hed just become engaged to nicola she wasnt suggesting him as a suspect but if the police were looking for leads then they certainly would want to talk to julian nicola had been with him the night before she left for her camping trip she might have said something to julianor done something eventhat would result in another possibility for the police to explore in their investigation it was a reasonable enough suggestion lynley thought he jotted down julians name and address nan maiden supplied the information for his part hanken brooded and he said nothing more until he and lynley had returned to the car it may all be a blind you know he switched on the ignition reversed out of their parking space and turned the car to face maiden hall there he let the engine idle while he studied the old limestone structure what lynley asked so this business of someone from his past its a bit too convenient wouldnt you say convenient is an odd choice of words to describe a lead and a potential suspect lynley said unless you yourself already suspect he looked towards the hall exactly what is it that you suspect peter dyou know the white peak hanken asked abruptly it runs from buxton to ashbourne from matlock to castleton weve got dales weve got moors weve got trails weve got hills thiswith a gesture at the environmentis part of it sos the road we came in on for that matter and hanken turned in his seat to face lynley squarely and in all this vast amount of space on last tuesday nightor wednesday morning if we want to believe himandy maiden managed to find his daughters car hidden out of sight behind a stone wall what would you say the odds are on that lynley looked to the building to its windows reflecting the last of the daylight like row upon row of shielded eyes why didnt you tell me he asked the other di i didnt think of it hanken said not till our boy brought up so not till our andy got caught out keeping the truth from his wife he wanted to spare her as long as he could what man wouldnt lynley asked a man with nothing on his conscience hanken said showered and changed into the most comfortable elasticwaisted trousers that she possessed barbara was back to grazingon leftover takeaway pork fried rice which unheated wasnt about to make it onto anyones culinary top tenwhen nkata arrived he announced himself with two sharp raps on the door she swung it open takeaway container in hand and leveled a chopstick at him your watch stopped or something what goes for five minutes in your book winston he stepped inside unbidden and flashed her the full wattage of his smile sorry got another page before i could clear out the guv i had to phone him first of course cant keep his lordship waiting nkata let the comment go damned lucky that service is slow at the pub i shouldve been out of there thirty minutes ago which wouldve put me too close to shoreditch to come back here for you funny isnt it like my mum always says things work out exactly the way theyre sposed to barbara stared at him wordless she felt nonplused she wanted to tell him off for the note hed left herand for the letter c so prominent on itbut his air of ease stopped her she couldnt explain his nonchalance any more than she could explain his presence inside her dwelling he could at least look bloody uncomfortable she decided we got two bodies in derbyshire and a london angle that needs playing on the case nkata said he sketched in the details a woman a young man a former so officer anonymous letters assembled from newsprint a threatening note written by hand i got to get over to an address in shoreditch where this dead bloke mightve come from he told her if someones there who can id the body im on my way back to buxton in the morning but the yard end of thingsll need looking into the spector just told me to set that up thats why he paged barbara couldnt hide her eagerness when she said lynley asked for me nkatas glance shifted away for an instant but that was enough her spirits came to earth i see she carried her takeaway container to the kitchen work top the rice sat heavily on her stomach its flavour clung to her tongue like fur if he doesnt know youre asking me winston i can refuse with no one the wiser cant i you can pass me by and get someone else can do sure nkata said i can check the rota or i can wait till morning and let the super make the call but doing all that leaves you free to get assigned to stewart hale or macpherson doesnt it and i didnt much think youd want to go that way if you didnt have to he left unsaid what was legend in cid barbaras failure to establish a working relationship with the dis hed mentioned her subsequent return to uniform from which she had only been elevated by her partnership with lynley barbara swung around perplexed by what appeared to be the other dcs inexplicable generosity another man in his position would have left her hanging in the wind the better to improve his own position and to hell with what she might have to face that nkata wasnt doing so made her doubly cautious he was saying its computer work the guv wants on cris not your thing i know but i thought if you wanted to come to shoreditch with mewhich is why i was in your neighbourhood in the first placei could drop you at the yard afterwards and you could get onto crime recording straightaway if you pull something good from the records quick who knows nkata shifted on his feet his air of ease diminished slightly as he concluded it could go some distance to setting you right barbara found an unopened packet of cigarettes wedged between the crumbdusted toaster and a box of watermelon poptarts she lit up using one of the gas burners on the cooker and she tried to make sense of what she was hearing i dont get it this is your chance winston why dont you take it my chance for what he said looking blank you know for what to climb the ladder to ascend the mountain to fly to the moon my stock with lynley couldnt be much lower nows your chance to break out of the pack why arent you taking it or better said whyre you taking the risk that i might do something to untarnish myself the spector told me to bring in another dc nkata said i thought of you and there they were those two ugly letters once again dc and there was the nasty reminder as well of what she had been and what she had become of course nkata would have thought of her what better way to rub her face in her loss of position and authority than by bringing her in as a fellow dc his superior no longer ah she said another dc as to that she scooped up the note from where shed left it on the dining table next to her necklace she said i guess ive got to thank you for this havent i id been thinking about taking out an advert in the paper to inform the general public but youve saved me the trouble nkatas eyebrows knotted whatre you on about the note winston did you honestly think i might forget my position or did you just want to remind me that were equals now players on a level pitch lest i forget hang on youve got it dead wrong have i right i dont think so what other reason could there possibly be for you to address me as dc havers c for constable just like you most obvious reason in the world nkata said really whats that ive never called you barb she blinked what ive never called you barb he repeated just sarge always that and then this he used his wide hands in a gesture that encompassed the room but meant the day as she very well knew i didnt know what else the name and everything he grimaced and rubbed the back of his neck which lowered his head and ended eye contact he said dcs only your title anyway its not who you are barbara was struck dumb she stared at him his attractive face with its nasty scar looked unsure at the moment which had to be a first she thought back and relived in an instant the cases on which shed worked with nkata and in reliving them she was a witness to the truth she covered her confusion with her cigarette inhaling exhaling studying the ash flicking grey flakes of it into the sink when the silence between them became too much for her she sighed and said jesus winston sorry bloody hell right he said so are you in or out im in she answered good he said and winnie she added im barbara as well chapter it was dark by the time they cruised into chart street in shoreditch and sought out a parking space along a pavement that was lined with vauxhalls opels and volkswagens barbara had felt a distinct twinge in her gut when nkata had led her to lynleys sleek silver car a possession so prized by the inspector that merely to have been handed its keys was an eloquent statement of lynleys confidence in his subordinate officer she herself had been casually tossed that key ring on only two occasions but both had come long after shed worked her first case as the inspectors partner indeed reflecting upon her association with lynley she found that she couldnt begin to imagine him passing his car keys over to the person shed been on the first investigation theyd worked together that hed given them so easily to nkata spoke volumes about the nature of their relationship fine she thought with resignation thats just the way it is she studied the neighbourhood through which they were driving looking for the street address that the dvla had listed as belonging to the owner of the motorcycle found near the murder scene in derbyshire like so many of its sister districts in london shoreditch may have been down at one time or another but it could never be counted fully out it was a densely populated area comprising a narrow appendix of land that dangled from the greater body of hackney in northeast london since it formed one of the boundaries of the city some of shoreditch had been encroached upon by the sort of financial institutions one expected to see only within the roman walls of old london other parts of it had been taken over by industry and commercial development but there were still vestiges of the former villages of haggeston and hoxton in shoreditch even if some of those vestiges merely took the form of commemorative plaques marking the spots where the burbages had plied their theatrical trade and where associates of william shakespeare lay buried chart street appeared to represent the history of the district in one brief thoroughfare forming a dogleg that stretched between pitfield street and east road it contained commercial establishments as well as residences some of the buildings were smart modern and new and consequently they expressed the abundance of the city others awaited that miracle of london neighbourhoodsgentrificationwhich could take a simple street and transform it from slum into yuppie paradise within the space of a few short years the address produced by the dvla took them to a line of terraced houses that in appearance were somewhere between the two extremes of disintegration and renovation the terrace itself was flatfronted and constructed of brick and while the woodwork of the house in question badly needed painting its windows were hung with white curtains that at least from the exterior looked crisp and clean nkata found a parking space in front of the marie lloyd pub he slid the bentley into it with the sort of concentration that barbara imagined a neurosurgeon giving to a patients brain she shoved open the door and clambered out the third time the other dc meticulously straightened the car she lit a fag and said winston bloody hell youre not clocking on and neither one of us is getting any younger come on nkata chuckled affably giving you time to see to your habit thanks but i dont need to smoke a whole packet the car finally parked to his satisfaction nkata eased out of it locked it and set its alarm he checked scrupulously to make sure the doors were secured before joining barbara on the pavement they walked to the house barbara smoking and nkata ruminating at the yellow front door he paused barbara thought he was giving her time to finish off her fag and she puffed away bulking up on the nicotine as she usually did before embarking on a task that could turn unpleasant but when she finally tossed the burning end of the cigarette into the street nkata still didnt move she said so are we going in whats up he roused himself to answer saying thiss my first first what oh first time as the bearer of bad tidings well take comfort it doesnt get any easier he shot her a look smiled ruefully funny when you think he said quietly the caribbean in him coming out in his pronunciation of the final word tink he said think what think how many times it couldve been my mum getting a visit like this from the rozzers if id kept on walking the path i was walking yeah well she jerked her head towards the door and mounted the single step weve all got blots on our copybooks winnie the faint sound of a childs crying seeped round the cracks in the doorjamb when barbara rang the bell the crying approached it intensified a womans harassed voice said shush now shush thats quite enough darryl you made your point and then called through the panels whos there then police barbara answered can we have a word there was no response at first other than darryls crying which went unabated then the door swung open and they were confronted by a woman with a small boy on her hip he was in the act of rubbing his running nose against the collar of the green smock she wore the primrose path was embroidered on the left breast of this along with the name sal beneath it barbara had her warrant card ready she was showing it to sal when a younger woman came dashing down the narrow stairs that rose about nine feet from the entry she wore a chenille dressing gown with one chewedup sleeve her hair was wet she said sorry mum give him here thanks for the break i needed it darryl whatre you on about luv da darryl sobbed and reached a grimy hand towards nkata wanting his daddy nkata remarked not likely hed be wanting that bloody bastard sal muttered give your granna kiss then darling boy she said to darryl who in his distress didnt oblige her she bussed him noisily on one wet cheek its his tummy again cyn i made him a hot water bottle its in the kitchen mind you wrap it in a towel before you give it him thanks mum youre a queen cyn said her son on her hip she disappeared down the corridor towards the back of the house whats this about then sal looked from nkata to barbara not moving from her position by the door she hadnt invited them to step inside it was clear that she didnt intend to do so its gone ten i expect you know that barbara said may we come in mrs cole she said sally cole sal she stepped back from the door and scrutinised them as they crossed the threshold she folded her arms beneath her breasts in the better light of the entryway barbara saw that her haircut bluntly just below her earswas streaked on either side of her face with panels of whiteblonde these served to emphasise her irregular and incongruous features a broad forehead a hooked nose and a tiny rosebud mouth i cant cope with suspense so tell me what you got to tell me straightaway could we barbara nodded towards a door that opened to the left of the stairs beyond lay what appeared to be the sitting room although it was dominated by a large and curious arrangement of gardening tools that stood in its centre a rake with every other tine missing a hoe with its edge turned inwards and a blunted shovel all formed a teepee over a cultivator whose handle had been split in half barbara examined this curiosity and wondered if it had anything to do with sal coles manner of dress the green smock and the words embroidered on it did suggest a source of employment that leaned towards the floral if not the agricultural hes a sculptor my terry sal informed her corning to stand at barbaras side thats his medium gardening tools hes got a piece with secateurs that makes me want to cry both my kidsre artists cyns doing a course at the college of fashion is this about my terry s he in some sort f trouble tell me straightaway barbara glanced at nkata to see if he wanted to do the dubious honours he raised the fingers of one hand to his scarred cheek as if the cicatrix there had begun to throb she said terry isnt home then mrs cole he doesnt live here sal informed her she went on to say that he shared digs and a studio in battersea with a girl called cilia thompson a fellow artist somethings not happened to cilia has it youre not looking for terry because of cilia theyre only friends the two of them so if shes been roughed up again you best talk to that boyfriend of hers not to my terry terry wouldnt hurt a flea if it was biting him hes a good boy always has been is there a well is there a mr cole if they were about to suggest to this woman that her son was dead barbara wanted another presencea potentially stronger presenceto help absorb the blow sal gave a hoot mr coleas he wasdid a houdini on us when terry was five found hisself a little bit of fluff with a nice set of kitties down in folkestone and that was that for mr family man why her voice had begun to sound more anxious whats this all about then barbara nodded at nkata he after all had come to london to fetch the woman should it be necessary it was in his hands how to break the news that the unidentified body they had might well be her sons he began with the triumph sal cole confirmed that her son owned such a motorcycle and as she did so she also made the logical leap to a traffic accident she went on so quickly to ask what hospital hed been taken to that barbara found herself wishing that the news they bore was as simple as a crash on the motorway there was no easy way barbara saw that nkata had moved to a photographladen mantel that spanned a shallow embrasure where a fireplace once had been he lifted one of the plasticframed pictures and the expression on his face told barbara that carting mrs cole all the way to derbyshire was probably going to be a mere formality nkata had after all seen pictures of the corpse if not the corpse itself and while murder victims sometimes bore little resemblance to their living selves there were usually enough areas of commonality for the astute observer to make a tentative identification from a photograph seeing the picture appeared to give nkata the courage to tell the tale which he did with a simplicity and sympathy that impressed barbara more than she would have thought possible there had been a double homicide in derbyshire nkata informed mrs cole a young man and a woman were the victims terrys motorcycle had been found nearby and the young man in question bore something of a resemblance to this photograph from the mantel it could be coincidental of course that terrys motorcycle would be found near the scene of a murder but nonetheless the police needed someone to accompany them to derbyshire in an attempt to identify the body mrs cole could be that someone or if she believed it would be too traumatic then someone elseperhaps terrys sister it was up to mrs cole nkata gently replaced the photograph sal watched him looking stunned she said derbyshire no i dont think so my terrys working on a project in london a bigmoney project a commission taking up all his time its why he couldnt be here last sunday for lunch like he usually is he dotes on our little darryl he does he wouldnt miss his sunday afternoon with darryl but the commission terry couldnt come because of the commission thats what he said her daughter joined them then having donned a blue track suit and slicked back her hair she paused in the doorway and appeared to take a reading of the room she went hastily to sals side saying mum whats wrong youve gone dead white sit down or youll faint wheres our baby wheres our little darryl hes settled that hot water bottle did the trick come on mum sit down before you fall over you wrapped it in a towel like i said hes fine cyn turned to barbara and nkata whats happened nkata explained briefly the second time through seemed to deplete not his resources but those of mrs cole when he reached the body another time she grasped the handle of the hoe in the odd teepee sculpture said it was to be three times this size his commission was he told me so and made her way to a threadbare overstuffed chair a small childs toys encircled this and she reached for one of them a bright yellow bird that she held to her chest derbyshire cyn sounded incredulous what the hells our terry doing in derbyshire mum he probably borrowed the motorcycle to someone cilia would know lets phone her she strode to do so punching in the numbers on a phone that stood on a squat table at the foot of the stairs her end of the conversation was simple enough is that cilia thompson this is cyn cole terrys sister yeah oh right proper little monster he is got us all running round for him whenever he blinks listen cilia s terry about oh dyou know wheres he gone off to then a sombre glance over her shoulder at her mother as cilia answered cyn said right then no no message but if he turns up in the next hour or so have him phone me at home okay and then she rang off sal and cyn communicated wordlessly in the way of women long used to each others company sal said quietly hes set on that commission heart and soul he said thisll bring destination art into being just you watch mum so i dont see why he wouldve left destination art barbara asked his gallery thats what he wants to call it destination art cyn clarified hes always wanted a gallery for moderns it was to beis to beon the south bank near the hayward its his dream mum this could be nothing you hold on to that it could be nothing but the tone of her voice sounded as if shed have loved nothing more dearly than to convince herself well need the address barbara told her there isnt any gallery yet cyn replied for terrys digs nkata clarified and the studio he shares but you just said sal didnt finish her remark a silence fell among them the source of it was obvious to them all what could have been nothing was probably something the worst sort of something that a family like the coles might ever have to face cyn went in search of the exact addresses as she did so nkata said to terry coles mother ill fetch you first thing in the morning mrs cole but if terry should ring you sometime tonight you page me right dont mind the time just page me he wrote out his pager number on a sheet of paper that he removed from his neatly kept notebook he was ripping it out and handing it over to sal cole when terrys sister returned with her brothers information she gave it to barbara two locations were listed next to the words flat and studio both barbara saw were in battersea she committed the addresses to memoryjust in case she told herselfand she gave the paper to nkata he nodded his thanks folded it and shoved it into his pocket a time was agreed upon for the mornings departure and the two police constables found themselves out in the night a mild wind gusted on the street blowing a plastic carrier bag and a large burger king cup down the pavement nkata disarmed the security system on the car but he didnt open the door instead he looked at barbara over the roof then beyond her to the dismallooking council housing on the other side of the street his face was a study in sadness what barbara asked him i killed their sleep he said i shouldve waited till morning why didnt i think that no way could we have driven back there tonight im too shagged out so whyd i rush over here like there was a fire i had to put out they got that baby to see to and i just killed their sleep you didnt have a choice barbara said if youd waited till morning theyd probably bothve been goneto work and to schooland youdve lost a day dont drive yourself round the bend on it winston you did what you had to do its him he said the bloke in the picture hes the one got the chop i reckoned as much they dont want to believe it who would barbara said its the final goodbye without a chance to say it and there cant be anything more rotten than that lynley chose tideswell a limestone village climbing two opposing hillsides tideswell sat virtually at the midway point between buxton and padley gorge housing himself in the black angel hotelwith its pleasing view of the parish church and its surrounding greenwould provide him during the investigation with easy access both to the police station and to maiden hall and to calder moor if it came to that inspector hanken was agreeable to the idea of tideswell he would send a car round for lynley in the morning he said pending the return of lynleys own officer from london hanken had thawed considerably in the hours theyd spent in each others company in the bar of the black angel hotel he and lynley had enjoyed one bushmill apiece prior to dinner a bottle of wine with the meal and a brandy afterwards which also gave some assistance in the matter the whiskey and wine had elicited from hanken the sort of professional war stories that were common to most interactions between policemen rows with superiors cockups in investigations rough cases hed been lumbered with the brandy had provoked more personal revelations the inspector from buxton pulled out the family photograph hed shown lynley earlier and gazed upon it long before he spoke his index finger tracing the bundled shape of his infant son he said the word children and went on to explain that a man was changed for all time the moment a newborn was placed into his arms one wouldnt expect that to be the casethat sort of alteration in persona was womens stuff wasnt itbut thats what happened and what resulted from that change was an overwhelming desire to protect to batten down every hatch in sight and to secure every route of access into the heart of the home so to lose a child despite every precaution it was a hell beyond his imagining something andy maiden is currently experiencing lynley noted hanken eyed him but didnt argue the point he went on to confide that his kathleen was the light of his life hed known from the day theyd met that he wanted to marry her but it had taken five years to persuade her to agree what about lynley and his new bride how had it been for them but marriage wife and children were the last subjects lynley wanted to entertain he sidestepped adroitly by claiming inexperience im too wet behind the ears as a husband to have anything remarkable to report he said he found that he couldnt avoid the subject when he was alone with his thoughts later that night in his room still in an attempt to divert themor at least to postpone themhe went to the window he notched open the casement an inch and tried to ignore the strong scent of mildew that seemed to permeate the environment he was as successful at this however as he was at overlooking the bed with its concave mattress and its pink duvet covered with a slick pseudosatin material that promised a night of wrestling to keep it on the bed hed at least been equipped with an electric kettle he observed gloomily with a wicker basket of pg tips seven plastic thimbles of milk one packet of sugar and two pieces of shortbread and he had a bathroom as well although it had no window and it was fitted out with a waterstained bath encased in linoleum and was lit by a single light bulb of candlestrength wattage it could have been worse he told himself but he wasnt sure how when he could no longer avoid doing so he glanced at the telephone on the ironlegged outdoor table that did service next to the bed he owed helen a call at least to give her his whereabouts but he was reluctant to punch in the numbers he considered the reason certainly helen was more in the wrong than he he may have lost his temper with her but shed crossed a line when shed taken the part of barbara havers advocate as his wife she was supposed to be his advocate she might have asked why hed chosen winston nkata to work with and not barbara havers instead of attempting to argue him into altering a decision that he had felt compelled to take of course upon reflection he recalled that helens conversational opening had indeed been to ask him why hed selected nkata it was his series of responses that had led them from a reasonable discussion into a row yet hed responded as he had done because shed provoked in him a sense of maritalif not moraloutrage her questions implied an alliance with someone whose actions couldnt begin to be justified that he was being asked to justify his own actionswhich were reasonable allowable and completely understandablewas more than mildly annoying policing worked because of its officers adherence to an established chain of command senior officers gained their positions by proving themselves capable of performance under pressure with a life at stake and a suspect fleeing barbara havers superior officer had made a splitsecond decision giving orders that were as pellucid as they were reasonable that havers had contravened those orders was bad enough that shed taken matters into her own hands was very much worse but that shed wrested power to herself by using a firearm was q violation of their entire oath of office it wasnt a simple bending of rules it was a mockery of everything they stood for why hadnt helen understood all this these things arent black and white tommy malcolm webberlys comment came back to him as if in answer to his mental question but lynley had to disagree with his superintendent it seemed to him that some things were still he couldnt work his way round the fact that he owed his wife a telephone call they didnt need to pursue their argument and he could at least offer an apology for losing his temper instead of helen however he found himself talking to charlie denton the young frustrated thespian who played the role of manservant in lynleys life when he wasnt haunting the halfprice ticket booth in leicester square the countess wasnt at home denton informed him and lynley could tell how much the maddening man enjoyed giving helen the title shed phoned round seven oclock from mr st jamess house denton went on and said shed been asked to stay to dinner she hadnt yet returned did his lordship wishlynley cut him off wearily denton he warned sorry the younger man chuckled and dropped the mock servility dyou want to leave her a message then ill catch her in chelsea lynley replied but he gave the black angels number to denton all the same when he phoned the st james house however he discovered that helen and st jamess wife had gone out straight after dinner he was left talking to his old friend they mentioned a film st james told him vaguely i got the impression it was something romantic helen said she could do with an evening looking at americans rolling round on a mattress with sculpted bodies fashionable hair and perfect teeth thats the americans not the mattress by the way i see lynley gave his friend the number of the hotel with a message for helen to phone if she returned at a reasonable hour they hadnt had a proper chance to speak before hed taken off for derbyshire he told st james even to his own ears it sounded a lame explanation st james said that hed pass the message to helen how was lynley finding derbyshire he wanted to know it was a tacit invitation to discuss the case st james would never enquire directly he had too much respect for the unwritten rules that governed a police investigation lynley found himself wanting to talk to his old friend he reviewed the facts the two deaths the differing means by which theyd come about the absence of one of the weapons the lack of identification on the boy the anonymous letters assembled from cutouts the scrawled suggestion that this bitch has had it it puts a signature on the crime lynley concluded although hanken thinks the note could be part of a blind misdirection on the part of the killer who andy maiden if you go along with hankens thinking the father thats a bit rough why is hanken heading that way he wasnt at first lynley described their interview with the dead girls parents what had been said and what had been inadvertently revealed he ended with so andy believes theres an so connection what do you think like everything else it needs checking out but hanken didnt trust a word andy said once we learned that hed been keeping information from his wife he could merely have been trying to protect her st james offered not an unreasonable thing for a man to do for a woman he loves and if they were really looking for a blind wouldnt they misdirect you into considering the boy lynley agreed theres a real bond between the two of them simon it appears to be an extraordinarily close relationship st james was silent for a moment on the other end of the line outside lynley s hotel room someone walked down the corridor a door shut quietly then theres another way to look at andy maiden protecting his wife isnt there tommy st james finally said whats that then he may be doing it for another reason the worst possible reason in fact medea in derbyshire lynley asked christ thats horrific simon and when mothers kill the childs generally young ill be pressed for a motive if things go that way medea would have argued that she had one in the midst of dealing with one of nicolas many disappearances prior to the familys move to derbyshire nan maiden would have been incredulous had anyone suggested to her that there would come a day when she would yearn for something as simple as a teenagers running away from home in a fit of temper when nicola had disappeared in the past her mother had reacted the only way she knew with a mixture of terror anger and despair shed phoned the girls friends shed alerted the police and shed taken to the streets to trackher down shed been capable of nothing else until shed known her child was safe that nicola would vanish into the streets of london always intensified nans worry for anything could happen on the streets of london a teenaged girl could be raped she could be seduced into the netherworld of narcotics she could be beaten she could be maimed there was one prospective consequence of nicolas running off that nan never considered however that her daughter had been murdered the thought simply didnt bear dwelling upon not because murder never happened to young girls but because if it happened to this particular young girl her mother had no idea how she herself would go on and now it had happened not during those tempestuous teenage years when nicola was insisting on autonomy independence and what shed called the right to selfdetermination mum were not living in the middle ages you know not during that torturous period when making a demand of her parentswhether it was for something simple and concrete like a new cd or something complex and nebulous like personal freedomwas no less than an unspoken threat to vanish for a day or a week or a month if that demand wasnt met but now when she was an adult when locking her door and nailing closed her window were actions that were supposed to be not only unthinkable but also unnecessary yet thats exactly what i should have done nan thought brokenly i should have locked her in tied her to her bed and refused to let her out of my sight i know what i want nicola had declared so many times throughout the years and this is it nan had heard that in the voice of the sevenyearold who wanted barbie barbies house barbies car and every item of clothing that could be slid onto the impossibly shaped plastic figure that was supposed to be the epitome of femininity in the cry of the twelveyearold who could not exist another moment unless she was allowed to wear makeup stockings and fourinchhigh heels in the black moods of the fifteenyearold who wanted a separate telephone line a pair of inline skates a holiday in spain without the burden of her parents along nicola had always wanted what nicola wanted at the moment when nicola wanted it and many times over the years it had seemed so much easier just to give in than to face a day a week or a fortnight of her disappearance but now nan wished with all her heart that her daughter had simply chosen to run off again and she felt the hundredweight of guilt dragging down on her for the occasions during nicolas adolescence when faced with yet another of her daughter s petulant flights from home shed even for an instant harboured the notion that it would be better to have had nicola die at birth than not to know where she was or if shed ever be found at all in the laundry room of the old hunting lodge nan maiden clutched one of her daughters cotton shirts to her chest as if the shirt could metamorphose into nicola herself without a thought that she was doing so she raised the collar of that shirt to her nose and breathed in the scent that was her child the mixture of gardenias and pears from the lotions and shampoo that nicola had used the acrid odour of her perspiration nan discovered that she could visualise nicola on the last occasion when shed worn the shirt on a recent bike ride with christianlouis once the sunday afternoon lunches had all been served the french chef had always found nicola attractivewhat man hadntand nicola had observed the interest in his eyes and had not ignored it that was her talent pulling men without effort she didnt do it to prove anything to herself or to anyone else she simply did it as if she gave off a peculiar emanation that was transmitted solely to males in nicolas childhood nan had fretted over her sexual powers and what price they might exact from the girl in nicolas adulthood nan saw that the price had finally been paid the purpose of parenthood is to bring up children who stand on their own as autonomous adults not as clones nicola had said im responsible for my destiny mum my life has nothing to do with you why did children say such things nan wondered how could they believe that the choices they made and the end they faced touched no lives other than their own the way that events had unfolded for nicola had everything to do with her mother simply because she was her mother for one did not give birth and then spare no thought to the future of ones treasured child and now she was dead sweet jesus god there would never be another crashbang entrance of nicola coming home for a holiday of nicola returning from a hike on the moors of nicola slugging her way inside the lodge with carrier bags of groceries dangling from her arms of nicola back from a date with julian all laughter and chatter about what theyd done sweet jesus god nan maiden thought her lovely tempestuous incorrigible child was truly gone the pain of that knowledge was an iron band growing tight round nans heart she didnt think shed be able to endure it so she did what she had usually done when the feelings were too much to be borne she continued to work she forced herself to lower the cotton shirt from her face and went back to what she had been doing removing from the laundry all of her daughters unwashed clothing as if by keeping the scent of her alive she could also forestall the inevitable acceptance of nicolas death she mated socks she folded jeans and jerseys she smoothed out creases in every shirt and she rolled up knickers and matched them to bras finally she slid the clothing into plastic carrier bags from the kitchen then she methodically taped these bags closed sealing in the odour of her child she gathered the bags to her and left the room upstairs andy was pacing nan could hear his footsteps above her as she moved noiselessly down the corridor past the guest rooms he was in his cubbyhole of a den walking from the tiny dormer window to the electric fire backwards and forwards over and over again hed retreated there upon the departure of the police announcing that he would start looking through his diaries immediately in an attempt to find the name of someone with a score to settle against him but unless he was reading those diaries as he paced in the intervening hours hed not begun the search nan knew why the search was useless she wouldnt think of it nan told herself not here not now and possibly not ever nor would she think what it meantor didnt meanthat julian britton claimed to be engaged to her daughter nan paused at the staircase that led to the private upper floor of the house where the familys quarters were her hands felt slick on the carrier bags which she held to her chest her heart seemed to pound in tandem with her husbands tread go to bed she told him silently please andy turn out the lights he needed sleep and the fact that he was starting to go numb again told her just how badly he needed it the advent of a detective from scotland yard hadnt resulted in a mitigation of andys anxiety the departure of that same detective had only increased it the numbness in his hands had begun to travel up his arms a prick of a pin brought no blood to the surface of his skin as if his whole body were shutting down hed managed to hold himself together while the police were present but once theyd left hed fallen apart that was when hed said he wanted to start going through the diaries if he withdrew from his wife into his den he could hide the worst of what he was experiencing or so he thought but a husband and wife should be able to help each other through something like this nan argued in the stillness whats happening to us that were facing it alone she had tried to replace conversation with concern earlier in the evening but andy had sloughed off her solicitous hovering consistently refusing her offers of heating pads brandy cups of tea and hot soup hed also avoided her attempts to massage some feeling back into his fingers so ultimately everything that might have been spoken between them went unsaid what to say now nan wondered what to say when dread was among the emotions raging inside like innumerable battalions from a single army out of control and combating one another she forced herself to mount the stairs but instead of going to her husband she went to nicolas bedroom there she moved across the green carpet in the darkness and opened the clothes cupboard that was tucked under the eaves eyes used to the gloom she could make out the shape of an old skateboard pushed to the back of a shelf of an electric guitar leaning long unused against the far wall where it was draped by trousers touching these with the tips of her fingers saying idiotically tweed wool cotton silk as she felt the material of each nan became aware of a sound in the room a buzzing that came from the chest of drawers behind her as she turned puzzled the sound stopped she had almost convinced herself that shed imagined it when it occurred again curious nan set her packages on the bed and crossed the room to the chest there was nothing on top of it to make such a noise just a vase of drooping bladder campion and nightshade collected on a walk through padley gorge these wildflowers were accompanied by a hair brush and comb three bottles of scent and a small beanbag flamingo with bright pink legs and large yellow feet with a glance towards the open bedroom door as if she were engaged in a surreptitious search nan slid open the top drawer of the chest as she did so the buzzing sounded for a third time her fingers moved in the direction of the noise she found a small plastic square vibrating beneath a stack of knickers nan carried this plastic square to the bed sat and switched on the bedside lamp she examined what shed taken from the drawer it was nicolas pager on the top of it were two small buttons one grey and one black across the end of it a thin screen held a single brief message one page the buzzer sounded again startling nan maiden she pushed down one of the two buttons in response the thin screen shifted to another message this a telephone number with an area code that nan recognised from central london she swallowed she stared hard at the number she realised that whoever had paged her daughter had no idea that nicola was dead it was this thought that took her automatically to the telephone in order to make a reply but it was another set of thoughts that took her to a telephone in the reception area of maiden hall when she could have as easily phoned the london number from the bedroom that she shared with andy she drew a long breath she wondered if she would have the words she considered the possibility that having the words would make no difference to anyone but she didnt want to think about that she just wanted to phone rapidly she punched in the numbers she waited and waited for the connection to be made till she became lightheaded and realised that she was holding her breath finally with a click a phone somewhere in london began sounding doublering doublering nan counted eight of them she had started to think shed misdialled the number when she finally heard a mans gruff voice he answered in the old way marking his generation he gave the last four digits of his number and because of that fact and because his way of answering reminded her so much of her own father nan heard herself saying what she would not have believed herself capable of saying an hour earlier a whisper only nicola here oh so its nicola tonight is it he demanded where the hellve you been i paged you over an hour ago sorry and in her daughters abbreviated style of talking whats up nothing and you damn well know it whatve you decided have you changed your mind you can do that you know all will be forgiven whenre you back yes nan whispered ive decided yes thank god it was fervent oh jesus thank god damn its become impossible nikki im missing you too much tell me at once when youre coming back soon the whisper how soon tell me ill phone you no good god are you mad margaret and molly are here this week wait for the page she hesitated of course darling have i made you angry she said nothing i have done havent i forgive me i didnt mean to she said nothing then the voice altered becoming suddenly and bizarrely childlike oh nikki pretty nikki of mine say youre not angry say something to me darling she said nothing i know what youre like when ive made you angry im a wicked boy arent i she said nothing yes i know i dont deserve you im wicked and i must take the medicine youve got my medicine havent you nikki and i must take it yes i must nans stomach heaved she cried out who are you tell me your name a muted gasp was the answer the line went dead chapter at the end of her third hour at the computer barbara havers knew she had two alternatives she could continue with the so files in cris and possibly end up blind or she could take a break she chose the latter option she flipped her notebook closed made an exit from the search shed been conducting and enquired where the nearest office was in which she could indulge her habit with new scotland yard giving itself ever more over into the eager embrace of ash she was told that everyone on this particular floor was abstemious bloody hell she muttered there was nothing for it but to backslide into behaviour from her schooldays she slouched towards the nearest stairwell and plunked her squat body onto the stairs where she lit up inhaled and held the wonderful noxious fumes within her lungs for so long that her eyeballs felt ready to pop from their sockets pure bliss she thought life didnt get much better than a fag after three hours away from the weed the morning had gained her nothing of scintillating substance on cris shed discovered that detective inspector andrew maiden had served with the force for thirty years and hed spent the last twenty with so where only inspector javert could have had a more resplendent career his record of arrests was transcendent the convictions that followed those arrests were themselves a marvel of british jurisprudence but those two facts created a nightmare for anyone looking into his history undercover maidens convicts had gone through the system and ended up being detained at her majestys pleasure in virtually every one of her majestys prisons within the uk and while the files gave details of undercover operationsmost of them having been named by someone with a distinct taste for loony acronyms she foundand complete reports into investigations interrogations arrests and charges the information became sketchy when it came to prison terms and sketchier still in the area of parole if a ticketofleave man was on the streets and after the bloke who caused the silver bracelets to be slapped on him in the first place he wasnt going to be easy to find barbara sighed yawned and tapped her cigarette against the sole of her shoe dislodging ash onto the step beneath her shed abjured her trademark hightop red trainers in deference to her new positionall spit and polish for ac hillier should he happen past eager to give her another wiggingand she found that her feet had begun to throb so unaccustomed had they become to formal footwear indeed sitting on the step in the stairwell she became aware of entire areas of her body that were screaming discomfort and had doubtless been doing so for most of the morning her skirt felt as if an anaconda had taken position round her hips her jacket appeared to be chewing large bites from her underarms and her tights had dug so far into her crotch that an episiotomy was going to be unnecessary should she ever be in the position to give birth shed never been one for high fashion during her working hours choosing drawstring trousers tshirts and jerseys over anything that might be construed as remotely related to haute couture and used to seeing her more casually arrayed more than one person this day had encountered barbara with a raised eyebrow or a stifled grin among this lot had been her near neighbours whom barbara had encountered not twentyfive yards from her own front door taymullah azhar and his daughter had been loading themselves into azhars spotless fiat when barbara trundled round the corner of the house that morning fighting her notebook into her shoulder bag a halfsmoked fag dangling from her lips she hadnt been aware of them at first not till hadiyyah called out happily barbara hullo hullo good morning you shouldnt smoke so awfully much itll make your lungs all black and nasty if you dont stop we learned that in school we saw pictures and everything did i tell you that already you look quite nice half in and half out of the car azhar extricated himself and nodded at barbara politely his gaze travelled from her head to her toes good morning he said youre off early as well the bird the worm and all that rubbish barbara replied heartily did you reach your friend he enquired last night my friend oh you mean nkata winston right i mean winston nkata thats his name she winced inwardly wondering if she always sounded so lame hes a colleague from the yard yeah we got in touch im back in the game its afoot or whatever i mean im on a case you arent working with inspector lynley youve a new partner barbara the dark eyes probed oh no she said partial truth partial lie were all working the same case winstons just part of it like me you know the inspectors handling one arm out of town the rest of usre here he said reflectively yes i see too much she thought i only ate half my toffee apple last night hadiyyah informed her a blessed diversion shed begun to swing on the open door of the fiat hanging from the lowered window with her legs dangling and her feet kicking energetically to keep up the momentum she was wearing socks as white as angels wings we cn eat it for tea if you like barbara thatd be nice i have my sewing lesson tomorrow did you know im making something awfully special but i cant say what it is right now because she cast a meaningful look at her father but you can see it barbara tomorrow if you like do you want to see it ill show it to you if you say you want to see it that sounds just the ticket but only if you can keep a secret can you mums the absolute word barbara vowed during this exchange azhar had been regarding her his professional field was microbiology and barbara was beginning to feel like one of his specimens so intense was his scrutiny despite their conversation of the previous night and the conclusion hed reached upon seeing her manner of dress hed witnessed her setting off in her normal work togs long enough to know that the alteration in her getup had a significance beyond a womans fancying a fashion makeover he said how content you must be on a case again after the weeks of idleness its always gratifying to engage ones mind isnt it its definitely the cats jimjams barbara dropped her cigarette to the ground and crushed it out kicking the dog end into the flower bed biodegradable she said to hadiyyah who was obviously about to reprimand her aerates the soil feeds the worms she settled the strap of her bag more comfortably on her shoulder well im off keep that toffee apple fresh for me okay maybe we can watch a video as well no damsels in distress though lets do the avengers mrs peels my idol i like a woman who can show off her legs and kick gentlemens bottoms simultaneously hadiyyah giggled barbara nodded her goodbye she was on the pavement making her escape when azhar spoke again is scotland yard undergoing a reduction in force barbara she stopped puzzled and answered without thinking of the intent behind the question good grief no what made you ask that autumn perhaps he said and the changes it brings ah she sidestepped the implication behind the word changes she avoided his eyes she took the statement at its most superficial and dealt with it accordingly the bad guys want nabbing no matter the season you know the wicked they never rest she smiled brightly and went on her way as long as he never confronted her directly with the word constable she knew that she wouldnt have to explain to him how it had come to be attached to her name she wanted to avoid that explanation as long as possible forever if she could because explaining to azhar ran the risk of wounding him and for reasons she didnt care to speculate upon wounding azhar was unthinkable to her now in the stairwell of new scotland yard barbara strove to put the thought of her neighbours out of her mind thats all they were at the end of the day anyway a man and a child whom she had come to know by chance she glanced at her watch it was half past ten she groaned the thought of six or eight more hours staring at a computer screen was less than exciting there had to be a more economical way to delve into di maidens professional history she tossed round several possibilities and decided to try the most likely one in her perusal of the files shed come across the same name time and again dci dennis hextell with whom maiden had worked in partnership as an undercover cop if she could locate hextell she thought he might be able to put her onto a lead that was stronger than something she would have to interpret from reading twenty years of files that was the ticket she decided hextell she shoved herself off the stairs and went in search of him it turned out to be easier than she had anticipated a phone call to so gained her the information that dci hextell was still in the department although now as detective chief superintendent he directed operations instead of taking part in them on the street barbara found him at a small table in the cafeteria on the fourth floor she introduced herself asking if she could join him the dcs looked up from a set of photographs his face barbara saw wasnt so much lined as it was gouged and gravity had taken its toll on his muscles the years certainly hadnt been good to him the chief superintendent gathered his photographs together and didnt answer barbara said helpfully im working on the maiden killing in derbyshire sir andy maidens daughter you were a team with him right that got a response sit she could live with monosyllables barbara did his bidding shed fetched herself a coke and a chocolate donut from the cafeteria and she set these down on the table in front of her rot your teeth that hextell noted with a nod im a victim of my addictions he grunted that your plane barbara asked with a nod at the picture on the top of his stack it featured a yellow biplane of the sort that had been flown in world war i when aviators wore leather helmets and flowing white scarves one of them he said the one i use for aerobatics stunt pilot are you i fly oh right must be nice barbara wondered if the years undercover had made the man so loquacious she launched into the purpose behind tracking him down was there any case any stakeout any operation that leapt to mind as being particularly important in the history of his association with andy maiden were looking at revenge as a possible motive for the girls murder someone that you and di maiden put away someone wanting to settle the score maidens trying to come up with a name on his own in derbyshire and ive been scrolling through the reports all morning on the computer but nothings ringing my chimes hextell began separating his pictures he appeared to have a system for doing so but barbara couldnt tell what it was since each shot was of exactly the same plane just of varying angles the fuselage here the struts there the wing tip the engine and the tail when the piles were arranged to his liking he took a magnifying glass from his jacket pocket and began studying each photograph under it could be anyone we were rubbing elbows with first class rot pushers addicts pimps gun runners you name it any one of them would have walked the length of the country to rub us out but no ones name comes to mind ive survived by putting their names behind me andy was the one who couldnt survive forget hextell separated one picture from the rest it documented the plane headon its body truncated by the angle he applied his magnifying glass to every inch of it squinting like a jeweller with a diamond in question is that why he left he was out of here on early retirement ive heard hextell looked up whos being investigated here barbara hastened to reassure him im just trying to get a feeling for the man if theres something you can tell me thatll help she made a thatwouldbegreat gesture and gave her enthusiasm to her chocolate donut the dcs set down his magnifying glass and folded his hands over it he said andy went out on a medical he was losing his nerves he had a nervous breakdown hextell blew out a derisive breath not stress woman nerves real nerves sense of smell went first taste went next then touch he coped well enough but then it was his vision and that was the end of him he had to get out bloody hell he went blind would have done no doubt but once he retired it all came back feeling vision the lot so whatd been wrong with him hextell looked at her long and hard before answering then he raised his index and middle fingers and tapped them lightly against his skull couldnt cope with the game undercover takes it out of you i lost four wives he lost nerves some things cant be replaced he didnt have wife problems like i said it was the game some blokes keep their peckers up fine when theyre pretending to be someone theyre not but for andy thats not how it was the lies he had to tell out there keeping mum about a case till it was long over it knocked the stuffing out of him so there was no one caseone big case perhapsthat cost him more than the others dont know hextell concluded like i said i put it behind me if there was one case i couldnt name it with that sort of memory hextell would have been a pearl of low price to the crown prosecutors in his salad days but something told barbara that the dcs didnt care whether the prosecutors found him useful or not she packed the rest of her donut into her mouth and washed it down with coke thanks for your time she told him and added in a gesture of friendliness looks like fun with a nod at the biplane hextell picked up the propeller picture held it top to bottom with the edges of his thumb and index finger so as not to smudge it just another way to die he said bloody hell barbara thought what people do to put the job out of mind no closer to the name she was looking for but wiser to the potential pitfalls promised by a lengthy career in police work she returned to the computer shed just begun revisiting andrew maidens history when a phone call interrupted her its cole winston nkatas voice came over a line that was thick with static mum took one look at the body said right thats my terry walked out f the room like she was going for groceries and just hit the floor flat on her face we thought shed had heart failure but shed just checked out she had to be sedated once she came to shes taking it hard rough go barbara said she doted on the bloke makes me think of my mum right well barbara couldnt help thinking of her own mother doting certainly wouldnt be the word to describe her maternal deportment sorry and all that are you bringing her back be there by midafternoon i expect we stopped for coffee shes in the loo ah barbara wondered why he was phoning perhaps to serve as intermediary between herself and lynley passing along information so that the inspector would have as little contact with her as he apparently deemed necessary at the moment she said i havent got anything on maidens arrests yet at least not anything that looks useful she told him what dcs hextell had confided about maidens nervous complaints adding whatever the inspector wants to make of that ill give him the information nkata told her if you cn break off theres battersea to look at itd save us some time battersea terry coles digs his studio as well one of us needs to get over there talk to his roommate this cilia thompson you recall yeah but i thought what had she thought obviously that nkata would keep as much to himself as he could leaving the grunt work to her the other dc continued to nonplus her with his easy generosity i can break off barbara said i remember the address she heard nkata chuckle now whym i not surprised at that lynley and hanken had spent the first part of the morning waiting for winston nkata to deliver terry coles mother to them for the purpose of identifying the second body found on the moor neither man had much doubt that the procedure would be a mere formalitydevastating and anguished but still a formality when no one had come off the moor by dawn to claim the motorcycle and no one else had reported it stolen it seemed fairly conclusive that the mutilated male and the owner of the motorcycle were one and the same nkata reached them by ten and the answer was theirs by quarter past the hour mrs cole verified that the boy was indeed her son terry after which she collapsed a doctor was summoned sedative in hand he took over where the police left off i want his effects sal cole had sobbed by which they understood that she meant her sons clothes i want his effects for our darryl i mean to have them and she would do they told her once forensics had completed their analysis once the jeans and tshirt and doc martens and socks were no longer deemed necessary for a successful prosecution of whoever had committed the crime until that time they would give her receipts for each garment that the boy had been wearing for his motorcycle as well they didnt tell her that it could easily be years before the ensanguined clothing was released to her and for her part she didnt ask when she might expect it she just clutched the envelope of receipts and wiped at her eyes with the back of her wrist winston nkata escorted her from the nightmare into the extended nightmare to come lynley and hanken withdrew to the dis office in silence prior to nkatas arrival hanken had spent the time reviewing his notes on the case thus far and hed had another look at the initial report compiled by the constable whod first talked to the maidens about their daughters disappearance she had several phone calls on the morning of her hike he told lynley two from a woman one from a man neither giving their names to nan maiden before she fetched nicola to take the calls could the man have been terence cole lynley asked it was more grist for the mill of their suspicions hanken concluded he went to his desk at its precise centre someone had placed a sheaf of papers while theyd been with mrs cole it was hanken told lynley upon taking them up a document relating to the case owing largely to the services of an excellent transcriptionist dr sue myles had managed to be as good as her word they had the postmortem report in hand dr myles had been as thorough as shed been unconventional they discovered her findings upon external examination of the bodies alone took up nearly ten pages in addition to a detailed description of every wound contusion abrasion and bruise on both corpses dr myles had recorded each minute particular associated with a death on the moor thus everything from the heather caught up in the hair of nicola maiden to a thorn pricking one of terry coles ankles was assiduously noted the detectives were made aware of infinitesimal fragments of stone embedded in flesh evidence of bird droppings on skin unidentified slivers of wood in wounds and the postmortem damage done to the bodies by insects and birds what the detectives didnt have at the end of their reading however was what they hadnt had at the beginning of it a clear idea of the number of killers they were seeking but they did have one intriguing detail aside from her eyebrows and the hair on her head nicola maiden had been completely shaven not born hairless but deliberately shaven it was that interesting fact that suggested their next move in the investigation perhaps it was time lynley said to talk to julian britton the griefstricken fiancé of their primary victim they set off to do so the britton home broughton manor sat midway up a limestone outcrop just two miles southeast of the town of bakewell facing due west it overlooked the river wye which at this location in the dale cut a placid curve through an oakstudded meadow where a flock of sheep grazed from a distance the building looked not like a manor house that had doubtless once been the centre of a thriving estate but instead an impressive fortification erected from limestone that had long ago gone grey from the lichen that thrived upon it the house consisted of towers battlements and walls that rose twelve feet before giving way to the first of a series of narrow windows the manors entire appearance suggested longevity and strength combined with the willingness and the ability to survive everything from the vicissitudes of weather to the whimsies of the family who owned it closer however broughton manor told a different tale glass was missing from some of its diamondpaned windows part of its ancient oak roof appeared to have caved in a forest of greeneryeverything from ivy to old mans beardseemed to be pressing against the remaining windows of the southwest wing and the low walls that marked a series of gardens falling towards the river were crumbling and gapridden giving wandering sheep access to what had probably once been a descending array of colourful parterres used to be the showplace of the county di hanken said to lynley as they swung across the stone bridge that spanned the river and gave onto the sloping drive up to the house chatsworth aside of course im not talking about palaces but once jeremy britton got his maulers on it he ran it straight to hell in less than ten years the older boythats our julianhas been trying to bring the place back to life he wants to make it pay for itself as a farm or a hotel or a conference centre or a park he even lets it out for fetes and tournaments which probably has his ancestors spinning in their graves but hes got to stay one step ahead of his dad wholl drink up the profits if hes got the chance julians in need of funds putting it mildly and there are other children lynley asked julians the eldest hanken pulled past an enormous ironstudded front doorits dark oak dun with age indifferent care and bad weatherand drove them round to the back of the house where an arched gate big enough for a carriage to pass through had an additional humansize door cut into it this stood open beyond it a courtyard between whose paving stones weeds sprang like unexpected thoughts he switched off the ignition julians got a brother permanently at university and a sister married and living in new zealand hes the oldest childjulian isand why he doesnt go along the same path as the others and clear out is far beyond me his dads a real piece of work but youll see that for yourself if you meet him hanken shoved open his door and led the way towards the house behind them excited howling came from what seemed to be the stables which stood at the end of an overgrown gravel lane shooting north from a curve in the nearby drive someones with the harriers hanken told lynley over his shoulder probably julianhe breeds the dogsbut we may as well check inside first this way this way took them into a courtyard one of two hanken informed him according to the di the imperfect rectangle in which they stood was a relatively modern addition to the older four wings of the building which comprised the west facade of the house relatively modern in the history of broughton manor of course meant that the courtyard was just under three hundred years old and as such it was called the new court the old court was mostly fifteenth century with a fourteenthcentury central portion that constituted the shared boundary between the courts even a cursory inspection of the courtyard was enough to reveal the decay that julian britton was attempting to counteract but there were indications of occupancy intermingling with those of decrepitude a makeshift clothesline waving incongruous pink sheets had been rigged in one corner extending in a diagonal between two wings of the house and tied onto two paneless windows by means of their rusting iron casements plastic rubbish bags waited to be carted off alongside antique tools that probably hadnt been used for a century a shiny aluminium walking stick lay near an old discarded mantel clock past and present met in every corner of the courtyard as something new tried to rise from the detritus of the old hullo there can i help you it was a womans voice calling to them from above they looked towards the windows and she laughed and said no up here she was on the roof with a rubbish sack slung over her shoulder giving her the appearance of a decidedly unseasonal and even more outsized christmas elf in the middle of a delivery but she was a particularly dishevelled elf her bare arms and legs were streaked with grime gutters she said cheerfully in apparent reference to her current occupation if youll wait a moment ill be right down clouds of filth and decomposing leaves rose round her as she worked her head turned away to keep the worst of the mess from alighting on her face there thats that the young woman said when she reached the gutters end she yanked off a pair of gardening gloves and came across the roof to an extension ladder that rested against the building behind the line of pink sheets she climbed down agilely and came across the courtyard she introduced herself as samantha mccallin in an environment so conducive to historical reflections lynley saw the young woman as she would have likely been seen in the distant past extremely plain but hardy of peasant stock a perfect specimen for childbearing and labour on the land in modern terms she was tall and well built with the physique of a swimmer she wore nononsense clothes that were suited to her activity old cutoff blue jeans and boots were topped by a tshirt a bottle of water hung from her belt shed pinned her mousebrown hair to the top of her head in a coil and she loosed it as she observed them frankly it fell in a single thick plait to her waist im julians cousin and you i expect are the police and this visit i imagine is about nicola maiden am i right her expression told them that she generally was wed like a chat with julian hanken told her i hope youre not thinking he was involved in her death she unhooked the water bottle and took a slug of it thats impossible he adored nicola he played knight to her damsel and all that nonsense no distress was too much of a challenge for julie when nicola called he was into his armour before you could say ivanhoe metaphorically speaking naturally she offered them a smile it was her only mistake brittle it revealed the anxiety beneath her friendly demeanour where is he lynley asked gone to the dogs fitting isnt it for the environment were in come along ill show you the way her guidance wasnt necessary they could have followed the noise but the young womans determination to monitor their meeting with julian was an intriguing circumstance that a wise investigator would want to toy with and that she was determined to monitor that meeting was evidenced in the long sure stride she employed charging past them out of the courtyard they followed samantha up the overgrown lane the branches of unpruned limes overhung it offering an idea of what the leafy tunnelled path to the stables had once been like the stables themselves had been converted to kennels for the breeding of julian brittons harriers there were dogs in abundance in a number of curiously shaped runs and all of them broke into cacophonous barking as hanken and lynley approached with samantha mccallin quiten down you lot samantha shouted you cass why arent you with the pups in reply the dog spoken tostalking back and forth in a separate run from the otherstrotted back to the building and disappeared through a dogsize door that had been hewn into the limestone wall thats better samantha remarked and to the men she whelped a few nights ago shes protective of the pups juliell be with them i expect its just inside the kennels she told them as she swung open the door consisted of exterior and interior dog runs two birthing rooms and a dozen puppy pens in contrast to the manor house at the kennels the accent was on the clean and the modern outside the runs had been swept and the water dishes had sparkled inside the detectives found that the walls were whitewashed the lights were bright the stone floor was polished and music played brahms by the sound of it the thick walls of the building provided an insulation against the noise of the dogs outside because they also intensified the damp and the cold central heating had been installed lynley glanced at hanken as samantha led them towards a closed door it was clear that the other di was thinking the same thing the dogs were living better than the humans julian britton was in a room identified on its door as pup room one samantha knocked twice and called his name she said the police want a word can we come in a mans voice said quietly casss uneasy we saw her outside and to lynley and hanken act reassuring if you will towards the dog cass set up a ruckus when they entered the room she was in an lshaped run that gave on to the exterior run by means of the door through the wall at the far end of thiswell away from the drafta box contained her new litter of puppies four heat lamps shone over this section of the run the box itself was insulated sided with sheepskin and floored with a thick padding of newspaper julian britton stood inside the run he held a puppy in his left hand while he offered his right index finger to the tiny dogs mouth eyes still closed the animal sucked eagerly after a moment julian disengaged him returned him to the nest and made a note in a threering binder he said easy cass to calm the dog she remained wary though merely exchanging the bark for low growls all mothers should take such an interest in their brood it was impossible to tell to whom samantha was referring the dog or julian britton as cass settled herself in the nest of newspapers julian watched he said nothing until the pup hed been examining had found its place on one of the teats then he merely murmured to the dogs as the rest of the litter nosed into position to nurse lynley and hanken introduced themselves producing warrant cards julian looked these over which gave them time to look him over he was a goodsize man hefty without being overweight his face bore the sort of irregular freckles on the forehead that were indications of a life spent outofdoors as well as the precursors of skin cancer and an additional patch of freckles across his cheeks gave him the appearance of a gingerhaired bandit in combination with the unnatural pallor of his skin though the freckles enhanced a look of malaise after he had inspected the detectives identification to his satisfaction he removed a blue handkerchief from his trouser pocket and wiped his face with it although he didnt appear to be perspiring he said ill do anything i can to help you i was with andy and nan when they got the news i had a date with nicola that night when she didnt turn up at the hall we phoned the police julie went looking for her himself samantha added the police werent willing to do anything hanken didnt look pleased with this oblique criticism he cast a sour glance at the woman and asked if they could have their conversation somewhere where the bitch wouldnt be growling at them he was of course referring to the dog but samantha didnt miss the double entente she gave hanken a narrow glance and pressed her lips together julian obliged them by leading the way to the puppy runs in a separate section of the building here older pups were engaged in play the runs were cleverly devised to keep them challenged and entertained with cardboard boxes to tear apart complicated multilevel mazes to wander in toys to play with and hidden treats to search out the dog julian britton informed them was an intelligent animal expecting an intelligent animal to thrive in a concrete run devoid of distraction was not only stupid it was also cruel hed talk to the detectives while he worked he said he hoped that would be all right so much for the grieving fiancé lynley thought thatll be fine hanken said julian seemed to know what lynley was thinking he said works a balm at the moment i expect you understand need help julie samantha asked to her credit the offer was gently made thanks you can work with the biscuits if youd like sam im going to rearrange the maze he entered the run as samantha went to fetch the food the pups were delighted with this human intrusion into their domain they stopped playing and gravitated towards julian eager for another distraction he murmured to them patted their heads and tossed four balls and several rubber bones to the far end of the run as the dogs scampered after them he set to work on the maze which he disassembled through a series of slots in the wood weve been given to understand that you and nicola maiden were engaged to be married hanken said weve been told it was a recent engagement as well you have our sympathy lynley added it cant be something you particularly want to talk about but there might be something you can tell ussomething youre not even aware of yourself perhapsthat will help in the investigation julian gave his attention to the sides of the maze stacking them neatly as he answered i misled andy and nan it was easier at the moment than going into everything they kept asking if wed had a row everyone kept asking when she didnt turn up misled then you werent engaged to her julian cast a glance in the direction that samantha had taken to fetch the dogs food he said quietly no i asked she turned me down the feelings werent mutual hanken asked i suppose they werent if she didnt want to marry me samantha rejoined them lugging a large burlap sack behind her her pockets bulging with treats for the puppies she entered the run saying here julie let me help you with that when she saw that her cousin was wrestling with a part of the maze that didnt want to give way he said im coping dont be a goose im stronger than you are in samanthas capable hands the maze came apart julian stood by and looked uncomfortable exactly when did this proposal occur lynley asked him samanthas head turned swiftly towards her cousin just as swiftly it turned away she industriously began hiding dog biscuits throughout the run on monday night julian told them the night before she before nicola went out on the moor abruptly he went back to his work he spoke to the maze not to them saying i know how that looks im not such a fool that i dont know exactly how it looks i propose she turns me down then she dies so yes yes i know exactly how it bloody well looks but i didnt kill her head lowered he widened his eyes as if by doing so he could keep them from watering he said only i loved her for years i loved her samantha froze where she was at the far end of the run the puppies cavorting round her it seemed as if she wanted to go to her cousin but she didnt move did you know where shed be that night hanken asked the night she was killed i phoned her that morningthe morning she leftand we fixed up a date for wednesday night but she didnt tell me anything more not that shed be going out hiking not that she was going off at all she had other phone calls before shed left that day lynley told him a woman phoned possibly two women a man phoned as well no one gave nicolas mother a name have you any idea who might have wanted to speak with her none at all julian showed no reaction to the knowledge that one of her callers had been male it could have been anyone she was quite popular samantha said from her end of the run she was always surrounded by people up here so she must have had dozens of student friends as well i expect she got phone calls from them all the time when she was away from college college hanken asked nicola had just finished doing a conversion course at the college of law julian told them and he added in london when they asked him where shed studied she was up for the summer working for a bloke called will upman hes got a firm of solicitors in buxton her dad fixed it up for her because upmans something of a regular at the hall and because i expect he hoped shed work for upman in derbyshire when she finished her course that was important to her parents hanken asked it was important to everyone julian replied lynley wondered if everyone included julians cousin he glanced her way she was very busy hiding dog biscuits for the puppies to search out he asked the obvious next question how had julian parted from nicola that night of the marriage proposal in anger bitterness misunderstanding hope it was a hell of a thing lynley said to ask a woman to marry you and to be turned down it would be understandable if her refusal led to depression or an unexpected burst of passion samantha rose from her position at the far end of the run is that your clever way of asking if he killed her sam julian said it sounded like a warning i was down of course i felt blue who wouldnt was nicola involved with someone else is that why she refused you julian didnt reply lynley and hanken exchanged a glance samantha said ah i see where this is heading youre thinking that julie came home on monday night phoned her up the next day to arrange a meeting discovered where shed be that nightwhich he of course wouldnt admit to youand then killed her well i can tell you this thats absurd perhaps but an answer to the question would be helpful lynley noted julian said no no she wasnt involved with someone else or no she didnt tell you if she was involved with someone else nicola was honest if shed been involved with someone else romantically she would have told me she wouldnt have tried to protect you from the knowledge to spare your feelings once youd made them clear to her julian gave a rueful laugh believe me sparing peoples feelings wasnt her way despite any suspicions that he had elsewhere the nature of julians response seemed to prompt hanken to ask where were you on tuesday night mr britton with cass julian said the dog with the dog she was whelping samantha said you dont leave a dog alone when shes whelping you were here as well miss mccallin lynley asked helping out with the delivery she caught her lower lip with her teeth it was in the middle of the night julie didnt get me up i saw the puppies in the morning i see no you dont she cried you think julies involved youve come to trick him into saying something that will implicate him thats how you work we work at getting to the truth oh right tell that to the bridgewater four only its three now isnt it because one of those poor sods died in prison call a solicitor julie dont say another word julian britton in possession of a solicitor was exactly what they didnt need at the moment lynley said you appear to keep records about the dogs mr britton did you record the time of delivery they dont all pop out at once inspector samantha said julian said cass went into labour round nine at night she began delivering round midnight there were six puppiesone was stillbornso it took several hours if you want the exact times i have them in the records sam can fetch the book she went to do so when she returned julian said to her thanks im nearly finished in here youve been a real help ill manage the rest obviously he was dismissing her she appeared to communicate something to him through eye contact only whatever it was he either couldnt or didnt want to receive the message she cast a moderately baleful look at lynley and hanken before she left them the sound of the dogs barking outside rose then fell as she opened and closed the door behind her she means well julian told them when she was gone i dont know what id do without her trying to put the whole manor back together its a hell of a job sometimes i wonder why i took it on why did you lynley asked thereve been brittons here for hundreds of years my dream is to keep them here for a few hundred more nicola maiden was part of that dream in my mind yes in her mind no she had her own dreams or plans or whatever they were but thats fairly obvious isnt it she told you about them all she told me was that she didnt share mine she knew i couldnt offer her what she wanted not at the moment and probably never she thought it was the wiser course to leave our relationship the way it was which was what we were lovers if thats what youre asking in the normal sense hanken asked whats that supposed to mean the girl was shaved it suggests a certain sexual whimsicality to the relationship you had with her ugly colour flared in julians face she was quirky she waxed herself she had some body piercings done as well her tongue her navel her nipples her nose thats just who she was she didnt sound like a woman whod be the prospective bride of the impoverished landed gentry lynley wondered how julian britton had come to think of her as such britton however appeared to read the direction lynleys thoughts were taking he said it doesnt mean anything all that she just was who she was women are like that these days at least women her age as youre from london id expect you know that already it was true that one saw just about everything on the streets of london it would be a myopic investigator who judged any woman under thirtyor over thirty for that matteron the basis of waxing herself hairless or allowing holes to be needled into her body but all the same lynley wondered at the nature of julians comments there was an eagerness to them that wanted probing thats all i can tell you having made that remark julian opened the record book that his cousin had brought to him he flipped to a section behind a blue divider and turned several pages until he found the one he wanted he turned the book round so that lynley and hanken could see it the page was labelled cass in large block letters beneath her name were documented the times of each puppys delivery as well as the times that parturition had begun and ended they thanked him for the information and left him to continue his work with the harriers outside it was lynley who spoke first those times were written in pencil peter the lot of them i noticed hanken nodded in the direction of the manor house saying make quite a team dont they julie and his cousin lynley agreed he just wondered what game the team was playing chapter barbara havers was relieved to be able to leave the claustrophobic confines of the met headquarters once winston nkata requested that she get onto the battersea address of terry cole she wasted little time in dashing for her car she took the most direct route possible heading for the river where she followed the embankment to albert bridge on the south bank of the thames she consulted her battered a to z until she found the street she was looking for sandwiched between the two bridge roads battersea and albert terry coles digs were in a forestgreen brickandbaywindowed conversion set among other similar conversions in anhalt road a line of buzzers indicated that there were four flats in the building and barbara pressed the one that had colethompson taped next to it she waited glancing round at the neighbourhood terraced houses some in better condition than others were fronted by gardens some were neatly planted some were overgrown and more than one appeared to be used as a dumping place for everything from rusting cookers to screenless televisions there was no answer from the flat barbara frowned and descended the steps she blew out a breath not wanting to face another few hours at the computer and considered her options as she studied the house a spate of breaking and entering definitely wasnt going to cut the mustard and she was thinking about a retreat to the nearest pub for a heaped plate of bangers and mash when she noticed a curtain flick in the bay window of the ground floor flat she decided to have a go at the neighbours next to flat number one was the name baden barbara pressed the buzzer a tremulous voice came through the speaker almost at once in reply as if the person in the corresponding flat had been preparing for a visit from the law once barbara identified herselfand cooperatively held up her warrant card so that it could be observed at a distance through the ground floor windowthe lock on the door was released she pushed it open and found herself inside a vestibule that was the approximate size of a chess board it was chess board in decoration as well red and black tiles across which innumerable footprints were smudged flat number one opened to the right of the vestibule when barbara knocked she found that she had to go through the procedure all over again she held her warrant card to the peep hole in the door this time when it had been studied to the occupants satisfaction two dead bolts and a safety chain were released and the door opened barbara was faced with an elderly woman who said apologetically one cant be too careful these days im afraid she introduced herself as mrs geoffrey baden and quickly brought barbara up to speed on the particulars of her life without being asked twenty years a widow she had no children just her birdsfinches whose enormous cage occupied one complete side of the sitting roomand her music the source of which seemed to be a piano that occupied the other side this was an antique upright and its top held several dozen framed pictures of the late geoffrey while its music rack displayed enough handscored sheet music to suggest that mrs baden might be channelling mozart in her free afternoons mrs baden herself suffered from tremors they affected her hands and her head which shook subtly but unceasingly throughout her interview with barbara no place to sit in here im afraid mrs baden said cheerfully when she was done sharing her personal particulars come through to the kitchen ive a fresh lemon cake if youd like a piece she would have loved a piece barbara told her but the truth was that she was looking for cilia thompson did mrs baden know where cilia might be found i expect shes working in the studio mrs baden replied confiding theyre artists the two of them cilia and terry lovely young people if you dont mind their appearance which i myself never do times change dont they and one must change with them she seemed such a gentle kind soul that barbara was reluctant to tell her of terrys death immediately so she said you must know the two of them well cilias rather shy but terrys a dear boy always popping round with the little gift or surprise he calls me his adopted gran does terry he sometimes does the odd job when i need him and he always stops to ask if i want something from the grocery when he pops out for his shopping neighbours like that are hard to come by these days dont you agree im lucky that way myself barbara said warming to the old woman ive good neighbours as well then count yourself among the fortunate my dear may i say what a lovely colour your eyes are by the way one doesnt see such a pretty blue that often i expect youve some scandinavian in your blood ancestrally of course mrs baden plugged in the electric kettle and pulled a packet of tea from a cupboard shelf she spooned leaves into a faded porcelain pot and brought two mismatched mugs to the kitchen table her tremors were so bad that barbara couldnt imagine the woman wielding a kettle of boiling water and a few minutes later when the kettle clicked off she hastened to make the tea herself for this activity mrs baden thanked her graciously she said one keeps hearing that young people have become virtual savages these days but thats not been my experience she used a wooden spoon to stir the tea leaves round in the water then she looked up and said quietly i do hope dear terrys not in some sort of trouble as if shed expected the police to come calling for quite some time despite her earlier words im awfully sorry to tell you this mrs baden barbara said but terrys dead he was murdered in derbyshire several nights ago thats why id like to talk to cilia mrs baden mouthed the word dead in some confusion her expression became stunned as the full implication behind that word made its way past her defences against it oh my goodness she said that lovely young boy but certainly you cant think that ciliaor even that unfortunate boyfriend of hershad anything to do with it barbara filed away the information about the unfortunate boyfriend for future reference no she told mrs baden she actually wanted cilia to let her inside the flat she needed a look round the place to see if there was anything that might give the police a clue why terry cole had been murdered he was one of two people killed you see barbara told her the other was a womannicola maiden she was calledand it may well be that the killings happened because of her but in any event were trying to establish whether terry and the woman even knew each other of course mrs baden said i understand completely you have a job to do as unpleasant as it must certainly be she went on to tell barbara that cilia thompson would be in the railway arches that fronted portslade road that was where she terry and two other artists pooled their resources to have a studio mrs baden couldnt give barbara the exact address but she didnt think the studio would be difficult to find one can always ask along the street in the other arches i expect the proprietors would know whom youre talking about as to the flat itself mrs baden used a pair of silver tea tongstheir plate worn through in spotsto capture a sugar cube it took her three tries because of the shaking but she smiled with real pleasure when she managed it and she dropped the cube into her tea with a satisfied plop i do have a key of course brilliant barbara thought and she mentally rubbed her hands together in anticipation its my house you see mrs baden went on to explain that when mr baden had passed on shed had the house converted as an investment to provide her with income in her twilight years i let out three flats and live in the fourth myself and she added that she always insisted on keeping a key to each of the flats shed long ago discovered that the potential of a landlords surprise visit always kept her tenants on their toes however she concluded sinking barbaras ship with a nonetheless fond smile i cant let you in you cant im afraid it would be such a violation of trust you see to let you in without cilias permission i do hope you understand damn barbara thought she asked when cilia thompson generally returned oh they never kept regular hours mrs baden told her shed be wisest to run by portslade road and make an appointment with cilia while she was painting and by the way could mrs baden talk the constable into a slice of lemon cake before she left one loved to bake but only if one could share ones creations with someone else it would balance the chocolate donut nicely barbara decided and since immediate access to terry coles flat was going to be denied her she thought she might as well continue towards her personal dietary goal of ingesting nothing but sugar and fat for twentyfour hours mrs baden beamed at barbaras acceptance and sliced a wedge of cake suitable for a viking warrior as barbara fell upon it the older woman made the sort of pleasant chitchat at which her generation so excelled buried within it was the occasional nugget about terry cole thus barbara gleaned that terry was a dreamer not entirely practicalto mrs badens way of thinkingabout his future success as an artist he wanted to open a gallery but my dear the thought that someone might actually want to buy his pieces or even those done by his colleagues but then what did an old woman know about modern art his mother said that he was working on a big commission barbara noted had he mentioned it to you my dear he did talk about a big project but there wasnt one im not quite saying that mrs baden made the point hastily i think in his mind there truly was in his mind youre saying that he was delusional perhaps he was just a little overly enthusiastic mrs baden gently pressed the tines of her fork against a few cake crumbs and looked reflective her next words were hesitant it does seem like speaking ill of the dead barbara sought to reassure her you liked him thats obvious and i expect you want to help he was such a good boy he couldnt do enough to help those he cared for youll be hardpressed to find anyone wholl tell you differently but barbara tried to sound encouraging but sometimes when a young man wants something so desperately he cuts corners doesnt he he tries to find a shorter and more direct route to get to his destination barbara seized on the final word youre talking about the gallery he wanted to open gallery no im talking about stature mrs baden replied he wanted to be someone my dear more than money and goods he wanted a sense of having a place in the world but ones place in the world has to be earned hasnt it constable she set her fork by her plate and dropped her hands into her lap i feel terrible saying such things about him he was you see so good to me he gave me three new finches for my birthday and only this week some nice piano music flowers on mothering sunday as well so considerate a boy so generous really and helpful he was so truly helpful when i needed someone to tighten a screw or change a bulb i understand barbara reassured her its just that i want you to know he had more than one side to him and this other partthe part in a hurrywell he would have outgrown that as he learned more about life wouldnt he without a doubt barbara said unless of course his hunger for stature was directly related to his death on the moor upon leaving broughton manor lynley and hanken stopped in bakewell for a quick pub meal not far from the centre of town there over a filled jacket potato hanken and a ploughmans lunch lynley they sorted through their facts hanken had brought with him a map of the peak district which he used to make his major point were looking for a killer who knows the area he said indicating the map with his fork and you cant tell me some lag fresh out of dartmoor prison took a crash course in trekandtrack in order to get revenge on andy maiden by killing his daughter that kite wont fly lynley studied the map dutifully he saw that hiking trails snaked all across the district and destinations of interest dotted it it looked like a paradise for a hiker or camper but a huge paradise in which the unwary or unprepared walker could easily become lost he also noted that broughton manor was of enough historical significance to be indicated as a point of interest just south of bakewell and that the manors land abutted a forest which itself gave way to a moor both across the moor and through the forest were a series of footpaths for the hiker which led lynley to say julian brittons family have been here for a few hundred years i expect hes familiar with the area as is andy maiden hanken countered and he has the look of someone whos been out and about on the land a fair amount i wouldnt be surprised to learn his daughter inherited her penchant for trekking from him and he found that car all night out scouring the whole blasted white peak and he managed to find that bloody car where was it exactly hanken used his fork again between the hamlet of sparrowpit and winnats pass stretched a road that formed the northwest boundary of calder moor a short distance from the track leading southeast towards perryfoot the car had been parked behind a drystone wall lynley said all right i see that it was a lucky shot hanken snorted right to find the car but lucky shots happen and he knew her haunts he did indeed he knew them well enough to track her down do her in and dash back home with no one the wiser with what motive peter you cant hang guilt on the man on the strength of his keeping information from his wife that kite wont fly either and if hes the killer whos his accomplice lets get back to his so years hanken said meaningfully what old lag fresh out of newgate would say no to making a few quid on the side especially if maiden made him the offer and guided him personally out to the site he forked up a mound of potato and prawns and shoveled them into his mouth saying it could have happened that way not unless andy maiden has undergone a transformation in personality since moving here peter he was one of the best dont like him too much hanken warned he may have called in markers to get you sent up here for one very good reason i could take offence at that my pleasure hanken smiled ive a fancy for seeing a nob cheesed off but mind you dont think too highly of this bloke thats a dangerous place to be just as dangerous as thinking too ill of the man in either case the vision goes to hell touché hanken said julian has a motive peter disappointment in love perhaps something stronger perhaps an elementary passion a base one at that whos this chap upman ill introduce you they finished their meal and returned to the car they headed northwest out of bakewell climbed upwards and traversed the northern boundary of taddington moor in buxton they cruised along the high street finding a place to park behind the town hall this was an impressive nineteenthcentury edifice overlooking the slopes a treeshaded series of ascending paths where those who once had come to buxton to take the waters had exercised in the afternoons the solicitors office was further along the high street above an estate agent and an art gallery featuring water colours of the peaks it was reached by means of a single door with the names upman smith sinclair printed on its opaque glass as soon as hanken sent his card into upmans office in the hands of an ageing secretary in secretarial twin set and tweeds the man himself came out to greet them and to usher them into his domain hed heard about nicola maidens death he told them somberly hed phoned the hall to ask where he should send nicolas final wages for the summer and one of the dailies there had given him the news the previous week had been her last in the office the solicitor seemed happy enough to cooperate with the police he deemed nicolas death a damnable tragedy for all concerned she had tremendous potential in the legal field and i was more than satisfied with her performance for me this past summer lynley studied the man as hanken gleaned the background information on the solicitors relationship with the dead woman upman looked like a newsreader for the bbc picture perfect and squeaky clean his oakbrown hair was greying at the temples giving him an air of trustworthiness that probably served him well in his profession this general sense of reliability was enhanced by his voice which was deep and sonorous he was somewhere in his early forties but his casual manner and his easy bearing suggested youth he answered hankens questions without the slightest indication that he might be uncomfortable with any of them hed known nicola maiden for most of the nine years that she and her family had lived in the peak district her parents acquisition of the old padley gorge lodgenow maiden hallhad brought them into contact with one of upmans associates who handled estate purchases through him will upman had met the maidens and their daughter weve been given to understand that mr maiden arranged for nicola to work for you this summer hanken said upman confirmed this he added it was no secret that andy hoped nicola would practise in derbyshire when shed completed her articles hed been leaning against his desk as they spoke having not offered either detective a chair he seemed to realise this all at once however because he hurried on to say im completely forgetting my manners forgive me please sit can i offer you coffee or tea miss snodgrass this last he called in the direction of the open door there the secretary reappeared shed donned a pair of largeframed spectacles that gave her the appearance of a timid insect mr upman she waited to do his bidding gentlemen he asked lynley and hanken they declined his offer of refreshment and miss snodgrass was dismissed upman beamed upon the detectives as they took seats then he remained standing lynley noted this raising his guard in the delicate game of power and confrontation the solicitor had just scored and the manoeuvre had been so smoothly handled how did you feel about nicola becoming employed somewhere in derbyshire he asked upman the solicitor regarded him affably i dont think i felt anything at all are you married never have been my line of work tends to give one cold feet when it comes to matrimony i specialise in divorce law that generally disabuses one of ones romantic ideals in rather short order could that be why nicola turned down julian brittons marriage proposal lynley asked upman looked surprised id no idea hed made one she didnt tell you she worked for me inspector i wasnt her confessor were you her anything else hanken put in clearly annoyed at the tenor of upmans last remark aside from her employer naturally from his desk upman picked up a palmsize violin that apparently served as a paperweight he ran his fingers along its strings and plucked at them as if testing their tuning he said you must be asking if she and i had a personal relationship when a man and a woman work at close quarters on a regular basis hanken said these things do happen they dont happen to me by which we can take it that you werent involved with the maiden girl thats what im saying upman replaced the violin and took up a pencil holder he began removing those pencils whose lead was too worn laying them neatly next to his thigh which continued to rest against the desk he said andy maiden would have liked it had nicola and i become involved hed hinted as much on more than one occasion and whenever i was at the hall for dinner and nicola was home from college he made a point of throwing us together so i saw what he was hoping for but i couldnt accommodate him why not hanken asked something wrong with the girl she wasnt my type what type was she lynley asked i dont know look what does it matter im well im rather involved with someone else rather involved this from hanken we have an understanding i mean we date i handled her divorce two years ago and what does it matter anyway he looked flustered lynley wondered why hanken appeared to notice this as well he began to home in you found the maiden girl attractive though of course im not blind she was attractive and did your divorcee know about her shes not my divorcee shes not my anything were seeing each other thats all there is and there was nothing for joyce to know joyce lynley asked his divorcee hanken said blandly and upman repeated there was nothing for joyce to know because there was nothing between us between nicola and me finding a woman attractive and becoming caught up in something that cant go anywhere are two different things why couldnt it go anywhere lynley asked because we were both involved elsewhere i am and she was so even if id thought about trying my luckwhich i hadnt by the wayid have been signing up for a course in frustration but shed turned down julian hanken interposed that suggests she wasnt as involved as you supposed that perhaps shed set her sights on someone else if so they werent set on me and as for poor britton id wager that she turned him down because his income didnt suit her my guess is that shed got her eye on someone in london with a hefty bank balance what gave you that impression lynley asked upman considered the question but he appeared relieved to be himself let off the hook of a possible involvement with nicola maiden she had a pager that went off occasionally he finally said and once when it did she asked me would i mind if she phoned london to give someone the number here to ring her back and he did as much after that time and again why would you conclude this was someone with money lynley asked a few long distance phone calls arent out of the question even for someone strapped for cash i know that but nicola had expensive tastes believe me she couldnt have bought what she wore to work every day on what i was paying her ill lay twenty quid on it that if you trace her wardrobe youll find it came from knightsbridge where some poor sods paying piles on an account that she was free to use and that sods not me very neat lynley thought upman had tied all the pieces together with an adroitness that was a credit to his profession but there was something calculated in his presentation of the facts that made lynley wary it was as if hed known what they would ask him and had already planned his answers like any good lawyer from hankens expression of mild dislike it was clear that hed reached the same conclusion about the solicitor are we talking about an affair hanken asked is this a married chap doing what he can to keep the mistress content i have no idea i can only say that she was involved with someone and i expect that someones in london when was the last time you saw her alive friday evening we had dinner but you yourself had no personal relationship with her hanken noted i took her to dinner as a farewell which is fairly common practice between employers and employees in our society if im not mistaken why does this put me under suspicion because if id wanted to kill herfor whatever reason you might have in mindwhy would i wait from friday until tuesday night to do it hanken pounced ah you seem to know when she died upman wasnt rattled i did speak to someone at the hall inspector so you said hanken got to his feet youve been most helpful to our enquiries if you can just give us the name of friday nights restaurant well be on our way the chequers inn upman said in calver but look here why do you need that am i under suspicion because if i am i insist on theres no need for posturing at this point in the investigation hanken said there was also no need lynley thought to put the solicitor any more on the defensive he intervened with everyone who knew the murder victim is a suspect at first mr upman di hanken and i are in the process of eliminating possibilities even as a solicitor i expect youd encourage a client to cooperate if he wanted to be crossed off the list upman didnt embrace the explanation but he also didnt press the issue lynley and hanken took themselves out of his office and into the street where hanken immediately said what a snake as they walked to the car what a slimy bugger did you believe his story which part of it any of it all of it i dont care as a lawyer naturally everything he said was immediately suspect this effected a reluctant smile in hanken but he gave us some useful information id like to talk to the maidens again and see if i can get anything out of them that will corroborate upmans suspicions that nicola was seeing someone in london if theres another lover somewhere theres another motive for murder for britton hanken acknowledged he jerked his head in the direction of upmans office but what about him dyou plan to list him among your suspects till we check him out definitely hanken nodded i think im starting to like you he said cilia thompson was in residence at the studio when barbara havers tracked it down three arches away from the dead end of portslade road she had the two big front doors completely open and she was in the midst of what looked like a creative fury slashing at a canvas with paint as what sounded like african drums emanated rhythmically from a dusty cd player the volume was high against her skin and in her sternum barbara could feel the pulsations cilia thompson she shouted wrestling her identification from her shoulder bag can i have a word cilia read the warrant card and put her paint brush between her teeth she punched a button on the cd player choked off the drums and returned to her work she said cyn cole told me and continued to smother the canvas with paint barbara sidled round to have a look at her work it was a gaping mouth out of which rose a motherly looking woman wielding a teapot decorated with snakes lovely barbara thought the painter was definitely filling a vacuum in the art world terrys sister told you that he was murdered his mum phoned her from the north soon as she saw the body cyn phoned me i thought something was up when she rang last night her voice wasnt right you know what i mean but i wouldnt have guessed i mean like who wouldve wanted to snuff terry cole he was a harmless little prick a bit demented considering his work but harmless all the same she said this last with a perfectly straight face as if all round her were canvases by peter paul rubens and not depictions of countless mouths regurgitating everything from oil slicks to motorway pileups the work of her compatriots wasnt much better from what barbara could see the other artists were sculptors like terry one used crushed rubbish bins as a medium the other used rusting supermarket trolleys yeah right barbara said but i spose its all a matter of taste cilia rolled her eyes not to someone whos educated in art terry wasnt terry was a poser no offence he wasnt educated in anything except lying and hed got like a first in that his mum said he was working on a big commission barbara said can you tell me about it for paul mccartney i have no doubt was cilias dry reply depending on what day of the week you happened to have a chat with him terry was working on a project that would bring him millions or getting ready to sue pete townshend for not telling the world he had a bastard sonthats terry mind youor stumbling on some secret documents that he planned to sell to the tabloids or having lunch with the director of the royal academy or opening a topflight gallery where hed sell his sculptures for twenty thousand a pop so there was no commission thats a safe bet cilia stepped back from her canvas to study it she applied a smear of red to the mouths lower lip she followed with a smear of white saying ah yes in apparent reference to the effect shed attained youre coping quite well with terrys death barbara noted for having just heard about it that is cilia read the statement for what it was implied criticism catching up another brush and dipping it into a glob of purple on her palette she said terry and i shared a flat we shared this studio we sometimes had a meal together or went to the pub but we werent real mates we were people who served a purpose for each other sharing expenses so we like didnt have to work where we lived considering the size of terrys sculptures and the nature of cilias paintings this arrangement made sense but it also reminded barbara of a remark that mrs baden had made how did your boyfriend feel about the deal then youve been talking to pruneface i see shes been waiting for dan to cut up rough with someone ever since she saw him talk about judging a bloke on appearances and and what and has he ever cut up rough that is with terry its not your everyday situation is it when one blokes girlfriend is living with another bloke like i said we arentwerentliving with like in living with most of the time we didnt even see each other we didnt hang out with the same group even terry had his mates and i have mine did you know his mates the purple paint went into the hair of the mouthsprung woman who was holding the teapot in cilias painting she applied it in a thick curving line then used the palm of her hand to smear it after which she wiped her palm on the front of her dungarees the effect on the canvas was disconcerting it rather looked as if mother had holes in her head cilia took up grey next and advanced on mothers nose barbara stepped to one side not wishing to see what the artist intended he didnt bring them round cilia said it was mostly phone chat and they were mostly women and they phoned him not the other way round did he have a girlfriend a special woman i mean he didnt do women not that i ever knew gay asexual he didnt do anything except toss off and even thats a real maybe his world was his art barbara offered cilia whooped such as it was she stepped back from her canvas and evaluated it yes she said and turned it round to face barbara voila now that tells a proper tale doesnt it mothers nose was excreting an unsavoury substance barbara decided that cilia couldnt possibly have spoken words more true about her painting she murmured her assent cilia carried her masterwork to a ledge along which half a dozen other paintings rested from among them she selected an unfinished canvas and carried it to the easel to continue with her work she dragged a stool to the right of her easel she rustled in a cardboard box and brought forth a mousetrap with its victim still in place she set this on a stool and made its companions a motheaten taxidermic cat and ajar of pasta cheese she shuffled these objects this way and that until she had the composition she required then she set upon the unfinished canvas where the lower lip of a mouth had been harpooned by a hook and a tongue protruded can i assume terry didnt sell much barbara asked her he sold sod all cilia said cheerfully but then he wasnt like ever willing to put enough of himself into it was he and if you dont give your all to your art your art isnt going to give anything back to you i put my guts right onto the canvas and the canvas rewards me artistic satisfaction barbara said solemnly hey i sell a real gent bought a piece off me not two days ago walked in here took one look said he had to have his own cilia thompson straightaway and brought out the chequebook right barbara thought the woman had quite an imagination so if he never sold a sculpture where did terry get the beans to pay for everything the flat this studio not to mention the gardening tools that he appeared to have amassed by the gross she thought he said his money was a payoff from his dad he had enough of it mind you payoff now here was something that could lead them somewhere was he blackmailing someone sure cilia said his dad pete townshend like i said as long as old pete kept the lolly rolling in terry wouldnt go to the papers crying dads floating in it and ive got sod all ha as if terry cole had the slightest hope of convincing anyone he wasnt what he really was a scam man out for the easy life this wasnt too far from mrs badens description of terry cole albeit spoken with far less affection but if terry cole had been into a scam what had it been and who had been its victim there had to be evidence of something somewhere and there seemed to be only one place where that evidence might be she needed to have a look through the flat barbara explained would cilia be willing to cooperate she would cilia said shed be home by five if barbara wanted to pop round then but constable havers had better have it straight in her head that whatever terry cole had been caught up in cilia thompson had not been part of it im an artist first last and always cilia proclaimed she rearranged the dead mouse and pulled the stuffed cats paw into a more ominous and chasseurlike position oh i can see that barbara assured her at buxton police station lynley and hanken parted ways once the buxton di arranged for his scotland yard associate to pick up a car hanken planned to head for calver determined to corroborate will upmans alleged dinner date with nicola maiden for his part lynley set out towards padley gorge at maiden hall he found that afternoon preparations for the evening meal were going on in the kitchen which backed onto the car park where lynley left the police ford the bar in the lounge was being restocked with spirits and the dining room was being set for the evening there was a general air of activity about the place demonstrating that as much as possible life was going on at the hall the same woman whod intercepted the dis on the previous afternoon met lynley just beyond the reception desk when he asked for andy maiden she murmured poor soul and left to fetch the former police officer while he waited lynley went to the door of the dining room just beyond the lounge another womanof similar age and appearance as the firstwas placing slender white candles in holders on the tables a basket of yellow chrysanthemums sat next to her on the floor the serving hatch between dining room and kitchen was open and from within the latter room came the sound of french rapidly spoken and with some considerable passion and then in accented english and no and no and no i ask for shallots it means shallots these are onions for boiling in the pan there was a quiet response that lynley couldnt catch then a torrent of french of which he caught only je temtnerde tommy lynley swung round to see that andy maiden had come into the lounge a spiral notebook in his hand maiden looked ravaged he was drawn and unshaven and he wore the clothes hed had on on the previous evening i couldnt wait for the pension he said voice numb i lived to retire i put up with the work without a word because it was leading to something thats what i told myself and them nan and nicola a few more years id say then well have enough rousing himself to trudge the rest of the way across the lounge to join lynley seemed to take what few resources he had left and look where its brought us my daughters dead and ive come up with the names of fifteen bastards whodve willingly killed their own mothers if theyd gain by the act so why the hell did i think theyd serve their time disappear and never bother to go after me lynley glanced at the notebook realising what it was youve got a list for us i read through the night three times four and heres where i ended dyou want to know yes i killed her i was the one how many times had he heard that need to take blame lynley wondered a hundred a thousand it was always the same and if there was a glib response that could attenuate the guilt of those who were left behind after violence had done its worst to a loved one he hadnt yet learned it andy he began maiden cut him off you remember what i was like dont you keeping society safe from the criminal element i told myself and i was good at what i did i was so bloody good but i never once saw that while i was concentrating on our fucking society my very own daughter my nick his voice began to waver sorry he said dont apologise andy its all right itll never be all right maiden opened the notebook and ripped out the last page he shoved this towards lynley find him we will lynley knew how inadequate his words wereas would be an arrest in the caseto mitigate maidens grief nonetheless he explained that hed assigned an officer to go through the so records in london but hed so far heard nothing thus anything that maiden provided them witha name a crime an investigationcould well end up halving or quartering the london officers time on the computer and freeing that officer to pursue likely suspects the police would be in maidens debt for that maiden nodded dully how else can i help can you give me something tommy something else to do because otherwise he ran a large hand through hair that was still curly and thick albeit quite grey im a textbook case looking for employment so i can stop going through this its a natural response we all put up defences against a shock till were ready to deal with it thats part of being human this im even calling it this because if i say the word thatll make everything real and i dont think i can stand it youre not expected to cope right now you and your wife are both owed some time to avoid whats happened or to deny whats happened or to fall apart altogether believe me i understand do you i think you know i do there was no easy way to make the next request i need to go through your daughters belongings andy would you like to be present maiden knotted his eyebrows her things are in her room but if youre looking for a connection to so whats nicolas bedroom got to do with that nothing perhaps lynley told him but we spoke to julian britton and will upman this morning there are several details wed like to explore further maiden said good christ are you thinking one of them and he looked beyond lynley to the window seeming to ponder what horrors a reference to britton and upman implied lynley said quickly its too early for anything but guesswork andy maiden turned back examined him for a long thirty seconds he finally seemed to accept the answer he took lynley to the second floor of the house and led him to his daughters bedroom remaining in the doorway and watching as lynley began going through nicola maidens belongings most of these comprised exactly what one would expect to find in the room of a twentyfiveyearold woman and much of it supported points that either julian britton or will upman had made a wooden jewellery case contained evidence of the body piercings with which julian had declared that nicola had decorated herself single gold hoops of varying sizes and without mates suggested rings that the dead girl had worn through her navel her up and her nipple single studs spoke of the hole in her tongue tiny ruby and emerald studs with screw tips would have fitted her nose the clothes cupboard contained designer clothing the labels were a whos who of haute couture upman had declared that she couldnt have dressed herself on what hed been paying her for her summers employment and her clothing fully supported his contention but there were other indications that nicola maidens whims were being fulfilled by someone the room was replete with items that could be associated only with either a considerable discretionary income or with a partner eager to prove himself through gifts an electric guitar took up space in the cupboard to the side of which were a cd player a tuner and a set of speakers that would have set nicola maiden back more than a months wages a nearby rotating oak stand designed solely for the occupation held two or three hundred cds a colour television in one corner of the room was the resting place for a mobile phone on a shelf beneath the television stand eight leather handbags were lined up precisely everything in the room spoke of excess everything also announced that at least in one respect nicolas employer may have been telling the truth either that or the girl had come by her money in a way that ultimately led to her death through drug pushing blackmail the black market embezzlement but thinking of upman reminded lynley of something else that the solicitor had said he went to the chest and began sliding open its drawers upon silk underwear and nightgowns cashmere scarves and designer socks yet to be worn he found one drawer devoted solely to the outdoor life stuffed with khaki shorts folded jerseys a small day pack ordnance survey maps and a silver flask engraved with the girls initials the bottom two drawers in the chest contained the only items that didnt look as if theyd been purchased in knightsbridge but even they were filled to the very top like the others they were a storage space for woollen sweaters of every possible style and hue each bearing an identical label sewn into the neckline made with loving hands by nancy maiden lynley fingered one of the labels thoughtfully he said her pagers missing andy upman said she had one do you know where it is maiden left his position by the door a pager is will certain about that he told us that she was paged at work you didnt know she had one i never saw her with one its not here maiden did what lynley had done he examined the items on the top of the chest then repeated the search through each of the drawers he went further however by taking lynleys place at the clothes cupboard where he checked the pockets of his daughters jackets and the waistbands of her trousers and skirts there were sealed plastic bags of clothing on the bed and he went through these as well finding nothing he finally said she must have taken it on the hike itll be in one of the evidence bags why take her pager but leave her mobile phone lynley asked the one would be useless on the moor without the other maidens glance went to the television where the mobile lay then back to lynley then its got to be here somewhere lynley checked the bedside table he found a bottle of aspirin a packet of kleenex birth control pills a box of birthday candles and a tube of lip balm he went to the leather handbags beneath the television opening them checking each compartment all of them were empty as were a satchel he discovered a briefcase and an overnight bag it could be in her car maiden suggested something tells me not why lynley made no reply standing in the middle of the room he saw the details with a vision that was heightened by the absence of a single simple possession that could have meant nothing and might have meant everything doing so he was able to see what he hadnt noticed before there was a museumlike quality to everything round him nothing in the room was even remotely out of place someone had been through the girls belongings wheres your wife this afternoon andy lynley asked chapter when andy maiden didnt reply at once lynley repeated the question and added is she in the hotel is she somewhere in the grounds maiden said no no she tommy nans gone out his fingers shut into his palms as if in a sudden spasm where do you know onto the moor i expect she took the bike and thats where she generally rides it on calder moor maiden moved to his daughters bed and sat heavily on the edge of it youve not met nancy before this have you tommy not that i recall she means nothing but well that woman she gives and she gives but there are times when i cant take any longer he looked down at his hands he flexed his fingers he raised then dropped his hands to gesture with as he went on she was worried about me can you credit it she wanted to help all she could think aboutor talk about or do something aboutwas getting this numbness out of my hands all yesterday afternoon she was after me about them all last night as well perhaps its her way of coping lynley said but it takes too much concentration for her to cut out the thoughts that shes trying to cut out dyou see that it takes every ounce of concentration she has and i found that i couldnt breathe with her round me hovering there offering cups of tea and heat pads and i began to feel like my skin wasnt even my own like she couldnt rest till shed even managed to invade my pores in order to he paused abruptly and in that pause he seemed to evaluate everything hed said unguarded because his next words were hollow god listen to me selfish bastard youve been dealt a death blow youre trying to cope shes been dealt the blow as well but she thinks of me he kneaded one hand with the fingers of the other she wanted to massage them thats all it was really and god forgive me but i drove her off because i thought id suffocate if i stayed in the room with her a moment longer and now how can we need and love and loathe all at once whats happening to us the aftershocks of brutality are happening to you lynley wanted to reply but instead he repeated has she gone out to calder moor andy shell be on hathersage moor its closer a few miles the other no she wont be on calder has she ever ridden there on calder yes on calder moor has she ever ridden there of course she has yes lynley hated to do so but he had to ask indeed he owed it both to himself and to his buxton colleague to ask you as well andy or just your wife andy maiden looked up slowly at this as if finally seeing the road they were travelling he said i thought you were pursuing the london angle so and what goes along with so i am pursuing so but im after the truth all of the truth as you are i expect do both of you ride on calder moor nancys not andy help me out you know what the jobs like the facts generally come out one way or another and sometimes the how of their coming out becomes more intriguing than the facts themselves that can easily divert an otherwise simple investigation and i cant believe you want that maiden understood an attempt at obfuscation could ultimately become more arresting than the information one sought to withhold both of us ride on calder moor all of us in fact but its too far to bike there from here tommy how many miles i dont know exactly but far too far we take the bikes out in the landrover when we want to ride there we park in a layby or in one of the villages but we dont ride all the way to calder moor from here he canted his head in the direction of the bedroom window adding the land rovers still out there she wont have gone onto calder this afternoon not this afternoon lynley thought he said i did see a land rover when i came through the car park maiden hadnt been a police officer for thirty years without being capable of a simple act of mind reading he said running the halls a demanding life it drains our time we take our exercise when we can if you want to track her on hathersage moor theres a map in reception thatll show you the way that wouldnt be necessary lynley told him if nancy maiden had ridden her bike out onto the moors she probably was seeking some time alone he was happy enough to let her have it barbara havers knew that she could have purchased some takeaway from uncle toms cabin a food stall on the corner of portslade and wandsworth roads it occupied little more than a niche at the near end of the railway arches and it looked just the sort of unhygienic place where one might purchase enough cholesterolladen grub to guarantee concrete arteries within the hour but she resisted the impulsevirtuously she liked to thinkand instead took herself to a pub near vauxhall station where she indulged in the bangers and mash upon which shed been meditating earlier these went down a treat eased on their way with half a pint of scrumpy jack sated with the food and drink and satisfied with the information shed gathered during her morning in battersea she returned to the north side of the thames and skimmed her way along the river traffic moved well on horseferry road she was pulling into the underground car park at new scotland yard before shed smoked her second player she had two professional options at this point she decided she could return to cris and the hunt for a suitable ticketofleaver out for the blood of a maiden or she could compile the information shed gathered so far into a report the former activityboring and subservient though it waswould demonstrate her ability to take the medicine which certain officers of the law believed she ought to be swallowing the latter activity however appeared to be the one likelier to take them towards some answers in the case she opted for the report it wouldnt take that long it would allow her to set down information in a concrete and thoughtprovoking order and it would postpone having to face the glowing screen for at least another hour she took herself off to lynleys officeno harm in using the space since it was going empty at the moment rightand set to work she was thoroughly into it just coming up to the salient points made by cilia thompson concerning terry coles paternity and his propensity towards questionable means of supportblackmail shed just typedwhen winston nkata strode into the room he was wolfing down the last of a whopper the container of which he sailed into the rubbish he wiped his hands thoroughly with a paper napkin he popped an opal fruit into his mouth junk foodll kill you barbara said sanctimoniously but ill die smiling was nkatas reply he swung one long leg over a chair and took out his leatherbound notebook as he sat barbara glanced at a wall clock and then at her colleague just how fastre you driving up and down the ml youre setting land speed records from derbyshire winston he avoided answering which was answer in itself barbara shuddered to think what lynley would say had he known that nkata was roaring along in his beloved bentley at just under the speed of sound been to the college of law he told her guv told me to look into the maiden girls doings in town barbara stopped typing and she dropped out she dropped out of law college thats how it looks nicola maiden he told her had apparently dropped out of law college on the first of may approaching exam time shed done it responsibly making appointments to see all the appropriate instructors and administrators before leaving several of them had tried to talk her out of itshed been near the top of her class and theyd considered it madness to leave when her successful future in law was assuredbut shed been politely adamant and shed disappeared muffed her exams barbara asked didnt ever take them left before she laid eyes on them was she scared developing nerves like her dad getting ulcers losing sleep realising shed have to swot and wasnt up to the challenge decided she just didnt fancy the law was what she told her personal tutor shed been working for eight months parttime at a firm in notting hill called mkr financial management nkata went on most of the law students did that sort of thing worked parttime during the day to support themselves taking instruction at the college in the late afternoons and at night shed been offered a fulltime placement at the notting hill firm and as she liked the work she decided to take it and that was that nkata said no one at the college heard a word from her since so what was she doing in derbyshire if shed taken a fulltime position in notting hill barbara asked was she having a holiday first not ccording to the guv and this is where it starts getting dodgy she was working for a solicitor on a summer job getting ready for the future and all that bit thats why he put me onto the college of law in the first place so shes employed in finance in london but takes a summer job doing law in derbyshire barbara clarified thats a new one on me does the inspector know she left law college havent rung him yet i wanted to have a chat with you first barbara felt a rush of pleasure at this remark she shot nkata a look as always his face was ingenuous pleasant and perfectly professional should we ring him then the inspector i mean lets chew on it a bit right okay well forget what she was doing in derbyshire for the moment the london bit at mkr financial management mustve brought her some decent dosh right because she wouldnt have been hurting for it at the end of the day had she stayed in law so why drop out of law college unless there was some decentand immediatelolly involved how does all that sound ill go with it for now okay so did she need cash quick and if so why was she making a big purchase paying off a debt taking a trip wanting to live an easier life barbara thought about terry cole and added with a snap of her fingers ah how about being blackmailed by someone by a london someone who zipped up to derbyshire wanting to know why her payment was late nkata flipped his hand back and forth his whoknows gesture could just be that the mkr gig looked more exciting than a life of wigwearing at the old bailey not to mention more profitable in the long run what did she do for mkr exactly nkata referred to his notes money management trainee he said trainee come on winston she couldntve dropped out of law college for that trainees where she started round october last year im not saying thats where she ended up but then what was she doing in derbyshire working for a solicitor had she changed her mind about the law was she going to go back to it if she did she never told the college hmm thats odd as she considered the apparent contradictions in the dead girls behaviour barbara reached for her packet of players saying mind if i do a fag winnie not in my breathing zone she sighed and settled for a stick of juicy fruit which she found in her shoulder bag adhered to a stub from her local cinema she picked off the thin shreds of cardboard and folded the gum into her mouth right so what else do we know she left her digs why wouldnt she if she was up in derbyshire for the summer i mean she left them permanently just like she left the college okay but that doesnt sound like news from the burning bush hang on then nkata reached in his pocket and brought forth another opal fruit he unwrapped it and tucked the sweet into the pocket of his cheek the college had her addressthis is the old oneso i went there and had a chat with the landlady in islington she had a bedsit and barbara encouraged him she moved housethe girl not the landladywhen she left law college this was on the tenth of may no notice given just packed her belongings left behind an address in fulham to send the post on and vanished landlady wasnt happy about that she wasnt happy about the row either nkata smiled as he offered this last bit of information barbara acknowledged the manner in which her colleague had played out the bits and pieces hed gathered by cocking a finger at him and saying you rat give me the rest winston at which nkata chuckled some bloke and her they went at it like paddies in the peace talks landlady said this was on the ninth the day before she moved house right violence no just shouting and some nasty language anything we can use bloke said i wont have it ill see you dead before ill let you do it now thats a nice bit dare i hope we have a description of the bloke nkatas expression told her damn he said but its something to note prhaps or not barbara considered what hed told her earlier she said but if she moved house right after the threat whyd the murder come along so much later if she moved house to fulham and then left town hed have to track her down nkata pointed out then he said whatd you get at this end barbara told him what shed gathered from her conversations with mrs baden and cilia thompson she concentrated on terrys source of income and on the contrasting descriptions of him as provided by his flatmate and his landlady cilia says he never sold a thing and wasnt likely to and i wouldnt disagree so then how did he support himself nkata thought about this moving his sweet from one side of his mouth to the other he finally said lets phone the guv and he went to lynleys desk where he punched in the number in a moment the connection went through and he had lynley on the inspectors mobile he said hang on and punched another button on the phone over the speaker barbara heard lynleys pleasant baritone saying whatve we got so far winnie just the sort of thing he would have said to her she got up and strode to the window there was nothing to see but tower block of course it was just something to do winston quickly brought lynley up to speed on nicola maidens abrupt departure from the college of law on her employment at mkr financial management on her moving house without giving notice on the row that preceded her moving house and on the particular threat to her life that had been overheard theres apparently a lover in london lynley said in reply upmans given us that but not a word about her having left law college whyd she keep it a secret because of the lover perhaps barbara could tell from lynleys voice that he was chewing this over mentally because of plans they had some married bloke then check out the financial management firm he could be there lynley related his own information he concluded with if the lover in london is a married chap whod set nicola up as a permanent mistress in fulham its not the sort of thing shed want to broadcast in derbyshire i cant see her parents feeling pleased with the news and britton would have been cut up as well but what was she doing in derbyshire in the first place barbara whispered to nkata her actions are contradicting themselves all over the map tell him winston nkata nodded and raised his hand to indicate that hed heard her he didnt argue with the inspectors points however instead he took notes at the conclusion of lynleys remarks he offered the details about terry cole considering the scope of them in conjunction with the brevity of time nkata had been back in town lynleys comment upon the constables conclusion was good god winnie how have you managed all this are you working telepathically barbara turned from the window to get nkatas attention but she didnt manage it before he spoke he said barbs on to the boy she did battersea this morning she talked to havers lynleys voice sharpened is she with you then barbaras shoulders sagged yeah shes writing lynley cut in didnt you tell me she was going through maidens past arrests she was doing yeah have you completed that search havers lynley asked barbara blew out a breath lie or truth she wondered a lie would serve her immediate purposes but it would sink her ship at the end of the day winston suggested i trek out to battersea she told lynley i was just about to go back to cris when he showed up with the information on the girl i was thinking sir that her working for upman doesnt make sense when you look at the fact that shed dropped out of law college and had another job in london that shed apparendy taken leave from for some reason if she even had another job at all because weve yet to check that out and anyway if theres a lover as youve said and if she was getting herself ready to be supported by him why the hell would she be spending a summer working in the peaks you need to get back on cris was lynleys reply ive had a word with maiden and hes given us some possibilities to look into from his time with so take down these names and deal with them havers he began reciting spelling when necessary there were fifteen names in all when she had them barbara said but sir dont you think that this terry cole business what he thought lynley interrupted was that as an so officer andrew maiden would have overturned rocks and uncovered slugs worms and insects from all walks of life he could have struck up an acquaintance during his time in undercover who had proved fatal years later thus once barbara was done looking for the obvious vengeance seekers she was to read the files again for a more subtle connection like a disappointed snout whose efforts hadnt been sufficiently rewarded by the police but dont you think ive told you what i think barbara ive given you an assignment id like you to get on with it barbara got the message she said sir in reply a polite affirmative she nodded to nkata and left the office but she took no more than two steps from the doorway get on to the financial management firm lynley said im going to have a look at the girls car if we can find that pager and if the lovers phoned in the number will put us on to him right winston said and rang off barbara slid back into lynleys office sidling along the wall casually as if shed never had an order to do anything else so who is it who told her in islington that hed see her dead before hed let her do it the lover her dad britton cole upman or someone we havent got on to yet and whats the it anyway when its at home settling in to be some heavy punters fluffy bit on the side going for the dosh with a bit of blackmail against the loverthats always nice isnt it having it off with more than one man what dyou think nkata looked up from his notebook as she spoke his glance went beyond her to the corridor where shed remained in mild defiance of lynleys instructions to her he said barb in a monitory fashion you heard the guvs order remained unsaid barbara said breezily there may even be more at mkr financial management nicola could have been a bird who fancied a regular bonk when she wasnt getting it from the boyfriend in the peaks and when the london lover was taken up with his wife but i dont think we want to go at that angle directly at mkr do you what with sexual harassment all the rage nkata didnt miss the plural pronoun he said a model of patience and delicacy barb the guv did say youre to get back on to cris bollocks to cris dont tell me you think some lag on the loose squared it with maiden by taking the cosh to his daughter thats stupid winston its a waste of time might be but when the spector tells you what road to take youd be a wise bird to take it right and when she didnt reply right barb okay okay barbara sighed she knew that shed been given a second chance with lynley through the good graces of winston nkata she just didnt want the second chance to materialise as a lengthy assignment to sit at a computer she tried a compromise what about this then let me go with you to notting hill let me work it with you and ill do the computer business on my own time i promise i give you my word of honour the guvs not going to go for that barb and hell be bloody cheesed off when he twigs what youre doing and then wherell you be he wont know about it i wont tell him you wont tell him look winston ive got a feeling about this the information weve got is all knotted up and it wants unknotting and im good at that you need my input youll need it more once you get more details from this mkr place im promising to do the computer slogim swearing to do itso just let me have a bigger piece of the case nkata frowned barbara waited she chewed her gum more vigorously nkata said whenll you do it then early morning night weekends when whenever she replied ill squeeze it in between tea dancing engagements at the ritz my social lifes a real whirl as you know but i think i can carve out an hour here and there to obey an order hell be checking to see youre doing what he says nkata pointed out and ill be doing it wearing bells if necessary but in the meantime dont waste my brain and experience by advising me to spend the next twelve hours at a computer terminal let me be part of this while the scents still fresh you know how important that is winston nkata slid the notebook into his pocket and observed her evenly youre a pit bull sometimes he said defeated its one of my finer attributes she replied chapter lynley pulled into the car park in front of buxton police station untangled his lengthy frame from the small police vehicle and examined the convex brick facade of the building he was still astounded at barbara havers he had suspected that nkata might put havers on to the task of tracing andy maidens investigations via computer he knew the black man was fond of her and he hadnt forbade it because in part he was willing to see ifafter her demotion and disgraceshe would complete a simple assignment that she was sure not to like true to form shed gone her own way in it proving once again what her commanding officer believed to be the case she had no more respect for a chain of command than a bull had respect for wedgwood china no matter that winston had asked her to see to the battersea end of things shed been given a prior assignment and she very well knew she was supposed to complete it before taking on something else christ when would the woman learn he strode inside the building and asked for the officer in charge of evidence from the crime scene after speaking to andy maiden hed tracked down nicolas saab at the pound where hed spent a fruitless fifty minutes doing himself what had already been done with exemplary efficiency by hankens team going over every inch of the car inside and out stem to stern the object of his search had been the pager hed come up emptyhanded so if nicola maiden had indeed left it in the saab when shed set off across the moors the only place remaining to look for it would be among whatever evidence had been taken from her car the officer in question was called dc mott and he presided over the cardboard boxes paper bags plastic containers clipboards and record books that constituted the evidence so far linked to the investigation he gave lynley the wariest of welcomes into his lair he was in the middle of tucking into an enormous jam tart onto which hed just poured a liberal helping of custard andspoon in handhe didnt look like a man who wished to be disturbed in the midst of indulging in one of his vices munching happily away mott leaned back in a metal folding chair and asked lynley exactly what he wanted to mess about with lynley told the constable what he was looking for then hedging his bets he went on to add that while the pager might well have been left in nicola maidens car it might also have been left at the crime scene itself in which case he wouldnt want to limit his search to evidence taken from the saab would mott mind his having a look through everything pager you say mott spoke with the spoon wedged into his cheek didnt come across nowt like that m afraid and he dipped his head to the tart with devotion best you have a look through the records book first sir no sense sifting through everything till you see what weve got usted is there fully aware of the degree to which he was treading on another mans patch lynley sought the most cooperative route he found a vacant spot to lean against a metaltopped barrel and he skimmed through the lists in the records book while motts spoon clicked energetically against his bowl nothing in the records book came close to resembling a pager so lynley asked if he might have a look through the evidence for himself taking time to polish off tart and custard with gustolynley half expected the man to lick the sides of the bowlmott reluctantly gave lynley permission to look through the evidence once lynley managed to obtain a pair of latex gloves from the dc he started with the bags marked saab he got only as far as the second bag however when di hanken came charging into the evidence room upmans lied to us the sod he announced flipping mott a cursory nod not that im surprised smarmy bastard lynley went on to the third bag from the saab he set it on the top of the barrel but he didnt open it saying lied about what about friday night about his supposedheavy irony on the wordguvtosubordinate relationship with our girl hanken scrambled in his jacket and brought out his marlboros at which constable mott said not in here sir fire hazard to which hanken said hell and shoved them back into his pocket he went on they were in the chequers all right i even had a word with their waitress a girl called margery who remembered them at once seems our upmans taken more than one dolly bird to the chequers in the past and when he does he asks that margery serve them likes her she says and tips like an american bloody fool lynley said the lie did they ask for a room oh no they left like upman said what he failed to tell us was where they went afterwards hanken smiled thinly clearly delighted at having caught the solicitor out they went from the chequers to chez upman he announced where the maiden girl checked in for a lengthy visit hanken warmed to his story having learned never to believe the first thing a lawyer said hed done a little more scavenging once hed spoken to margery a brief stint in the solicitors neighbourhood had been enough to unearth the truth upman and nicola maiden had apparently arrived at the solicitors house round eleven fortyfive seen by a neighbour who was taking rover out for his lastoftheevening ana theyd been friendly enough with each other to suggest that a little more existed between them than the employeremployee relationship depicted by mr upman tongues on the porch hanken said crudely our will was examining her dental work closely ah lynley opened the evidence bag and lifted its contents onto the barrel top and do we know it was nicola maiden upman was with what about the divorcee girlfriend joyce it was nicola all right hanken said when she leftthis was at half past four the next morningthe bloke next door was taking a piss he heard voices had a look out the window and got a fine glimpse of her when the light went on in upmans car soand here he took out his marlboros once morewhat dyou think they were up to for five hours mott said again not in here sir hanken said shit and returned the marlboros to their place another talk with mr upman appears to be in order lynley said the expression on hankens face said that he couldnt wait lynley summarised for his colleague the information that nkata and havers had gleaned in london he concluded by saying thoughtfully but no one here in derbyshire seems to know that the girl had no intention of completing her law course curious dont you think no one knew or someones lying to us hanken said pointedly he seemed to note for the first time that lynley was sifting through evidence he said whatre you doing then satisfying myself that nicolas pager isnt here dyou mind satisfy away the contents of the third bag appeared to be articles from the saabs boot among the items lying on the barrel top were the cars jack a box spanner a wheel brace and a set of screwdrivers three spark plugs looked as if theyd been rolling round the boot since its factory days and a set of jump leads were curled round a small chrome cylinder lynley lifted this last up and looked it over under the light whatve we got hanken asked lynley reached for his glasses and slipped them on hed been able to identify every other item that had been taken from the car but what the cylinder was he couldnt have said he turned the object over in his hand little more than two inches long the cylinder was perfectly smooth both inside and out and either end of it was curved and polished suggesting that as it was it was all of a piece it opened to fall precisely in half by means of a hinge each half had a hole bored into it through each hole an eyebolt was screwed looks like something from a machine hanken said a nut a cog something like that lynley shook his head it hasnt any interior grooves and if it had wed be looking at a machine the size of a space ship i dare say then what here let me have a look gloves sir mott barked vigilance in action he tossed a pair to hanken who put them on in the meantime lynley gave the cylinder a closer scrutiny its got something on the inside a deposit of some kind motor oil not unless motor oil solidifies these days lynley said hanken took it from him and had his own go with it he turned it in his palm and said substance where lynley pointed out what hed seen a smear in the shape of a small maple leaf lapping over the topor the bottomof the cylinder something had been deposited there and had dried to the colour of pewter hanken scrutinised this even going so far as to sniff it in a noisy houndlike fashion he asked mott for an evidence bag and said get this checked out straightaway ideas lynley asked him not off the top of my head he replied could be anything bit of salad cream smear of mayonnaise from a prawn sandwich in the boot of her car she went on a picnic how the devil do i know thats what forensic is for there was more than a grain of truth to this but lynley felt unsettled by the presence of the cylinder and he wasnt altogether sure why he said attempting delicacy with the request and knowing how it might be interpreted peter would you mind if i had a look at the crime scene he neednt have worried hanken was hot to get on to other things have at it ill have at upman he peeled off his gloves and fished out his marlboros a final time saying to mott dont have a coronary constable im not lighting up in here and once outside the constables demesne he went on happily as he fired up the tobacco you know how it looks with the girl bonking upman as well as whatve we got so far two others julian britton and the london lover lynley verified for starters and upmanll make a third once ive talked to him hanken inhaled deeply and with some satisfaction so how dyou suppose our upman felt wanting her having her and knowing she was giving it out to two other blokes just as happily as she was giving it to him youre getting ahead of yourself on that one peter i wouldnt put money on it more important than upman lynley pointed out how did julian britton feel he wanted to marry her not to share her and if as her mother claims she always told the truth what might his reaction have been when he learned exactly what nicola was up to hanken mulled this over britton is easier to tag with an accomplice he admitted isnt he just lynley said samantha mccallin didnt want to think and when she didnt want to think she worked she trundled a wheelbarrow briskly down the long gallerys old oak floor kitted out with a shovel a broom and a dust pan she stopped at the first of the rooms three fireplaces and applied herself to removing the grit grime coal dust bird droppings old nests and bracken that over time had fallen down the chimney in an attempt at disciplining her thoughts she counted her movements oneshovel twolift threeswing fourdump and in this way she emptied the fireplace of what appeared to be fifty years of detritus she found that as long as she kept up the rhythm she held her mind in check it was when she had to move from shovelling to sweeping that her thoughts began to gallop about lunch had been a quiet affair with the three of them gathered round the table in a nearly unbroken silence only jeremy britton had spoken during the meal when samantha had placed a platter of salmon in the middle of the table her uncle had caught her hand unexpectedly and raised it to his lips announcing were grateful for all youve been doing round here sammy were grateful for everything and hed smiled at her a long slow meaningful smile as if they shared a secret which they did not samantha told herself no matter the extent to which her uncle had revealed his feelings about nicola maiden on the previous day shed been successful in keeping hers to herself it was necessary that with the police crawling about asking questions and gazing at one with open suspicion it was absolutely crucial that how she felt about nicola maiden be something samantha held close to her heart she hadnt hated her shed seen nicola for what she was and shed disliked her for it but she hadnt hated her rather shed simply recognised her as an impediment to attaining what samantha had quickly decided she wanted in a culture requiring her to find a man in order to define her world samantha hadnt come across a decent prospect in the last two years with her biological clock ticking away and her brother refusing to have so much as a cup of coffee with a prospective female lest he be asked to commit his life to her she was beginning to feel that the responsibility to extend the immediate family line was hers alone but shed been unable to sniff out a mate despite the humiliation of taking out personal ads joining a dating agency and engaging in such maritally conducive activities as singing in the church choir and as a result shed felt a growing desperation to settle down which meant of course to reproduce at one level she knew it was ridiculous to be so marriageandoffspring minded women in this day and age had careers and lives beyond husband and children and sometimes those careers and those lives excluded husband and children altogether but on another level she believed that she would be failing somehow if she made her lifes journey forever alone besides she told herself she wanted children and she wanted those children to have a father julian had seemed so likely a candidate theyd got on from the first theyd been such pals theyd achieved a quick intimacy born of a mutual interest in restoring broughton manor and if that interest had been manufactured on her part initially it had become real quickly enough when shed understood how passionate her cousin was about his plans and she could help him with those plans she could nurse them along not only by working at his side but by infusing the manor with the copious supply of money shed inherited upon her fathers death it had all seemed so logical and meant to be but neither her camaraderie with her cousin her ample funds nor her efforts at proving her worthiness to julian had sparked the slightest degree of interest in him beyond the affectionate interest one might have had for the family dog at the thought of dogs samantha shuddered she would not go in that direction she thought firmly walking that path would lead her inexorably to a consideration of nicola maidens death and thinking about her death was as intolerable a prospect as was thinking about her life yet the act of trying not to think about her spurred samantha to think about her anyway you dont like me much do you sam nicola had asked her scanning her face to read what was there yes i see its because of jules i dont want him you know not the way women generally want men hes yours if you can win him that is so frank she was so absolutely upfront with every word she spoke hadnt she ever worried about the impression she was making hadnt she ever wondered if someday that relentless honesty was going to cost her more than she was willing to pay i could put in a word for you if youd like im happy to do it i think you and jules would be good together a frightfully proper sort of match as they used to say and shed laughed but it hadnt been malicious disliking her would have been so much easier if only nicola had stooped to ridicule but she hadnt she hadnt needed to when samantha already knew quite well how absurd her desire for julian was i wish i could make him stop loving you shed said if you find a way do it nicola had replied and therell be no hard feelings you can have him with my blessing it would be for the best and shed smiled the way she always smiled so open and engaging and friendly so completely without the worries of a woman who knew that her looks were nondescript and her talents worthless that smacking her seemed like the only response samantha could possibly make smacking her and shaking her and shouting do you think its easy being me nicola do you think i enjoy my situation that contact of flesh on flesh of flesh on bone was what samantha had wanted anything to remove from nicolas clear blue eyes the knowledge that in a battle in which nicola didnt even bother to fight samantha mccallin still could not win sam here you are samantha swung hastily round from the fireplace and saw julian coming along the gallery in her direction the afternoon sunlight striking his hair her sudden movement spilled several globs of petrified ashes onto the floor miniature clouds of griseous dust rose from them you frightened me she said how can you walk so quietly on a wooden floor he looked down at his shoes as if in explanation sorry he was carrying a tray with cups and plates on it and he gestured with it i thought youd like a break ive made us tea she saw that hed also cut them each a piece of the chocolate cake shed made for that evenings pudding she felt a twinge of impatience at this surely he could have seen it hadnt been cut into yet surely he could have known it was meant for something surely just for once dear god he could have drawn one or two conclusions from the facts in hand but she emptied her shovelful of debris into a wheelbarrow and said thanks julie i could do with something she hadnt been able to eat much of the lunch shed prepared them neither she had noted had he so she knew that she was due for some sustenance she just wasnt sure she could manage it in his presence they went to the windows where julian set the tray on the top of an old dole cupboard leaning their bums against the dusty sill they each held a mug of darjeeling and waited for the other to speak its coming along was julians offering as he looked the length of the gallery to the door through which hed entered for an overlong time he seemed to study the grimy ornate carving of the britton falcon that surmounted it i couldnt manage any of this without you sam youre a brick just what a woman longs to hear samantha replied thanks very much damn i didnt mean never mind samantha took a sip of tea she kept her eyes on its milky surface why didnt you tell me julie i thought we were close next to her he slurped his tea samantha subdued her moue of distaste tell you what and we are close at least i hope we are i mean i want us to be without you here i would have packed it all in a long time ago youre practically the best friend i have practically she said that limbo place you know what im saying and the trouble was she did know she knew what he was saying what he meant and how he felt she wanted to take him by the shoulders and shake him into an understanding of what it meant that such an unspoken communication should exist between them but she couldnt do so so she settled on trying to ferret out some of the real story of what had occurred between her cousin and nicola not really knowing what shed do with the facts when and if she got them id no idea youd even thought about asking nicola to marry you julie when the police brought it up i didnt know what to think about what about why you hadnt told me first that youd asked her then that shed said no frankly i hoped shed reconsider i wish you had told me why it would have made things easier i suppose at that he turned she could feel his gaze on her and she grew restive under it easier how could knowing id asked nicola to marry me and been turned down have made anything easier and for whom his words were guarded careful for the first time which made her speak guardedly in reply easier for you of course i had the feeling something was wrong all day tuesday if youd told me i could have given you some support it cant have been easy waiting through tuesday night and wednesday i expect you didnt get a minutes sleep silence for a terribly long moment then quietly yes thats true enough well we could have talked about it it helps to talk dont you think talking would have i dont know sam wed been terribly close the two of us in the last few weeks it felt so good and i samantha warmed to the words suppose i didnt want to do anything that might kill the closeness and drive her off not that talking to you would have done that because i know you wouldnt have told her wed spoken naturally samantha said with quiet bleakness i knew shed be unlikely to reconsider but i still hoped she would and it seemed to me that if i said something about what was going on it would be like bursting a bubble idiotic i know but there you have it putting your hopes into words yes i understand i suppose the truth is that i couldnt face reality i couldnt look squarely at the fact that she didnt want me the way i wanted her i would have done as a friend as a lover even when she was in the peaks but nothing more than that he picked at his wedge of cake with the fork tines he was she noted eating as little as she finally he set his plate on the window sill he said did you see the eclipse she frowned then remembered it seemed so long ago it didnt seem like much fun to wait for it alone i didnt go after all thats just as well we wouldnt want you lost on the moors oh thats unlikely isnt it it was only eyam moor and even if it had been one of the others ive been out there enough by myself that i always know where im she stopped herself she looked at her cousin he wasnt watching her but his ruddy natural colouring gave him away ah i see is that what you think im sorry his voice was wretched i cant stop thinking about it having the police turn up made everything worse all i can think about is what happened to her i cant get it out of my mind try doing what i do she said past a pounding heartbeat that she heard in her ears there are so many ways to keep ones mind occupied try considering for example the fact that dogs have been giving birth on their own for a few hundred thousand years its remarkable that one can think about it for hours that thought alone can fill up ones head so theres no room left for anything else julian was immobile shed made her point where were you on tuesday night sam he whispered tell me i was killing nicola maiden samantha said getting to her feet and walking back to the fireplace i always like to end my day with a spot of murder mkr financial management was housed in what looked like a pale pink confection on the corner of lansdowne road and st johns gardens the decorative icing consisted of woodwork so clean that barbara havers imagined a dusterwielding lackey getting up at five in the morning each day to scrub his way from the faux columns on either side of the door to the plaster medallions above the porch good thing weve still got the guvs motor nkata murmured as he pulled up to the pavement across the street from the building why barbara asked we look like we fit in he nodded to a car whose back end was sloping up the drive at one side of the pink confection it was a jaguar xjs silver in colour it could have been the bentleys first cousin a black mercedes sat in front of the building locked between an astonmartin and an antique bristol were definitely out of our financial depth barbara said heaving herself from the car but thats just as well we wouldnt like to be rich people with dibs are always dead choked you believe that barb no but it keeps me happier to pretend it come on i need some serious financial managing and something tells me weve come to a place where it can happen they had to ring to get in no voice enquired as to whod come calling but none was necessary since a hightech security system on the building included a video camera placed strategically above the front door just in case someone was watching barbara took out her warrant card and held it up to the camera perhaps in response the door buzzed open an oakfloored entry became a hushed corridor of closed doors with a width of persian carpet running down it off this reception consisted of a small room that was heavy on antiques and heavier still on silverframed photographs there was no one present just a sophisticated telephone system that appeared to answer calls automatically and send them on their way this sat on a kidneyshaped desk across whose top were fanned out a dozen brochures with the logo mkr stamped in gold upon them it was all very reassuring in appearance just the sort of place one wouldnt mind coming to in order to discuss the delicate matter of ones monetary situation barbara went to investigate the photographs she saw that the same man and woman were common to them all he was short wiry and angelic in appearance with a wispy corona of hair round his head which added to his celestial aura his companion was taller than he blonde and as thin as a walking eating disorder she was beautiful in the fashion of a catwalk model vacantlooking and all cheekbones and lips the photographs themselves were vintage hello featuring their subjects with an assortment of wellturnedout nobs políticos and celebrities a former prime minister stood among them and barbara had no trouble identifying opera singers film stars and a wellknown us senator a door opened and closed somewhere in the corridor the floor boards creaked as someone walked along the persian carpet towards reception with a click of heels against a bare section of wood a woman came into the room to greet them no more than a glance told barbara that one of the two photographed subjects had herself come to see why the rozzers were calling she was tricia reeve the woman said assistant director of mkr financial management how might she be of help to them barbara introduced herself nkata did the same they asked the woman if they could have a few minutes of her time of course tricia reeve replied politely but barbara couldnt help noticing that the assistant director of mkr financial management didnt exactly embrace the words scotland yard cid with the devotion of a member of the faithful instead her glance moved like nervous quicksilver sliding between the two detectives as if she wasnt certain how to behave her wide eyes looked black but a lengthier look at them revealed that her pupils were so enlarged that they covered all but a thin edge of iris the effect was disconcerting but it was also revealing drugs barbara realised tsk tsk tsk no wonder she was jumpy with the cops on her doorstep tricia reeve took a moment to inspect her watch goldbanded this was and coruscating expensively in the light she said i was just about to leave so i hope this wont take long ive got to attend a tea at the dorchester its a charity do and as im a member of the committee i hope you understand is there a problem murder certainly was a problem barbara thought she let nkata do the honours for her part she watched for reactions there were none other than perplexity tricia reeve observed nkata as if she hadnt heard him correctly after a moment she said nicola maiden murdered and then she added most strangely are you certain weve had a positive id from the girls parents i meant are you certain she was murdered we dont think she bashed in her own skull if thats what youre asking barbara said that got a reaction limited though it was one of tricia reeves manicured hands reached for the top button of her suits jacket it was pinstriped with a pencilwidth skirt that showed several miles of leg look barbara said the college of law told us that she came to work for you last autumn on a parttime basis that turned to fulltime in may we take it shed gone on leave for the summer is that right tricia glanced towards a closed door behind the reception desk youll need to speak to martin she went to the door knocked once entered and shut it behind her without another word barbara looked at nkata im panting for your analysis son shes pilledup like a pharmacists cupboard was his succinct reply shes flying all right what dyou reckon it is he flipped his hand its keeping her sweet whatever shes on it was nearly five minutes before tricia reappeared during this time the phones continued to ring the calls continued to be routed and the low murmur of voices came from behind the heavy closed door when it opened at last a man stood before them it was angel hair from the photographs decked out in a welltailored charcoal suit and waistcoat with the heavy gold chain of a pocket watch slung across his middle he introduced himself as martin reeve he was tricias husband he told them managing director of mkr he invited barbara and nkata into his office his wife was on her way out to tea he explained would the police be needing her because as head of fund raising for children in need she had an obligation to her committee to be present at their autumn harvest tea at the dorchester it began the season and had tricia not been the chairmansorry darling chairperson of the event her presence wouldnt be so crucial as it was she happened to have the guest list in the boot of her car and without that list the seating assignments for the tea couldnt be made reeve hoped the police would understand he flashed a mouth of perfect teeth in their direction straight white and capped they were a testimony to one mans triumph over the vicissitudes of dental genetics absolutely barbara agreed we cant have sharon whosis sitting next to the countess of crumpets as long as mrs reeve is available later should we need to talk to her reeve assured them that both he and his wife understood the gravity of the situation darling he nodded tricia on her way shed been standing hesitantly next to his desk a massive affair of mahogany and brass with burgundy leather inlaid in the top at his nod she made her exit but not before he stopped her for a goodbye kiss she was forced to bend to accommodate him with stilettos on she was a good eight inches above his height that didnt cause them any difficulty however the kiss lingered just a bit too long barbara watched them thinking what a clever move it was on their part the reeves were no amateurs when it came to gaining the upper hand the only question was why did they want it she could see that nkata was growing as uncomfortable as they wanted him to be with their unexpected extended display of affection her colleague shifted from one foot to the other as arms crossed in front of him he tried to decide where he was supposed to look barbara grinned because of his impressive height and his equally impressive wardrobe and despite his adolescence spent as chief war counsel with brixtons most notorious street gang she sometimes forgot that winston nkata was in fact a twentyfiveyearold kid who still lived at home with his mum and his dad she cleared her throat quietly and he glanced her way she gave a nod to the wall behind the desk where two diplomas hung he joined her there loves a beautiful thing she murmured quietly we must show it respect the reeves eased up on their mouthtomouth suction see you later darling martin reeve murmured barbara rolled her eyes at nkata and inspected the two diplomas hanging on the wall stanford university and london school of economics both were made out to martin reeve barbara eyed him with new interest and more than a little respect it was vulgar to display themnot that reeve would ever stoop to vulgarity she thought sardonicallybut the bloke was clearly no slouch when it came to brains reeve sent his wife on her way from his pocket he took a snowy linen handkerchief which he used to wipe from his face the leavings of her pale pink lipstick sorry he said with a boyish smile twenty years of marriage and the firesre still burning youve got to admit thats not too bad for two middleagers with a sixteenyearold son here he is by the way names william favours his mom doesnt he the appellation told barbara what the stanford diploma the antiques the silver frames and the careful midatlantic pronunciation had only suggested youre an american she said to reeve by birth but i havent been back for years reeve nodded at the photo what dyou think of our william barbara glanced at the picture and saw a spottyfaced boy with his mothers height and his fathers hair but she also saw what she was meant to see the unmistakable cutaway and striped trousers of a pupil at eton ladeedahdah barbara thought and handed the picture off to nkata eton she said with what she hoped was the right degree of awe he must have brains by the bucketful reeve looked pleased hes a whiz please sit down coffee or a drink but i suppose you dont while youre working do you drink that is they demurred on everything and got to the point theyd been told that nicola maiden had been employed by mkr financial management from october of the previous year true enough reeve affirmed she worked as a trainee equally true reeve agreed what was that exactly what was she training for investment advisor reeve told them nicola was preparing herself to be able to manage financial portfolios stocks bonds mutual funds derivatives offshore holdings mkr managed the investments of some of the biggest hitters in the marketplace with complete discretion of course lovely barbara told him it was then their assumption that nicola had remained in his employ until shed taken a leave of absence to work for a solicitor in derbyshire for the summer if mr reeve wouldreeve stopped them from going further he said nicola didnt take a leave from mkr she quit at the end of april she was moving home to the north she said moving home barbara repeated then what of the forwarding address shed left with her landlady in islington she wondered an address in fulham was hardly north of anything save the river thats what she told me reeve said i take it she told others something else he offered them an exasperated smile well to be honest that doesnt surprise me i discovered that nicola sometimes played a bit fast and loose with her facts it wasnt one of her finer qualities had she not quit i probably would have let her go eventually i had my he pressed his fingertips together i had my doubts about her ability to be discreet and discretion is critical in this line of work we represent some very prominent players and as we have access to all their financial data they have to be able to depend on our ability to be circumspect with our information the maiden girl wasnt nkata asked i dont want to say that reeve said hastily nicola was quick and bright no mistake about that but there was something about her that needed watching so i watched she had an excellent hand with our clients which was certainly to her credit but she had a tendency to be a bit well perhaps overawed is the best way to put it she was rather overawed by the value of some of their portfolios and its never a good idea to make howmuchsirsomebodyisworth the topic of lunchtime conversation with your pals was there any client with whom she may have had a special hand barbara asked one that extended after business hours reeves eyes narrowed what do you mean nkata took the ball the girl had a lover here in town mr reeve were looking for him i dont know anything about a lover but if nicola had one youll more likely find him at the college of law weve been told that she left the college of law to work fulltime for you reeve looked affronted i hope youre not suggesting that nicola maiden and i well she was a finelooking woman as is my own wife im wondering if your wife had anything to do with why she left its odd you ask me the maiden girl leaves law college to work for you fulltime but she leaves you practically the same week why dyou think she did that i told you she said she was moving home to derbyshire where she went to work for a bloke who tells us she had a man in london right so what im wondering is whether that london mans you barbara shot nkata an admiring glance she liked that he was willing to cut to the chase i happen to be in love with my wife reeve said deliberately tricia and i have been together for twenty years and if you think id jeopardise everything we have for a onetime romp with a college girl then youre wrong theres nothing to suggest it was a oneoff barbara said oneoff or every night of the week reeve countered i wasnt interested in a liaison with nicola maiden he seemed to stiffen as his thoughts suddenly took another direction he drew in a shallow breath and reached for a silver letter opener that sat in the middle of his desk he said has someone told you otherwise has my good name been slandered by someone i insist on knowing because if thats the case ill be talking to my solicitor he was definitely an american barbara thought wearily she said do you know a bloke called terry cole mr reeve terry cole cole i see as he spoke reeve reached for a pen and a pad of paper and scrawled the name so hes the little bastard whos said that terry coles dead nkata cut in he didnt say anything he died with the maiden girl in derbyshire you know him ive never heard of him when i asked whod told you look here nicolas dead and im sorry shes dead but i havent seen her since the end of april i havent talked to her since the end of april and if someone out there is besmirching my good name i mean to take whatever steps are necessary to rout the bastard out and make him pay is that your usual reaction when youre crossed barbara asked reeve set down his pen this interviews over mr reeve please leave youve had my time and ive told you what i know if you think im going to play police patsy and sit here while you attempt to lead me down the garden path towards some sort of selfincrimination he pointed at them both he had barbara saw inordinately small hands his knuckles crosshatched with myriad scars you guys need to be less obvious he said now get out of here pronto there was nothing for it but to accede to his request good expatriate yank that he was his next move surely was going to be to ring up his solicitor and claim harassment there was no point pushing anything further nice work winston barbara said when her colleague had unlocked the bentley and theyd climbed inside you put him on the ropes quick and proper no sense in wasting our time he examined the building i wonder if theres a real children in need do going on at the dorchester today there must be something going on somewhere she was dressed up to the nines wasnt she nkata looked at barbara his glance traveled over her clothes sorrowfully with all respect barb she laughed all right what do i know about the nines anyway he chuckled and started the car pulling away from the pavement he said seat belt barb barbara said oh right and turned in her seat to reach for it which was when she saw tricia reeve the assistant director of mkr had taken herself nowhere near the dorchester as things turned out she was skulking round the side of the building hastening up the front steps and heading straight for the door chapter the moment the cops were out of his office martin reeve pressed the call button that was recessed into one of the shelves on which his collection of henley photos were arranged just as the phony college diplomas were part of the martin reeve story the henley photos were a vital piece of the martin and tricia reeve romance it was part of their manufactured history that theyd first met at the regatta hed been telling the apocryphal tale of their introduction for so long that hed begun to believe it himself his call was answered in less than five seconds a record jaz burns entered the room without knocking a real cow she was he said with a smirk fancy shagging her marty youd not soon forget it from his lair at the back of the house it was jazs habit to play peeping tom with the surveillance equipment in martins office he had an annoying tendency to voyeurism which martin was willing to overlook in the cause of employing his other talents follow them martin said the cops theres a turnaround for you whats up later get on it now jaz was astute at reading nuances he jerked his head in a nod snatched up the keys to the jaguar and slipped soundlessly from the room on catburglar feet the door hadnt been closed behind him for more than fifteen seconds however when it opened again martin swung round in agitation saying god damn it jaz and ready to berate his employee for whatever dawdling had caused him to lose the cops trail before theyd even begun to lay it but tricia not the spritelike burns stood there and the expression on her face told martin that a scene was coming fuck it he wanted to say not now at the moment he didnt have the resources to soothe tricia through an attack of the shrills what are you doing here tricia youre supposed to be at the tea i couldnt she shut the door behind her what do you mean you couldnt youre expected this has been set up for months i pulled a dozen strings to get you on that committee and if youre on the committee youre supposed to turn up youve got the god damn list patricia howre those women supposed to carry on this eventand by the way how are we supposed to maintain our good nameif you cant be relied upon to show up on time with a seating plan in your possession what did you tell them about nicola he blew out a breath on the word shit is that why youre here am i clear on that youve failed in your part to show open support for one of the worthiest causes in the uk because you want to know what i told the cops about a fucking dead bitch i dont like that language which part fucking dead or bitch lets get it straight because right at this moment there are five hundred women and photographers from every publication in the country waiting for you to appear and god knows you wont be able to manage it if we arent clear on which part of my language bothers you what did you tell them i told them the truth he was so irritated that he could almost enjoy the expression of horror that crossed her face what when she asked the question was hoarse nicola maiden was a trainee financial advisor she quit last april if she hadnt quit i would have fired her tricia relaxed noticeably martin went on he vastly preferred his wife on edge id love to know where the little bitch took herself off to from here and with any luck ill have that information from jaz within the hour cops are nothing if not predictable if she had a place in londonand my money says she hadthen the copsre going to lead us straight to it the tension was gratifyingly back in an instant why dyou want to know whatre you going to do i dont like disrespect patricia you of all people ought to know that i dont like to be lied to trust is the bedrock of any relationship and if i dont do something when someone screws me over then its open season for everyone to take martin reeve for all that hes worth well i wont allow that you had her didnt you tricias face was pinched dont be an idiot you think i cant tell you say to yourself dear trishs doped up to her eyeballs half the time what could she possibly notice but i do i saw how you looked at her i knew when it happened martin sighed you need a hit sorry to put it so crudely my dear i know youd prefer to avoid the topic but the truth of the matter is that you always get weird in the head when youre coming down too fast you need another hit i know what youre like her voice was rising and he wondered idly if he could manage the needle without her cooperation but how the hell much was she shooting up these days anyway even if he could cope with the needle and the syringe the last thing he needed was his wife carted off in a coma i know how you like to be the boss martin and what better way is there to prove youre in charge than to tell some college girl to drop her knickers and then watch how fast shes willing to do it tricia this is such awesome bullshit are you listening to yourself so you had her and then she walked away poof she was gone vanished tricia snapped her fingers rather weakly martin noticed and that felt nasty didnt it and we know how you react when something feels nasty speaking of which martin itched to strike her he would have done so had he not been certain that doped up or not shed run straight home to daddy in an instant with the tale daddy would make certain demands if she did that detox first divorce after that neither of which was acceptable to martin marriage into wealthno matter that the money came from a successful antiques business and hadnt been passed down through successive generations in best blueblood fashionhad garnered for him a degree of social acceptance that hed never have acquired as a mere immigrant to the country no matter how successful in business he might be he had no intention of giving that social acceptance up we can have this discussion later he said with a glance at his pocket watch for now you still have time to get to the tea without thoroughly humiliating yourself or me say it was the traffic a pedestrian hit by a taxi in notting hill gate you stopped to hold his handno make it a woman and a childtill the ambulance arrived a hole in your stocking would support the story by the way dont dismiss me like some mindless tart then stop acting like one he shot the retort back without thinking and immediately regretted it what possible purpose could be served by escalating an idiotic discussion into a fully blown row look sweetheart he said aiming for conciliation lets stop the bickering were letting ourselves get thrown by a simple routine visit from the cops as far as nicola maiden goes we havent done it in months martin he went steadily on its unfortunate that shes dead its unfortunate that she was murdered but as we werent involved in what happened to her we havent fucked since june her voice rose are you listening to me are you hearing what im saying im doing both he replied and if you werent blitzed most hours of the day youd find your memory improving that at least and thank god stopped her she after all had no more wish than he had to end their marriage he served a purpose in her life that was as necessary to her as the purpose she served was necessary to him he kept her supply lines open and her secret safe she increased his mobility and garnered from his fellows the sort of deference one man shows another when that other has possession of a beautiful woman thus she very much wanted to believe and in martins experience when people desperately wanted to believe they talked themselves into believing just about anything in this case however tricias belief wasnt far from the truth he did indeed do her when she was tripped out she just didnt know he preferred it that way she said in a smaller voice oh and she blinked yes he said oh all through june july and august last night as well she swallowed last night he smiled she was his he went to her lets not let the cops wreck what we have trish theyre after a killer theyre not after us he touched her lips with the battleweary knuckles of his right hand left hand on her buttocks he drew her near now isnt that right isnt it true that what the police are looking for they wont find here ive got to get off the stuff she whispered he urged her down for a kiss one thing at a time he said in his room at the black angel hotel lynley discarded his suit and tie in favour of jeans hiking boots and the old waxed jacket that he generally wore in cornwall an ancient possession of his longdead father he kept glancing at the telephone as he dressed alternately willing it to ring and willing himself to make the call from this end there had been no message from helen hed excused her silence that morning as a result of her late night with deborah st james and her probable subsequent liein but he was having difficulty excusing a silence that had apparently continued well into midafternoon hed even phoned down to reception asking that they doublecheck on his messages but an extended foray into pigeon holes and rubbish baskets hadnt produced anything different from what hed had at the beginning his wife hadnt phoned nor had anyone else for that matter but silence from the rest of the world didnt concern him silence from helen did in the way of people who believe theyre in the right he replayed their conversation of the previous morning he checked it for subtext and nuance but no matter how he examined it he came out on top the fact was simplicity itself his wife had been interfering in his professional life and she owed him an apology she had no business secondguessing decisions that he made as part of his work any more than he had a place instructing her how and when she could assist st james in his lab in the personal arena they each had a vested interest in knowing the others hopes resolutions and desires in the world of their individual occupations they owed each other kindness consideration and support that his wifeas was clearly indicated by her undeniably perverse refusal to phone himdidnt wish to adhere to this basic and reasonable manner of coexisting was a source of disillusionment to him hed known helen for sixteen years how could he have gone such a time without actually knowing her at all he checked his watch he looked out of the window and made note of the suns position in the sky there were several good hours of daylight left so he had no need to rush off right at the moment knowing this and knowing what he could well do because of this he procrastinated by checking to make sure he had a compass a torch and an ordnance survey map tucked into the various pockets of his jacket then without further employment available he heaved a sigh of defeat he walked to the phone and punched in his home number might as well leave her a message if shes gone out he thought one can make a point with ones mate for only a limited period he expected denton or the answerphone what he didnt expectbecause if she was at home why the devil wasnt she phoning himwas to hear his wifes soft voice on the other end of the line she said hello twice in the background he could hear music playing it was one of his new prokofiev cds shed taken the call in the drawing room he wanted to say hello darling we parted badly and im longing to make it up with you but instead he wondered how the hell she could sit there in london blissfully enjoying his music while they were at odds and they were at odds werent they hadnt he just spent most of his working day successfully avoiding an obsessive contemplation of their disagreement of everything that had led up to it of what it indicated about the past of what it presaged for the future of what it might lead them to if one of them didnt wake up and realise thathelen said this is very rude whoever you are and rang off which left lynley holding a dead receiver and feeling very foolish ringing her back at the moment would make him feel even more foolish he concluded so that was that he replaced the receiver removed the keys to the police car from his suit coat and left the room he drove northeast cruising along the road that carved a gully between the limestone slopes upon which tideswell was built the land formed a natural siphon here the wind gusted through it like a gushing river whipping tree limbs and flipping leaves upside down in an unspoken promise of the seasons first rain at the junction a handful of honeycoloured buildings marked the hamlet of lane head here lynley veered to the west where the road made a straight charcoal incision into the moor and drystone walls prevented the accretion of heather bilberry and ferns from reclaiming the road and returning it to the land it was a wild country once lynley left the last of the hamlets behind the only signs of lifeaside from the vegetation which was profusewere the jackdaws and magpies and the occasional sheep that stood serene and cloudlike grazing among the pink and the green stiles provided access to the moor and signposts marked the routes of public footpaths that had been used for centuries by farmers or shepherds traveling between the farflung hamlets hiking and biking trails were a more recent addition to the landscape however and these carved through the heather and disappeared towards distant lichengrey outcrops that formed the remains of prehistoric settlements ancient places of worship and roman forts lynley found the spot a few miles northeast of the tiny hamlet of sparrowpit where nicola maiden had left her saab upon setting off into the moor there a long and knobby border of wall was interrupted by a white iron gate its thick skin of crusty paint eaten through in spots by blemishes of rust when he arrived lynley did what nicola maiden herself had done he opened the gate pulled into a narrow paved lane within and parked behind the stone wall on a patch of earth he consulted the map before getting out of the car opening it against the passenger seat and fixing his reading glasses on his nose he studied the route he would need to take to get out to nine sisters henge making note of landmarks that would be useful in guiding him on his way hanken had offered him a detective constable as a guide but hed refused he wouldnt have minded an experienced hiker as an escort but he preferred not to be accompanied by a member of the buxton police who could possibly take offenceand report such offence to hankenwhen lynley scrutinised the crime scene with an attention suggesting that the local cid hadnt done its job its a last possibility for that blasted pager and id like to eliminate it lynley had told hanken if it had been there my boys would have found it hanken had replied reminding him that theyd done a fingertip search for the weapon which certainly would have turned up a pager even if it hadnt dislodged a knife from the site but if it puts your mind at rest to do it then put your mind at rest and do it as for himself he was off after upman champing at the bit to confront the solicitor feeling sure of his route lynley folded the map and returned his glasses to their case he put map and glasses in his jacket pockets and climbed out into the wind he set out southeast with the collar of his jacket turned up and his shoulders hunched against the gusts that were blowing against him the stretch of paved lane led in the direction he wanted so he started out on it but after less than a hundred yards it ended in a crumble of aggregate boulders comprising mostly gravel and tar from there the going became rougher an uneven trail of earth and stones creased by watercourses that were skeletally dry from a summer without rain the walk took him nearly an hour and he made it in utter solitude his route followed stony paths that intersected with other stonier paths he brushed through heather gorse and fern he climbed limestone outcrops he passed the remains of chambered cairns he was just coming upon an unexpected fork in the trail when he saw a lone hiker walking his way from the southeast as he was fairly certain that this was the direction of nine sisters henge lynley remained where he was waiting to see who had made this lateafternoon visit to the scene of the crime as far as he knew hanken still had the stone circle taped off and guarded so if the hiker was a journalist or press photographer he would have found little joy in taking an extended walk across the moor it wasnt a man as things turned out nor was it either a journalist or a photographer instead as the figure approached lynley saw that samantha mccallin had for some reason decided to treat herself to an afternoon hike out to nine sisters henge apparently she recognised him at the same instant that he realised her identity because her gait changed its rhythm shed been marching along with a whip tail of birch in her hand flicking it against the heather as she stepped along the path but seeing lynley she chucked the whip tail to one side squared her shoulders and came straight at him its a public place she said at once you can tape off the circle and post guards out there but you cant keep people off the rest of the moor youre some miles from broughton manor miss mccallin dont killers return to the scenes of their crimes im merely living the part would you like to arrest me id like you to explain what youre doing here she looked over her shoulder in the direction from which shed come he thinks i killed her isnt that rich i speak out in defence of him this morning and by afternoon hes decided i did it its an odd way to say thanks for taking my part sam but there you have it it could have been the wind of course but it looked to lynley as if shed been crying he said so what are you doing here miss mccallin you must know that your presence i wanted to see the place where his fantasy died the wind had loosened hair from her plait and wispy tendrils of it blew round her face hed say of course that his fantasy died on monday night when he asked her to marry him but i dont think so i think as long as nicola walked the earth my cousin julian would have held on to his obsession of having a life with her waiting for her to change her mind waiting for her toas he would sayreally see him and the funny thing is if shed crooked her finger at him just the right wayor even the wrong way for that matterhe wouldve interpreted it as the sign he was waiting for proving to him that she loved him in spite of everything she said and did to the contrary you disliked her didnt you lynley asked she gave a short laugh what difference does it make she was going to get what she wanted no matter how i felt about her what she got was death and she cant have wanted that she would have destroyed him she would have sucked out his marrow she was that sort of woman was she samanthas eyes narrowed as a gust of wind spat chalky bits of earth into the air im glad shes dead i wont lie about that but youre making a mistake if you think that im the only person whod dance on her grave given half the chance who else is there she smiled i dont intend to do your job for you that said she stepped past him and walked off down the path taking the direction he himself had traveled from the northern boundary of the moor he wondered how she had come to be on the moor at all as hed seen no cars parked on the verge when hed turned off the road he also wondered if she parked elsewhere either out of ignorance of the presence of the hardpacked little plot of land behind the drystone wall or to hide her knowledge of the plots existence he watched her but she didnt turn back to see if he was doing so she must have wanted toit was human natureand the fact that she didnt spoke worlds about her selfdiscipline he himself walked on he recognised nine sisters henge by the separate stonethe king stone hed been toldthat marked its location within a thick copse of birches he came at the monument from the opposite side however and didnt realise that he was actually upon it till he circled the copse took a compass reading just beyond it reckoned that the stone circle had to be nearby and turned back to see the pockmarked monolith rising beside a narrow path into the trees he retraced his steps hands shoved into his pockets he found di hankens posted guard a few yards from the site and he admitted lynley to it allowing him to duck beneath the crime scene tape and approach the sentry stone alone lynley paused by this and examined it it was weatherworn as one would expect but it was manworn as well at some time in the past indentations had been carved into the back side of the enormous column they formed handholds and footholds so that a climber could ascend to the top to what use had the stone been put in ancient times lynley wondered as a means of calling a community to assemble as a lookout post for someone responsible for the safety of shamans performing rituals within the stone circle as the reredos of an altar for sacrifice it was impossible to say he slapped his hand against it and went under the trees where the first thing he noticed was that the birchesgrowing so thickly togetheracted as a natural windbreak when he finally made his way into the prehistoric circle not a breath of air was stirring his first thought was that it was nothing like stonehenge which was when he realised how firmly the word henge was rooted in his mind with a particular image there were standing stonesnine of them as the place name suggestedbut these were far more roughly hewn than hed expected there were no lintel stones as there were at stonehenge and the external bank and the internal ditch that enclosed the standing stones were far less distinct he entered the circle it was quiet as death while the trees prevented the wind from reaching into the circle the stones appeared to prevent the sound of the leaves being rustled from reaching into the circle either it wouldnt be difficult for someone at night to come upon the monument unheard then heor she or theywould merely have had to know where nine sisters henge was or to follow a hiker there from a distance in daylight and wait for nightfall which in itself would not have been difficult the moor was vast but it was also open on a clear day one could see for miles the circles interior consisted of dying moor grass beaten lateral by a summer of visitors to the site a flat slice of rock at the base of the northernmost standing stone and the remains of half a dozen old fires built by campers and worshippers starting at the circles perimeter lynley began a systematic search for nicola maidens pager it was a tedious activity involving an inchbyinch scrutiny of the bank the ditch the base of each stone the moor grass and the fire rings when hed completed his inspection of the site without finding a thing and knew hed next have to trace nicolas route to the location of her death he paused to pick out the path of her flight in doing so he found his gaze drawn to the central fire ring he saw that the ring was distinguished from the rest in three ways it was fresherwith hunks of charred wood not yet disintegrated into ashes and lumps it bore the unmistakable marks of having been sifted through by the scenes of crime team and the stones that encircled it had been disturbed roughly as if someone had stamped on the fire to put it out and dislodged the barrier in the process but seeing these stones brought to lynleys mind the photographs of the dead terry cole and the burns that charred one side of the young mans face he went to squat by the fire remains and he thought for the first time about that face and what was indicated by its burnt skin he realised that the extent of the burning suggested that the boy had had a fairly lengthy contact with the fire but he hadnt been held down into the flames because if he had been there would have been defensive wounds on his body as he struggled to free himself from someones grasp and according to dr myles there had been no such wounds on terry cole no bruising or scratching of his hands or knuckles no distinctive abrasions on his torso and yet lynley thought hed been exposed to the fire long enough to be severely burnt indeed to have his skin blackened there seemed to be only one reasonable answer cole must have fallen into the fire but how lynley rested on his haunches and let his gaze wander round the circle he saw that a second narrower path led out of the thicketopposite the path hed come in onand from his position by the fire ring that path was in a direct line with his vision this then had to be nicolas route he pictured the young people on tuesday night sitting side by side at the fire two killers wait outside the stone circle unheard and unseen they bide their time when the moment is right they charge towards the fire each of them taking one of the two and making short work of them it was plausible lynley decided but if that was what happened he couldnt see why short work hadnt been made of nicola maiden indeed he couldnt see how the young woman had managed to get one hundred and fifty yards from her killer before she was even attacked while it was true that she could have fled the circle and taken off on the second path that he himself could see cutting through the trees with the advantage of surprise on the killers part how had she managed to elude capture for such a distance she was an experienced hiker of course but what did experience really count for in darkness with someone in a panic and running for her life and even if she wasnt in a panic how could her reflexes have been so good or her understanding of what was happening so acute surely it would have taken her at least five seconds to realise that harm was intended her and that delay would have been her undoing right then within the circle and not one hundred and fifty yards away lynley frowned he kept seeing the photograph of the boy those burns were important a critical point those burns he knew told the real tale he reached for a stickpart of the kindling of the fireand aimlessly shoved it into the ashes as he thought nearby he spotted the first of the dried splatters of blood that had come from terry coles wounds beyond those splatters the dry moor grass was gouged and torn up in a zigzagging path that led to one of the standing stones slowly lynley followed this path it was speckled with blood for the entire distance there were no great gobs of gore though and not the sort of blood evidence one would expect from someone bleeding to death from an arterial wound in fact as he moved along it lynley realised that the trail did not offer the sort of blood evidence one would expect to find from the multiple stab wounds that terry cole had had inflicted upon him at the base of the standing stone however lynley saw that the blood had pooled indeed it had splashed onto the stone itself leaving tiny rivulets from a height of three feet dribbling down to the ground below lynley paused here his gaze moved from the fire ring to the beaten path in his mind he saw the picture of the boy that the police photographer had taken his flesh eaten black by the flames he considered all of it point by point blood by the fire in daubs and splatters blood by the standing stone in pools blood in rivulets from a height of three feet a girl running off into the night a chunk of limestone bashing in her skull lynley narrowed his eyes and drew a slow breath of course he thought why hadnt he seen from the first what had happened the address theyd been given in fulham took barbara havers and winston nkata to a maisonette in rostrevor road they expected to have to deal with a landlady custodian or concierge in order to gain access to nicola maidens rooms but when they went through the pro forma business of ringing the bell next to the number five they were surprised to hear a womans voice on the speaker asking them to identify themselves there was a pause once nkata made it clear that scotland yard had come calling after a moment the disembodied voice said ill be down shortly in the cultured accent of a woman who spent her free time reading for parts in costume dramas on the bbc barbara expected her to appear in full jane austen regalia done up in a slender regency dress with ringlets round her face some five minutes laterwheres she coming from exactly nkata wanted to know with a glance at his watch southendonseathe door opened and a twelveyearold in a vintage mary quant minidress stood before them vi nevin the child said by way of introduction sorry id just got out of the bath and had to pull on some clothes may i see your identification please the voice was the same as the womans on the speaker and coming from the pixielike creature in the doorway it was quite disconcerting as if a female ventriloquist were lurking somewhere nearby throwing her voice into a preadolescent child for a bit of a lark barbara caught herself sneaking a glimpse round the door jamb to see if someone was hiding there the expression on vi nevins face said that she was used to such a reaction after looking over their warrant cards to her satisfaction she handed them back and said right what can i do for you and when they told her that her rooms had been given as a forwarding address for the post when a student from the college of law had moved house from islington she said theres nothing illegal in that is there it sounds the responsible thing to do did she know nicola maiden then nkata asked her i dont make a habit of taking up lodgings with strangers was her reply and then glancing from nkata to barbara but nikki isnt here she hasnt been for weeks shes up in derbyshire till next wednesday evening barbara saw that nkata was reluctant to do the dubious honours of announcing death to the unsuspecting yet another time she decided to show mercy upon him saying is there a place we can talk privately vi nevin heard something beyond the simple question as her eyes indicated why have you a warrant or a decree or something i know my rights barbara sighed inwardly what damage the last few revelations of police malfeasance had done to public trust she said im sure you do but were not here to conduct a search wed like to talk to you about nicola maiden why where is she whats she done may we come in if you tell me what you want barbara exchanged a glance with nkata oh well her look told him there was nothing for it but to give the young woman the nasty news on her own front step shes dead barbara informed her she died in the peak district three nights ago now may we come in or should we keep talking out here in the street vi nevin looked completely uncomprehending dead she repeated nikkis dead but she cant be i spoke to her on tuesday morning she was going hiking she isnt dead she cant be she searched their faces as if looking for evidence of a joke or a lie apparently not finding it she stood back from the door she said please come in in a hushed and altered voice she led them up a flight of stairs to a door that stood gaping on the first floor this gave into an lshaped living room where french windows opened onto a balcony below it water played in a garden fountain and a hornbeam threw lateafternoon shadows on a pattern of flagstones at one side of the room a sleek chrome and glass trolley held at least a dozen bottles of spirits vi nevin chose an unsealed glenlivet and she poured herself three fingers in a tumbler she took it neat and any lingering doubts that barbara had had about her age were put to rest when she tackled the whisky while the young woman gathered herself together barbara took stock of the living situation what she could see of it on the first floor of the maisonette were the living room the kitchen and a loo the bedrooms would be above them accessed via a staircase that rose along one wall from where she was standing just inside the front door she could see to the top of the stairs as well as into the kitchen this was fitted out with a surfeit of mod cons refrigerator with ice maker microwave oven espresso machine gleaming copperbottomed pots and pans the work tops were granite and the cupboards and the floor were bleached oak nice barbara thought she wondered who was paying for it all she glanced at nkata he was taking in the low buttercoloured sofas with their profusion of green and gold cushions tumbling across them his gaze went from there to the luxurious ferns by the window to the large abstract oil above the fireplace it was a bloody far cry from loughborough estate his expression said he looked barbaras way she mouthed ladeedah he grinned having downed her drink vi nevin appeared to do nothing more than slowly breathe finally she turned to them she smoothed back her hairthis was blonde and breastlengthand she fixed it in place with a hair band that made her look like alice in wonderland she said im sorry no one phoned ive not had the television on i had no idea i talked to her only tuesday morning and for gods sake what happened they gave her two pieces of information her skull had been fractured her death hadnt been an accident vi nevin said nothing a tremor passed through her nicola was murdered barbara finally said when vi requested no details someone beat in her skull with a boulder the fingers of vis right hand closed tightly on the hem of her minidress she said sit down and motioned them to the sofas she herself sat rigidly on the edge of a deep armchair opposite knees and ankles together like a welltrained schoolgirl still she didnt ask any questions she was clearly stunned by the information but she was equally clearly waiting what for barbara wanted to know what was going on were working the london end of the case she told vi our colleaguedi lynleyis in derbyshire the london end vi murmured there was a bloke found dead with the maiden girl nkata removed the leather notebook from his jacket and twirled a bit of lead from his propelling pencil names terry cole hes got digs in battersea you acquainted with him terry cole vi shook her head no i dont know him an artist a sculptor hes got a studio in some railway arches in portslade road he shares that and a flat with a girl called cilia thompson barbara said cilia thompson she echoed and shook her head again did nicola ever mention either of them terry cole cilia thompson nkata asked terry or cilia no she said barbara wanted to point out that there was no narcissus present so she could abjure her role in the mythical drama but she thought the allusion might fall on unappreciative ears she said miss nevin nicola maidens skull was smashed in this might not break your heart but if you could cooperate with us please she said as if she couldnt bear to hear the news again i havent seen nikki since the beginning of june she went north to work for the summer and she was due back in town next wednesday like i said to do what barbara asked what to do what when she got back into town vi gave no answer she looked at both of them as if searching the waters for hidden piranhas to work to take up a life of leisure to what barbara asked if she was coming back here she must have intended to do something with her time as her flatmate i expect youd know what that was she had intelligent eyes barbara saw they were grey with black lashes they studied and assessed while her brain doubtless weighed every possible consequence to every answer vi nevin knew something about what had happened to nicola that was a certainty if shed learned nothing else from working with lynley for nearly four years barbara had learned that there were times to play hardball and times to give hardball produced the intimidation card giving offered an exchange of information having nothing to use as intimidation with the other woman the interview was beginning to look like a time to give barbara said we know she dropped out of law college round the first of may telling them shed taken a fulltime job with mkr financial management but mr reevethats her guvinformed us that she left the company just before that telling him she was moving home to derbyshire yet when she moved house she gave this addressnot a derbyshire addressto her landlady in islington and from what weve been able to gather no one in derbyshire had an inkling that she was up there for anything more than a summers visit what does this suggest to you miss nevin confusion vi said she hadnt yet made up her mind about her life nikki liked to keep her options open leaving college quitting her job telling tales unsupported by the facts her options werent open they were manufactured everyone weve talked to has a different idea of what she intended to do with herself i cant explain it im sorry i dont know what you want me to say did she have a job lined up nkata looked up from his notebook i dont know did she have a source of income lined up barbara asked i dont know that either she paid her share of the expenses here before she left for the summer and whyd she leave and as it was in cash vi plunged on i had no reason to question her source of income really im sorry but thats all i can tell you fat chance barbara thought she was lying through her pretty babysized white teeth how did you come to know each other are you at the college of law yourself we met through work mkr financial and when vi nodded what dyou do for them nothing any longer i left in april as well what she had done she told them was work as tricia reeves personal assistant i didnt much care for her she said shes a bit peculiar i handed in my notice in march and left once they found a replacement for me and now barbara asked now what dyou do now nkata clarified where dyou work shed taken up modeling she told them it had long been her dream and nikki had encouraged her to go for it she produced a portfolio of professional photographs which depicted her in a variety of guises in most of the pictures she looked like a waif thin and largeeyed with the sort of vacant expression that was currently de rigueur in fashion magazines barbara nodded at the photos aiming for appreciation but inwardly wondering for a fleeting moment when rubenesque figuressuch as her own franklywould ever be in vogue you must be doing well a place like this i dont expect it comes cheap does it is it your own by the way this maisonette its rented vi gathered up her pictures she tapped them together and replaced them in their portfolio from who nkata asked the question without looking up from his meticulous notetaking does it matter from whom tell us and well make up our minds barbara said from douglas and gordon mates of yours its an estate agency barbara watched as vi replaced the portfolio on a shelf beneath the television she waited till the young woman had turned back to them before she went on mr reeve told us that nicola maiden had a problem with the truth and a bigger problem keeping her mouth shut about his clients finances he said he was going to sack her when she left thats not true vi remained standing arms folded beneath diminutive breasts if he was going to sack her which he wasnt it wouldve been because of his wife why jealousy tricia wants to eliminate every woman he looks at and he looked at nicola i didnt say that listen we know she had a lover barbara said we know hes in london could that have been mr reeve tricia doesnt give him ten minutes out of her sight but its possible no nikki was seeing someone its true but not here there in derbyshire vi went into the kitchen and returned with a handful of picture postcards they depicted various sites in the peak district arbor low peveril castle thors cave the stepping stones in dovedale chatsworth house magpie mine little johns grave nine sisters henge each was addressed to vi nevin and each bore an identical message ooohlaaa this was followed by the initial n that was all barbara handed the postcards over to nkata she said to vi okay ill bite clue me in on the meaning behind these those are the places she had sex with him every time they did it in a new location she bought a postcard and sent it along to me as a joke a real scream barbara agreed whos the bloke she never said but i expect hes married why because aside from the postcards she never once mentioned him when we talked on the phone thats how id expect her to act if she had a relationship that wasnt on the up and up made a habit of that did she nkata set the cards on the coffee table and made a note in his book she did other married blokes i didnt say that just that i think this one was married and he wasnt in london but someone was barbara thought someone had to be if nicola maiden had intended a return to town at the end of the summer she would have been coming with some means of supporting herself once she got here with this ultramodern recently redecorated plush posh and pleasant maisonette having try sting place written all over it how unreasonable was it to assume that a punter deep in dosh had set her up in style to be at his disposal day and night that begged the question of what the hell vi nevin was doing there but perhaps that had been part of the deal a flatmate with whom the mistress could while away the boring hours while waiting for her lord and master to appear it was a stretch but no more than that which was needed to accommodate the vision of nicola maiden as sir richard burton hiking across the moors to discover new and exciting bonking locations to share with a married lover what the hell am i doing in police work barbara wondered acerbically when the rest of the world is having so much fun theyd like to have a look at nicola maidens room and belongings she told vi nevin somewhere there was going to be concrete evidence that nicola was up to something and she was determined to find it chapter he squirmed the flaming bastard bloody well squirmed di peter hanken leaned back in his chair and savoured the moment arms locked behind his head a lit cigarette dangled from his mouth and he talked round it with the expertise of a man long practised in the art lynley stood at a set of filing cabinets spreading out on their tops the photographs of both dead bodies he studied these while doing his best to keep clear of hankens tobacco smoke a former victim of the weed himself he found cause for celebration in the fact that he experienced the smoke as an irritant at long last when months before he would have queued just to lick hankens ashtray not that the other di was using the ashtray when the burnt tobacco needed dislodging he merely turned his head and let the ashes fall to the floor it was a gesture out of character in the otherwise compulsively neat di it spoke of the level of his excitement hanken was recounting his interview with will upman the gusto with which he told the tale was growing as he reached its climax metaphorically speaking it seemed because according to hanken the solicitor apparently hadnt been able to perform to his usual standards but he said popping his cork doesnt matter to him when hes with a woman hanken scoffed said what matters is the fun of it all im intrigued lynley said how did you manage to get that admission from him that he shagged her or that he didnt go the distance once he had her on the skewer either both lynley selected the clearest picture of terry coles face and set it next to the clearest of the wounds on his body i trust you didnt use thumbscrews peter hanken laughed didnt have to i just told him what his neighbours had reported and he sent the white flag straight up the pole why had he lied claims he hadnt claims he would have told us straight out if wed asked straight out thats splitting hairs lawyers the single word said it all will upman hanken had reported concisely confessed to a single fling with nicola maiden and that fling had occurred on her last night in his employ hed felt a strong attraction to her for the entire summer but his position as her employer had prevented him from making a move being involved elsewhere didnt prevent him lynley clarified not at all because how could he be truly madly and deeply in love with joyceand consequently legitimately involved with herwhen he felt so wildly attracted to nicola and if he was wildly attracted to nicola didnt he owe it to himself to see what that attraction was all about joyce had been pressing him for a commitmentshed had her mind set on their living togetherbut he couldnt take the next step with her until he cleared his head about nicola may i assume he dashed off straightaway and proposed to joyce once his head was cleared with regard to the maiden girl lynley asked hanken guffawed appreciatively upman had oiled the wheels with drinks dinner and wine the di reported he took her to his home more drinks there some music several cappuccinos he had candles set up round his bathtublord lynley shuddered the man was a victim of hollywood cinema and he got her undressed and in the water without any trouble her wanting it as bad as he did according to upman hanken said they played in the tub till they looked like prunes at which point they adjourned to the bedroom which is where hanken concluded the rocket didnt launch and on the night of the murder where was he you mean hanken recounted that as well at lunch on tuesday upman had had another setto with the girlfriend on the topic of cohabitation rather than go home after work and run the risk of a phone call from her he went for a drive he ended up at manchester airport where he checked into a hotel for the night and had a massage therapist come to his room to relieve him of his tension even had the receipts to wave in front of me hanken said seems he intends to claim it as a business expense youre checking it out i plan to as i breathe hanken said your end of things this was where he had to tread carefully lynley thought so far despite his encounter with upman hanken hadnt appeared to be wedded irrevocably to any particular scenario still what he was about to suggest was a contravention of the dis main conjecture he wanted to lead into it carefully so that his colleague might be open to its logic he hadnt found the pager he said but hed had a rather long look round the site and an even longer think about the two bodies he wanted to propose an altogether different hypothesis to the one theyd been working with would hanken hear him out the di lowered his chair and smashed out his cigarette mercifully he didnt light another he ran his tongue over his teeth eyes speculatively fixed on lynley he finally said lets have it and settled back as if expecting a lengthy monologue i think weve got one killer lynley said and no accomplice no phone call for reinforcements when our man or woman or are you giving that up as well or woman lynley replied and he used the opportunity to inform hanken of his encounter with samantha mccallin on calder moor the other di said that puts her back in the running id say she was never out of it okay go on no call for reinforcements when the killer saw there were two targets instead of one hanken folded his hands over his stomach and said continue lynley used the photograph of terry cole as he did so burns on the face but no defensive wounds on the body lynley said indicated that cole hadnt been held in the fire but rather that he had fallen into it the damage to his skin indicated that contact with the flames had been more than brief there was no contusion to the head to suggest that hed been clubbed knocked unconscious and left in the fire so he had to have been wounded or disabled in some way as he sat by the fire in the first place one killer lynley said goes out there after the girl when he arrives at the site or she hanken cut in yes or she when he or she arrives at the site its to find that nicola isnt alone so cole has to be eliminated first because hes capable of protecting her should the killer go after her and second because hes a potential witness but the killer faces a dilemma does heor she yes i see that peterkill cole at once and run the risk of losing nicola if she escapes while hes dispatching cole or does he kill nicola and run the risk of being thwarted by cole he has surprise on his side but thats all he has aside from his weapon lynley sorted through the photographs and pulled out one that showed the trail of blood most clearly if you consider all that and take into account the deposits of blood at the site hanken raised his hand to stop the words he moved his gaze from lynley to the window where the unappealing prospect of buxton football stadium across the street resembled a concentration camp he said thoughtfully the killer rushes forward with his knife and wounds the boy in an instant the boy topples into the fire where hes burned the girl takes to her heels the killer follows but his weapon is lodged in the boy hmm yes i see how it works hanken turned from the window eyes cloudy as he considered the scene he went on to describe its dark outside the ring of the fire the girls on the run so does he take the time to remove the knife from the boy or does he take off after the girl straightaway he goes after the girl he has to hasnt he he dispatches her with three blows to the head then returns to finish off the boy by which time coles managed to crawl from the fire to the edge of the stone circle and thats where the killer finishes him off the blood tells the tale peter dripping down the standing stone pooled on the ground if youre right hanken said weve got a killer covered in blood its night and in the middle of the back of beyond so he has an advantage there but eventually hes going to need something to hide his clothes unless he did the killing in the nude which isnt likely he may have brought something with him lynley said or taken something from the scene itself hanken slapped his hands against his thighs and got to his feet lets get the maidens to take a look at the girls belongings he said barbara fumed punched her fist into her palm and paced as winston nkata placed the call to lynley from inside the prince of wales pub they were across the street from battersea park and round the corner from terry coles domicile and while she wanted to grab the phone from nkatas hand and make a few points more forcefully than winston was making them she knew she had to hold her tongue nkata was relaying the source of her agitation to their superior officer and silence on her part was essential lest lynley realise that shed left her post at the computer ill get back to cris tonight she swore to nkata when she realised that his reluctance to trot from fulham to battersea was directly connected to his worries about her willingness to attend to her assigned duties winston on my mums life i tell you that ill sit at the screen till im blind okay but later later lets do battersea first nkata was relaying to lynley the results of their visits to nicolas former employer and to her current flatmate after reporting on the postcards that nicola had sent to vi nevin and explaining what vi had claimed their implicit message was he went on to dwell in particular upon the fact that nicolas bedroom in the fulham maisonette had apparently been seen to prior to his laying eyes upon it how many birds you know have nothing that says who they are sitting round nkata asked man i say this that bird vi kept us waiting on the steps before letting us in cause she was shoveling that bedroom clear of something once she heard there were rozzers at the door barbara winced and held her breath at the plural pronouns no fool lynley on his end of the line he jumped at once nkata said in reply with a glance at barbara what no figure of speech man yeah believe me i got that engraved on my soul he listened as lynley apparently relayed how things were playing out in his part of the world he laughed outright at a piece of information saying the fun of it lord i believe that like the world is flat and toyed with the steel tubing of the telephone cord after a few moments he said battersea right now barb said that coles flatmated be in for the evening so i thought to have a look through his traps landlady wouldnt let barb have a peek earlier and he stopped as lynley interrupted at some length barbara tried to read his expression for an indication of what the inspector was saying the black mans face was completely blank she whispered tersely what what nkata waved her off following up on those names you gave her he said far as i know at least you know barb oh thanks very much winston she whispered nkata turned his shoulder and gave her his back he went on to lynley saying barb said the flatmate says anythings possible the kid was flush with moneyalways had a wad of cashand he never sold a stick of his art which isnt hard to believe when you see it blackmails sounding nicer every minute again he listened and he finally said thats why i want to have a recce theres a connection somewhere has to be that they were on the trail of something significant had been spelled out to them in the complete lack of personal detail in nicola maidens fulham bedroom apart from a few articles of clothing and an innocuous line of seashells on the window sill there was nothing to suggest the room had ever been occupied by a real person barbara would have concluded that the fulham address was a front and that the maiden girl had never lived there at all had not the evidence of something having been removed betrayed vi nevins use of the time between their speaking to her from the street and her appearance at the front door of the building two drawers in the large chest were completely empty in the clothes cupboard a space on the hanging rail spoke of a few articles hastily deleted and on top of the chest bare spots devoid of dust indicated that something had stood there until recently barbara saw all of this but she didnt bother to request a look at vi nevins own bedroom for the missing items the young woman had been plain enough earlier that she knew her rights under the law and there was no point in pushing her to exercise them but it meant something that shed performed the expurgation and only a fool would walk away from the implications nkata rang off and recounted lynleys end of the investigation barbara listened carefully looking for connections among the pieces of information they were gathering when he was done she said the upman bloke claims he stuffed her on a oneoff but he could be mr ooohlala from the postcards and be lying through his teeth couldnt he or lying about what it meant when he had her nkata said he couldve thought it was something important happening between them she couldve just been doing it for kicks and when he found out he did her in where was he on tuesday night then getting a massage near manchester airport for stress he said barbara whooped thats an alibi ive not heard before she slung her bag over her shoulder and jerked her head towards the door they ducked out into parkgate road the house that contained terry coles flat was less than five minutes by foot from the pub and barbara led nkata to it this time when she rang the buzzer next to the tag reading colethompson the door catch was released in reply cilia thompson met them at the top of the stairs she was dressed for a night out her metallic silver miniskirt and matching bustier and beret suggesting an imminent audition for a role in a feminist wizard of oz she said i dont have much time barbara replied no problem we dont need much she introduced nkata and they went inside the flat which occupying the second floor of the house had been remodeled into two small bedrooms a sitting room a kitchen and a loo the size of a larder not wanting to encounter another vi nevin situation barbara said wed like to paw through everything if thats okay with you if terry was into something dodgy he might have left evidence of it anywhere he might have hidden it as well cilla had nothing to hide she informed them but she didnt fancy them fingering through her knickers personally shed show them every one of her belongings but that was the extent of it they could do whatever serious trolling they wanted to do among terrys lumber the rules established they began in the kitchen where the cupboards revealed nothing except a predilection for instant macaroni cheese which the flats occupants appeared to consume by the gross several bills lay on the draining boardwhere what looked like six weeks of crockery was dryingand nkata examined these and handed them over to barbara the telephone bill was respectable but not outrageously high the electricity usage seemed normal neither bill was overdue neither bill had gone unpaid during the previous billing period the refrigerator was equally unilluminating a limp lettuce and a plastic bag of sadlooking brussels sprouts suggested that the flats inhabitants hadnt been as conscientious about eating their veg as they should have been but there was nothing more sinister inside the appliance than a tin of pea soup that was open and appeared to have been half eaten as it was straight up with no heating barbaras stomach lurched and shed thought her culinary tastes were questionable we eat out mostly cilia said from the doorway looks like barbara agreed they moved to the sitting room where they paused and took in its unusual decor the room appeared to be a showplace for their art there were several pieces of the same agricultural nature as the larger efforts that barbara had seen earlier that day in the railway arch studio marking them as the work of terry the other objectspaintings thesewere the obvious results of cilias endeavours nkatahaving not seen cilias mouth fixation given concrete formwhistled quietly in reaction to the dozen or more oral cavities that were explored on canvas in the sitting room screaming laughing weeping speaking eating slobbering vomiting and bleeding were all featured in graphic detail cilia had also explored further fantastic possibilities of the orifice in her paintings several mouths had fully grown human beings rising from them most notably members of the royal family very different nkata commented munch however has nothing to worry about barbara murmured next to him there were bedrooms on either side of the sitting room and they ventured into cilias first with the artist herself leading the way aside from a collection of paddington bears that overflowed from the top of the chest of drawers and the window sill onto the floor cilias room didnt present any contradiction to the artist herself her wardrobe contained the usual coloursplodged garments one would associate with a painter the milk crate serving as bedside table held the box of condoms that one would expect of the sexually active and sexually cautious young woman in the depressing days of stds a considerable collection of cds met with barbaras approval and told nkata how far out of the loop he was when it came to rock n roll a number of copies of whats on and time out had pages turned down and galleries with newly mounted shows circled the walls featured her own art and the floor had been painted by the artist to reveal more of her singular artistic sensibility great flapping tongues dribbled partially masticated food onto naked infants who were defecating onto other great flapping tongues it was certainly one for freud cilia said i told mrs baden id paint over it when i move out in apparent response to the detectives failure to keep their expressions dispassionate she likes to support talent she says so you can ask her well take your word for it barbara said they found nothing in the bathroom save a grubby and unhygienic ring round the bath which nkata clucked at mournfully from there they went to terry coles bedroom with cilia dogging their heels as if worried that they might nick one of her masterpieces if she didnt keep watch nkata took a post at the chest of drawers barbara at the wardrobe there she discovered the gripping fact that terry coles preference in colours was black and he carried this theme out in tshirts jerseys jeans jackets and footwear while nkata slid open drawers behind her barbara began going through the jeans and the jackets in the hope that they might reveal something cogent she found only two possibilities among the cinema ticket stubs and crumpled tissues the first was a scrap of paper with soho square written on it in a small pointed hand and the second was a business card that had been folded in half over a wad of discarded chewing gum barbara prised this open one could always hope bowers was engraved in posh script across the card in the lower left corner was an address on cork street and a phone number on the lower right was a name neil sitwell the address was w another gallery barbara deduced but she flicked the dried gum onto the bedside table and pocketed the card nonetheless something here nkata said behind her she swung round and saw that hed taken a humidor from the bottom drawer of the chest he had it open what she said he tilted it towards her cilia craned forward she said in a rush thats none of mine you lot when she saw what was in it the humidor contained cannabis several lids by the look of it and from the drawer from which hed taken the humidor nkata pulled out a palmsize bong rolling papers and a large freezer bag sealed upon at least another kilo of the weed ah barbara said she eyed cilia suspiciously i said cilia countered i wouldntve let you go through the flat if i knew he had that stuff would i i dont touch it i dont touch anything that could cock up the process the process nkata looked quizzical my art cilia said the creative process right barbara said god knows you dont want to mess about with that wise move on your part cilia heard no irony she said talents precious you dont want to like waste it are you saying thiswith a nod at the cannabisis why terry couldnt make it as an artist like i told you at the studio he never put enough into ithis art that isto get anything out of it he didnt want to work at it like the rest of us he didnt think he had to maybe this is why because he was high too often nkata asked cilia looked uncomfortable for the first time she shifted from foot to foot on her platform shoes look its like hes dead and all that and im sorry about it but truths the truth his money came from somewhere this is probably it theres not much here if hes pushing nkata said to barbara maybe hes got a cache somewhere else but aside from a lumpy overstuffed chair the only other article of furniture in the room that afforded a hiding place was the bed it seemed too obvious to be likely but barbara went through the manoeuvre anyway she lifted the edge of an old chenille counterpane doing so she exposed the side of a cardboard box that had been shoved beneath the bed ah barbara said perhaps perhaps she crouched and drew the box towards her its flaps were tucked in but they werent sealed she separated them and examined the boxs contents they were she discovered postcards several thousand of them but they were definitely not the kind that one sent home to the family while on ones yearly hols in regions afar these postcards werent for greeting purposes they werent for sending messages they werent souvenirs what they were however was the first indication of who had killed terry cole and why a detective constable had been sent to fetch the maidens to buxton for their inspection of their daughters effects hanken had pointed out that a mere request for their presence would likely be met with a postponement on their part since the dinner hour was fast approaching and the maidens would claim to be tied up seeing to the needs of their guests if we want an answer tonight we fetch them hanken said not unreasonably an answer that night would be helpful lynley concurred so while he and hanken tucked into rigatoni puttanesca at the firenze restaurant in buxton market square dc patty stewart went to padley gorge to fetch the parents of the dead girl by the time the dis had finished their meal and topped it off with two espressos apiece stewart had telephoned to hanken that andrew and nan maiden were waiting at the station have mott sign out the girls belongings to you hanken directed her from his mobile lay them out in room four and wait for us they were no more than five minutes from buxton station hanken took his time about seeing to the bill he wanted to make the maidens sweat if he could he explained to lynley he liked everyone on edge in an investigation because one never knew what a case of nerves could turn up i thought youd switched your interest to will upman lynley remarked to his colleague im interested in everyone i want them all on edge hanken replied its a treat what people will suddenly remember when the pressure builds lynley didnt point out that andy maidens experience with so had probably conditioned him to weathering a great deal more pressure than would develop during quarter of an hours wait for two colleagues inside a police station this was after all still hankens case and he was proving himself to be an accommodating colleague im sorry to have missed you this afternoon lynley told nan maiden when she and her husband were ushered into room four where he and hanken stood on either side of a large pine table on this nicolas possessions had been laid out by dc stewart who remained by the door with a notepad in her hand id gone out for a bike ride nan maiden said andy said you were on hathersage moor is that a tough ride i like the exercise its not as rough as it sounds run into anyone else while you were out there hanken asked andy maidens arm went round his wifes shoulders she replied evenly enough not today i had the moor to myself go out often do you mornings afternoons nights as well nan maiden frowned im sorry are you asking me her husbands grip tightening on her shoulders was enough to stop her andy maiden said i think you wanted us to look through nicolas belongings inspector he and hanken observed each other across the width of the table by the door dc stewart glanced between them her pencil poised outside the building a car alarm went off hanken was the one to blink he said have a go with a nod at the articles on the table is there anything missing or anything not hers the maidens moved slowly inspecting each item nan maiden reached out and fingered a navy sweater with a strip of ivory defining its neckline she said the neck wasnt right the way it lay on her skin i wanted to change it but she wouldnt have that she said you made it mum and thats what counts but i wish id fixed it it wouldve been no trouble she blinked several times and her breathing became shallow i dont see anything im sorry im being so little help andy maiden put his hand on the back of his wifes neck and said a few moments more love he urged her along the table he however rather than she was the one to notice what wasnt among the items gathered from the scene of the crime nicolas rain gear he told them its blue hooded a waterproof it isnt here hanken shot a glance at lynley corroboration for your theory his expression said it didnt rain tuesday night did it nan maidens question was nonsequiturial they all knew that anyone who hiked on the moors had to be prepared for swift changes in weather andy spent the longest time with the implements from the camp site the compass the stove the pot the map case the trowel his forehead creased as he examined everything then he finally said her pocket knifes missing as well it was a swiss army knife that had been his own he told them hed given it to nick as a gift one christmas when her fancy for hiking and camping had first developed shed always kept it with the rest of her gear and shed always taken it when she went into the peaks lynley felt rather than saw hanken looking his way he reflected on what the fact of a missing knife might do to their conjecture he said youre sure of that andy she couldve lost it maiden replied but she would have replaced it with another before camping again his daughter was an experienced hiker he explained nick didnt take chances on the moors or in the peaks she never went out without being prepared who would try to camp without a knife hanken asked for a description maiden gave him the particulars listing the features of a multiuse utensil the largest blade was about three inches he said when the dead girls parents had completed their task hanken asked stewart to provide them with a cup of tea he turned to lynley once the door was shut upon them are you thinking my thinking he asked the blade length matches dr myles conclusions about the weapon used on cole lynley stared thoughtfully at the items on the table and pondered the spanner that andy maiden had inadvertently thrown into the works of his theory it could be a coincidence peter she could have lost it earlier that day but if she didnt you know what it means we have a killer on the moors tracking nicola maiden and for some reason tracking her without a weapon which means no premeditation a chance encounter in which things got out of hand hanken blew out a breath where the hell does that take us to some serious rethinking lynley said chapter the night sky was awash with stars when lynley stepped from the entrance porch of maiden hall and because hed loved the night sky as a boy in cornwall where like the sky in derbyshire he could see study and name the constellations with an ease that was impossible in london he paused next to the weatherpitted stone pillar marking the edge of the car park and looked to the heavens he was seeking an answer to what everything meant there must be a mistake with their records nan maiden had told him with quiet insistence she was holloweyed as if the last thirtysix hours had dragged from her a life force that would never be replaced nicola wouldnt have left law college and she certainly wouldnt have left law college without telling us that wasnt her way she loved the law besides shed spent the whole summer working for will upman so why on earth would she have done that if she dropped out of college in did you say it was may lynley had driven them home from buxton and had followed them into the hall for a final conversation because the lounge was still occupied by hotel residents and diners enjoying postprandial coffees brandy and chocolates theyd repaired to an office next to the reception desk it was overcrowded with the three of them a room meant for one person who would work at a computer behind a desk a fax machine was disgorging a lengthy message when they walked in andy maiden glanced at this and placed the message into a tray that bore a neat sign declaring it to be the repository of reservations neither of the maidens had known of their daughters leaving the college of law neither had known that she had moved house to take up residence in fulham with a young woman called vi nevin whose name nicola had never mentioned neither had known that shed gone to work fulltime at mkr financial management which went far to put a significant dent in nan maidens earlier assertion that her daughter had been the incarnation of honesty andy maiden had been silent in response to the revelations but he looked beaten as if each new piece of knowledge about his daughter was a blow to his psyche while his wife sought to explain away the inconsistencies in their daughters actions he merely seemed to be attempting to absorb them while minimising the additional damage to his heart perhaps she meant to transfer to a college closer to home nan had sounded pathetically eager to believe her own words isnt there one in leicester or in lincoln and as she was engaged to julian she might have wanted to be nearer to him disabusing nicolas mother of the notion of an engagement to julian britton had been a tougher task than lynley would have thought possible nan maidens efforts at elucidation ceased entirely when he revealed brittons misrepresentation of the facts of his relationship with her daughter she looked stricken saying only they werent but then why before falling silent and turning to her husband as if he were capable of giving her an explanation for the inexplicable thus lynley reached the conclusion that it wasnt beyond the realm of reason that the maidens hadnt known of their daughters possession of a pager and when nan maiden had proved to be as much in the dark as her husband regarding the little device lynley had felt inclined to believe her now as he stood in the penumbrous space between the softlylit car park and brightwindowed hotel lynley allowed himself a few minutes to ponder in a circumstance in which he also allowed himself a few additional minutes to feel hed earlier taken the car keys from hanken and said go home to your family peter ill drive the maidens back to padley gorge and it was hanken his family and his words earlier that day that lynley considered as he remained by the pillar the di had said that holding in his arms an infantones own child and creationchanged a man irrevocably hed said that the pain of losing that child was something beyond his contemplation what then did a man like andy maiden feel at this moment the fabric of him altered so many years ago at his daughters birth the substance of him shifting subtly throughout her childhood and adolescence and the core of him fracturedperhaps irreparablyat her death and now to pile on top of the loss of her came the additional knowledge that his only child had had secrets from him how lynley wondered must it feel the death of a child he thought kills the future and decimates the past making the former an imprisonment that seems interminable rendering the latter an unvoiced reproach for every moment robbed of its significance by the calls of a parents career one didnt recover from such a death one just grew more adept at stumbling on he glanced back at the hall and saw the distant form of andy maiden leave the little office cross the entrance and trudge towards the stairs the light remained on in the room he departed and in the window of that room nan maidens silhouette appeared lynley saw the maidens separateness and wanted to tell them not to bear their grief in solitude from each other theyd created their daughter nicola together and theyd bury her together so why did they have to mourn her alone were all alone inspector barbara havers had told him once in a similar case in which two parents had been forced to mourn the death of a child and believe me its only a bloody illusion that were anything else but he didnt want to think of barbara havers of her wisdom or her lack thereof he wanted to do something to give the maidens a measure of peace he told himself that he owed that much if not to two parents whose suffering was of a kind he hoped never to have to face then to a former colleague whose service on the force had placed officers like lynley in his debt but he also had to admit that he sought to give them peace as a hedge against potential grief in his own future in the hope that attenuating their present sorrow might prevent him from ever having to experience a similar pain himself he couldnt change the basic facts of nicolas death and the secrets shed kept from her parents but he could seek to disprove what information was beginning to look manufactured wearing the guise of innocent revelation while all the time created to meet the exigency of the moment will upman after all was the person who had mentioned a pager and a london lover in the first place and who better than upmaninterested in the young woman himselfto fabricate both possessions and relationships to divert the polices attention from himself he could have been the lover in question showering gifts upon a woman who was his obsession as well as his employee and told that she was leaving the law leaving derbyshire and establishing a life for herself in london how might he have reacted to the knowledge that he would be losing her permanently indeed they knew from the postcards which nicola sent to her flatmate that she had a lover in addition to julian britton and she would have hardly felt the need to code a messagelet alone to arrange for the assignations suggested by the postcardshad the man in question been someone with whom she felt that she could freely be seen and then there was the entire question of julian brittons place in nicolas life if he had actually loved her and had wished to marry her what would his reaction have been had he discovered her relationship with another man it was perfectly possible that nicola had revealed that relationship to britton as part of her refusal to marry him if shed done so what thoughtstaking up residence in brittons minddid he have and where did those thoughts take him on tuesday night an exterior door closed somewhere footsteps crunched in gravel and a figure came round the side of the building it was a man wheeling a bicycle he guided it into a puddle of light that spilled from one of the windows there he toed the kick stand downwards and removed from his pocket a small tool which he applied to the base of the bicycles spokes lynley recognised him from the previous afternoon when from the lounge window hed seen him pedalling away from the hall as lynley and hanken had waited for the maidens to join them he was no doubt one of the employees as lynley watched him crouched on his haunches next to the bike with a heavy lock of hair falling into his eyes he saw his hand slip and get caught between the spokes and he heard him cry out merde saloperie de bécane je sais pas ce qui me retient de venvoyer a la casse he leapt up knuckles shoved to his mouth he used his sweatshirt to wipe the blood from his skin hearing him speak lynley also recognised the unmistakable sound of a cog in the wheel of the investigation clicking into place he adjusted his previous conjectures with alacrity realising that nicola maiden had done more than merely joke with her london flatmate shed also given her a clue he approached the man have you hurt yourself the man swung round startled brushing the hair from his eyes bon dieu vous mavez fait peur excuse me i didnt mean to come out of nowhere like that lynley said and he produced his warrant card and introduced himself a fractional movement of the eyebrows was the other mans only reaction to hearing the words new scotland yard he replied in heavilyaccented englishinterspersed with frenchthat he was christianlouis ferrer master chef of the kitchen and the primary reason that maiden hall had been awarded the coveted étoile michelin youre having trouble with your bike dyou need a lift somewhere no mais merci quand même long hours in the kitchen robbed him of time to exercise he needed the twicedaily ride to keep himself fit this vélo de merdewith a dismissive gesture at the bicyclewas better than nothing to use for that exercise but hed have been grateful for un deuxroues that was a little more dependable on the roads and the trails might we chat before you leave then lynley asked politely ferrer shrugged in classic gallic fashion a simple uplift of the shoulders communicating that if the police wished to speak with him hed be foolish to refuse hed been standing with his back to the window but now he shifted position so that his face was in the light seeing him illuminated lynley realised that he was much older than hed looked from a distance on his bicycle he appeared to be in his mid fifties with age and the good life incised on his face and grey threaded through his walnut hair lynley quickly discovered that ferrers english was fine when it suited him of course he knew nicola maiden ferrer said calling her la malheureuse jeune femme he had laboured for the past five years to raise maiden hall to its current position de temple de la gastronomiedid the inspector happen to know how few country restaurants in england had actually been awarded the étoile michelinso of course he knew the daughter of his employers she had worked in the dining room during all her school holidays ever since he himself had practised his art for monsieur andee so naturally he had come to know her ah good how well lynley enquired mildly at which time ferrer failed to understand english although his anxious polite smilespurious though it might have beenindicated his willingness to do so lynley switched to what hed always referred to as his travelandsurvive french he took a moment to telegraph a silent message of thanks to his fearsome aunt augusta whod often decreedin the midst of a family visitthat ce soir on parlera tous frangais a table et apres le diner cest la meilleure fagon de se préparer passer des vacances dété en dordogne thus attempting to polish his rudimentary skills in a language in which he would otherwise only have been able to request a cup of coffee a beer or a room with a bath he said in french your expertise in the kitchen isnt in doubt monsieur ferrer what id like to know is how well you knew the girl her father tells me that all the family are cyclists youre also a cyclist did you have occasion to ride with her if ferrer was surprised that a barbaric englishman spoke his languagehowever imperfectlyhe covered it well he gave no quarter by slowing the pace of his reply though forcing lynley to ask him to repeat the answer which gave the frenchman the satisfaction he apparently needed yes of course once or twice we rode together ferrer told him in his native tongue he had been riding from grindleford to maiden hall on the road and when shed heard about this the young lady had told him of a route through the forest that was rough going but more direct she didnt wish him to become lost so she rode it with him twice to make sure he took all the right paths grindleford is where you have lodgings yes there were not enough rooms here at maiden hall to accommodate those who worked for the hotel and restaurant it was as the inspector had no doubt observed a small establishment so christianlouis ferrer had a room with a widow called madame clooney and her spinster daughter who if ferrers account was to be believed had designs upon him that werealasimpossible to gratify i am of course married he told lynley although my beloved wife remains in nerville le forét until such a time as we can be together again this lynley knew was not an unusual arrangement european couples often lived separately one of them remaining with their children in their native country while the other emigrated to seek more gainful employment however an innate cynicism that he quickly assessed as having flourished within him through too much exposure to barbara havers over the past few years made him immediately suspicious of any man who used the adjective beloved in front of the noun wife youve been here the entire five years lynley asked do you get home much for holidays and such alas ferrer confessed a man of his profession was best servedas indeed were his beloved wife and dearest childrenby spending his holiday time in the pursuit of cooking excellence and while this pursuit could be done in franceand with far more felicitous results considering with what licence the word cuisine was bandied about in this countrychristianlouis ferrer knew the wisdom of thrift should he travel back and forth between england and france at holiday time there would be that much less money to save for the future of his children and the security of his old age it must be difficult lynley said such a long separation from ones wife lonely as well i expect ferrer grunted a man does what he must do still there must be times when the loneliness makes one long for a connection with someone we dont live on work alone do we and a man like you it would be understandable ferrer crossed his arms in a movement that emphasised the prominence of his biceps and triceps he was in so many ways the perfect image not only of virility but of virilitys need to establish its presence lynley knew that he was engaging in the worst kind of stereotyping even to think so but still he allowed himself to think it and to see where the thinking would lead their conversation he said with a meaningful justbetweenusboys shrug five years without ones wife i couldnt do it ferrers mouthfulllipped the mouth of a sensualistcurved and his eyes became hooded he said in english estelle and i understand each the other it is why we are married for twenty years so there is the occasional dalliance here in england nothing of significance estelle i love the other well it was what it was a useful slip lynley thought was its over then and ferrers faceso swiftly guardedtold lynley the rest were you and nicola maiden lovers silence in reply lynley persevered if you and the maiden girl were lovers monsieur ferrer it looks far less suspicious if you answer the question here and now rather than find yourself being confronted with the truth of it gathered from a witness who might have seen the two of you together it is nothing ferrer said again in english thats not the assessment id make about coming under suspicion in a murder investigation ferrer switched back to french i dont mean suspicion i mean with the girl are you saying that nothing happened with the girl im saying that what happened was nothing it meant nothing to either of us perhaps youd tell me about it ferrer glanced at the halls front door it stood open to the pleasant night air and within residents were moving towards the stairs chatting amiably ferrer spoke to lynley but kept his gaze on the residents a womans beauty exists for a man to admire a woman naturally wishes to augment her beauty to increase the admiration thats arguable it is the way of things all of nature speaks to support this simple true order of the world one sex is created by god to attract the other lynley didnt point out that the natural order of which ferrer spoke generally called for the malenot the femaleof a species to be more attractive in order to be acceptable as a mate instead he said finding nicola attractive you did something to support gods natural order then as i say it meant nothing of a serious nature i knew this she knew it as well he smiled not without fondness it seemed she enjoyed the game of it i could see this in her when first we met when she was twenty it is a false woman who doesnt know her own allure nicola was not a false woman she knew i saw she saw that i saw the rest he gave another quintessentially gallic shrug there are limits to every communion between men and women if one remembers the limits ones happiness within the communion is safeguarded lynley made the interruption adroitly nicola knew you wouldnt leave your wife she did not require that i leave my wife she had no interest there believe me then where her interest he smiled as if with memory the places we met the exertion required of me to get to the places what was left of my energy once i arrived and how well i was able to use it ah lynley considered the places the caves the barrows the prehistoric villages the roman forts ooohlala he thought or as barbara havers might have said bingo inspector they had mr postcard you and nicola made love we had sex not love our game was to choose a different site for each meeting nicola would pass a message to me a map sometimes sometimes a riddle if i could interpret it correctly follow it correctly again that shrug she would be there to provide the reward how long had you been lovers ferrer hesitated before replying either doing the maths or assessing the damage of revealing the truth finally he chose five years since you first came to the hall this is the case he admitted i would of course prefer that monsieur and madame it would only serve to distress them unnecessarily we were always discreet we never left the hall together we returned first one then the other later so they never knew and never had reason to sack you lynley thought the frenchman seemed to feel the necessity for a further explanation it was that look she gave me when first we met you know what i mean i could tell from the look her interest matched my own there is sometimes an animal need between a man and a woman this is not love this is not devotion this is just what one feelsa pain a pressure a needhere he indicated his groin you a man you feel this as well not every woman has an ache that matches that of a man but nicola had i saw that at once and did something about it as was her wish the game of it came later the game was her idea her way it was why i never sought another woman while in england there was no need she had a way to make a simple affair he sought a word to describe it magic he settled on exciting i would not have thought myself capable of fidelity to a mere mistress over five years one woman had never held me more than three months before nicola the game of it was what she enjoyed thats what kept her tied to the affair with you the game kept me tied for her there was the physical pleasure naturally there was also the ego lynley thought wryly he said five years is a long time to keep a woman interested especially with no hope of any future of course there were the tokens as well ferrer admitted they were small but all true symbols of my esteem i have so little money because most of it my estelle would wonder if the money changed what i send to her you see if it became less so there were tokens only but they were enough gifts to nicola gifts if you will perfume a gold charm or two this pleased her and the game went on he dug into his pocket and removed the small tool hed been using on the bicycle spokes he hunkered down and went at them again tightening each spoke with infinite patience he said i shall miss her my little nicola we didnt love but how we laughed when you wanted the game to begin lynley said how did you let her know the frenchman raised his head his expression puzzled please did you leave her a note did you page her ah no it was the look between us nothing else was needed so you never paged her page no why would i when the look was all that why do you ask this question because evidently when she was at work in buxton this past summer someone paged her and phoned her a number of times i thought it might have been you ah i had no need but the other he could not leave her alone the buzzer every time it went off like a clocks work corroboration at last lynley thought he clarified with she received pages when you were together it was the only imperfection in our game that little pager always she would ring him back he tested the bicycle spokes with his fingers bah what was she doing with him there was so little they could have had together sometimes when i think of what she had to experience with him too young to know the first thing about giving a woman pleasure what a crime against love him with my nicola with him she endured with me she enjoyed lynley filled in the blanks are you saying it was julian britton who paged her always he wanted to know when they could meet when they could talk when they could make plans she would say darling how extraordinary that youd page me now i was just thinking of you i swear i was shall i tell you what i was thinking shall i tell you what id do if we were together and then she would tell and he would be satisfied with that just that ferrer shook his head in disgust are you certain it was britton who paged her who else she talked to him as she talked to me the way one talks to a lover and he was her lover not the same as i of course but still her lover lynley set that area of discussion aside did she always have the pager with her or did she have it only when she was away from the hall she always had it as far as he knew ferrer answered she wore it tucked into the waistband of her trousers or her skirt or her hiking shorts why he wanted to know was the pager of some importance in the inspectors investigation that lynley thought was indeed the question nan maiden watched them shed moved from the office to the first floor corridor where a bank of windows lined the wall she stood in the embrasure of one of these windows someone studying the moonlight striking the trees should any of the residents happen to see her nervously she fingered the tieback of the heavy curtains it caught on the bitten skin round her nails she watched the two men below in conversation and she fought the desirethe impulse the needto run down the stairs with an excuse to join them to offer explanations and to argue fine points of her daughters character that might be misconstrued look mum nicola had said all of twenty years old with the frenchmans scent clinging to her like the aftertaste of wine gone bad i know what im doing im quite of an age to know my own mind and if i want to fuck a bloke old enough to be my dad then im going to fuck him its no ones business but my own and it isnt hurting a soul so whyre you in a state about it and shed gazed at nan with those clear blue eyes so frank and open and reasonable shed unbuttoned her shirt and stepped out of her shorts dropping bra and knickers on top of them as she passed her mother and stepped into the tub ferrers scent grew stronger and nan choked upon it nicola lowered herself into the water sinking up to her shoulders so that it completely covered her teacup breasts but not before nan saw the marks of his teeth and not before nicola saw her see them she said he likes it that way mummy rough but he doesnt actually hurt me and anyway i do the same to him everythings okay youre not to worry nan said worry i didnt bring you up to mum shed lifted the sponge from the tray and dipped it into the water the room was steamy and nan sat on the toilet lid she felt dizzy and caught in a world gone mad you brought me up fine nicola said and this isnt about how you brought me up anyway hes sexy and hes fun and i like to fuck him theres no need to make an issue out of something that isnt an issue for either one of us hes married you know that he cant offer you marriage he wants you for cant you see its only sex to him free sex without the slightest obligation cant you see youre his toy his little english plaything its only sex to me as well nicola said frankly she brightened as if she suddenly realised why her mother was harbouring such concerns mum were you thinking i love him that i want to marry him or something like that lord no mum i promise you i just like the way he makes me feel and when the happiness of being with him makes you long for more and youre not able to have it nicola picked up her gel soap and applied it to the sponge dribbling it out like custard over a cake she looked confused for a moment then her expression cleared and she said i dont mean that kind of feel that heart kind of feel i mean physically the way he makes my body feel thats all i like what he does and how i feel when he does it thats what i want from him and thats what he gives me sex right hes quite good you know shed cocked her head given an impish grin and winked at her mother or do you know already have you had him as well nicola she squirmed in the water and hung her head appealingly on the side of the tub mum its okay i wouldnt tell dad god have you done it with him i mean when im away at college he must need someone else to come on tell me nan had longed to strike her to mark the lovely elfin face as christianlouis had marked the lithe young body she wanted to take her by the shoulders and shake until her teeth rattled in her head and pebbled from her mouth into the water she wasnt supposed to be like this confronted by her mother with the accusation she was supposed to deny to break down when the evidence was presented to plea for forgiveness and to ask for understanding but the last thing she was supposed to do was to confirm her mothers worst suspicions with the same ease that might have gone into answering a question about what shed eaten for breakfast sorry nicola said when her mother didnt reply to her lighthearted questions its different for you i can see that i shouldnt have intruded im sorry mum shed taken a razor from the bathtub tray and she was applying this to her right leg it was deeply tanned and long with a wellshaped calve and muscles taut from hiking nan watched her run it along her flesh she waited for a nick for a scrape for the blood none came she said what are you exactly what do i call you a scrubber a slag a common tart the words didnt wound they didnt even touch nicola set down the razor and gazed at her im nicola she said the daughter who loves you very much mummy dont say that if you loved me you wouldnt be mum i made a decision to do this eyes wide open and knowing all the facts i didnt make the decision to hurt you i made it because i wanted him and when this endsbecause all things dohow ill feel is my responsibility if im hurt im hurt if im not im not im sorry you found out about it because obviously its upset you but id like you to know that we did try to be discreet the voice of reason her lovely daughter nicola was who nicola was she called aces as she saw them and spades the same and as nan saw her so vividlya spectral figure whose image seemed to form on the glass panes of the window at which her mother now stoodshe tried not to think let alone to believe that the girls forthright honesty was what had killed her nan had never understood her daughter and she saw that now more clearly than she had done in all the years shed waited for nicola to emerge from the chrysalis of her troubled adolescence fully formed as an adult made in the image and likeness of her progenitors thinking of her child nan felt settle upon her shoulders the mantle of a failure so profound that she wondered how she would ever be able to continue living that she had produced such a daughter from her own body that the years of selfsacrifice had brought her to this moment that the cooking and cleaning and washing and ironing and worrying and planning and giving giving giving had resulted in her feeling like a starfish taken from the ocean and left to dryand to rottoo far from the water to save herself that the sweaters knitted and the temperatures taken and the scraped knees bandaged and the little shoes polished and the clothes kept neat and fresh and sweet had ultimately counted for nothing in the eyes of the single person for whom she lived and breathed it was too much to bear shed given the effort of motherhood everything she possessed and shed failed entirely teaching her daughter nothing of substance nicola was who nicola was nan was only grateful that her own mother had died during nicolas childhood she would never have to see how nan had failed where her female forebears had known nothing but success nan herself was the embodiment of her mothers values born into a time of terrible strife shed been schooled in the disciplines of poverty suffering generosity and duty in war one did not seek to gratify the self the self was secondary to the cause ones home became a haven for convalescing soldiers ones food and clothingand dear god even the gifts one received at an eighthyear birthday party when the little attendants had been told in advance that the guest of honour had no wants in comparison with what the dear soldiers neededwere gently but firmly removed from ones grasp and passed on to hands worthier than her own it was a hard time but it created her mettle on its forge she had character as a result this was what she should have passed to her daughter nan had moulded herself in her own mothers image and her reward had been a cool unspoken but nonetheless treasured approval communicated by a single nod of the regal head shed lived for that nod it said children learn from their parents and you have learned to perfection nancy parents gave their childrens world both order and meaning children learned who they wereand how to beat their parents knees so what had nicola seen in her parents that resulted in who and what she had become nan didnt want to answer that question it brought her facetoface with ghouls that she didnt wish to confront shes so like her father nans inner voice whispered but no but no she turned from the window she climbed the stairs to the private floor of maiden hall she found her husband in their bedroom sitting in the armchair in the darkness his head in his hands he didnt look up as she closed the door behind her she crossed the room to him knelt by the chair and put her hand on his knee she didnt say to him what she wanted to say that christianlouis had accidentally burnt pine nuts into tiny lumps of charcoal weeks ago that the ground floor took hours to lose the acrid scent of the burning and that heandyhadnt mentioned the odour because he hadnt noticed it in the first place she didnt say any of this because she didnt want to consider what it implied instead she said lets not lose each other as well andy at that he looked up she was struck by how the last days had aged him his natural vibrancy was gone she couldnt imagine the man she saw before her jogging from padley gorge to hathersage skiing hell for leather down whistler mountain or tearing along the tissington trail on his mountain bike without raising a sweat he didnt look as if hed make it down the stairs let me do something for you she murmured a hand at his temple to smooth back his hair tell me what you did with it he replied her hand dropped with what i dont need to spell it out did you take it with you onto the moor this afternoon you must have done its the only explanation andy i dont know what you dont he said just tell me and tell me why you said you didnt know she had one id like to know that most of all nan feltrather than heardan odd buzzing in her head it was very much as if nicolas pager were somewhere in the room with them an impossibility of course it lay where she had deposited it deep in a crevice created at the juncture of two pieces of limestone on hathersage moor dearest she said i really dont know what youre talking about he examined her she met his gaze she waited for him to be more direct to ask with an explicitness of language that she couldnt avoid she had never been a particularly good liar she could feign confusion and act ignorant of the facts but she could do little else he didnt ask instead he let his head sink back against the chair and he closed his eyes god he whispered what have you done she made no reply hed been invoking god not her and gods ways were a mystery even to the faithful yet andys suffering was so excruciating to her that she wanted to give him an anodyne of some sort she found it in a partial disclosure he could make of it what he would things need to stay uncomplicated she murmured we need to keep things simple as best we can chapter samantha came across her uncle jeremy in the parlour when she was making her final rounds of the night shed been checking doors and windowsby virtue of habit rather than by virtue of the fact that the family had anything of value worth burgling at this pointand shed marched into the parlour with the intention of seeing to the windows in there before she realised that he was present the lights were off but not because jeremy was sleeping he was instead running an old eightmillimeter film through a projector that clacked and whirred as if on its last legs the picture itself flickered not on a screen because jeremy couldnt be bothered setting that up rather it moved against a bookshelf where the curved backs of mildewing volumes distorted the figures whose images had been filmed he was reliving what appeared to be a longago birthday broughton manor rose in the backgroundlong before the building had fallen into ruinous disrepairwhile in the foreground a floppyhatted clown played the pied piper to a group of little children wearing party hats the clown led them down the slope to the ancient footbridge that provided access to a meadow beyond the river wye and in that meadow a pony stood waiting its reins in the hand of a man whose resemblance to the adult jeremy told samantha that she was looking at her maternal grandfather as a very young man as she watched the little boy her uncle once had been ran across the meadow and flung himself ecstatically into his fathers arms he was lifted onto the ponys back as the other childrensamanthas own mother among themclustered round and the clown danced a jig to soundless music the scene shifted in the way of home films and they were under a tree where a table had been laid with a birthday cloth and decorations the same children bobbed and squirmed on either side of the table and a woman carried into the picture a cake on which five candles burned the child jeremy stood upon his chair to make his wish and extinguish the candles he lost his balance and nearly toppled to be saved from the fall by his mother she laughed waved at the camera and dropped her arms to hold her son safely on the chair dead in less than two years jeremy britton said without turning from the picture that undulated against the backs of the books his words were only mildly slurred not nearly as incomprehensible as they usually were after a day of drinking she was counting out change to buy me a packet of crisps in longnor mum wasjesus can you credit thatand she dropped dead at the till gone before she hit the floor and i said mum what about my crisps jesus have mercy on us all jeremy lifted his glass and drank he replaced it with such precision on the table next to his chair that samantha wondered what he was actually drinking he turned his head and squinted in her direction as if the light from the corridor were too bright ah its you sammy come to join the resident insomniac i was checking the windows i didnt know you were still up uncle jeremy didnt you jeremy turned from his scrutiny of samantha giving his attention back to the film you lose your mum and youre marked forever he murmured taking up his glass once more did i ever tell you sammy yes you did numerous times since her arrival in derbyshire samantha had heard the story that she already knew his mothers untimely death his fathers rapid remarriage his own banishment to boarding school at the tender age of seven while his only sister was allowed to remain at home ruined me hed said time and again robs a man of his soul and dont you forget it samantha decided it was best to leave him to his musings and she began to depart the room but his next words stopped her its nice to have her out of the way isnt it he asked with absolute clarity opens things up the way they should be opened up thats what i think what about you she said what i dont what and in her surprise she feigned misunderstanding in a circumstance where no misapprehension was really feasible especially with the high peak courier sitting on the floor next to her uncles chair with its frontpage headline shouting death at nine sisters so it was foolish to attempt to dissemble with her uncle nicolas dead was going to be the subtext of every conversation samantha had with anyone from this time forward and it would serve her interests far better to become used to nicola maiden as a rebeccalike figure in the background of her life than it would to pretend the woman had never existed at all jeremy was watching the film a smile playing round the corners of his mouth as if he found amusement in the sight of his fiveyearold self skipping along the path in one of the gardens dragging a stick along the edge of what was then a welltended herbaceous border sammy my angel he said to the screen and again his voice was remarkable for the unusual clarity of his enunciation how it happened isnt the point that it happened is and what were going to do now that its happened is the most important point of all samantha made no reply she felt unaccountably rooted to the spot both trapped and mesmerised by what could destroy her she was never right for him sammy obvious whenever they were together she held the reins and he got ridden whenever he wasnt riding her of course jeremy chuckled at his own joke prhaps he wouldve seen the wrongness of it all at the end of the day but i dont think so shed worked herself under his skin too deep good at that she was some women are youre not was what he didnt say but samantha didnt need him to say it pulling men had never been her forte shed always believed that an outright demonstration of her virtues would serve to establish her firmly in someones affections womanly virtues had a longevity to them that sexual allure could never match and when lust and passion died the death of familiarity one needed something of substance to take their place or so she had taught herself to believe through an adolescence and a young adulthood remarkable for their solitude couldnt have happened any better jeremy was saying sammy always remember this things generally work out the way theyre meant to she felt her palms dampening and she rubbed them surreptitiously against the skirt that shed donned for dinner youre right for him the other she wasnt what you have to offer she couldnt touch she wouldve brought nothing to a marriage with julieaside from the only decent pair of ankles the brittons have seen in two hundred yearswhereas you understand our dream you can be part of it sammy you can make it happen with you julie can bring broughton manor back to life with her well like i said things generally work out the way theyre meant to so what weve got to do now im sorry shes dead samantha broke in because she knew she must say something eventually and a conventional expression of sorrow was the only statement she could think of at the moment to stop him from going on for julians sake im sorry hes devastated uncle jeremy isnt he just and thats exactly where we begin begin dont play the innocent with me and for gods sake dont be a fool the ways clear and therere plans to be laid youve taken enough trouble to woo him youre mistaken and what youve done is lay a decent foundation but this is the point where we start building on that foundation nothing hasty mind you no going to his bedroom and dropping your knickers just yet everything in good time uncle jeremy i hardly think good dont think let me do that you keep it simple from this time on he raised his glass to his lips and eyed her sharply over its rim its when a woman complicates her plans that her plans get cocked up if you know what i mean and i expect you do samantha swallowed pinned to his gaze how was it that an ageing alcoholica bloody drunk for the love of godcould manage to discompose her so easily except he didnt seem very much like a drunk right now flustered she went to the windows and locked them as had been her intention behind her the film came to an end and the tail of it slapped noisily against its spool as the projector continued to run kickateck kickateck kickateck jeremy didnt seem to notice you want him dont you he asked her and dont lie to me about it because if im to help you catch the boy i want to know the facts oh not all of them mind you just the important one about you wanting him hes not a boy hes a man who isnt he just knows his own mind bollocks that he knows his own dick and where he wants to stick it we just need to see that he learns to want to stick it in you please uncle jeremy it was horrible inconceivable humiliating to be listening to this she was a woman whod forged her own path throughout her life and to place herself in the position of depending on someone other than herself to mould events and people to her wishes was not only foreign to her thinking it was also foolhardy and it could be dangerous sammy my angel im on your side jeremys voice coaxed urging her to declare herself in the very same way that one might urge a frightened puppy to come forward from beneath a chair she found herself turning from the windows she saw that he was watching her his eyes hooded and his chin held by fingers adopting a pious attitude of prayer im on your side completely and one hundred percent only listen my angel i need to know exactly what your side is before i take action on your behalf samantha tried to move her eyes away from him but she failed completely one little fact sammy you want the boy believe me you dont need to say anything more fact is i dont want to know any more just that you want him end of story i cant you can simple as anything three little words and they wont kill you words that is words dont kill but i fancy you know that already dont you she couldnt look away she wanted to she was desperate to and yet she couldnt the words came from her at last without volition as if he drew them from her and she was powerless to stop him all right i want him jeremy smiled dont tell me anything else barbara havers felt as if someone had planted thorns beneath her eyelids it was her fourth hour into her adventure with the so files on cris and she was mightily regretting her promise to nkata that shed work nights and dawns to fulfill her obligations to the assignment given her by inspector lynley she wasnt getting anywhere with this rubbish aside from becoming aware of her potential for arriving at destinations marked damaged retinas and imminent hypermetropia following their recce of terry coles flat nkata and barbara had driven to the yard there after transferring the cannabis and the box of postcards to the front seat of barbaras minito be dealt with laterthey had parted ways nkata drove off to return the inspectors bentley to his home in belgravia barbara reluctantly trudged off to keep her promise to nkata to do her duty in the crime recording information system shed come up with sod bloody all so far which hardly surprised her as far as she was concerned after the discovery of the postcards in the battersea flat neon arrows had begun pointing to terry cole as the killers main targetnot to nicola maidenand unless there was some manner in which she could tie cole to andy maidens time in so this business of delving through files was a waste of her time only a name leaping off the screen drooling blood and screaming im the one baby was going to convince her otherwise still shed known it was in her best interest to comply with lynleys orders so for the fifteen names he had given her shed read the cases and organised each into arbitraryalbeit uselesscategories that shed called drugs potential for blackmail prostitution organised crime and murder for hire dutifully shed placed the names from lynleys list into these categories and shed added the prisons to which each malefactor had been sent to while away a few years at her majestys pleasure shed tracked down terms of imprisonment and added those to the mix and shed begun the process of determining which of the convicts were now on parole locating the former lags however was something which she knew would be impossible at the time so feeling that shed been virtuous obedient and responsive to her superiors order to return to cris she decided at half past twelve to call it a night traffic was light so she was home by one with terry on her mind and a motive for his murder to be fished from the evidence she scooped up the box of postcards and carried them through the dark garden to her digs inside her phone was blinking its message light when she shouldered open the door of her bungalow and heaved the cardboard box onto the table she switched on a lamp gathered up a selection of the postcardswhich were bundled together with elastic bandsand crossed the room to listen to her calls the first was mrs flo telling her that mum looked right at your picture this morning barbie dear and she said your name bright and clear as ever was she said this is my barbie what do you think of that i wanted you to know because well it is distressing when shes got herself into one of her muddles isnt it and that silly business about what was she called lilly oryan well no matter shes been right as rain all day so dont you worry that shes forgotten you because she hasnt all right dear i hope youre well see you soon bye now barbie byebye byebye praise god for small favours barbara thought a day of lucidity weighed against weeks of dementia was little enough to celebrate but shed learned to take her triumphs in teaspoonfuls when it came to her mothers fleeting moments of coherence the second message began with a bright hello hello followed by three breathy notes of music did you hear that im learning flute i just got it today after school and im to be in the orchestra they asked me special and i asked dad would it be okay and he said yes so now i play flute only i dont play it very well yet but im practising i know the scale listen there followed a clatter as the phone was dropped afterwards came eight highly hesitant notes breathy like the first then see the teacher says ive a natural talent barbara do you think so as well the voice was interrupted by another a mans voice speaking quietly in the background then oh this is khalidah hadiyyah up front in the ground floor flat dad says i forgot to tell you that i expect you know its me though dont you i wanted to remind you about my sewing lesson its tomorrow and you said you wanted to see what im making dyou still want to go we cn have the rest of the toffee apple afterwards for our tea pang me back okay and the phone clunked down at her end of the line after which barbara heard the quiet wellbred tones of inspector lynleys wife helen said barbara winstons just returned the bentley he told me youre working on the case here in town im so glad and i wanted to tell you so i know your work will put you back in good standing with everyone at the yard barbara will you be patient with tommy he thinks the world of you and well i hope you know that its just that the situation what happened this past summer it took him rather by surprise so oh bother i just wanted to wish you well on the case youve always worked brilliantly with tommy and i know this instance will be no different at which barbara winced her conscience prickled but she muffled the voice that told her shed been acting in defiance of lynleys orders for a good part of the day and she silently announced that she wasnt defying anyone at all she was merely taking the initiative supplementing her assignment with additional activities demanded by the logic of the unfolding investigation it was as good an excuse as any she kicked off her shoes and flopped onto the day bed where she pulled the elastic band from the collection of postcards she was carrying she began to flip through them and as she did so she thought of the myriad ways in which terry coles lifeas it was unfolding through her investigation of itwas unveiling him as a killers target while nicola maidens lifeno matter how they viewed itwas unveiling her as nothing more than a sexually active twentyfiveyearold whod had one or two men in every port and a wealthy lover by the string and while sexual jealousy on the part of one of those men might have led him to give the girl the chop he certainly wouldnt have needed to do the job out on the moor especially when he saw that she was with someone it would have made more sense for him to wait till he found her alone unless of course she and terry had been into something at that moment that made him think they were an item in which case blinded by rage and jealousy he could well have stormed into the stone circle and attacked his rival for the maiden girls favours running her down as well after hed wounded the boy but that seemed an unlikely scenario nothing barbara had learned about nicola maiden had so far suggested that shed gone for unemployed teenaged boys terry on the other hand was turning out to be a field ripe for harvest when it came to activities from which murder could arise according to cilia hed carried gobs of cash with him and the postcards that barbara now arranged on her day bed suggested a field of underworld employment that was absolutely rife with violence despite what his mother claimed about the big commission that terry had despite what mrs baden had asserted about the boys good nature and generosity it was seeming more and more likely that the real terry cole had lived close to if not directly within the underbelly of english life tied to that underbelly were drugs pornography snuff films paedophilia exotica erotica and white slavery not to mention a hundred tasty perversions all of which could so easily give rise to a motive for murder but in nicolas case nearly everything had been accounted for from her lifestyle in london to her supply of dosh they still had to discover why shed gone to work in derbyshire for the summer but what on earth could that possibly have to do with her murder on the other hand virtually nothing about terry coles life had made sense at all until barbara had unearthed the postcards she gazed upon them in their orderly rows on the day bed and pursed her lips come on she told them give me something to run with i know its here i know one of you can tell me i know i know she could still hear cilia thompsons passionate reaction to seeing the cards he never wouldve told me about this never in a hundred years he was pretending to be an artist for gods sake and artists spend their time on their art when theyre not creating theyre thinking about creating theyre not crawling round london sticking these up everywhere art begets art so you expose yourself to art thiswith a contemptuous gesture towards the cardsis a life exposed to absolute crap but terry had never been truly interested in art barbara guessed hed been interested in something else entirely in the first set of postcards there were fortyfive in all each barbara saw was different and no matter how she studied them categorized them or attempted to eliminate them one by one she was finally forced to accept the fact that only the telephoneeven at this hour of the nightwas going to assist her in sussing out her next move in the investigation she deliberately set aside any consideration that terry cole might be connected to andy maidens past in so she set aside any consideration that so was involved in the case at all instead she reached for the phone she knew quite well thatdespite the hourat the other end of the line would be fortyfive suspects just waiting for someone to ring them and ask a few questions by rising at dawn the next morning and driving to manchester airport lynley managed to catch the first flight to london it was nineforty when his taxi left him at the front door of his house in eaton terrace he paused before entering despite the brightness of the morningwith the sun glittering against the transom windows of the houses that lined the quiet streethe felt as if he were walking directly beneath a cloud his eyes took in the fine white buildings the wrought iron railings that fronted them without a spot of rust marring their midnight paint and regardless of the fact that hed been born into the longest period of peace that his country had ever experienced he found himself unaccountably thinking of war london had been devastated night after night the bombs fell upon it reducing large areas of the metropolis to bricks mortar beams and rubble the city the docklands and the suburbsboth north and south of the riverhad sustained the worst of the damage but no one in the nations capital had escaped the fear it was heralded nightly by the sound of the sirens and the whistling of the bombs it was embodied by explosions fires panic confusion uncertainty and the aftermath of them all yet london had continued to persevere renewing itself as it had done for two thousand years boadiceas tribesmen had not vanquished it neither the plague nor the great fire had subdued it so the firestorm of the blitz could not have hoped to defeat it because out of pain destruction and loss it always managed to rise anew so perhaps it could be argued that strife and travail could lead one to greatness lynley thought that ones sense of purpose once tested by adversity became reliably firm and ones understanding of the world once questioned in the midst of sorrow and misconception was forever enhanced but the thought that bombs ultimately led to peace as a womans labour led to birth was not enough to dispel the gloom and dread that he was feeling good could come out of bad it was true it was the hell in between that he didnt want to ponder at six that morning hed phoned di hanken and told him that some crucial information uncovered by the london officers working the case required his presence back in town he would be communicating with derbyshire as soon as he followed up on that information to hankens logical query about the necessity of lynleys traveling to london when he had two officers already working there and couldwith a simple telephone callgarner two or even two dozen more lynley replied that his team had uncovered a few details that were making it look as if london and not derbyshire was where the facts were leading it seemed reasonable he said for one of the two ranking officers on the case to assess and assemble these facts in person would hanken make available to him a copy of the postmortem report he asked he also wanted to hand that document over to a forensic specialist to see if dr myless conclusion about the murder weapon was accurate if shes made an error about the knifethe length of the blade for exampleid like to know that at once he said how would a forensic specialist be able to discern an error in the report without seeing the body the xrays the photographs or the wound itself hanken queried this lynley told him was no ordinary specialist but he asked for copies of the xrays and the photographs as well and a quick stop at the buxton station on his way to the airport had put everything into his possession for his part hanken was going to start a search for the swiss army knife and the maiden girls missing rain gear he would also be talking personally to the masseuse whod seen to will upmans ostensibly tense muscles on tuesday night and if time allowed hed pay a call at broughton manor to see if julian brittons father could confirm his sons alibi or that of his niece look hard at julian lynley told him ive found another of nicolas lovers he went on to summarise his previous nights conversation with christianlouis ferrer hanken whistled are we going to be able to find a bloke anywhere who wasnt shafting this bird i expect we might be looking for the bloke who thought that he was the only one britton he said he proposed and she refused but we have only his word for that dont we its a good way to take the spotlight off himself saying he wanted to marry her when he wantedand didsomething else entirely now in london lynley unlocked the front door and shut it quietly behind him he called his wifes name he was half expecting helen to be out alreadysomehow knowing his intention to return without having been told and seeking to avoid him in the aftermath of their earlier disagreementbut as he crossed the entry to the stairs he heard a door crash shut a mans voice say whoops sorry dont know my own strength do i and a moment later denton and helen came towards him from the direction of the kitchen the former was balancing a stack of enormous portfolios across his arms the latter was following him a list in her hand she was saying ive narrowed things down somewhat charlie and they were willing to part with the sample books till three oclock so im depending on you to give me input i hate flowers and ribbons and that sort of rubbish denton said all twee that is so dont even show it to me makes me think of my gran so noted helen replied cheers denton saw lynley then look what the mornings brought lady helen good you wont be needing me then will you needing you for what lynley asked helen hearing him said tommy youre home that was a quick trip wasnt it wallpaper denton said in reply to lynleys question he gestured with the portfolios he was carrying samples for the spare rooms helen added have you looked at the walls in there lately tommy the paper looks as if it hasnt been changed since the turn of the century it hasnt just as i suspected well if we dont get it changed before she gets here im afraid your aunt augusta will change it for us i thought we might head her off i had a look through the books at peter jones yesterday and they were good enough to let me pinch a few at closing time just for today though wasnt that kind of them she started up the stairs saying over her shoulder whyre you back so soon have you sorted everything out already denton trailed her lynley made a third in their little procession suitcase in his hand hed followed some information to london he told his wife and there were documents he wanted st james to look over the postmortems some photos and xrays he said arguments among the experts she asked a reasonable assumption it wouldnt have been the first time st james had been requested to mediate a dispute among scientists just some questions in my own mind lynley told her as well as a need to look over some information winstons managed to gather ah she looked over her shoulder and offered him a fleeting smile its quite nice to have you back the spare rooms in need of refurbishment were on the second floor of the house lynley left his suitcase inside the door of their bedroom and then joined his wife and denton up above helen was laying sample sheets of wallpaper out on the bed in the first of the rooms removing the portfolios from dentons outstretched arms one at a time and making her selections with infinite care the younger man was wearing an expression of longsuffering patience throughout this activity but he brightened considerably when lynley walked into the room he said hopefully here he is so if you wont be needing me to lynleys wife i cant stay denton was lynleys reply the other man drooped a problem lynley said have you a sweet young thing waiting somewhere today it wouldnt be unusual dentons pursuit of ladies was the stuff of legend ive the halfprice ticket booth waiting denton answered i hoped to make it in advance of the crowd ah yes i see not another musical i hope well denton looked embarrassed his love of the spectacles posing regularly as west end theatre soaked up a good part of his wages each month he was almost as bad as a cocaine addict when it came to greasepaint dimmed lights and applause lynley took the portfolios from dentons arms go he said god forbid that we keep you from experiencing the latest theatrical extravaganza its art denton protested so you keep telling me go and if you buy the accompanying cd ill ask you not to play it when im home hes a real culture snob isnt he denton asked helen his voice confidential as ever there was she continued laying wallpaper samples out on the bed once denton had left them she rejected three samples replaced them with three others and took another portfolio from her husbands arms she said you dont need to stand there holding them tommy youve work to do havent you it can wait a few minutes this will take far longer than a few minutes you know how hopeless i am when it comes to making up my mind about anything i had thought of something rather pretty with flowers subdued and calming you know what i mean but charlies put me off that idea god forbid we ask him to escort aunt augusta into a room he considers twee what about this one unicorns and leopards isnt it ghastly but suitable for guests whose visits one wishes to curtail helen laughed there is that lynley said nothing until shed made her selections from all the portfolios he was holding she covered the bed with them and went on to litter most of the floor all the time he thought how strange it was that two days previously theyd been at odds with each other he felt neither irritation nor animosity now nor did he feel that sense of betrayal that had triggered within him such righteous indignation he experienced only a quiet surging of his heart towards hers which some men might have identified as lust and dealt with accordingly but which he knew had nothing to do with sex and everything on earth to do with love he said you had my number in derbyshire i gave it to denton to simon as well she looked up a lock of chestnut hair caught at the corner of her mouth she brushed it away you didnt ring he said was i meant to ring there was nothing coy about the question charlie gave me the number but he didnt say youd asked me to you werent supposed to ring but i hoped you would i wanted to talk to you you left the house in the middle of our conversation the other morning and i felt uneasy with the way things were left between us i wanted to clear the air oh the word was small she went to the rooms old georgian dressing table and sat tentatively on the edge of its stool she watched him gravely a shadow playing across her cheek where her hair shielded her face from a shaft of sunlight that streamed in through the window she looked so much like a schoolgirl waiting to be disciplined that lynley found himself reassessing what hed believed were his rational grievances against her he said im sorry about the row helen you were giving your opinion thats more than your right i jumped all over you because i wanted you on my side shes my wife i thought and this is my work and these are the decisions that im forced to take in the course of my work i want her behind me not in front of me blocking my way i didnt think of you as an individual in that moment just as an extension of me so when you questioned my decision about barbara i saw red my temper got away from me and im sorry for it her gaze lowered she ran her fingers along the edge of the stool and examined their route i didnt leave the house because you lost your temper god knows ive seen you lose it before i know why you left and i shouldnt have said it said that remark the tautology bit it was thoughtless and cruel id like to have your forgiveness for having said it she looked up at him they were only words tommy you dont need to ask forgiveness for your words i ask nonetheless no what i mean is that youre already forgiven you were forgiven at once if it comes to that words arent reality you know theyre only expressions of what people see she bent and took up one of the wallpaper samples holding it the length of her arm and evaluating it for some moments his apology it seemed had been accepted but he had the distinct feeling that the subject itself was miles away from being put at rest between them still following her lead he said helpfully in reference to the wallpaper that looks like a good choice do you think so helen let it fall to the floor choices are what defeat me having to make them in the first place and having to live with them afterwards warning flares shot up in lynleys consciousness his wife hadnt come into their marriage the most eager of brides indeed it had taken some time to persuade her that marriage was in her interests at all the youngest of five sisters whod married in every possible circumstance from into the italian aristocracy to on the land to a montana cattleman shed been a witness to the vicissitudes and vagaries that were the offspring of any permanent attachment and shed never prevaricated about her reluctance to become a party to what might take from her more than it could ever give but shed also never been a woman to let momentary discord prevail over her common sense theyd exchanged a few harsh words that was all words didnt necessarily presage anything still he said to counter the implication in her statements when i first knew that i loved youhave i ever told you thisi couldnt understand how id managed to go so long blind to the fact there you were a part of my life for years but youd always been at the safe distance of a friend and when i actually knew that i loved you risking having more than your friendship seemed like risking it all it was risking it all she said theres no going back after a certain point with someone is there but i dont regret the risk for a moment do you tommy he felt a rush of relief then were at peace were we anything else it seemed he hesitated uncertain how to describe the sea change he was experiencing between them he said weve got to expect a period of adjustment havent we we arent children we had lives that were independent of each other before we married so its going to take some time to adjust to lives that include each other all the time had we she said it as a statement reflectively she looked up from the wallpaper samples to him had we what independent lives oh i see that you did who would ever argue with that but as to the other half of the equation she made an aimless gesture at the samples i would have chosen flowers without a moments hesitation but flowers im told by charlie are twee you know i never actually considered myself hopeless in the arena of interior design perhaps ive been kidding myself about that lynley hadnt known her for more than fifteen years to fail in understanding her meaning now helen i was angry angry im the first to climb on the highest horse i can find but as you pointed out what i said was words theres no more truth in them than theres truth in suggesting im the soul of sensitivity which as you know im not full stop as he spoke shed begun setting the floral samples to one side as he finished she paused she looked at him head cocked face gentle you dont really understand what im talking about do you but then how could you in your position i wouldnt understand what i was talking about either i do understand i corrected your language i was angry because you werent taking my side so i responded as i believed youd responded to the form instead of to the substance beneath it in the process i hurt you and im sorry for that she got to her feet sheets of wallpaper held to her chest tommy you described me as i am she said simply i left the house because i didnt want to listen to a truth ive avoided for years chapter women had always been a mystery to him helen was a woman ergo helen would always be a mystery so lynley thought as he worked his way from belgravia to westminster and new scotland yard hed wanted to continue their discussion but shed said gently tommy darling youve come back to london with work to do havent you you must do it go on well talk later a man whod generally managed to obtain what he desired in fairly short order after desiring it lynley chafed at any kind of postponement but helen was right hed already tarried at home longer than hed originally intended so he kissed her and set off for the yard he found nkata on the telephone in his office he was jotting something into his notebook saying describe it for me as best you can then well what sort of collar does it have fr instance are there snaps or a zip look anything you give me is more than i have right now hmmm yeah okay right ill hold put her on as well cheers he looked up as lynley entered the room he began to remove himself from the chair behind the desk lynley waved him back into place he went round to stand behind him where he could see a column of postcards that had been arranged on his leather blotter the cards ran along one edge of this samples of the lot thataccording to nkatahad been taken from terry coles flat lynley saw that punishment was offered on some of the cards domination was promised on others still others suggested that ones ultimate fantasies could be fulfilled mention was made of bubble baths massages video services torture chambers some cards offered the use of animals a few noted that costumes could be provided many had photographs depicting such delights as were on offer from the transsexual black shemale or the ultimate domina or a hot stunning thai girl in short there was something for every taste inclination and perversion and since the cards looked too fresh from the printer to have spent any time blu tacked to the walls of a phone box prior to being collected by a sweatypalmed teenager with masturbation in mind the only conclusion to be reached from the presence of several thousand of such cards beneath his bed was that terry cole had not been a collector but rather a distributora part of the great machine that peddled sex in london this at least explained the cash that cilia thompson claimed the boy had carried card boys who worked quickly enough putting up cards in phone boxes all round central london could earn a substantial living because the going rate was one hundred pounds for every five hundred cards the boy managed to place and the service of a card boy was absolutely essential agents of british telecom removed the cards daily so they always had to be replaced two of these cards had been isolated from the column on lynleys blotter and lay in the centre of his desk one displayed the photo of a putative schoolgirl one bore only print lynley picked them up and examined themfeeling heartsoreas nkata continued his call shhh was printed across the top of the first and below the photograph ran the words dont tell mummy whats on after school the picture itself showed a rucksack with books tumbling out of it and bending from the waist to gather them up was a girl her bum pointing towards the camera she wasnt ones average schoolgirl her pleated skirt was hiked up to display black thong knickers and thighhigh black stockings with lace round the top she was looking coyly over her shoulder at the camera blonde hair tousled and tumbling round her face beneath her stilettoheeled shoes was a telephone number with a handscrawled ring me next to it christ lynley whispered and when nkata ended his phone call he said as if an explanation in the light of day would negate the one hed heard via phone from the constable in the dead of night take me through it the entire situation beginning to end another time winnie let me fetch barb the brainwork was hers havers lynleys tone stopped the other man from picking up the phone winston i told her i wanted her on the computer you assured me thats what she was doing whys she involved in this end of the investigation nkata showed his palms empty and innocent he said shes not involved id the box of cards in your motor when i came back here last evening from battersea i called in to see how she was doing on cris she asked to take the cards along with her when she went home to have a look through them the rest she can tell you how it played out nkatas face wore the guileless expression of a child at the knees of father christmas declaring that there was more to the story than had been revealed lynley sighed fetch her then nkata reached for the phone he punched in a few numbers and while waiting for the connection said solemnly shes working cris right now been there since six this morning ill kill the fatted calf lynley replied nkata not given to biblical exegesis or allusion said right uncertainly and then into the phone guvs here barb that was the extent of it while they waited for havers lynley examined the second postcard he didnt want to think of the anguish that lay ahead for the parents of the murdered girl however so he gave his attention back to nkata anything else this morning winnie id a page from the coles missus and the sister that was the sister i was talking to just now and the boys jackets missing jacket right a black leather jacket he always wore it when he rode the big bike when you gave mrs cole that list of the kids effectsthose receipts rememberthe jacket wasnt on it they think someone pinched it at the station in buxton lynley recalled the photographs of the crime scene he thought about the evidence that hed looked through in buxton then he said are they certain about the jacket generally wore it they claimed and he wouldntve ridden all the way north in a tshirt whichs all the covering it looked like he had from the receipts that is he wouldntve ever ridden on the motorway in only a tshirt they said it hasnt been cold though the jacket was for moren warmth it was also protection if he accidentally pranged the bike on the road wouldnt get so cut up with the jacket on they explained so where is it is what they want to know it wasnt among his things in the flat barb went through his clobber so she can tell you nkata stopped himself abruptly he had the grace to look abashed ah lynley said the syllable rich with meaning she worked the computer half the night afterwards nkata said hastily did she indeed and whose idea was it that she accompany you to the cole boys flat havers advent saved nkata from having to reply she arrived as if on cue all business with a notebook in her hand she looked as professionally attired as lynley had ever seen her she didnt flop into the chair in front of his desk as usual she stood by the open door her heels pressed against it as if holding her body at a respectful attention to lynleys question about the jacket she responded after a moment in which she seemed to be attempting to read her fellow dcs face as if it were a barometer that would enable her to assess the climate in lynleys office the kids gear she said carefully when nkatas earnest nod towards lynley apparently told her it was at least moderately safe to reveal that shed once again been derelict in her duties well hmmm well deal later with what you were supposed to be doing havers lynley told her was a black leather jacket among the boys clothes she managed to look uncomfortable lynley noted there was a mercy in that she licked her lips and cleared her throat everything was black she reported there were sweaters shirts tshirts and jeans in his clothes cupboard but a jacket hadnt been among them not a leather one at least there was a lighter jacket though a windcheater she said and a coat really long like something from the regency period that was it a pause and then she ventured why nkata told her someone must have taken it from the crime scene was her immediate assessment to which she added sir in lynleys direction as if the respectful utterance might indicate a newly found reverence for authority lynley thought about what her conjecture implied two garments now were missing from the crime scene a jacket and a waterproof so were they back to two killers prhaps the jacket points the way to the killer havers offered as if reading his mind if our killers worried about forensic evidence then he should have stripped the body completely what does taking only the jacket gain him coverage nkata said hed have had the raingear to hide the blood on him but if he knew he had to stop somewhere after the killingor if he knew hed be seen on the route back to his digshe couldnt exactly have a waterproof on why would he be wearing it it wasnt raining on tuesday night havers still stood at the doorway and her questions and statement were careful as if shed finally and gratifyingly come to realise just how much a probationary figure she was there was sense in her remarks lynley acknowledged this with a nod he went on to the postcards saying as he used them to gesture with let me hear it all again havers shot a look at nkata as if she expected him to take the bit he read her meaning and said i could do a quick a to zed off the top of my head but id miss fifteen letters in between you take it right she stayed at the door id been thinking how any one of that lotwith a nod to the cards on lynleys deskmight have a motive to murder terry cole what if hed been cheating them what if he collected their cards took their hundred pounds each and never put up the cards at all or at least not the number he said after all she pointed out how did a prostitute really know whereor even ifher cards were tacked up unless she went out personally to check on them and even if she walked round central london making stops at every phone box she came to what was to prevent terry cole from claiming that the bt contract cleaners were sweeping the boxes free of cards just as fast as he could distribute them so i decided to give each of them a call to see what they had to say about terry she got very little joy from the calls shed made however and she had just begun to ring the number advertised on the schoolgirl card when shed given the picture closer scrutiny and realised the girl looked awfully familiar fairly certain about her identity shed phoned the number on the card and said is that vi nevin then when her call was answered dc barbara havers here shed said to the young woman ive one or two points to clear up if you have the time or should i call in in the morning on the other end of the line vi nevin hadnt even questioned how havers had come to have her number shed merely said in her sculpted rada voice its after midnight do you know that constable are you trying to intimidate me she looks young enough to play the part of a schoolgirl in some punters sex fantasy havers concluded and from the looks of her digs yesterday id say she winced and halted obviously realising what shed just revealed about the rest of her activities on the previous day inspector listen i talked winnie into letting me be part of everything he really wanted me to stay on the computer just like you ordered hes absolutely in the clear on this it just seemed to me that with two of us doing the interview instead of one wed be able to lynley cut her off well talk about that later he gave his attention to the second of the two postcards that had been at the centre of his desk the telephone number was the same as the number on the schoolgirl card what was on offer was different however nikki temptation was printed prominently at the top of the second card with the words discover the mysteries of domination just beneath the name and under that suggestion the mysteries themselves were alluded to a fully equipped torture chamber a dungeon a medical room a school room bring your toys or use mine was the final enticement the telephone number followed there was no picture at least we got the reason they left mkr financial nkata said these birds they take in anything from fifty quid an hour up to fifteen hundred a night ccording to what my sources say he added quickly as if clarification were needed to keep his reputation unbesmirched i had a word with hillinger in obscene publications those blokesve seen it all reluctantly lynley saw how the various pieces of information theyd been gathering on nicola maiden were beginning to fit together he said the pager was for her clients then which explains why her parents didnt know she had one but upman and ferrerboth of them men with whom shed been intimatedid you mean she was on the game in derbyshire as well barbara asked with upman and ferrer perhaps but even if she was having them just for the fun of it she was a business woman whod want to keep in touch with her regular clients giving them phone sex while she was away its possible but why was she away that was still the question as to those blokes from the peaks nkata added thoughtfully what about them there was a blowup in islington im wondering about it blowup nicolas landlady in islington heard her having a row with some bloke havers put in from the doorway in may just before she moved house to fulham im wondering if we finally got ourselves a rocksolid motive to pin to julian britton nkata said this bloke said hed see her dead before hed let her do it something like that prhaps he knew shed left law college and mkr to go on the game how would he know lynley countered testing the theory julian and nicola were living more than two hundred miles apart you cant be thinking he came to london picked up a card in a call box somewhere phoned the number for a nice session of whipsandhandcuffs and found nicola maiden dressed up to use them thats more coincidence than one case can bear havers said he could have come to town for a visit without telling her in advance sir nkata nodded he shows up in islington and finds his woman tightening the nipple clamps on a bloke whos wearing a leather harness thatd be something could cause a row that was indeed a potential scenario lynley agreed but another existed as well theres someone else here in town who might have been just as aggrieved to learn about nicolas career plans we need to find her london lover but couldnt that have been just another one of her clients phoning as often as upman and ferrer both claim i doubt it havers said sir theres terry cole to consider isnt there im talking about a man who killed her constable not about a man who was killed alongside her im not suggesting cole as her london lover havers said her voice uncharacteristically careful i meant cole as cole to look at to talk about weve got our connection between them nowmaiden and cole obviously he was placing cards for her just like he was doing for the other tarts but he cant have gone all the way to derbyshire to collect more cards from her to put in call boxes especially since she wasnt in london to take calls from anyone who picked up her cards so what was he doing there in the first place there must be a further tie between them coles hardly the point at the moment how can you say that hes dead inspector do we need a bigger point lynley shot her a look nkata spoke quickly as if to head off a hovering confrontation what if cole was sent there to kill her and he ended up getting killed himself or he was trying to warn her about something giving her the word to expect some kind of danger then why not just phone her barbara countered does it even make sense that hed hop on his motorcycle and roar up to derbyshire to warn her about something she took a step away from the door as if getting closer to them could somehow win them to her way of thinking the girl had a pager winston if youre going to argue that terry trekked all the way up to the peaks because he couldnt get her by phone why didnt he just page her if there was danger that she needed to know about there was too much of a chance it would get to her before cole himself did which is what happened nkata pointed out right the worst happened and both of them died both of them and i say wed be wise to start thinking of them that way as a unit not as a coincidence and what i say lynley said meaningfully is that your assignments waiting for you havers thank you for your input ill let you know if i want more but sir constable the way he said the word made it more than her title at lynleys desk nkata stirred he seemed to be hoping havers would look his way she didnt but the hand holding her notebook fell to her side and assurance was gone from her voice when she went on sir i just think we need to work out exactly what cole was doing in derbyshire when weve got the reason for his trip well have our killer i can feel that cant you your feeling has been noted her bottom teeth chewed at her upper lip she looked towards nkata at last as if hoping for direction the other dc raised his eyebrows slightly with a cock of his head towards the office door perhaps telling her that the course of wisdom suggested she hotfoot it back to the computer she didnt take his meaning to heart she said to lynley can i follow it sir follow what the cole end of things havers you have an assignment and youve been told to return to it when youve completed your work with cris theres a report i want you to deliver to st james after you accomplish that ill give you another assignment but dont you see that if he went all the way to derbyshire to meet her theres got to be something more between them nkata said barb like a cautious admonition he had wads of dosh she persisted wads of it inspector all right okay it could have come from the card business but he also had cannabis in his flat and a big commission that he talked about to his mum and sister to mrs baden to cilia thompson i thought at first he was blowing smoke but since the card boy business cant even begin to explain what he was doing in derbyshire havers im not going to tell you again but sir god damn it no lynley felt the ground fracturing beneath his hold on his temper the womans obstinacy was working on him like a match put to dry tinder if youre trying to suggest that someone followed him all the way to derbyshire with the express intention of slicing open his arteries that isnt on every piece of information weve come across takes us straight to the maiden girl and if you cant see that then youve lost more than merely your rank as a result of your day trip on the north sea last june her mouth clamped shut her lips thinned like a spinsters hopes nkata let out a heavy breath on the word damn now lynley used the word to gain time he used the time to bring his temper to heel if youd like to request placement with another di havers be plain about it theres work to do five seconds ticked by nkata turned from the window he and havers exchanged a look that appeared to mean something to them but to lynley was inscrutable im not requesting another placement havers finally said then you know what to do she shared another look with nkata then she gave her glance to lynley sir she said politely and she left the office lynley realised that he hadnt asked her one question regarding her search through the files but it was a fact that didnt occur to him until hed replaced nkata behind his desk and then he felt that to call her back would be to give her the advantage which was something he didnt want to do at that moment well take the prostitution angle first he told nkata that could give a man in love one hell of an incentive to kill itd be ugly for a bloke sussing out the fact that his womans on the game and being on the game in london suggests the possibility of someone sussing it out here in london as well wouldnt you agree i got no argument with that then i suggest we begin by tracking the london lover lynley finished and ive a fairly good idea where to start chapter vi nevin took the postcard from lynleys fingers and after glancing at it set it carefully onto the spotless glass coffee table that served both the buttery sofa and the matching love seat which formed a right angle at one of its corners she had placed herself on the sofa leaving the love seat for lynley and nkata to crowd themselves onto nkata hadnt cooperated with the ploy however hed stationed himself at the door to the maisonette with his arms crossed and his body proclaiming no escape youre the schoolgirl pictured on the card arent you lynley began vi reached for the portfolio shed showed havers and nkata on the previous day she slid this across the coffee table i pose for pictures inspector thats what i do and thats what i get paid for i dont know whos going to use them for what and i dont really care as long as i get paid are you saying that youre just a model for sexual services that someone else provides thats what im saying i see then whats the point of having your phone number on the card if youre not the schoolgirl in question her gaze slid away from him she was quick fairly well educated well spoken and clever but she hadnt thought quite that far ahead you know i dont have to talk to you she said and what im doings not illegal so please dont act like it is explaining the finer points of the law to her wasnt his purpose in coming to see her lynley told her but if she was engaged in prostitution show me where it says on that card that anyone pays me for anything she demanded if lynley repeated she was engaged in prostitution then he assumed she knew where the ice was thin and where it was not in her behaviour that being the caseam i loitering somewhere am i soliciting in a public place that being the case he continued firmly he would also assume that miss nevin was cognisant of how loosely and generously the word brothel could be defined by a magistrate with little patience with linguistic gymnastics he glanced round the maisonette lest she not comprehend the full meaning of his comment she said cops dismissively indeed was lynleys affable reply he and nkata had driven directly to fulham from new scotland yard theyd found vi nevin unloading sainsburys carrier bags from a new alfa romeo and when shed caught a glimpse of nkata as he eased his lengthy body from the bentley she said whyre you here again why arent you out looking for nikkis killer look i dont have time to talk to you ive an appointment in fortyfive minutes then i expect youd like us to be gone in advance lynley had said shed flicked a glance at both men looking for meaning she said give me a hand then and passed two loaded carrier bags over to them shed unpacked perishables into a large refrigerator pâté greek olives prosciutto camembert dolmades having a party lynley had asked her or is the food part of the appointment perhaps vi nevin had shut the refrigerator door smartly and walked into the sitting room where shed taken up her position on the sofa there she still sat a retrogarbed figure in brogues and white socks turnedup blue jeans a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up and the collar at attention a scarf knotted at the throat and a ponytail she looked like a refugee from a james dean film all that was missing was the bubble gum she did not however speak like a refugee from a james dean film she might have been dressed like a gumpopping devotee of bop but she spoke like a woman either born to advantage or selfmade to appear that way more likely the latter lynley would think as he interviewed her every now and then her careful persona slipped just a word here and there or a skewed pronunciation that inadvertently revealed her origins still she wasnt what he would have expected to find at the other end of a phone box postcard advertising sex miss nevin lynley said im not here to strongarm you im here because a womans been murdered and if her murder is somehow connected with her source of income thats where you always head isnt it right to one of our punters shes a slag and she got what she was asking for its damn lucky she lasted as long as she did what with her lifestyle and the blokes who take part in it which is what youd like to put an end to isnt it the lifestyle so dont tell me what you do or dont intend with regard to my source of income she gazed at him evenly if you only knew how many warrant cards get set to one side when a blokes in a hurry to climb out of his trousers hmph i could name a few names im not interested in your clients im interested in finding nicola maidens killer who you think is one of her clients why wont you admit it and how do you expect those punters will feel when the cops come calling on them and what do you think itll do for business once word gets out that im naming names if i know their names to begin with and i dont by the way we go by first names only and thats not going to help you much across the room nkata took out his notebook opened it and said were happy to take whats on offer miss forget it constable im not that stupid lynley leaned towards her then you know how simple it would be for me to shut you down a uniformed constable walking this street every fifteen minutes would i think do some damage to your clients sense of privacy as would the word slipped to one or two tabloids who might want to see if anyone worthy of public notice is paying calls on you you wouldnt dare i know my rights none of which preclude the presence of journalists paparazzi looking for everyone from film stars to members of the royal family or your local bobby whos just keeping the streets safe for elderly women walking their dogs you bloody outrageous its a nasty world nkata cut in solemnly she glared at both of them the telephone rang and she jumped to answer it she said whats your pleasure into the receiver nkata looked heavenward vi said hang on let me check my book and she flipped through the pages of an engagement diary sorry i cant manage that someones already booked she ran her finger down the page saying i could do four oclock how long a session she listened then murmured dont i always leave you fit for her afterwards and she jotted a reference into her diary she rang off stood with her fingers on the telephone as if in thought her back to them she sighed and said all right then quietly she went into the kitchen and returned with an envelope which she handed over to lynley this is what you want i hope it doesnt break your heart to be completely wrong about the punters the envelope had already been unsealed lynley slid out its contents one piece of paper and a single message assembled from letters that appeared to come from glossy magazines two bitches will die in there own puke theyll beg for mersey and get nothing but pain after reading it lynley handed the note to nkata the dc looked it over then raised his head same as the others left at the scene lynley nodded he told vi nevin about the anonymous notes that had been left at the murder site i sent them to her she said puzzled lynley turned over the envelope and saw it was addressed to vi nevin with a local postmark but this appears identical to those she said i dont mean i sent them to her like this without a name like a threat i mean they came to me here at home theyve been coming all summer long i kept telling nikki about them when we talked on the phone but she just laughed them off so i finally sent them up to her with terry because i wanted her to see for herself that the situation was escalating and we both needed to start taking some care which she added bitterly nikki didnt do god why wouldnt she ever listen lynley took the note back from nkata he examined it again then carefully refolded and stowed it into its envelope he said perhaps youd better start from the beginning shelly platts the beginning was her reply vi went to the window which overlooked the street she looked down as if expecting to see someone below she said we were friends it was always shelly and vi and it had been for years but then nikki came along and i could see it made more sense to set myself up with her shelly couldnt cope with that and she started causing trouble i knew her voice quavered she halted then i knew shed do something eventually but nikki never believed me she just kept laughing it off it the letters and the calls we hadnt been in this placewith her hand she indicated the maisonettetwo days before shelly got her hands on the phone number and started ringing and then sending letters and then turning up in the street and then pinching the cards vi went to the drinks trolley an ice bucket stood on it she lifted this and from beneath it she took a small stack of postcards she said shed destroy us shes a nasty little jealous she drew a quick breath shes jealous the cards were the same schoolgirl advertisements that lynley had already seen except that each had been defaced with various sexually transmitted diseases scrawled upon it in bright felt pen terry found those when he was making his regular rounds of the boxes vi said it was shelly who did it up to her tricks she wont be happy till im ruined tell us about shelly platt lynley said she was my maid we met in cest la vie do you know it its a french bakery and caff over by south ken station i had what you might call an arrangement there with the head bakerbaguettes quiches and tarts in exchange for a few liberties in the gents looand shelly was there one morning shoveling chocolate croissants into her mouth when alf and i went below stairs she saw him give me the food afterwards without taking any money and she got interested in what was going on in order to blackmail you vi looked grimly amused by the question she wanted to know what she had to do to get her croissants for nothing plus she liked the way i dressi was doing a mary quant that morningand she wanted a bit of that as well your clothes my whole life as things turned out i see and as your maid with access to your belongings vi laughed at the drinks trolley she took two cubes of ice from the bucket and a small tin of tomato juice from the bottom shelf she deftly mixed herself a bloody mary with the precision of long experience she wasnt that kind of maid inspector she was the other kind she took phone calls from punters and booked their appointments for me vi stirred her drink with a glass rod surmounted by a bright green parrot she set this neatly on a cocktail napkin and returned to the sofa where she placed the glass on the coffee table and continued her explanation shed been employing a middleaged filipino woman to book her clients prior to meeting shelly platt in cest la vie but everyone employed middleaged filipino women as their maids these days so she thought it might be an added interest to have a teenager acting the part instead fixed up shelly wouldnt look half bad and more important she was so ignorant of the ways of the profession that vi knew she would be able to pay her a pittance i gave her room board and thirty pounds a week vi told them and believe me thats more than she was getting doing knee tremblers outside earls court station which was how she was supporting herself when i met her they were together for nearly three years she went on but then vi met nikki maiden and saw how much more was possible if the two of them set up a business together we kept shelly with us at first but she hated nikki because with her there it wasnt just the two of us any longer thats the way shelly is although i didnt know it when i first took her on the way she is she gets her hooks into people and thinks she owns them i should have seen it when she first talked about what had gone on with her boyfriend she followed him to london from liverpool and when she got here and found out he didnt want to be her boyfriend any longer she started her routine following him everywhere phoning him constantly hanging round his flat sending him letters bringing him presents only i didnt know it was her routine you see i thought it was a oneoff her reaction to her first love not working out she took a stiff gulp of her drink right bloody fool i was she did the same to you i should have seen obviously stanthis was her boyfriendcame to the flat after shed cut up his car tyres he was all in a rage and he must have thought hed straighten her out but he was the one who got straightened out how she cut him open with a butcher knife nkata glanced lynleys way lynley nodded a killer did generally have a favourite weapon but why kill nicola if shellys object was vi and why wait so many months to do it vi seemed to recognise lynleys unspoken questions she said she didnt know where nikki was but she did know terry was thick with her if she followed him it was only a matter of time before he led shelly right to her she tossed down more of the drink picking up a napkin to dab against the corner of her mouth murdering little bitch she said quietly i hope she rots this bitch has had it lynley murmured now knowing the source of the note that had been found in nicola maidens pocket he said well need her address if you have it and well also need a list of nicolas clients this isnt about clients ive just told you that you have but weve also been told that there was a man in london with whom nicola had a relationship that was more than youd expect between a client and he looked for a euphemism his evenings companion nkata supplied and we may well find him among the men she serviced regularly lynley finished well if there was someone i dont know about him vi said i have trouble believing that lynley said you cant expect me to believe that a flat like this is paid for solely from your earnings in the sex trade believe what you want vi nevin said her fingers crept to the scarf at her throat and loosened it quickly miss nevin were looking for a killer if hes the man who initially installed nicola maiden in this maisonette then you need to give us his name because if he thought he had one kind of arrangement with her only to learn that it was another he might well have been driven to kill her and i dare say he wont like you hanging on here at his expense now that shes gone youve had my answer is reeve the bloke nkata asked her reeve vi reached for her glass again martin reeve mkr financial management she didnt drink instead she swirled the liquid and watched as it slid across the ice cubes which rattled against the side of the glass she finally said i lied about mkr ive never worked for martin reeve i dont even know him i just knew about him and tricia from what nikki said and when you asked about him yesterday i followed your lead i didnt know what you knew about me about nikki and in my line of work it doesnt make sense to trust the police then how did you two hook up in the first place nkata asked her nikki and i we met in a pub jack horner on the tottenham court road near her college she was being chatted up by a baldheaded bloke with a paunch and bad teeth and once he left her alone we had a laugh about him we began to chat and she shrugged we just got on nikki was easy to talk to easy to tell the truth to she was interested in my work and when she knew how much money could be had on the joba far sight more than what she was making at mkrshe decided to try it you didnt mind the competition lynley asked there wasnt any i dont understand nikki didnt like it straight vi explained she only serviced men if they wanted quirky sex costumes playacting domination ill do little girls for men who prefer it from twelveyearolds without the risk of going to gaol for their pleasure but thats about as quirky as i get ill give hand relief and do oral in addition to the littlegirl bit naturally otherwise what i have on offer is exactly what nikki couldnt be bothered with romance seduction and understanding youd be amazed how little of that goes on between husbands and wives so between the two of you lynley concluded sidestepping any discussion of what marriage could do by way of cocking up the works of a relationship you covered all tastes and all inclinations we did she replied and shelly knew it so she also knew that i wasnt about to choose her over nikki if the two of them didnt get on once nikki and i hooked up which is why you need to talk to her not to some nonexistent punter with money enough to give nikki this place where cn we find this shelly nkata asked vi didnt have her address but shed be easy enough to locate she said she was a regular at the stocks a club in wandsworth that catered to individuals with specific interests she was vi added special mates with the barman if shes not there now hell be able to tell you where to find her vi told them lynley examined her from his position on the love seat he found that despite the volume of information shed given them he still wanted to give her some sort of veracity test glibness was one of the essentials for survival in her profession and the course of wisdomnot to mention the years of rubbing elbows with those who lived on the edge of the lawsuggested that he take her word as something less than gospel he said nicola maidens movements in the months preceding her death seem at odds with each other miss nevin was she using prostitution for a quick source of income to tide her over till her law work was profitable no law work is as profitable as this vi said at least not when youre young thats why nikki dropped out of law college in the first place she knew she could go back to the law when she was forty but she couldnt be turning tricks at that age it made sense to her to get the money while she could then why did she spend the summer working for a lawyer or was she doing more than merely working for him vi shrugged youll have to ask the lawyer barbara havers worked the computer till midday shed left lynleys office in the thrall of an effort to maintain such a strict control upon her anger that for an hour at the glowing screen shed been completely incapable of assimilating a single piece of information but by the time shed read through the seventh report shed calmed down what had been rage metamorphosed into blind intent no longer was her performance in the investigation a case of redeeming herself in the eyes of a man shed long respected it was now a matter of proving to them bothto herself as well as to lynleythat she was right she could have dealt with anything other than the professional indifference with which he was making her current assignments had she seen the slightest indication on his patrician face of scorn impatience disregard or loathing she could have confronted him and they could have battled openly as theyd battled in the past but hed obviously concluded that she was criminally inadequate marginally hysterical and hence beneath his notice and nothing she could say by way of explaining her actions was going to make him think otherwise her only option was to prove to him how incorrect his assessment was there was a single way to accomplish this barbara knew that to do it was to put her entire career on the line but she also knew that she had no career of value at the moment and she never again would be able to have one unless she freed herself from the shackles of judgement that were currently binding her she began with the idea of lunch shed been at the yard since early morning and she was due a break so why not she thought take a stroll during the time that was due her nowhere was it written that she had to take all her meals in victoria street indeed a little hike through soho would be just the ticket to prime her with a bit of exercise before she faced a few more hours sifting through the so cases on cris she wasnt however so wedded to the idea of soho and exercise that she considered walking there time was of the utmost importance so she toddled out to her mini in the yards underground car park and she zipped up to soho via charing cross road the crowds were out in an area of london that blended everything from book shops to skin shows from street markets offering vegetables and flowers to sex shops selling vibrating dildos and pulsating ersatz vaginas there would always be crowds on the pavements of soho and on a sunny saturday in september with the tourist season not yet on the wane those crowds spilled from pavements into the streets making the going treacherous once one turned off the theatreoriented congestion of shaftesbury avenue and began heading up frith street barbara ignored the restaurants that called to her like sirens she inhaled through her mouth so as to avoid the beguiling fragrances of garlicladen italian food that were carried on the air and she allowed herself a sigh of relief when at last she saw the timbered structurepart arbour and part tool shedthat marked the centre of the square she made a circuit once looking for a place to park finding nothing available she located the building she was seeking and resigned herself to giving half a days wages to a car park a short distance from dean street she hoofed it back in the direction of the square digging from her shoulder bag the address that shed found on the crumpled bit of paper shed taken from a pair of terry coles trousers in his flat she verified the address soho square right she thought so lets see what little terry was up to she rounded the corner from carlisle street and sauntered to the building it stood at the southwest corner of the square a modern structure of brick with a mansard roof and transom windows a portico supported by doric columns sheltered the glassdoored entrance and above this entrance in brass were identified the occupants of the building triton international entertainment barbara knew little enough about triton but what she did know was that shed seen their logo at the end of television dramas and at the beginning of cinema films which made her wonder if terry cole had hoped to have a career as an actor in addition to his other questionable pursuits she tried the door it was tightly locked she muttered damn and peered through the tinted glass to see what if anything she could deduce by having a look at the lobby of the building not much as she discovered it was a marble plane its surface interrupted by sepiacoloured leather chairs that apparently served as a waiting area at the planes centre a kiosk stood on which tritons latest films were advertised near to the door curved a chesthigh walnut reception station and across from this a bank of three polished bronze lift doors reflected barbaras image for her personalalbeit dubiousviewing pleasure on a saturday there were no signs of life in the lobby but as barbara was about to curse her luck and turn tail for the yard one of the lift doors opened and revealed a greyhaired uniformed security guard in the act of zipping his trousers snugly and bobbing to adjust his testicles he stepped into the lobby started when he saw barbara at the door and waved her off not open he called out and even from behind the glass barbara could hear the glottal stop of the north londoner born and bred she dug out her warrant card and raised it to the glass police she called in turn could i have a word please he hesitated looking towards an enormous brassfaced clock that hung above a line of celebrity photographs on the wall to the left of the door he called its my lunch break better still barbara responded its mine as well come on out ill buy if you like whats this about then he approached the door but he maintained his distance across a rippled rubber door mat murder enquiry barbara wiggled her warrant card meaningfully please note her gesture told him he noted then he brought out a ring of what looked like two thousand keys and took his time about inserting the right one in the front door once inside barbara got directly to the point she was investigating the derbyshire murder of a young londoner called terence cole she told the guard whose name tag announced him unfortunately as dick long cole had had this address among his things and she was attempting to uncover the reason why cole you say the guard repeated terence the christian name never had nobody here called that far as i know which isnt saying much as i only work at the weekends i do weekdays im security at the bbc doesnt pay much either way but it keeps me from sleeping rough somewhere he pulled on his nostrils and investigated his fingers to see if hed mined anything of interest terry cole had this address among his belongings barbara said he could have come here passing himself off as an artist of sorts a sculptor does this sound familiar no one heres an art buyer what you want is one of them posh galleries luv over in mayfair or places like that though it does look a bit like a gallery in here eh what about that what dyou think what she thought was that she didnt have time to discuss triton entertainments interior decoration she said could he have had a meeting with someone at triton or at any of the other companies dick said therere more groups than triton at this address she asked oh yeh tritons only one they get their name above the door cause they take up the most space tothers dont mind as their rents lower dick jerked his head in the direction of the lifts and led barbara to a notice board between two of them on this she saw names departments and lists of companies they represented publishing film making and theatre it would take hoursperhaps daysto talk to everyone whose name was usted and to everyone else whose name wasnt included because he or she played a supporting role barbara turned away from the lifts and caught sight of the reception desk she knew what such a desk meant at the yard where security was paramount she wondered if it meant the same here she said dick do visitors sign in oh yeh they do excellent can i have a look at the book cant do that miss er constable sorry police business dick right but tis locked up at the weekend like you can have a try of the desk drawers to make sure though barbara did so slipping behind the walnut counter and pulling on the drawers to no avail damn she thought she hated having to wait till monday she was itching to slap handcuffs on a guilty party and to parade him in front of lynley shouting see see and waiting nearly fortyeight hours to take another step closer to the perpetrator of the derbyshire homicides was like asking hounds on the scent of a fox to have a bit of a kip once their quarry was in sight there was only one alternative she didnt much like it but she was willing to put in the time to give it a try she said tell me dick have you a list of the people who work here oh miss er constable as to that he pulled on his nostrils again and looked uneasy yes you do right because if somethings dodgy in part of the building you need to know who to contact yes dick i need that list im not supposed to give it out to anyone she concluded i know but youre not giving it out to anyone youre giving it to the police because someones been murdered and you understand that if you dont assist in the enquiry it might look like youre involved in some way he looked affronted oh no miss i never been to derbyshire but someone here may have been on tuesday night and to be a party to protecting that someone that never looks very good to the cps wha you think theres a murderer works here dick glanced at the lifts as if expecting them to disgorge jack the ripper could be the case dick could very well be he thought it over barbara let him think he looked from the lift doors to reception once again he finally said as its the police and joined barbara behind the reception desk where he opened what looked like a broom cupboard containing reams of paper and coffee supplies he took from the top shelf a stapled sheaf of papers he handed it over thesere them he said barbara thanked him fervently he was making his mark for the cause of justice she told him she would need to take a copy of the document with her though she was going to have to phone all of the employees listed and she didnt expect that he wanted her to do so sitting in the empty lobby of the building dick gave his reluctant permission and disappeared for five minutes to make a copy of the paperwork when he returned barbara did her best to stride with dignityand not dance with delightout of the building maintaining her poise she didnt take a look at the list until she rounded the corner into carlisle street but once there she dropped her gaze to it eagerly her spirits plummeted it was page after page no fewer than two hundred names were printed she groaned at the thought of the job ahead of her two hundred phone calls with no one to help her there had to be a more efficient way to serve up humble pie for lynleys dining pleasure and after a moments thought she decided what it might be chapter di peter hankens plan was to carve an hour out of his saturday to work on bellas new swing set a plan that he had to abandon not twenty minutes after his return from manchester airport hed got back home by midday having used up his morning tracking down the airport hilton masseuse who had worked on will upman on the previous tuesday night shed sounded sultry sexy and seductive over the phone when hanken had spoken to her from the hilton lobby but shed turned out to be a thirteenstone valkyrie in medical whites with the hands of a rugby player and hips the width of a lorrys front bumper shed confirmed upmans alibi for the night of the maiden girls murder he had indeed been seen to by miss freda as she was called and hed given her his usual generous tip when shed finished tenderising his knotted tendons tips just like a yank she informed hanken in a friendly fashion has done from the first so im always glad to see him he was one of her regulars miss freda explained he made the drive twice a month at least lots of stress in his line of work she said upmans appointment had been for one hour only shed seen to the solicitor in his room from half past seven that hanken reckoned gave upman plenty of time to trot from manchester back to calder moor afterwards to dispatch the maiden girl and her companion easily by half past ten and to scurry back to the airport hilton to resume his stay and firm up his alibi all of which kept the solicitor in the game and a phone call from lynley made upman a principal player at least to hanken he got the call on his mobile at home where hed just laid out the pieces of bellas swing set on the floor of the garage and was standing back to study them as he counted the number of screws and bolts that had been included in the package lynley reported that his officers had tracked down a young woman who was nicola maidens new flatmate and he himself had just completed an interview with her shed maintained that there was no lover in londonan assertion that lynley appeared to disputeand shed also suggested that the police have another chat with upman if they wanted to know why nicola maiden had decided to spend the summer in derbyshire to this hanken said we only have upmans word for it that the girl had a lover in the south thomas to which lynley replied but it doesnt make sense that shed drop out of law college in may yet spend the summer working for upman unless the two of them had something going on together do you have time to wring more information from him peter hanken was happydelighted in factto wring away at the smarmy sod but he sought some firm ground on which to base another interview with the buxton solicitor who so far hadnt called on his own lawyer to stand by his side during questioning but was likely to do so should he begin to believe that the investigation was tunneling in his direction nicola had a visitor just before she moved house from islington to fulham this would have been on the ninth of may lynley explained a man they had an argument they were overheard the man said hed see her dead before he let her do it do what hanken asked and lynley told him hanken listened to the story with a fair amount of incredulity midway through he said hells bells damn hang on thomas ill need to take some notes and he went from the garage into the kitchen where his wife was supervising his two daughters lunch while his infant son dozed in a baby carrier that was set on the work top clearing off a space next to sarah whod separated her egg sandwich into halves which she was smearing on her face he said right go on and began jotting down places activities and names he whistled softly as lynley told the tale of nicola maidens clandestine life as a london prostitute dazed he looked at his own young daughters as lynley explained the dead girls speciality he found that he felt torn by the need to make accurate notes and the desire to crush bella and sarah to his heartgrimy with egg mayonnaise though they wereas if by that action he could ensure that their future would be blessed with the safety of normalcy it was in fact in consideration of his girls that hanken said thomas what about maiden when lynley had concluded his remarks by explaining that his next move was going to be to track down vi nevins former flatmate shelly platt sender of the anonymous letters if he somehow found out that his daughter was turning tricks in london can you imagine what that would have done to him i think its more profitable to consider what that knowledge would have done to a man who thought he was her lover upman and brittoneven ferrerseem far more likely than andy for the role of nemesis not when you consider how a father thinks i gave her life what if he also thought her life was his to take away were talking about a cop peter a decent cop an exemplary cop without a single black mark on his whole career right fine but this situation has sod all to do with maidens career what if he went to london what if he stumbled on the truth what if he tried to talk her out of her lifestyleand i want to be sick even calling it a lifestylebut failed and knew there was only a single way to end it because thomas if he didnt end it the girls mum would have discovered it eventually and maiden couldnt abide the thought of what that would do to the woman he loves that goes for the others as well lynley countered upman and britton theyd want to talk her out of it and with far more reason christ peter sexual jealousy goes a greater distance than protecting a mother from having to hear the truth about her child you must see that he found that car out of sight behind a wall in the middle of the god damn bloody white peak pete the children hankens wife admonished him delivering glasses of milk to their daughters hanken nodded in acknowledgement as lynley said i know this man he doesnt have a violent bone in his body he had to leave the yard for gods sake because he couldnt stomach the job any longer so where and when did he develop the capacitythe blood lustto beat in his own childs skull lets do some digging on upman and brittonand ferrer if we have to theyre unknown quantities there are at least two hundred people at the yard who can testify that andy maiden isnt now the flatmatevi nevinis insisting we talk to upman again she may be temporising but i say we start with him it was hanken realised the logical place to begin but something about tackling the enquiry from that direction didnt feel right to him are you personalising this in some way i might very well ask the same of you was lynleys reply before hanken could argue the london di concluded the call with the information that terry coles black leather jacket was missing from the personal effects usted on the receipt that had been handed over to his mother on the previous morning it makes sense to have a thorough look for it among the crime scene evidence before we rally the troops he pointed out and then as if he wished to smooth over their disagreement he added what do you think ill see to that at this end hanken said the call concluded he looked at his family sarah and bella shredding their sandwiches and dipping the torn bits of bread into their milk pj awakening and beginning to fret for his own lunch and hankens own darling kathleen unbuttoning her blouse loosening the nursing bra and raising their son to her swollen breast they were a miracle to him his little family he would he knew go to any extreme to keep them from harm were richly blessed katie he said to his wife as she sat at the table where bella was inserting a carrot stick into her sisters right nostril sarah screamed in protest and startled pj he turned from his mothers milk and began to wail kathleen shook her head wearily its all in the definition i dare say she nodded at his mobile are you off again then afraid so darling what about the swings ill have the set up in time i promise he took the carrots away from his daughters grabbed a dish cloth from the sink and mopped up some of the mess theyd made on the kitchen table his wife cooed crooned and comforted pj bella and sarah made tentative peace after directing dc mott to paw through everything theyd taken from the murder site and after phoning the lab to make sure terry coles jacket hadnt been accidentally omitted from the list of clothing sent onward for analysis hanken set off to duel with will upman once more he found the solicitor in the narrow garage that abutted his home in buxton he was casually clad in jeans and a flannel shirt and he squatted next to a finelooking mountain bike whose chain and gear cluster he was attending to with a hose pipe a small spray bottle of solvent and a plastic bristle brush with one end shaped like a crescent he wasnt alone leaning against the bonnet of his car her eyes fixed on him with the unmistakable hunger of a woman desperate for a commitment a petite brunette was saying to him you did say half past twelve will and i know im not mistaken this time as hanken joined them upman said i couldnt have done darling id always planned to clean the bike so if youre ready for lunch this early it isnt early and itll be even less early by the time we get there damn it if you didnt want to go i just wish youd have told me for once joyce did i say did i even bloody hint that upman caught sight of hanken inspector he said rising and tossing the hose pipe to one side where it burbled water in a gentle stream from the garage out onto the driveway joyce this is inspector hanken buxton cid could you deal with the tap for me darling joyce sighed and saw to the water she returned to the car and took up position in front of one of its headlamps will she said ive been patient as a saint her tone implied upman flashed a smile at her work he said with a jerk of his head in hankens direction will you give us a few minutes joy lets forget the lunch and have something here we can drive over to chatsworth afterwards have a walk do some talking i have to pick up the kids by six i remember and well manage it no problem again the smile it was more intimate this time the kind of smile that a man uses when he wishes to suggest to a woman that he and she speak a special language understood only by the two of them it was mostly the language of bollocks hanken decided but joyce looked needy enough to accept the central theme such a language implied could you make us some sandwiches darling while im finishing here theres chicken in the fridge upman didnt mention hankens presence or the privacy that joyces removal to the kitchen would effect joyce sighed again all right this once but i wish youd start writing down the time when you want me to come over with the kids its not exactly easy to will do in future scouts honour he sent her an air kiss sorry she took it all in sometimes i wonder why i bother she said with absolutely no conviction we all know the answer to that hanken thought when shed taken herself off to prove herself in the housewife department upman went back to his mountain bike he squatted and sprayed solvent lightly on the gear cluster and along the chain the pleasant smell of lemons rose round them he spun the left pedal backwards as he sprayed running the chain through one revolution round the gears and when it was soaked he leaned back on his heels i cant think we have anything more to talk about he said to hanken ive told you what i know right and ive got what you know i want to hear what you think this time round upman took up the plastic brush from the floor about what he asked the maiden girl moved house in london four months ago she left law college round the same time and she had no plans to return to her studies she had in fact taken up an entirely new line of work what do you know about that about the new line of work nothing im afraid so why was she spending the summer doing the sort of job a law student takes in between terms for work experience it wasnt going to get her anywhere was it i dont know i didnt ask her those questions upman applied the brush to the bicycle chain meticulous with his cleaning efforts did you know shed left college hanken asked and when upman nodded he said exasperated gods teeth man whats the matter with you why didnt you tell us when we spoke to you yesterday upman glanced his way you didnt ask outright he said dryly and the implication was clear a man in his right mind never gave answers to questions that the police didnt ask all right my mistake im asking now did she tell you shed left college did she tell you why and when did she tell you upman scrutinised the bike chain as he worked upon it one inch at a time the grime that resulted from the marriage of offroad dust dirt and bicycle lubricant began to liquefy into soapy brown globs some of which plopped to the floor beneath the bike she phoned me in april upman said her dad and i had arranged her summer job last year in december this was i let her know then that i was selecting her on the strength of my friendshipwell acquaintance reallywith her father and i asked her to let me know at once if something more to her taste came along so i could offer the job to some other student id meant more to her taste in law but when she phoned in april she told me she was giving up the practise of law entirely shed got another job that she liked better she said more money less hours well dont we all want that she didnt say what it was she named a firm in london i dont remember what she called it we didnt dwell much on the subject just spoke for a few minutes mostly about the fact that she wouldnt be working for me in the summer but she ended up here anyway why did you talk her into it not at all she phoned again a few weeks later and said shed changed her mind about the job and could she work for me as previously arranged if i hadnt got anyone yet shed changed her mind about college no she was still leaving college i asked her that and she told me as much but i dont think she was ready to tell her parents they set a lot of store by her achievements well what parent doesnt and after all her dad had gone out of his way to arrange a job for her and she knew that the two of them were close and i think shed had second thoughts about letting him down when he was getting so much mileage from bragging about her my daughter the lawyer you know what i mean so why did you employ her if shed already left college if shed made it clear that she wouldnt be returning she wasnt a law student any longer why hire her as i know her dad i wasnt averse to going along with a little deception to spare his feelings if only for the time being why does that sound like pure cock to me upman you had something going with the maiden girl didnt you this summerjob rubbish was nothing but a blind and you damn well know what she was up to in london upman withdrew the crescent end of the brush from the bicycle chain it bled slick soapy residue onto the floor he looked at hanken i told you the truth yesterday inspector all right she was attractive and she was intelligent and the thought of having an attractive and intelligent young woman picking up the slack round the office from june till september didnt exactly set my teeth on edge she would be a visual diversion i thought and im not a man whos distracted from his own work by a pleasant visual diversion so when she wanted back in i was happy to have her as were my partners by the way have her did you say hell come on we arent playing at examinethehostilewitness theres no point to your trying to trap me with slips because im not hiding anything youre wasting your time where were you on the ninth of may hanken persisted upmans forehead furrowed the ninth id have to check my diary but i expect i had meetings with clients as usual why he looked over at hanken and appeared to take an accurate reading from the dfs face ah someone must have gone to london to see nicola is that right to talk her intoperhaps even to force her intoa scintillating summer in derbyshire taking depositions from housewives estranged from their husbands is that what you think he got to his feet and went for the hose pipe he turned on the tap and brought the nozzle back he directed a gentle spray at the bike chain moving it along and watching the muck wash away perhaps that was you hanken told him perhaps you wanted to keep her from her other employment perhaps you wanted to make sure you got thehe felt his lip curlvisual diversion you were looking for since she was so attractive and intelligent as you say youll have copies of my office diary on monday morning was upmans even reply names and phone numbers appended i hope whatever youd like upman nodded at the house at the door through which the longsuffering joyce had disappeared in case you hadnt noticed i already have attractive and intelligent women in my life inspector believe me i wouldnt have gone all the way to london to arrange for another but if your thoughts are heading in that direction you might want to consider who didnt have access to such a woman and i think we both know who that poor sod is teddy webster ignored his dads bark of an order since it came from the direction of the kitchen where his parents were still finishing up their lunch he knew he had a good quarter of an hour before the order came a second time and since his mum had made apple crumble as their sweet for oncea rare occurrence considering that her usual offering was a packet of fig newtons opened without ceremony and tossed into the centre of the table while she was clearing the plates awaythat quarter of an hour might stretch to thirty minutes in which case teddy would have plenty of time to watch the rest of the incredible hulk before his father shouted turn off that damn telly and get yourself out of the house right now i mean it teddy i want you out in the fresh air now now before i make you sorry ive had to repeat myself saturdays were always like that a boring daft repetition of every other boring daft saturday since theyd moved to the peaks what always happened on saturdays was this dad clumped round the house at half past seven bellowing about how fine it was to be out of the city at last and werent they all just bloody delighted to have fresh air to breathe and open spaces to explore and their countrys history and culture and tradition jumping out at them from every stupid pile of rocks in every dumb field only these werent fields were they these were moors and werent they all lucky and blessed and oh just bloody special to live in a place where they could set off north just beyond their own house and walk for six billion miles without ever seeing a single soul this wasnt a bit like liverpool was it kids this was heaven this was utopia this wasa place that sucked teddy thought and sometimes he said it which set his father off and made his mother cry and sent his sister into one of her fits where she started whingeing about how was she ever going to go to drama school and become a real actress if she had to live in the middle of nowhere like some sort of leper which really set dad off at full gallop and took the heat off teddy who always used the opportunity to slink to the television and tune in to fox kids which at the moment was featuring that alwayswicked moment when pencil dick dr david banner got his knickers twisted just enough by some ignorant yobbo that he went into one of those very cool fits where his eyes went backwards into his head and his arms and legs popped out of his clothes while his chest swelled up and his buttons flew off and he was beating the shit out of everyone in sight teddy sighed with pure happiness as the hulk made hash of his most recent tormentors it was exactly what teddy wished that he could do to those peabrain twits who met him at the school gates every morning and shadowed himtaunting poking tripping and shovingfrom the moment he set foot inside the school yard hed beat them to puke and guts and shit if he were the hulk hed take them one at a time or all at once it wouldnt matter because hed be more than seven feet tall and twentyfive stone of pure muscle and they wouldnt even know where hed come from or why and when they were sprawled out in their puke and their pee hed pick one of them up by his hair and hed say you leave teddy webster be you hear me or ill be back and hed thump that arsehole back to the ground and step on his face as he walked away and thengod damn it ted i want you out of here teddy scrambled to his feet so deeply into his fantasy had he sunk that he hadnt noticed his dad come into the sitting room it was nearly the end he said hastily i wanted to see how it his father held up a pair of scissors he grabbed the flex from the back of the telly i didnt bring my family to the country to have them spend their free time with their noses glued to the television you have fifteen seconds to get out of this house or the flex gets cut permanently dad i just wanted you need a hearing test ted he shot towards the door but there he paused what about carrie why doesnt she your sisters doing her school prep would you like to do yours or will you be going outside to play teddy knew that carrie was no more doing her school prep than he was preparing to perform brain surgery but he also knew when he was defeated he said play dad and he trudged outside giving himself full marks for not sneaking on his sister she was in her room mooning over flicks and writing loony love letters to some loonier actor it was a bloody stupid way to spend her time but teddy understood she had to do something to keep the bats from her brain telly did that for him watching telly felt good besides what else was there to do he knew better than to ask dad that question though when hed asked it at firstshortly after theyd moved here from liverpoolthe answer had been having a chore assigned to him so teddy no longer asked for suggestions when it came to free time he took himself outside and shut the door but not before he allowed himself the satisfaction of casting a baleful look over his shoulder as his father retreated into the kitchen for his own good were the last words teddy heard from his dad and he knewwith despairwhat those four words meant theyd come to the country because of him a fat little kid who wore pebble specs who had pimples on his legs and braces on his teeth and breasts like a girl who got bullied in school from day one hed overheard the big plan when his parents were making it if hes in the country hell be able to exercise hell want to exerciseboys are like that judyand then hell lose the weight he wont have to worry about being seen while hes exercising the way he does here and itll be good for all of us anyway i dont know frank teddys mum was the doubtful kind she didnt like disruptions and a move to the country was disruption times ten but teddys dad had his mind made up so here they were on a sheep farm where the sheep and the land were rented out to a farmer who lived in peak forest which was the nearest thing to a town within miles except it wasnt a town it wasnt even a village it was a handful of houses a church a pub and a grocery where if a bloke decided to sneak a packet of crisps for an afternoon snackeven if the bloke paid for them mind youthat blokes mum was sure to hear about it by six oclock in the evening and thered be hell to pay teddy hated it the vast empty space that stretched into forever on every side the great dome of sky that went pewter with fog on a moments notice the wind that whipped round the house all night and rattled his bedroom window like aliens trying to get in the sheep that bleated like something was wrong but ran off the first time you took a step towards them he just bloody hated the place and as teddy left the house and plodded into the yard a piece of gritshot by the wind like a missileflew past his glasses exploded into his eye and made him yowl he hated this place he removed his glasses and used the bottom of his tshirt against his eye it stung it burned and his sense of grievance grew blurry of vision he stumbled to the back of the house where the saturday morning washing was flapping and snapping on the line that was strung from the eaves to a rusteaten pole near a crumbling drystone wall pooey phooey poop teddy muttered on the ground near the house he found a long thin branch he scooped this up and it became a sword he used it as he advanced on the washing a row of his dads jeans his target stay where you are he hissed at them im armed you lot and if you think you can take me alive ha take that and that and that theyd come from the death star to deal with him they knew that he was the last of the jedi if they could just get him out of the way the emperor would be able to rule the universe but they couldnt kill him absolutely no way they were under orders to take him captive so that he could be made an example to all rebels in the star system well ha and ha they would never take him because he had a laser sword and swish swish lash and swish but omigod hang on now they had laser guns and they didnt want to capture him at all they wanted to kill him and eeeeooooowww he was completely outnumbered runrunrun teddy turned and fled waving his sword in the air he sought the protection of the drystone wall that fronted the property and edged the road with a leap he was over his heart pounded his ears throbbed safe he thought hed gone into light speed and left the imperial star troopers behind hed landed on an undiscovered planet theyd never find him here in a zillion years he would be an emperor now whoosh something whizzed by on the road teddy blinked the wind pummeled him like an angry ghosts fists bringing water to his eyes he couldnt quite see but still it looked like no it couldnt be teddy peered to the right and to the left he realised with horror where hed landed this wasnt a brandnew planet at all hed taken himself into jurassic park and what had lightninged by with the fury of hunger driving it was a velociraptor homing in on something for the kill omigod omigod and he had nothing with him no highpowered rifle no weapon of any kind just a stupid old stick and what good would that be against a dinosaur with human flesh on its mind he had to hide one velociraptor didnt exist without another nearby and two meant twenty or a hundred a thousand omigod he tore along the road a short distance ahead he saw his safety a yellow bin stood in the weeds on the verge he could hide in there till the danger passed whoosh whoosh more raptors tore by as teddy flung his body inside the bin he lowered himself and brought the lid down hed seen what raptors could do to a person teddy had they tore at flesh and sucked out eyeballs and crunched bones like they were mcdonalds french fries and they liked tenyearold boys the best he had to do something he had to save himself he crouched within the safety of the bin and tried to come up with a plan the bin held the remainder of last years grit some six inches of it left over from the winter when it was used on the road so that car tyres didnt slide on the ice teddy could feel the pebbles and shards of it biting into the palms of his hands could he use the grit could he make it a weapon could he ball it up into a nasty missile that he could throw at the raptors and hurt them enough for them to leave him alone if he did that he would then have time tohis fingers grabbed on to something hard something buried three inches into the grit it was slender and palmsized and when he dug round it he was able to free it and to bring it up into the weak light that came through the yellow walls of his hiding place wicked he thought what a find he was saved it was a knife julian britton was doing what he always did at the end of a mountain rescue he was checking his equipment as he put it away but he wasnt being as thorough or as careful as he usually was when organising and repacking his gear his thoughts were far away from ropes boots picks hammers compasses maps and everything else they used when someone got lost or someone else got injured and a team was required to find them his thoughts were on her on nicola on what had been and what could have been had she only acted the appropriate part in the drama hed written for their relationship but i love you hed said to her and even to his own ears the four words had sounded pathetic and stricken and i love you back shed replied kindly shed even taken his hand and held itpalm upwardsas if she intended to place something within it only its not enough the kind of love i feel for you and the kind of love you wantand deserveto have jules well it isnt the sort of love im likely to feel for anyone but im good for you youve said it enough times over the years thats enough isnt it cant the other sort of lovethe sort youre talking about cant it grow from there i mean were friends were companions were for gods sake were lovers and if that doesnt mean we have something special together hell what does shed sighed shed looked out of the car window to the darkness he could see her reflection in the glass jules ive become an escort she said do you know what that means the statement and the question had come out of nowhere so for a moment hed thought ridiculously of tour guides travel escorts who stand at the front of a coach and speak into a microphone as the vehicle lumbers round the countryside with tourists crammed into its seats youre traveling hed asked im seeing men for money she replied i spend the evening with them sometimes i spend the night i go to hotels and pick them up and we do what they want whatever they want then they pay me they give me two hundred pounds an hour fifteen hundred pounds if i sleep in their beds for the night he stared at her he heard her clearly but his brain refused to assimilate the information he said i see you have someone else in london then she said jules youre not listening to me i am you said youre hearing not listening men pay me for companionship to go out on dates you could call them dates dinner the theatre a gallery opening or business party when someone wants a nicelooking woman on his arm they pay me for that and they pay me for sex as well and depending on what i do to them when it comes to sex they pay me quite a lot more than i would ever have imagined possible for fucking a relative stranger to be honest with you the words were like bullets and he reacted as he would have done had she fired a volley through his body he went into shock not the normal sort of shock when ones system has undergone a physical trauma like a motor accident or a fall from a barn roof but the sort of shock that shatters the psyche so that one can take in only a single detail and that detail is usually the least dangerous to ones peace so what he saw was her hair how the light was behind it and how it shone through individual strands so that she looked like an earthbound angel but what she was telling him was far from angelic it was foul and disgusting and she continued to tell him and he continued to die no one forced me into it she said as she took a boiled sweet from her bag the escort stuff or the other the sex it was my decision once i saw the possibilities and once i knew how much i had to offer i started out just having drinks with them dinner sometimes or the theatre all on the up and up you know a few hours of conversation and someone to listen to reply if they wanted and to look starryeyed otherwise but they always askedevery one of themif i would do more at first i thought no i couldnt i didnt know them after all and i always thought i mean i couldnt imagine doing it with someone that i didnt actually know but then one of them asked if he could just touch me fifty pounds for putting his hand in my knickers and feeling my bush a smile when i had a bush back then before you know so i let him and it wasnt half bad it was rather funny in fact i started laughingthis was inside not openly mind youbecause it seemed so just so silly this blokeolder than my dad he wasbreathing heavy and going all tearyeyed because he had his hand in my crotch so when he said touch me back please i told him that would be fifty pounds more he said oh god anything so i obliged one hundred pounds for feeling his willie and letting him poke round my bush with his fingers stop hed finally managed the words but she was eager to make him understand they were friends after all theyd always been friends theyd been mates from the moment theyd met in bakewell she a seventeenyearold schoolgirl with an attitude and a strut to her walk that had always said im open to anything only he hadnt seen that until this moment and he nearly three years her senior home from university for the holidays and consumed with worry about his fathers drinking and a house that was falling down round their ears but nicola hadnt seen his worries then shed seen only an opportunity for some fun which shed taken happily he understood that now what im trying to explain is that its a way of life that works for me at the moment it wont always of course but it does today and because it does im grabbing it jules i would be every sort of fool if i didnt youve gone bloody mad was his numb assessment londons done this to you you need to come home nick you need to be with friends you need help she looked at him blankly its obvious isnt it somethings wrong you cant be in your right mind and be selling your body night after night several times a night frequently hed clutched at his head jesus nick you need to talk to someone let me find a doctor a psychiatrist i wont tell anyone why itll be our secret and when youve recovered julian she drew his hands from his head theres nothing wrong with me if i thought i was having relationships with these men thered be something wrong if i thought i was on the path to true love thered be something wrong if i was trying to avenge a wrong or hurt someone else or live in a fantasy id need to be carted to the madhouse straightaway but thats not how it is im doing this because i enjoy it because im paid well because my body has something to offer men and while its silly to me that theyd pay me to get it im perfectly willing to hed hit her then god forgive him but hed hit her because he was desperate to make her stop so he struck her in the face with a hard closed fist and her head flew back and hit the window then they stared at each other she with her fingertips at the point where his knuckles had met her face he with his left hand holding those knuckles and in his ears a high loud singing like the whining of car tyres caught in a skid and there was nothing to say not a single word to excuse what hed done to excuse what she was doing to both of them with the choices she was making and the life she was living still hed tried where did this come from hed asked hoarsely because it had to come from somewhere nick its not how normal people live a nasty skeleton in the closet dyou mean shed replied lightly fingers still at her cheek her voice was the same but her eyes had changed as if she was seeing him differently like the enemy hed thought and hed despaired right to the soles of his feet because he loved her so no jules i havent got any convenient excuses no one to blame no one to accuse just a few experiences that led to other experiences just exactly as i told you first an escort then a brief little grope and feel then she smiled then on from there he read the truth of who she was in that instant you must despise us all men what we want what we do shed reached for his hand it was still clenched and she unclenched it she raised it to her lips and kissed the knuckles that hed used to bruise her you are who you are she said julian its the same for me but he couldnt accept the simplicity of that statement he railed against it and he railed against her and he determined to change her no matter the cost she would see reason hed decided she would get help if thats what it took shed got death instead a fair trade some would argue for what she offered life julian felt numb as he packed his mountain rescue equipment away in its haversack his mind was swarming with memories and he was willing to do just about anything to silence the voices in his head distraction arrived in the person of his father who toddled along the first floor passageway just as julian was placing his haversack into the old mule trunk jeremy britton clutched a glass in one hand which was no surprise and a fan of brochures in the other which was he said ah mboy here you are then have you a minute for your dad his speech was clear which caused julian to eye his fathers drinking glass curiously the colourless liquid suggested gin or vodka but the glass was large enough to hold at least eight ounces of fluid and since it was threequarters empty and since jeremy would have never splashed so meagre an amount into a glass whose volume could have held more and since he wasnt slurring his words it could only mean that the glass didnt hold either vodka or gin at all which in turn had to mean julian rattled his own head mentally god he was losing it by leaps and by bounds sure he did his best not to eye the glass or to sniff its contents jeremy smiled lifted the glass and said water julie the old local aitchtwoandoh id nearly forgotten the taste of it the sight of his father drinking water was akin to having a vision of the ascension into heaven while hiking on the moor water best there is you ever notice my boy how the flavour of water taken off our own land tastes sweeter than what you can get from a bottle bottled water i mean he added with a smile evian perrier you know he tipped the glass up and swigged down a mouthful he smacked his lips spare a bit of time for your dad i want to ask your advice old chap puzzled wary amazed at the change in his fatherprompted it seemed to julian by nothing at allhe followed him into the parlour there jeremy sat in his usual chair after pulling another round to face it he gestured for julian to take that place julian did so hesitantly didnt notice at lunch did you jeremy asked notice what water nothing else thats what i was drinking didnt you see sorry ive had things on my mind but im glad of it dad good for you brilliant jeremy nodded looking pleased with himself had a think over the past week julie and heres what it is im going to take the cure ive been thinking about it since oh i dont know since when and i think its time you re going to stop drinking youre going to stop drinking enough is enough i been ive been blotto for something like thirtyfive years thought id try the next thirtyfive sober as a judge his father had made this claim before but hed usually made the claim when either drunk or hung over this time he seemed neither youre going to go to aa julian asked there were meetings in bakewell others in buxton in matlock and in chapelenlefrith more than once julian had phoned each town to get schedules of meetings that were sent to the manor house and then thrown away thats what i want to talk to you about jeremy said how best for me to beat the devil forever this time heres what i think julie and he handed over the fan of brochures hed been holding spreading them out on julians knees thesere clinics he said dryout houses you check in for a monthtwo or three if you need itand you take the cure proper diet proper exercise sessions with the resident shrink thats where you start detox once youve done the dance steps youre into aa have a look mboy tell me what you think julian didnt need to look to know what he thought the clinics were private they were expensive and there was no money to pay for them unless he gave up his work on broughton manor sold off the harriers and got a proper job it would be the end of his dream to bring the estate back to life if he sent his father to a clinic jeremy was watching him hopefully i know i could do it this time mboy i feel it in my gut you know how that is with a little help ill do it ill beat the devil at his own game you dont think aas enough to help you julian said because you see dad in order to send you to a place like this i mean i can check our insurance and i will absolutely but i rather think they wont pay we have the most basic health insurance you know unless youd like me to he didnt want to do it and the guilt of his reluctance felt like a gouge incised on his soul but he made himself say it this was after all his father in front of him i could stop work on the estate i could get a proper job jeremy reached forward and hastily gathered up the brochures i dont want that great scot julie i dont want that i want broughton manor back in its glory like you do i wont take you from that son no ill make do but if you think you need a clinic i do i do id get squared away proper and have a foundation but if theres no moneyand god knows i believe you boythen theres no money and thats an end to it perhaps another day jeremy stuffed the brochures into his jacket pocket he gave his gaze moodily to the fireplace money he murmured damn me if it doesnt always come down to money the parlour door opened samantha entered it was quite as if shed heard her cue chapter sorry luvs members only was how lynley and nkata were greeted at a lectern at the top of a staircase in wandsworth this led into the dark cavity that appeared to be the entrance to the stocks and it was being guarded in the early afternoon by a matronly woman doing needlepoint aside from her curious ensemble which consisted of a black leather sheath with a silver zip lowered to her waist and exposing pendulous breasts of an unappealing chickenskin texture she could have been somebodys grandmother and she probably was she had grey hair that looked crimped for sundays church services and halfmoon glasses at the end of her nose she looked up over them at the two detectives and added unless youre wanting to join is that it here have a look then she handed each of them a brochure the stocks lynley read was a private club for discriminating adults who enjoyed the diversion of domination for a modest yearly fee they would be offered access to a world in which their most private fantasies could become their most exciting realities in an atmosphere of light food drink and music whilst surrounded by likeminded enthusiasts they could live out witness or participate in the realisation of mankinds darkest dreams their identities and professions would be scrupulously protected by a management committed to complete discretion whilst their every desire would be seen to by a staff devoted to accommodating their needs the stocks was open from noon until four am from monday to saturday bank holidays included sundays were given to worship the worship of what lynley wondered but he didnt ask he slipped the brochure into his jacket pocket smiled affably said thank you ill keep it in mind and took out his warrant card police wed like a word with your barman black leather sheath wasnt exactly cerberus but she knew her cue she said this is a private club for members only sir this isnt a disorderly house by any means no one gets by me without showing his membership card and when someone wants to join he must bring with him a picture id that includes his date of birth we only give memberships to consenting adults and our employees are thoroughly vetted for police records prior to being hired when she drew breath lynley spoke madam if we wanted to close you down you cant as ive said this is a private club weve got a solicitor from liberty so we know our rights lynley aimed for patience with his reply im very glad of that i find that the average man on the average street is remarkably uninformed but as youre not in that position yourself youll know that if we wanted to close you down or even attempt to do so wed hardly present ourselves at the entrance with our identifications my colleague and i are in cid not in undercover investigations next to lynley nkata shuffled on his feet he was looking as if he didnt quite know where to direct his eyes the elderly womans décolletage was directly in his line of vision and hed probably never had the opportunity to examine flesh less suitable for examination were trying to locate someone called shelly platt lynley explained to the woman we were told your barman knows her whereabouts if youll fetch him we can talk to him right here or we can go below the choice is yours hes working she said as are we lynley smiled and the sooner we talk to him the sooner we take our work elsewhere reluctantly she said right and punched a number on the phone she spoke into the receiver but she kept her eyes glued to nkata and lynley as if theyd bolt for the staircase otherwise she said i got two busies up here wanting to find a shelly platt they say you know her no cid dyou want to come up or shall i youre sure right will do she replaced the receiver and inclined her head towards the stairs down you go she said he cant leave the bar as were shorthanded at the moment he can give you five minutes he said his name lynley asked you can call him lash is that mr lash lynley enquired soberly to which the woman disciplined a smile from twitching her lips she said youve a pretty enough face luv but dont push your luck they descended the stairs into a passageway where red lights hung above bare walls painted black at the end of this corridor a black velvet curtain hung over a doorway and through this evidently lay the stocks music filtered through the velvet like beams of light not the raucous heavy metal of punk guitars screeching like robots put to the rack but what sounded like a gregorian devotional chanted by monks on their way to prayer it was louder than monks would have chanted it however as if volume rather than meaning were what was required by the ceremony going on agnus dei qui tollis peccata mundi the voices sang as if in answer a whip cracked like a pistol shot ah welcome to the world ofs and m lynley said to nkata as he drew the curtain to one side lord whats my mum goin tsay to all this was the dcs response on an early saturday afternoon lynley expected the club to be deserted but that wasnt the case although he suspected that nightfall would bring many more members slithering out from beneath whatever stones they hid during the day there were still present enough devotees of the dungeon to get an idea of what the stocks was like when filled to capacity central to the club was the eponymous mediaeval device of public punishment it had positions for five miscreants but on this saturday only one sinner was paying the price for a malefaction a thickset man with a shiny bald head was being whipped by a barrelshaped woman shouting naughty naughty naughty with every blow he was naked she wore a black leather corset to which lace stockings were fastened on her feet were shoes with heels so high that she could have toedanced with very little effort up above them a light fixture revolved it was fitted with spots one of which pooled illumination directly downwards round the stocks and others which were appendant like arms and which revolved as the fixture did and slowly illuminated the rest of the action within the club oh my nkata murmured lynley couldnt fault the dcs reaction to the rhythms of the gregorian chant several men in dog collars attached to leads were being led round the club by fiercelooking women in black bodysuits or leather gstrings and thighhigh boots an elderly gentleman in a nazi uniform was attaching something to the testicles of a naked younger man manacled to a black brick wall while a woman strapped to a nearby rack writhed and shouted more as a steaming substance was poured from a tin jug onto her bare chest and between her legs a blowsy blonde in a pvc waistcoat with a cinchedin waist stood arms akimbo on one of the clubs tables as a leathermasked man in a metal gstring ran his tongue round the spike heels of her patent leather shoes and while these activities were going on in nooks in crannies and in the open a costume stall appeared to be doing a satisfactory business with club members who were hiring everything from cardinals red cassocks to catsoninetails next to lynley nkata took out a snowy handkerchief and pressed it quickly to his forehead lynley eyed him for a man who once organised brixtons knife fights youve led something of a sheltered existence winston lets see what lash has to say for himself the man in question seemed completely oblivious of the activities going on in the club he didnt acknowledge the presence of the two detectives until hed counted six shots of gin into a shaker added vermouth and dashed into the mix a few splashes of juice from ajar of green olives he screwed the cap onto the cocktail shaker and began to do the shaking which was when he looked their way as one of the revolving lights hit him lynley saw where the mans sobriquet had come from a ragged scar ran from his forehead and across one of his eyelids cutting a swathe that had removed the tip of his nose and half his upper lip slash would probably have been more appropriate since the scar was obviously the legacy of a knife but hed no doubt wished to stay with the theme of the club lash suggested that an element of the voluntary had been involved in his maiming lash looked not at lynley but at nkata abruptly he set the cocktail shaker to one side fuck he snarled i should of killed you when i had you demon that ransom idea was bullshit on wheels lynley looked at his dc curiously you two know each other we clearly nkata was seeking a delicate way of framing the information for his superior officer we met once or twice in the lotments near windmill gardens nkata said some years back this was weeding out dandelions from the lettuce patch i dare say lynley noted dryly lash snorted we as doing some weeding true enough he said and then to nkata i always wondered where you wanked off to i might of guessed itd be to something like this he took a step towards them and peered more closely at nkata his misshapen lips suddenly parted in what went for his smile you sod he cried giving a bark of happy laughter i knew i marked you that night i swore up and down all that blood wasnt mine you marked me nkata said congenially tapping the scar that ran across his cheek he extended his hand how are you dewey dewey lynley wondered lash dewey said right then lash you straight or what or what lash said and smiled again he took nkatas offered hand and shook it saying i just bloody knew i marked you deme you as good with a knife shit just take a look at this mug if you dont believe me this last was said to lynley and then back to nkata but i was always fast with the razor true enough that is nkata said what dyou lot want with shelly platt then lash grinned cant be looking for her usual wed like to talk to her about a murder lynley said nicola maiden is the name familiar lash considered this as he poured martinis into four glasses arranged on a tray he speared on toothpicks two stuffed green olives per glass and plopped them into the cocktails before replying sheila he barked its up and when the barmaid teetered over in platform boots and a fishnet teddy that showed far more than it could ever conceal he slid the tray to her and turned back to the detectives great name maiden for this sort of place id of remembered no dont know her shelly did apparently and now shes dead shellys no killer a bitch and a tart with a temper like a cobra but shes never done harm that i ever heard wed like to speak to her nonetheless i understand shes a habitué of the club if shes not here now you might want to tell us where we can find her i cant think youd like us hanging about till she arrives lash glanced at nkata he always talk like that born to it he was shit that must put the mockers on your style i cope nkata said can you help us out dew lash lash right i forget can lash said for old times and the like but you didnt hear it from me that straight got it nkata said and he took out his neat little leather notebook lash grinned chrisamighty you are legit eh keep it to yourself mate wont you shit demon of death a cop he chuckled shelly platt worked the streets round earls court station he said but at this time of day they wouldnt find her there she did the dusktodawn shift and that being the case theyd find her kipping in what went for her lodgings he recited the address they nodded their thanks and slipped out of the club where once in the blackwalled corridor they saw that a partitioned section of the passage had been opened what had appeared to be an expanse of plaster painted in funereal hue was now folded to one side and in its place was a small shop with a counter stretching its width behind this stood a ghoulish woman with purple hair worn in a style reminiscent of the bride of frankenstein her lips and eyelids were highlighted in black body studs erupted from her face and her ears like a fatal visitation of the kings evil off your patch you lot the woman said with a smirk as lynley and nkata passed her but i cn make it worth your while calling in if youve a mind for it lynleys attention went to the goods she had on offer in her shop displayed within was everything from sex toys to pornographic videos the counter itself was a glass case decorated with an artful arrangement of jars containing shaft the personal lubricant as well as leather and metal devices of various shapes and sizes upon whose use lynley didnt care to speculate but as he passed he caught sight of one of these devices and his footsteps slowed then halted altogether he squatted in front of the case nkata said spector in the agonised tone of a schoolboy whose parent has committed an unforgivable indiscretion hang on winnie lynley said and to the purplehaired woman what is this please he pointed and she brought out a chrome cylinder it was identical to the one hed found among the items taken from nicola maidens car this she said proudly is imported from paris this is nice dont you think lovely lynley agreed what is it a ball stretcher a what she grinned she brought out a lifesize anatomically correct male blowup doll from the floor behind the counter and stood him up saying to nkata hold him upright will you hes generally on his back but in a pinch and for a demo hey grab him by the bum or something hes not going to bite you luv ill keep mum about it lynley said to nkata sotto voce your every secret is safe with me funny you are nkata said i never touched any blokes bum plastic or otherwise ah first times are always the most anxietyladen arent they lynley smiled please help the lady out nkata winced but did as shed asked him hands on the plastic buttocks of the doll who was turned sideways and stood astride the counter right the shop assistant said watch this then she took the ball stretcher in hand and unscrewed the two eyebolts on either side of it this allowed it to open on its hinge so that it could be fastened neatly round the scrotum of the plastic doll leaving its testicles dangling beneath then she took the eyebolts and replaced them explaining that the dom screwed them in as far as the sub wanted increasing the pressure on the scrotum until the sub asked for mercy or said whatever predetermined word had been agreed upon to cease the torture you cn hang weights here as well she said pleasantly indicating the loops of the eyebolts it all depends on what you like and how much it takes to get you ready for relief most blokes generally want beatings as well but then thats blokes isnt it shll i wrap one up for you lynley fought back a smile at the thought of presenting helen with such a souvenir of his days activity perhaps another time well you know where to find us she told him out on the street once more nkata breathed out a gusty sigh never thought id see something like that whole place gave me the wimwams man demon of death who would think that someone meeting mr lash for a bout of knife play would go faint at the sight of a little torture nkatas lips twitched then he grinned outright you call me demon in public man our relationship is finished i stand advised come along then it was barbara havers decided ridiculous to trek all the way back to the yard once shed bought her lunch off a cart selling stuffed pita bread at the end of walkers court after all cork street was so close at hand indeed tucked just to the northwest of the royal academy cork street was nothing more than a hop skip and jump from the car park where barbara had deposited her mini prior to seeking out soho square and since she was going to have to pay for a full hour of parking time whether she used the full hour or not it seemed much more admirably economical to trot over to cork street right then while she was in the area rather than to return at the end of the day when shed dutifullynot to mention uselesslyslogged through a few more hours at the computer terminal she dug out the business card that shed found in terry coles flat and confirmed the name of the gallery that was engraved on it bowers it read with an address on cork street and neil sitwell beneath that time to see what terry cole had wanted or hoped for when hed collected the card she sauntered along old compton street crossed over into brewer street and dodged the saturday shoppers the traffic surging up from piccadilly circus and the tourists seeking the café royal on regent street she found bowers without any difficulty because an enormous lorry parked directly in front of it in cork street was blocking traffic and incurring the ire of a taxi driver who was shouting imprecations at two men unloading a crate onto the pavement barbara ducked inside what appeared to be not a galleryas shed originally supposed from the card the address printed upon the card and terrys artistic aspirationsbut instead an auction house not unlike christies apparently an auction was in some stage of preparation and the goods on offer were what was being unloaded from the lorry that was parked outside these were paintings in ornate gilt frames and they were everywhere stacked in crates propped against counters hanging on walls and lying on the floor stepping around them and among them bluesmocked employees with clipboards in their hands made notations which seemed to relegate each piece to areas signposted with the words frame damage restoration and suitable behind a counter a glass notice board was hung with posters that advertised past and future auctions in addition to paintings the house had sold to the highest bidder everything from farms in the irish republic to silver jewelry and objets dart bowers was much larger than it looked from the street where two windows and a door suggested entrance to a humbler establishment in reality inside one room appeared to open into another and that one to another all the way to the top of old bond street barbara wandered through looking for someone who could point her in the direction of neil sitwell sitwell turned out to be the majordomo of the days activities he was a rotund figure with a rug on his head that made him look like a bloke wearing yesterdays road kill when barbara came upon him he was on his haunches inspecting a frameless painting of three hunting dogs capering beneath an oak tree hed placed his clipboard on the floor and stuck his hand through a large rip in the canvas that ran from the right corner like a bolt of lightning or a commentary on the work itself barbara thought it looked to her like a fairly dismal effort sitwell withdrew his hand and called out take this to restoration tell them well want it in six weeks to a youngish assistant who was rushing by with several other paintings stacked in his arms right mr sitwell the boy called back will do in a tick thesere going to suitable ill be right back sitwell shoved himself to his feet he nodded at barbara and then at the painting hed been inspecting itll go for ten thousand youre joking she said is it the painter its the dogs you know the english cant abide them myself dogs that is what can i do for you id like a word if theres a place we can talk a word about what were overwhelmed at the moment and weve two more deliveries coming in this afternoon a word about murder barbara offered him her identification presto his attention was hers he ushered her up a cramped stairway where his office occupied a cubbyhole overlooking the showrooms it was furnished simply with a desk two chairs and a filing cabinet its only decorationsif they could be called suchwere the walls these had been covered with cork board from floor to ceiling and on them were pinned and stapled a veritable history of the enterprise in which mr sitwell worked it appeared that the auction house had a distinguished past but like a less noticed child in a home of highachieving siblings it needed to shout about itself to be heard above the notoriety given to sothebys and christies barbara brought sitwell quickly up to speed with regard to the death of terry cole a young manfound dead in derbyshirehad evidently kept a business card with neil sitwells name on it among his belongings she said would mr sitwell have any idea why that was the case he was something of an artist barbara added helpfully a sculptor he banged about with gardening tools and farming implements for his sculptures i mean thats how you might have met him prhaps at a show does this sound familiar not in the least im afraid sitwell said i attend openings naturally one likes to keep abreast of whats current in the art world its rather like honing ones instincts for what will sell and what wont but thats my avocationfollowing the latest trendsnot my main line of work since were an auction house and not a gallery idve had no reason to give a young artist my business card because you dont auction modern art you mean because we dont auction work by unestablished artists for obvious reasons barbara mulled this over wondering if terry cole had attempted to present himself as an established sculptor this seemed unlikely and while cilia thompson had claimed the sale of at least one of her rebarbative pieces it didnt seem likely that an auction house would be trying to win her over by wooing her flatmate instead could he have come hereor even met you elsewherefor another reason then sitwell steepled his fingertips beneath his chin weve been looking for a qualified picture restorer for the past three months as he was an artist im using the word in its broadest sense barbara cautioned the man right i understand well as he considered himself an artist perhaps he knew something about restoring pictures and came here for an interview with me hang on he wrestled a black engagement diary from the top middle drawer of his desk he began going back through the pages running his index finger down the days as he examined the appointments listed for each no cole terry or terence im afraid no cole at all he turned next to a dented metal box in which index cards were filed behind dogeared alphabetical dividers he explained that it was his habit to keep the names and addresses of individuals whose talents hed deemed useful to bowers in one way or another and perhaps terence cole was among those individuals but no his name wasnt among those on the index cards either he was terribly sorry neil sitwell said but it didnt appear that he was going to be able to assist the detective constable with her enquiry at all barbara tried a last question was it possible she asked that terry cole had come across mr sitwells business card in another way from what shed learned from speaking to the boys mother and sister he had dreams of opening his own art gallery so perhaps hed run into mr sitwell somewhere got into a conversation with him and found himself on the receiving end of one of mr sitwells cards with an invitation to call in sometime for a chat and some advice barbara said it all encouragingly without much hope of striking gold but when she said the words opening his own art gallery sitwell held up an index finger as if a memory had been jarred loose in his brain yes yes the art gallery of course i remember it was because you first said he was a sculptor you see the young man never identified himself as a sculptor when he came to see me or even an artist for that matter he only confided that he hoped you remember him barbara broke in eagerly it seemed like a rather dubious plan for someone who spoke sositwell glanced at her and quickly shifted gearswell who dressed so sitwell hesitated altogether caught between the devil and the deep blue sea clearly he realised that he was bordering on giving offence barbaras accent betrayed her origins which were very nearly identical to those of terry cole and as to her manner of dress she didnt need a fulllength mirror to tell her she was no candidate for vogue right he wore black all the time and had a workingclass accent barbara said goatee cropped hair a black ponytail yes that was the chap sitwell confirmed hed been at bowers the previous week hed brought along a sample of something that he thought the house might wish to auction the proceeds of such an auction hed confided would help him fund the gallery that he wished to open a sample of something to auction barbaras first thought went to the box of call girl cards that shed found beneath terry coles bed stranger things had been sold to the public but she wasnt sure she could name any of them what was it not one of his sculptures a piece of sheet music sitwell replied he said hed read about someone selling a handwritten lennon and mccartney songor a notebook of lyrics something like thatand hed hoped to sell a packet of music he had in his possession the sheet he showed me was part of that packet lennon and mccartney music dyou mean no this was a piece by michael chandler the boy told me hed got a dozen more and was hoping for an auction i expect he was imagining a scene in which several thousand fans of musical theatre queue up for hours hoping for the chance to pay twenty thousand pounds for a sheet of paper on which a dead man once made a few pencil smudges sitwell smiled offering barbara the sort of expression he must have offered terry one of tolerant and paternalistic derision she itched to smack him she restrained herself so the music was worthless barbara asked not at all sitwell went on to explain that the music might have been worth a fortune but it made no difference because it belonged to the chandler estate no matter how it happened to come into terry coles possession so bowers couldnt auction it off unless the chandler estate authorised a sale in which case the money would go to the surviving chandlers anyway so how did the music come to be in his possession oxfam jumble sale i dont know people sometimes throw out valuable belongings without realising dont they or they shove them away in a suitcase or a cardboard box and the suitcase or box falls into someone elses hands at any rate the boy didnt say and i didnt ask i did offer to track down the solicitors for the chandler estate and turn the music over to them to pass on to the widow and children but cole preferred to do that himself hopinghe saidthat thered be a reward at least for handing over found property found property thats what he called it the only question the boy had at the end of their meeting was to enquire how best to find the chandler solicitors sitwell had directed him to kingryder productions sinceas everyone whod been even moderately conscious for the last two decades knewmichael chandler and david kingryder had been partners until michael chandlers untimely death i suppose i should have pointed him towards the kingryder estate as well come to think of it sitwell said contemplatively adding poor sod in apparent reference to david kingryders suicide earlier that summer but as the production companys still up and running i thought it made sense to start with them what barbara thought an intriguing wrinkle she wondered if it was on the blanket of the murder or part of another bed entirely into her silence sitwell waxed apologetic he was sorry he couldnt be more helpful thered been nothing sinister about the boys visit nothing exceptional about it either sitwell had forgotten altogether that hed ever met him and he still couldnt say how terry cole had come to have his business card because he still couldnt recall ever handing him one he took one barbara said and indicated a card holder on sitwells desk with a nod of her head oh i see i dont remember him doing so but i suppose he might have i wonder why for his chewing gum she told him thinking and thank god for that she made her way back out to the street there she dug out of her bag the roster of employees that dick long had given her at soho square the list was alphabetical by employee surname it included the office telephone number of the person in question the home address and phone number and the organisation for which each individual worked barbara scanned the list till shed come up with what she was looking for kingryder productions she read next to the tenth name down bingo she thought security was nonexistent at shelly platts address she lived not far from earls court station in a conversion that had once been protected by the sort of door whose lock could be released by a resident pushing a buzzer from within an individual flat now however the door stood open when in an automatic response to seeing it ajar lynley paused to examine its locking mechanism he saw that while the door itself had the requisite parts the jamb that surrounded it had been destroyed sometime in the past the door was still capable of swinging shut but it caught upon nothing burgle at will could have been the buildings epigraph there was no lift so lynley and nkata headed for the stairs at the far end of the corridor shelly lived on the fourth floor which gave both men an opportunity to assess their physical condition nkatas was better lynley discovered his lips had never so much as tasted tobacco that abstinencenot to mention the mans insufferable youthshowed but nkata was considerate enough to mention neither although the blasted man did pretend to pause on the second floor mezzanine to admire what passed for a view and to give lynley a breather which he would have been damned before taking in front of his subordinate there were two flats on the fourth floor one facing the street and one overlooking what lay behind the building shelly platt lived in this latter accommodation which proved to be a small bedsit they had to rap on the door several times to get a response from within when it was finally opened the length of an insubstantial security chain a squinting face with sleepmodified orange hair peered out at them wha oh two of you is it no offence luv i dont do black not prejudiced mind you jus a rangement i got with a threeway girl whos getting on in years i cn give you her number if you want the girl had the distinctly adenoidal accent of a woman whod spent her formative years just north of the mersey miss platt lynley asked when im conscious she grinned her teeth were grey dont get your type round here much whadyou have in mind conversation lynley produced his warrant card and reacted quickly with his foot when she sought to slam the door cid he told her wed like a word miss platt you lot woke me up she was suddenly aggrieved you cn come back later when ive had me kip i doubt you want us to do that lynley told her especially if youre in the midst of an engagement later that could put a damper on business let us in please she said oh fook it then slid the chain off the door she left them to open it for themselves lynley pushed it inward to reveal a single room with a transom window covered by the sort of beaded curtain one usually found in doorways beneath this window a mattress on the floor served as a bed and shelly platt shuffled to this on bare feet and then walked across it to a heap of denim that turned out to be a pair of dungarees these she pulled on over what little she was wearing an extremely faded tshirt printed with the instantly recognisable face of the les misérables street urchin she scooped up a pair of moccasins and slid her feet into them the moccasins had been beaded at one time but what was left of their decoration consisted of tiny turquoise baubles that trailed along behind her on strings when she walked the bed was unmade its counterpane an indian bedspread of yellow and orange its single blanket a striped affair of purple and pink with a wellfrayed satin border shelly left this behind and walked across the room to a wash basin where she filled a pan this she set on one of the burners of a hot plate that stood atop a scarred chest of drawers there was only a single seat in the room a black futon marked with stains which were all of a similar grey hue like clouds these took a variety of shapes one could use the imagination and see in them everything from unicorns to seals shelly nodded towards the futon as she padded back to the bed you cn park it there if you want she said indifferently one of youll have to stand neither of them moved towards the grubby bit of furniture she said suit yourselfs then and plopped down on the mattress snatching up one of its two pillows which she cradled against her stomach she kicked out of the way another heap of clothinga red pvc miniskirt black net stockings still attached to a suspender belt and a green top that appeared to carry stains of a colour similar to those on the futon she observed lynley and nkata emotionlessly from eyes that were notable for their lifelessness as well as for the skin beneath them which gave her the unappealing addictedtoheroin look that fashion magazines had been featuring in their models lately well what dyou lot want you said cid not vice so this int nothing to do with business is it lynley removed from his jacket pocket the anonymous letter that vi nevin had shown them earlier in the day he handed it over shelly made much of giving it a thorough perusal sucking in on her lower lip and pinching it between her teeth thoughtfully as she did so nkata flipped open his notebook and adjusted the lead in his propelling pencil while lynley gathered information by allowing his glance the freedom of wandering round the room it possessed two notable features aside from the unmistakable odour of sexual intercourse which was barely covered by the scent of jasmine incense recently burned one was an old traveling trunk that was open upon its contents of black leather garments manacles masks whips and the like the other was a collection of photographs that were pinned to the walls these were of two subjects only a youngish lout usually pictured with an electric guitar slung somewhere about his person and vi nevin in a variety of poses from seductive to playful childlike of body and coy of face shelly saw lynley looking at these when she raised her head from studying the anonymous letter she said so wha of it anyway in apparent reference to what she was holding did you send it lynley asked her i cant believe shed call the cops on this wha a flaming div shes turned out so you did send it and others like it i dint say that did i shelly flung the letter to the floor she sprawled on her stomach and unearthed a gaily printed box from beneath several yellowed copies of the daily express it contained chocolate truffles which she picked through to find one to her liking she used her tongue against its entire surface before easing it slowly into her mouth her cheeks moved like bellows as she made much of sucking it she offered a moan of putative pleasure across the room nkata looked like a man whod just begun wondering how his day could possibly get worse where were you on tuesday night it was largely a pro forma question lynley couldnt imagine this girl having the witsnot to mention the strengthto dispatch two ablebodied young adults no matter what vi nevin thought otherwise nonetheless he asked it there was never any way to know how much information might be obtained by a simple show of police suspicion where i always am she replied easing herself down so that she was propped on one elbow with her hand supporting her lankhaired orange head i hang about earls court station so i cn give directions to anyone lost when he gets off the tube natcherlythis with a smirki was there last night ill be there tonight i was there on tuesday night as well why vi saying something different is she shes saying you sent her letters shes saying youve stalked her for a number of months listen to her shelly said derisively thiss a free country last time i looked i cn go where i want an if she just happens to be there its too bloody bad for her that is i dont give a fook one way or thother even if shes with nicola maiden shelly said nothing in reply merely fingering through her chocolates for another piece she was skeletally thin beneath her dungarees and the unappealing condition of her teeth gave mute testimony to how she managed it despite a diet of truffles she said bitches users those two are i should of seen it sooner only i thought being mates meant something to certain people which of course it dint i hope they pay for how they treated me nicola maiden has done lynley told her she was murdered on tuesday night have you someone who can verify your whereabouts between ten and midnight miss platt murdered shelly sat up straight nikki maiden murdered how when i dint ever you saying she was murdered fook hell i got to ring vi i got to ring vi she popped to her feet and went to the telephone which like the hot plate was on the chest of drawers there the water in the pan had begun to boil which offered shelly a moments distraction in her quest to contact vi nevin she carried the pan to the basin where she poured some of the water into a lavender cup saying murdered how is she vis okay right no one did nothing to vi did they shes fine lynley was curious about the sudden change in the young woman what it said about her what it said about the case she asked you to come and tell me dint she fook poor kid shelly opened a cabinet above the wash basin and took from it ajar of gold blend a second jar of coffee creamer and a box of sugar she excavated in the coffee creamer for a grimylooking spoon she used it to measure everything into her cup stirring vigorously between each measurement and dipping the spoon liberally into the next ingredient she performed each step without drying the utensil by the end it was thickly coated with an unappetising patina the colour of mud well steady on anyway she said having apparently used the coffeemaking time to reflect upon the information lynley had brought to her its not like im going to run right over am i no matter what she wants she did wrong by me and she bloody well knows it and she can just ask me nice if she wants me back and i might not go mind you i got my pride lynley wondered if shed heard his earlier question he wondered if she understood what his having asked it implied not only about her place in the investigation into nicola maidens murder but also about the state of her relationship with vi nevin he said your having sent threatening letters puts you under suspicion miss platt you do understand that dont you so youre going to need to produce whoever can verify your whereabouts on tuesday night between ten and midnight but vi knows id never shelly frowned something apparently made its way into her consciousness like a mole burrowing towards the roots of a rosebush her face illustrated what her mind was assembling if the police were standing there in her bedsit putting the frighteners on her about nikki maidens death there could be only one reason for their visit and only one person whod pointed them towards her vi sent you to me didnt she vi sent you to me vi thinks i took nikki for an airing fook that bitch that rotten little bitch shell do anything to get back at me wont she to get back for what nkata asked the guitarwielding lout leered over his shoulder from an overlarge photograph tongue hanging out a line of studs pierced it a silver chain dangled from one of the studs looping across his cheek to a ring in his ear to get back at you for what nkata repeated patiently his pencil poised and his face all interest for sneaking to prongbreath reeve thats for what shelly declared mkr financial management nkata asked martin reeve as ever bloody was shelly marched over to the mattress her coffee mug in her hand unmindful of the hot liquid that sloshed onto the floor she squatted rooted for a truffle and plopped it into the mug along with the coffee another chocolate she popped into her mouth she sucked energetically and with intense concentration this appeared to be directedat long lastat the moderate peril of her situation okay so i told him about everything she announced so bloody what he had a right to know they were lying to him oh he didnt deserve to know little wanker that he is but since they were doing to him what they did to me and since they were going to keep bloody doing it to everyone else in sight as long as they could get away with it then he had a right to know because if people just use other people like that then they bloody ought to pay for the using one way or another they bloody ought to pay just like the punters is what i say nkata looked like a man who was listening to greek and attempting to write a translation in latin lynley didnt feel a great deal more clarity at his end he said miss platt what are you talking about im talking about prongbreath reeve i am vi and nikki milked him like a cow and when their pockets were fullobviously she wasnt a woman who clung to the unity of her figurative languagethey did a bunk on him only they made sure they took their punters with them when they scarpered they were setting themselfs up to cost the prong dear by going into business for themselfs nikki and vi were and i didnt think it was fair so i told him so vi nevin did work for martin reeve lynley asked shelly course she did both of them did thas how they met did you work for him as well she snorted not bloody likely that oh i tried i did right when vi got hired i tried but i wasnt the type he was looking for prongbreath said he wanted refinement he said he wanted his girls to make conversation and know which fork to use with the fish knife and watch an opera without falling asleep and go to a drinks party on the arm of some ugly fat bloke who wants to pretend shes his girlfriend for a night and i think weve got the idea lynley cut in but let me make sure so theres no confusion mkr is an escort service posing as a financial management firm nkata added is that what youre saying lynley asked shelly are you saying that both nicola and vi worked for mkr as escorts until they broke away to form their own business is that right miss platt right as rain she asserted right as a bleeding hurricane he hires girls does martin and he calls them trainees for some flaming money business that dont even exist in the first place he sits them down with a slew of books theyre supposed to study from to learn the business and after bout a week he asks them will they do him a favour and act like the date of one of mkrs big clients in town for a conference and wanting to go to dinner hell pay them extra he says if theyll do it just this once and just this once turns into just another time and by the time they figger what mkrs really about theyre seeing they can make a lot more dosh acting like dates for korean computer salesmen or arab oil blokes or american políticos or whoever than they could ever make doing whatever else they was doing when they came to work for prongbreath in the first place and they can make even more if they give their companion a bit more than their company for the evening which is when the prong introduces them to what his business really is which has sod all to do with investing anyones money anywhere believe you me how did you learn all this lynley asked vi brought nikki home once they were talking i listened vi got hired by the prong different and they were telling their stories to each other to compare vis was different like i said she was the only escort he ever hired from the street the rest were students college girls who wanted to work parttime but vi worked the game by sticking her card in call boxes with you as her maid yeah thas right and prongbreath picked up one of her cards liked the look of heri spose he didnt have another girl who could look ten years old like vi can when she sets her mind to itand he rang her up i booked him in like i always did but when he showed up he wanted to talk business she lifted her coffee and drank examining lynley over the rim she said so vi went to work for him and ceased to need you lynley said i stuck by her though cooking meals doing laundry keeping the flat nice but then she wanted to take up with nikki as her mate and her partner and i was out just like that she snapped her fingers one day i was washing her knickers the next day i was pulling mine down to give tenpound pokes to blokes waiting to catch the district line to ealing broadway which was when you decided to inform martin reeve what they were up to lynley noted it was a good provocation for you to seek revenge i didnt hurt no one shelly cried if you want someone likely to do someone else ini mean to kill themthen you look at the prong not at me yet vi doesnt point the finger at him lynley said which you think she would do if she suspected him of anything how do you account for that she even denies knowing him well she would do wouldnt she shelly declared if that bloke even thought she sneaked on him to the cops about like well about his escort business on top of her already using him to build up a list of clients and then doing a runner to set up in business on her own shelly drew her thumb across her neck in a mime of throatslitting she wouldnt last ten minutes after he found out vi wouldnt the prong dont like to be crossed and hed see to it she paid for crossing shelly seemed to hear what she was saying and to realise all of the possibilities that could grow out of it nervously she looked towards the door as if expecting martin reeve to come barreling through it ready to wreak vengeance upon her for the sneaking that she had just done if thats the case lynley said if reeve is indeed responsible for nicola maidens deathwhich is what i assume youre suggesting when you talk about people paying when they doublecross him i never said understood you didnt say it directly im drawing the inference lynley waited for her to give a sign of comprehension she blinked he decided that would do he said if we infer that reeves responsible for nicola maidens death why would he have waited so long to kill her she left his employ in april its now september how do you account for the five months he waited to take his revenge i never told him where they were shelly said it proudly i pretended i didnt know i reckoned he was owed the tale of what they were up to but he was on his own to track them down and thas what he did depend on it chapter di peter hanken had just got back to his office after his conversation with will upman when the news came in that a tenyearold schoolboy called theodore webster playing hideandseek in a grit dispenser on the road between peak forest and lane head had found a knife buried in what remained of last winters protection against road ice it was a goodsize pocket knife replete with blades and the sort of miscellaneous gewgaws that made its inclusion in the equipment of a camper or a hiker de rigueur the boy might have kept it hidden away for years for his own useso his father reportedhad its blades not been impossible to open without someones assistance because of this hed taken the knife to his father for help thinking that a few drops of oil would take care of the problem but his father had seen the dried blood that was crusting the tightly closed knife and hed recalled the story of the calder moor deaths that had filled the front page of the high peak courier hed phoned the police immediately it might not be the knife that had been used on one of the two calder moor victims hanken was told via his mobile by the wpc whod taken the call but the di might want to have a look at it himself prior to its being sent onward to the lab hanken declared that hed take the knife to the lab himself so he barreled north to the a and headed southeast at sparrowpit this course bisected calder moor running at a fortyfivedegree angle from its northwest edge which was defined by the road along which the maiden girls car had been parked at the site hanken examined the grit dispenser in which the weapon had been found he made a note of the fact that a killerdepositing a knife thereincould then have proceeded on his way to a junction not five miles distant at which he could have turned either due east then north for padley gorge or immediately south towards bakewell and broughton manor which lay a mere two miles beyond it once hanken had confirmed this bit of data with a quick look at the map he went on to examine the knife itself in the kitchen of the websters farmhouse it was indeed a swiss army model and it now lay in an evidence bag on the cars seat next to him the lab would conduct all the necessary tests to ascertain whether the blood on both the blades and the case was terry coles but prior to those tests another less scientific identification could give the investigators a valuable piece of information hanken found andy maiden at the bottom of the drive leading up to the hall the former so officer was apparently installing a new sign for the establishment an activity that involved a wheelbarrow a shovel a small concrete mixer several lengths of flex and an impressive set of floodlights the old sign had already been removed and lay disassembled beneath a lime tree the new onein all its ornate handcarved and handpainted splendourwaited nearby to be mounted on a sturdy post of oak and wrought iron hanken parked on the verge and studied maiden who was working with a fierce expenditure of energy as if the replacement of the sign had to be accomplished in record time he was sweating heavily the damp forming rivulets on his legs and plastering his tshirt to his torso hanken noted that he was in remarkable physical condition looking like a man who had the strength and endurance of a boy in his twenties mr maiden he called as he shoved his door open could i have a word please and then more loudly when there was no reaction mr maiden maiden slowly turned from his work revealing his face hanken was struck by what his expression revealed of his mental state if the other mans body could have belonged to a bloke of a younger generation his face was ancient maiden looked as if the only thing keeping him going was the mindlessness of the moments exertion ask him to do anything but labour and sweat and the shell of the man that he had become would be blasted to fragments like a friable carapace hit by a hammer hanken experienced a dual reaction to the sight of the former so officer an immediate surge of sympathy that was swiftly replaced by the recollection of an important detail as an undercover cop andy maiden knew how to play a role hanken slid the evidence bag into his jacket pocket and joined andy maiden on the drive maiden watched him expressionless as he approached hanken nodded at the sign that maiden was preparing to hang admiring the artistry with which it had been crafted and saying nicer than the cavendishs road sign i think thanks but maiden hadnt spent his career with the met to think that the detective inspector in charge of the investigation into his daughters murder had come to chat about the manner in which maiden hall was advertising its presence he dumped a mound of concrete into the hole hed dug and he sank his shovel into the earth nearby he said youve news for us and he appeared to be attempting to read hankens face for the answer in advance of hearing it a knifes been found hanken brought the other policeman into the picture with a brief explanation of how it had come into the hands of the police youll want me to look at it maiden said hanken brought out the plastic evidence bag and rested it with the knife in his palm maiden didnt ask to hold it himself rather he stood gazing at it as if the case the folded blades or the blood upon both could give him an answer to questions he wasnt yet willing to ask you mentioned that you gave her your own knife hanken said could this be it and when maiden nodded is there anything about the knife that you gave her that distinguishes it from others of the same type mr maiden andy andy a womans voice grew louder as the woman herself descended from the hall walking through the trees andy darling here ive brought you some nan maiden stopped abruptly when she saw hanken excuse me inspector i had no idea you were andy ive brought you some water the heat you know pellegrinos all right isnt it she thrust the water at her husband she touched the backs of her fingers to his temple saying you arent overdoing it are you he flinched hanken felt a stirring on the back of his neck like a spirits caress against his skin he looked from husband to wife assessed the moment that had just passed between them and knew he was fast approaching the time to ask the question no one had given voice to yet he said first after nodding a hello to maidens wife as to anything that might differentiate the knife you gave your daughter from other similar swiss army knives one of the blades of the scissors broke off a few years ago i never replaced it maiden said anything else not that i recall after you gave the knifepossibly this oneto your daughter did you buy another for yourself i have another yes he said smaller than that though easier to carry about you have it with you maiden reached into the pocket of his cutoff jeans he brought out another model of a swiss army knife and handed it over hanken examined it using his thumbnail to prise open its largest blade two inches appeared to be its length nan maiden said inspector i dont understand what andys knife has to do with anything and then without a pause for response darling you havent had lunch yet may i bring you a sandwich but andy maiden was watching hanken open the knife and take the measure of each of its blades hanken could feel the former officers eyes upon him he could sense the intent behind the gaze that fixed itself on his fingers nan maiden said andy may i bring you no but you must eat something you cant keep no hanken looked up maidens replacement knife was too small for the murder weapon but that didnt obviate the necessity for asking the question that both of them knew he would ask he had after all admitted to helping his daughter pack her camping gear into her car on tuesday and he himself had given her the knife that he himself had later declared to be missing mr maiden he said where were you on tuesday night thats a monstrous question nan maiden said quietly i suppose it is hanken agreed mr maiden maiden glanced in the direction of the hall above them as if what he was about to say needed an accompanying corroboration that would be supplied by the halls existence i was having some eye trouble on tuesday night i went upstairs early because my vision kept tunneling it gave me a scare so i had a liedown to see if that would help take care of it tunnel vision hanken wondered incredulously that was certainly an alibi and a half maiden obviously inferred hankens thoughts from the expression on his face he said it happened during the evening meal inspector one cant mix drinks or serve dinners if ones field of vision is reduced to the size of a fivepence coin its the truth nan asserted he went upstairs he was resting in the bedroom what time was this maidens wife answered for him the first of our guests had gone through for their starters so andy must have left round half past seven hanken looked at maiden for confirmation of the time maiden frowned as if he were conducting a complex inner dialogue with himself how long were you up there in your bedroom then the rest of the evening the night maiden said your vision didnt improve is that it thats it have you seen a doctor seems to me that a problem like that could be cause for real concern andys had a few turns like this nan maiden said they pass hes fine as long as he rests and thats what he was doing on tuesday night resting id expect though that a condition like that wants looking at it could lead to something far worse a stroke perhaps chances are one would think of a stroke straightaway id want to call an ambulance as soon as i had the first symptoms its happened before we know what to do nan maiden said which is what exactly hanken enquired application of ice packs acupuncture to the temples full body massage half a dozen aspirin what is it you do when it looks like your husband might be having a stroke it isnt a stroke so you left him alone to his bed rest did you from half past seven in the evening until what time might that have been mrs maiden the care the couple took not to look at each other was as obvious as would have been a sudden collapse into each others arms nan maiden said of course i didnt leave andy alone inspector i looked in on him twice three times perhaps during the evening and the times i have no idea probably at nine then again round eleven and as hanken looked towards maiden she continued by saying its no use asking andy hed fallen asleep and i didnt wake him but he was there in the bedroom and there he stayed all night i hope thats all you want to ask in the matter inspector hanken because the very idea the thought that her eyes grew bright as she directed them towards her husband he looked in the direction of the ushaped gorge whose south end could be glimpsed where the road curved to the north i hope thats all you want to ask she said simply and there was a quiet dignity to her words still hanken said do you have any idea what your daughter planned to do with her life once she returned to london from her summer in derbyshire maiden watched him steadily though his wife looked away no he said i dont know i see and youre certain of that nothing you want to add nothing you want to explain nothing maiden said and to his wife you nancy nothing she said hanken gestured with the evidence bag in which the knife lay you know the routine mr maiden once we have a report with all the particulars from forensic ill probably need another chat with you i understand andy maiden said do your job inspector do it well thats all i ask but he didnt look at his wife they seemed to hanken like strangers on a railway platform tied in some way to a departing guest that neither wanted to admit to knowing nan maiden watched the inspector drive off without realising that she was doing it she began to gnaw at what was left of the fingernails of her right hand next to her andy set the bottle of pellegrino shed brought him into a depression that his heel had made in the soft earth round the concretefilled hole he hated pellegrino he scorned every kind of water that touted itself as offering more benefit than a full glass of the spring water from their own well she knew that but when shed looked from the window of the first floor mezzanine when through the trees shed seen the car pull onto the verge and watched the police inspector clamber out a bottle of water was the only excuse she could think of to get her down the hillside quickly enough to intercept him so now she bent for the water and wiped off the grime where the earth clung like an eruption of scabies to the condensation that had formed on the bottle andy fetched the thick oak pole from which the new maiden hall sign would hang he sank it upright into the ground and held it into position with four sturdy timbers he shovelled the rest of the concrete round it when will we talk she wondered when will it be safe to say the worst she tried to tell herself that thirtyseven years of marriage made conversation unnecessary between them but she knew there was little truth to that it was only in the halcyon days of courting engagement and newlywed excitement that a look a touch or a smile sufficed between a man and a woman and they were decades away from those halcyon days they were more than thirty years and one devastating death away from that time when words were secondary to the knowledge of ones partner that was as immediate and as natural as breathing silently andy packed the concrete round the post carefully he scraped the remains of the mixture from the bucket until there was nothing left he gave his attention next to the floodlights nan clasped the bottle of pellegrino to her bosom and turned away to climb back to the hall why did you say that her husband asked she turned back to him what you know why did you tell him you looked in on me nancy the bottle felt sticky under her palm it felt hard against her breast she said i did look in on you you didnt we both know it darling i did you were asleep you must have dozed off i had a quick look in the door and then went back to work im not surprised you didnt hear me he stood with the floodlights in his hands she wanted to go to him to swaddle his body with the kind of protection that would dispel the demons and drive off the despair but she just stood there a few feet above him on the slope holding a bottle of pellegrino which both of them knew he did not want and would never drink she was the why of it he said quietly every journey in life reaches an end but if youre lucky it has another beginning inside of it nick was the why do you understand nancy their gazes locked on each other for a moment his eyeswhich shed studied for thirtyseven years of love and frustration and laughter and fear and delight and anxietyspoke a message to her that was unmistakable in its existence but incomprehensible in its meaning nans body quivered with a chill of fear with the belief that she couldnt afford to understand anything that the man she loved would tell her from this moment on ive something to see to in the hall she said she began to climb the slope beneath the lime trees she felt the cool air of the shadows as if the tree leaves were spilling it like a soft fall of rain it touched her cheeks first then slid to her shoulders and the movement of the coolness against her skin was what prompted her to turn back to her husband for a final question andy she said the volume of her voice was normal can you hear me from here he didnt respond he didnt look up he didnt do anything save place the first floodlight in position on the ground beneath the pole that would hold the new sign for maiden hall oh god nan whispered she turned and continued her climb after the conversation shed had with her uncle jeremy on the previous evening samantha had done what she could to stay out of his way shed had to see him at both breakfast and lunch but shed avoided eye contact and conversation with him and as soon as shed finished eating shed cleared her plates from the table and cleared herself from the room she was out in the older courtyard preparing to wash what looked like a good fifty years of grime from those windows that were still glazed when she noticed her cousin he was sitting at the desk in his office just across the cobbles from where she was unreeling a lengthy hose pipe she paused to observe him admiring how the autumn light fell in the open window of the office and struck the top of his bent head so that his hair was burnished to a rusty gold as she watched she saw him rub the worry lines on his forehead and that told her instantly what he was doing although it didnt tell her why he was very good with figures so he was going over the accounts as he did every week making an evaluation of what went for the income assets and investments of his familys estate hed be looking at everything what came in from the sale of the harrier puppies and what went out to keep the kennel running what amassed from the rents accrued across the estate and what bled from the profits to keep all of the farm buildings in usable condition what income was provided by the tournaments and fetes held at broughton manor and what costs were accrued from the normal wear and tear that occurred when ones property was used by others what interest came in from invested capital and how much of that capital leeched away when a months expenditures exceeded its profits when he was done with that he would go on to examine the books in which he meticulously recorded every pound that was spent on the renovation of broughton manor itself and then he would refresh his memory about the debts that also comprised part of the britton family financial picture when he was finished he would have a fair idea of how things stood and he could lay any plans that needed to be laid for the coming week so samantha wasnt surprised to see him looking over the books she was however surprised to see him at them for the second time in four days as she watched she saw him plunge one hand back through his hair he entered some figures into an antique adding machine and from across the courtyard samantha could hear the whir and click of the old calculator as it lumbered through its sums when the answer was produced julian ripped the tape from the back of the machine and studied it for a moment then he crumpled the tape into a ball and threw it over his shoulder he went back to the books again seeing this samantha felt her heart tugged she wondered if there had ever been a man as responsible as julian a child less mindful of his familys history and his personal duty would have decamped from this nightmare of an ancestral home long ago a child less loving would have left his father to swill his way to delirium tremens cirrhosis of the liver and an early grave but her cousin julian wasnt that sort of child he felt the ties of blood and the obligations of heritage both were burdens but he bore them with dignity had he approached them any other way samantha wouldnt have come to care for him so deeply in his struggle shed learned to see a strength of purpose which was closely attuned to her own way of living they were right for each other she and her cousin no matter that the blood relationship was a close one cousins had formed alliances before and in the process had enriched the family from which they both sprang formed an alliance what a way to label it samantha thought wryly and yet hadnt things been so much more sensible during that period when marriages came about for just that reason there was no talk of true love in the days of political and financial matchmaking no aching longing and pining until ones true love happened to come along what there was instead was a steadiness and devotion that grew from an understanding of what was expected of one no illusions no fantasy just an agreement to bind ones life to another in a situation in which both parties had much to gain money position property authority protection and authentication perhaps that last most of all one wasnt complete until one married one wasnt married until the match was consolidated through coition and legitimised through reproduction simple it was there were no expectations of romance passion and exquisite surrender there was just the steady lifelong assurance that ones mate was actually that which the agreeing parties had earlier defined him to be sensible samantha decided and in a world in which men and women were partnered to each other in that fashion she knew that agents of herself and julian would long ago have reached an understanding but they didnt live in that world and the world they did live in was one suggesting that a permanent soul mate was one little strip of celluloid away boy meets girl they fall in love they have their troubles which are resolved by act iii fade to black and the credits roll that world was maddening because samantha knew if her cousin adhered to a belief in that sort of love she was doomed to failure im here she found herself wanting to shout hose pipe in hand i have what you need look at me look at me as if hed heard her silent cry julian glanced up at just that moment and caught her watching him he leaned forward and swung the casement window fully open samantha crossed the courtyard to join him youre looking grim i couldnt help noticing you caught me trying to design a cure for what ails you dyou think i have a future in counterfeiting he asked the sun was shining directly on his face and he squinted into it that may be the only answer do you think so she asked lightly no rich young thing waiting for seduction on your horizon it doesnt look like it he saw her observing the mass of documents and account books that were spread on his desk certainly a far greater number than he usually went through when doing his sums for the coming week trying to see where we stand he explained i was hoping to wring about ten thousand pounds out of well out of nothing im afraid why she noted the downhearted cast of his face and hastened to add julie is there an emergency of some sort is something wrong thats just the hell of it somethings right or something could be made right but theres not enough liquid cash to do much more than see us through to the end of the month i hope you know that you can always ask me she hesitated not wanting to offend him knowing that he was as proud a man as he was responsible she put it another way were family julie if somethings come up and youd like some money it wouldnt even be a loan youre my cousin you can have it he looked horrified i didnt mean you to think stop it im not thinking anything good because i couldnt not ever fine we wont discuss it but please tell me whats happened you look really cut up he blew out a breath he said oh bugger it and in a quick movement he climbed onto the desk and out of the window to join her in the courtyard whatre you up to ah windows i see have you any idea how long its been since theyve had a wash sam when edward chucked it all in for wallis fool that he was thats a fair bet which part of it the guess itself or chucking it all in for her he smiled resignedly im not sure at this point samantha didnt say what came first to her mind that he wouldnt have answered in such a way a week ago she merely gave a few moments consideration to what such an answer implied companionably they went at the windows the old glazing was set into lead in far too fragile a fashion to blast away at it with the hose pipe so they were reduced to a painstaking process of soaking away the grime with rags one single pane at a time thisll take till our dotage julian noted grimly after ten minutes of silent cleaning i dare say samantha replied she wanted to ask him if he was prepared for her to stay round that long but she let the thought go something serious was on his mind and she had to get to it if only to prove to him her abiding concern for all aspects of his life she sought a way in saying quietly julie im sorry about your worries on top of everything else i cant do anything about well she found that she couldnt even say nicola maidens name not here and now not to julian about whats happened in the last few days was what she settled on but if theres ever anything else that i can do im sorry he replied of course you are how could you be anything else but sorry i mean im sorry for what i said how i acted when i questioned you sam about that night you know she gave particular attention to a window pane that was crusted with guano which had dripped from a hundred years of birds nests tucked into a crevice above them you were upset i didnt need to accuse you though of of whatever of murdering the woman you loved you mean she looked his way the ruddy colour in his face had heightened sometimes i cant get a rein on the voices inside my head i start talking and whatever the voices have been shouting pops out its nothing to do with what i believe im sorry she wanted to say but she wasnt good for you anyway julie why did you never see that she wasnt good for you and when will you see what her death can mean to you to me to us julie but she didnt say it because to say it would be to reveal what she couldnt affordor even bearto reveal to him accepted she said instead thanks sam youre a brick he said again i mean she flashed him a smile its okay i understand hand me the hose pipe these need dousing now a burble of water was all they could risk against the old windows sometime in the future it would be necessary to have all the lead replaced or what was left of the ancient glass would definitely be destroyed but that was a conversation for another time with his present money worries julian didnt need to hear samanthas prescription for saving another part of the family home he said its dad she said what whats on my mind why ive been going through the books its dad and then he explained ending ruefully with ive been waiting for years for him to choose sobriety all of us have waited and now hes done that i got all caught up in trying to come up with a way to seize the moment before it passes i know the truth of the matter ive read enough about it to understand he has to do it for himself he has to want it but if you could have seen him heard how he was talking i dont think hes had a drink all day hasnt he no i suppose he hasnt and she thought of her uncle as hed been the previous night slurring not a word and coaxing from her an admission that she didnt want to make she felt a stillness come over her one in which she knew that she too could seize the momentcould use it and mould itor let it pass she said carefully perhaps he does want it this time julie hes getting older facing his well his mortality his mortality she thought not his death she wouldnt use that word because in this instant it was crucial to maintain a delicate balance in the conversation i expect everyone comes facetoface with well with the knowledge that nothing goes on forever perhaps hes feeling older all at once and he wants to sort himself out while he still has the chance but thats just it julian said does he have a chance how can he do it without help when hes never been able to do it before and now that hes finally asked for help how can i fail to give it because i want to give it i want him to succeed we all do julie the family we want that so i went through the books because of the health insurance we have i dont even need to read the small print to know theres no way he examined the pane he was working on scraping his fingernail against the glass nails on a chalkboard samantha shuddered she turned her head from the sound which was when she saw him where he always was he stood at the window in the parlour he watched her talking to his son and as she watched him watching her samantha saw her uncle raise his hand one finger touched his temple and then his hand dropped he might have been smoothing his hair from his face but the reality was that the gesture looked very much like a mock salute chapter we got in straightaway yesterday nkata said when no entry buzzer answered their ringing of the bell next to the white front door could be they got word bout us from the platt bird and did a runner what dyou think i didnt get the impression that shelly platt had any sympathy for the reeves did you lynley rang the bell at mkr financial management another time she seemed happy enough to put a spanner in their works so long as no trail led back to her do the reeves not live here as well as run their business from here winnie it looks like a residence to me lynley moved back from the door then descended the stairs to the pavement while the candyfloss building appeared uninhabited he had the distinct sensation of being watched from within it could have been his impatience to get martin reeve under his thumb for a thorough grilling but something suggested to him a form just out of sight behind the sheer curtains of a second floor window even as he stood gazing up at it the curtain twitched he called up police its in your interests to let us in mr reeve id rather not have to phone ladbroke grove police station for their assistance a minute passed during which nkata leaned on the bell and lynley walked to the bentley to phone the ladbroke grove station this apparently did the trick for as he was speaking to the duty sergeant nkata called were in spector and shoved the door open he waited for lynley inside the hall the building was quiet the air bearing a faint odour of lemons from polish perhaps used to maintain an impressive sheraton wardrobe in the corridor as lynley and nkata shut the door behind them a woman descended the stairs lynleys first thought was that she looked like a doll in fact she looked like a woman whod spent considerable time and energynot to mention moneyin moulding herself into a remarkable duplicate of barbie she wore black lycra from head to toe displaying a body so outrageously perfect that only imagination and silicone could have produced it this had to be tricia reeve lynley thought nkata had done a fine job of describing her lynley introduced himself saying wed like a word with your husband mrs reeve will you fetch him for us please hes not here shed stopped at the lowest step on the stairs she was tall lynley saw and shed made herself taller by refusing to descend completely to their level wheres he gone to then assiduously nkata prepared to take down the information tricias hand was on the staircase railing long skeletal fingers encumbered by rings she had a formidable grip upon the oak her diamonds glittered as her arm trembled with the force she was applying i dont know try out a few ideas on us nkata said ill take them all down were happy to check round for him we got the time silence or we could wait here lynley said where might we do that mrs reeve her glance flickered blue eyes lynley saw enormous pupils nkata had told him that she was a user it appeared that she was spiked up right now camden passage she said her pale tongue coming out to lick beestung lips theres a dealer there miniatures martin collects hes gone to look at whats been brought in from an estate sale last week the name of the dealer i dont know name of the gallery the shop i dont know what time dhe leave i dont know i was out lynley wondered in what sense she was using out he had a fairly good idea well wait for him then shall we show ourselves into your reception room is it this door mrs reeve she followed them saying quickly hes gone to camden passage from there to meet some painters whore working on a house of ours in cornwall mews ive the address shall i give it to you the switch to cooperation was far too swift either reeve was in the house or shed come up with a plan to put him on the alert to their search for him that would be easy enough lynley couldnt imagine a man of reeves description wandering the byways of london without a mobile phone in his possession the moment he and nkata were out the front door and on his trail reeves wife would be at the phone to warn him i think well wait all the same lynley said joni us mrs reeve i can phone the ladbroke grove station for a female constable if youre feeling uncomfortable alone with us shall i do that no with her right hand she clasped her left elbow she looked at her watch and the muscles in her neck convulsed as she worked her way through a swallow she was coming down lynley speculated and checking to see when she could next hit up with relative safety the presence of the police was an obstacle that thwarted her need and that might be useful she said insistently martin isnt here if i knew more id tell you but the fact is i dont im unconvinced im telling you the truth tell us another then where was your husband on tuesday night on tuesday she looked honestly confused i have no he was here with me he was here we spent the evening in can anyone confirm that the question obviously rang alarm bells for her she said in a rush we went for curry at the star of india on old brompton road round half past eight so you werent in then we spent the rest of the evening here did you book a table at the restaurant mrs reeve the maître d will remember us he and martin had words because we hadnt booked in advance and they didnt want to let us have a table at first even though there were several vacant when we got there we had a meal then we came home thats the truth on tuesday thats what we did it would be easy enough to confirm their presence at the restaurant lynley thought but how many maâtre d s would recall on what particular day theyd had a row with a demanding customer whod failed to book and also thus failed to provide himself with a reliable alibi he said nicola maiden worked for you she said martin didnt kill nicola i know thats why youve come so dont lets pretend otherwise he was with me on tuesday night we went to the star of india for a meal we were home by ten and we stayed in the rest of the evening ask our neighbours someone will have seen us either going out or coming back now do you want the address of the mews house or not because if not id like you to leave another agitated glance at her watch lynley decided to press her he said to nkata were going to need a search warrant winnie tricia cried what for ive told you everything you can phone the restaurant you can talk to our neighbours how can you get a search warrant when you havent bothered to see if im telling you the truth in the first place she sounded horrified better yet she sounded afraid the last thing she wanted lynley expected was to have a team of police going through her belongings no matter what they were looking for she may have had no hand in the death of nicola maiden but possession of narcotics wasnt going to go down a treat with the crown prosecutors and she knew that we sometimes cut corners lynley said pleasantly this looks like a good time to do so weve a murder weapon missing as well as a piece of clothing from the dead girl and the boy and if either article turns up in this house well want to know why shll i phone then guv nkata enquired blandly martin didnt kill nicola he hasnt seen her in months he didnt even know where she was if youre looking for someone who might have wanted to see her dead there are plenty of men who she stopped herself yes lynley asked plenty of men she brought up her left arm to cradle her right elbow just as her right had been cradling her left she walked the length of the reception room and back lynley said mrs reeve we know exactly what mkr financial management is fronting we know that your husband hires students to work as escorts and prostitutes for him we know that nicola maiden was one of those students and that she left your husbands employ along with vi nevin to set up in business on her own the information we have right now can lead directly to charges against you and your husband and i expect youre well aware of that so if youd like to avoid being charged tried sentenced and locked up i suggest you cooperate straightaway she looked rigid her lips hardly moved when she said what do you want to know i want to know about your husbands relationship with nicola maiden pimps are known for he isnt a pimp frequently displaying displeasure if one of their stable decides to break away from them thats not what its like thats not how it was really lynley asked how was it then vi and nicola decided to start their own business which cut out your husband but they did so without informing him he cant have liked that very much once he sussed it out youre getting it wrong she went to the ornate desk and out of a drawer she took a packet of silk cut she shook one out and lit it the phone began to ring she glanced down at it reached forward to press a button stopped herself at the final moment after twenty double rings it was silent but less than ten seconds later it started up again she said the computer should be getting that i cant think why and with an uneasy look in the direction of the police she snatched up the receiver and said tersely global into it then after a moment of listening and spoken in the most pleasant of tones she said it depends what you want actually yes that shouldnt be a problem at all may i have your number please ill ring you back shortly she scribbled on a paper that done she looked up defiantly as if to say prove it to what lynley was thinking about the conversation that shed just had he was happy to oblige her global lynley said thats the name of the escort agency mrs reeve global what global dating global desires what global escorts and providing an educated escort to a businessman in town for a conference isnt illegal living off immoral earnings however is mrs reeve do you really want the police to take possession of your account books assuming of course that there are account books for mkr financial management in the first place we can do that you know we can ask for documentation of every pound youve made and once were through with our bit of research we can hand everything over to the inland revenue so that their chaps can make certain youve donated your fair share to the support of the government how does that sound to you he gave her time to ponder the telephone went again after three double rings it switched onto another line with a soft click an order being taken elsewhere lynley thought by mobile remote control or satellite wasnt progress a wonderful thing tricia seemed to reach some sort of realisation obviously she knew that global escorts and the position of the reeves were compromised at this point one word from lynley to the inland revenue or even to the ladbroke grove police stations vice boys and the reeves entire way of life was on the chopping block and that didnt even begin to address what could happen to them once a search of the premises unearthed whatever moodaltering substance was squirreled away somewhere in the house waiting to work its magic on tricia all this knowledge seemed to settle upon her like soot from a fire shed lit herself she gathered herself together all right if i give you a nameif i give you the nameit cant have come from me is that understood because if word gets out about an indiscretion committed at this end of the business she let the rest of the sentence hang indiscretion was a unique way of labeling it lynley thought and why in gods name did she think that she was in any position to bargain with him he said mrs reeve the businessas you call itis finished martin she said wont see it that way martin lynley countered will find himself held on charges if he doesnt and martin will ask for bail hell be out on the street in twentyfour hours where will you be by then inspector no closer to the truth i expect she might have looked like barbie she might have sautéed part of her brain in drugs but somewhere along the line shed learned a bit about bargaining and she was doing it now with a fair amount of expertise lynley reckoned that her husband would have been proud of her she had no legal leg to stand on and she stood there anyway pretending she had he had to admire her chutzpah if nothing else she said i can give you a namethe name as ive saidand you can go on your way i can say nothing and you can search the house cart me off to gaol arrest my husband and be not an inch closer to nicolas killer oh youll have our books and our records but you cant expect that were so stupid as to list our punters by name so what will you gain and how much time will you lose im prepared to be reasonable if the informations good and in the time it takes me to ascertain the informations viability i would assume you and your husband would be considering where to relocate your business melbourne comes to mind what with the change in law that might take some time as will the verification of information tit for tat he awaited her decision she finally made it and took up a pencil from the top of the desk sir adrian beattie she said as she wrote he was mad about nicola he was willing to pay whatever she wanted if he could keep her all to himself i dont expect he much liked the thought of her expanding her business do you she handed over the address it was in the boltons it appeared lynley thought that they had the london lover at last when barbara havers found the note on her door upon her arrival home that evening she remembered the sewing lesson with a jolt she said bloody hell damn it and berated herself for having forgotten true she was involved in a case and hadiyyah would surely understand that but barbara hated to think that she might have been the cause of disappointment to her little friend you are cordially invited to view the work of miss jane batemans beginning seamstresses the note announced it was meticulously printed in a childish hand that barbara recognised a drooping cartoonish sunflower was sketched on the bottom alongside this was the date and time barbara made a mental note to enter both on her calendar shed put in another couple of hours at the yard after her conversation with neil sitwell shed been champing at the bit to start phoning the numbers of every employee listed under kingryder productions on the roster shed been given earlier but she trod the path of caution lest inspector lynley turn up and demand to know what shed gathered from the yard computer which was sod bloody all in spades of course to hell with him shed begun to think during her eighth cumulative hour at the terminal if he wanted a flaming report on every bleeding individual with whom di andrew maiden might have rubbed elbows in his years undercover shed damn well give it to him by the shovelful but the information was going to get him bugger all that would lead him to the derbyshire killer she would have bet her own life on that shed left the yard round half past four stopping at lynleys office to drop off a report and a personal note the report made her point she liked to think without stooping to rub his nose or otherwise dabble in the obvious im right youre wrong but ill play your stupid game were not words that she needed to say to him her time would come and she thanked her stars that the manner in which lynley was orchestrating the case actually left her more of a free hand than he realised the personal note that she left with the report assured lynley in the most polite of terms that she was taking to chelsea the postmortem file prepared by dr sue myles in derbyshire which was what barbara did as soon as she left new scotland yard she found simon st james and his wife in the back garden of their cheyne row house where st james was watching deborah crawl on her hands and knees along the brick path edging a herbaceous border that ran the length of the garden wall she had a pump action sprayer that she was dragging along as she moved and every few feet she stopped and energetically attacked the ground with a rainfall of pungent insecticide she was saying simon there are billions of them and even when i spray they keep moving about lord if theres ever a nuclear war ants will be the only survivors st james reclining on a chaise longue with a widebrimmed hat shading his face said did you get that section by the hydrangeas my love it looks as if you missed that bit by the fuchsia as well honestly youre maddening would you rather do this yourself i hate to be disturbing your peace of mind with such a slapdash effort hmm st james appeared to consider her offer no i dont think so youve been getting so much better at it recently doing anything well takes practise and i hate to rob you of the opportunity deborah laughed and mocksprayed him she caught sight of barbara just outside the kitchen door she said brilliant just what i need a witness hullo barbara please take note of which partner is slaving away in the garden and which is not my solicitor will want a statement from you later dont believe a word she says st james said ive only sat down this moment something about your posture says youre lying barbara told him as she crossed the lawn to the chaise longue and your fatherinlaw just suggested that i light a stick of dynamite under your bum by the way did he st james enquired frowning at the kitchen window through which joseph cotters form could be seen moving round thanks dad deborah called out in the direction of the house barbara smiled at their quiet fond sparring she pulled a deck chair up and sank into it she handed over the file to st james saying his lordship would like you to make a study of this what is it the derbyshire postmortems both the girl and the boy the inspectord tell you to have the closer look at the data on the girl by the way you wouldnt tell me that barbara smiled grimly i think my thoughts st james opened the file deborah crossed the lawn to join them trailing the spray pump behind her pictures st james warned her she hesitated bad multiple stab wounds on one of the victims barbara told her she blanched and sat on the chaise longue near to her husbands feet st james gave the photographs a glance only before he placed them face down on the lawn he flipped through the report pausing to read here and there he said is there something particular that tommys looking for barbara the inspector and i arent communicating directly im currently his gofer he told me to bring you the report i tugged my forelock and did his bidding st james looked up things still bad between you helen did tell me you were on the case marginally hell come round tommy always does deborah added husband and wife exchanged a look deborah said uneasily well you know yes st james said after a moment and with a brief kind smile in her direction then to barbara ill have a look at the paperwork barbara i expect he wants inconsistencies anomalies discrepancies the usual tell him ill phone right she said and then she added delicately im wondering simon hmm could you phone me as well i mean if you unearth something when he didnt reply at once she rushed on with i know its irregular and i dont want to get you into a bad spot with the inspector but he wont tell me much and its always get back to the computer constable if i make a suggestion so if you were willing to keep me in the picture i mean i know hed be cheesed off if he knew but i swear id never tell him that you ill phone you as well st james interrupted but there may be nothing i know sue myles shes nothing if not thorough frankly i dont see why tommy wants me to look her work over in the first place neither do i barbara wanted to tell him still his promise to phone her buoyed her spirits so she ended the day in far better a frame of mind than shed begun it when she saw hadiyyahs note however an unhappy twinge pricked at her mood the little girl had no mother to speak ofat least no mother who was present or likely to become present any time soonand while barbara didnt expect to take her mothers place she had struck up a friendship with hadiyyah that had been a source of pleasure to them both hadiyyah had hoped that barbara would attend her sewing lesson that afternoon and barbara had failed her it didnt feel good so when shed dropped her bag on the dining room table and listened to her messagesmrs flo reporting on her mum her mum reporting on a jolly trip to jamaica hadiyyah telling her shed left a note on the door and did barbara find itshe wandered up to the front of the big edwardian house where the ground floor flats french windows were open from the sitting room onto the flagstones of the area and within the room itself a childs voice was declaring but they dont fit dad honest hadiyyah and her father were just inside hadiyyah seated on a creampuffshaped ottoman and taymullah azhar kneeling next to her like a lovesick orsino the object of their attention appeared to be the shoes that hadiyyah was wearing these were black laceups of schooluniform appearance and hadiyyah was squirming round in them as if they were a new device for extracting information from double agents my toesre all squished up my toe knuckles hurt and you are certain this pain has nothing to do with the desire to follow a fad of fashion khushi dad hadiyyahs tone was martyred please thesere school shoes you know and as we both recall barbara said from the flagstones school shoes are never cool azhar they always defy fashion thats why theyre school shoes father and daughter looked up hadiyyah crying out barbara i left you a note on the door did you get it i stuck it with sellotape and azhar leaning back on his heels to give his daughters shoes a more objective scrutiny she says they no longer fit he told barbara i myself am not convinced arbitration is called for barbara said may i come in yes of course azhar rose and made a gesture of welcome in his formal fashion the flat was fragrant with the smell of curry barbara saw that the table was neatly laid for dinner and she said quickly oh sorry i wasnt thinking about the time azhar youve not eaten yet and dyou want me to come back later i just saw hadiyyahs note and thought id pop round you know the sewing lesson this afternoon id promised her she brought herself up short enough she thought he smiled perhaps youll join us for our meal oh gosh no i mean i havent eaten yet but i wouldnt want to you must hadiyyah said happily dad say that she must were having chicken biryani and dal and dads special veg curry which mummy cries when she eats cause its so spicy she says hari you make it far too hot and her eye makeup runs doesnt it dad hari barbara thought azhar said it does khushi and to barbara it will be our pleasure if you join us barbara she thought better run better hide but nonetheless she said thanks i will then hadiyyah crowed she pirouetted in her ostensibly tootight shoes her father watched her gravely and said with meaning ah as to your feet hadiyyah let me check them barbara interposed quickly hadiyyah flew to the ottoman and plopped down upon it she said they pinch and they pinch even then dad really azhar chuckled and disappeared into the kitchen barbara will decide he told his daughter they really pinch awfully hadiyyah said feel how my toesre scrunched up in front i dont know hadiyyah barbara said probing the toecaps tentatively whatll you replace these with more of the same the little girl didnt reply barbara looked up hadiyyah was sucking in on her lip well barbara asked hadiyyah have they changed the style of shoe you can wear with your uniform thesere so ugly she whispered i feel like i got boats on my feet the new shoesre slipons barbara theyve the loveliest leather braid round the top and the sweetest little tassel dangling over the toes theyre a bit spensive which is why not everyone has them yet but i know i could wear them forever if i got them i really could she looked so hopeful brown eyes the size of old tuppence pieces barbara wondered how her father managed to deny her anything she said in her position of arbiter will you go for a compromise hadiyyahs brow scrunched as effectively as had done her toes she said whats compromise an agreement in which both parties get what they want just not exactly how they expected to get it hadiyyah thought this over bouncing her laceupclad feet against the ottoman she said all right i spose but theyre really pretty shoes barbara if you saw them youd understand doubtless barbara said youve probably noticed what a fashion hound i am she heaved herself to her feet with a wink at hadiyyah she called into the kitchen id say shes got several months in these azhar hadiyyah looked stricken she wailed several months but shell definitely need another pair before bonfire night barbara said meaningfully she mouthed compromise in hadiyyahs direction and watched the little girl do the mental maths from september to november hadiyyah looked pleased when shed counted up the weeks azhar came to the kitchen door hed tucked a tea towel into his trousers to serve as an apron in his hand he held a wooden spoon you can be that exact with your shoe analysis barbara he asked soberly sometimes my talents amaze even myself curry in the kitchen was just another thing that azhar appeared to do effortlessly he accepted no assistance even with the washing up saying your presence is the gift you bring to our meal barbara we require nothing else of you to her offers of help nonetheless she bullied her way to clearing the dining table at least and while he was scrubbing and drying in the kitchen she entertained his daughter which was her pleasure hadiyyah pulled barbara into her bedroom once the table was cleared declaring that she had something special and secret to show a justbetweenusgirls revelation barbara assumed but instead of a collection of film star photos or a few penciled notes passed to her at school hadiyyah pulled from beneath her bed a carrier bag whose contents she lovingly eased out onto her counterpane finished today she announced proudly in sewing class i was sposed to leave it for the displaydid you get my invitation to the sewing show barbarabut i told miss bateman id bring it back nice and clean but that i had to have it to give to dad cause he wrecked one pair of trousers already when he was cooking dinner it was a bib apron hadiyyah had crafted it from pale chintz on which was printed an endless pattern of mother ducks leading their broods towards a pond with a stand of reeds the mother ducks all wore identical bonnets their little ones each carried a different beachgoing utensil under a tiny wing dyou think hell like it hadiyyah asked anxiously the ducks re so sweet arent they but i spose for a man i especially love ducks see dad and i feed them at regents park sometimes so when i saw this material but i expect i couldve chosen something more mannish couldnt i the thought of azhar encased in the aprons folds made barbara want to smile but she didnt instead she examined the zigzagging seams and the hem with its lopsided loving hand stitching she said its perfect hell love it dyou think so its my first project see and im not very good miss bateman wanted me to start with something simpler like a hankie but i knew what i wanted to make cause dad wrecked his trousers like i said and i knew he didnt want to wreck any more trousers cooking whichs why i brought this home to give to him shall we do that now then barbara asked oh no its for tomorrow hadiyyah said weve a special day planned dad and i were to go to the sea were to pack a picnic lunch and eat on the sand ill give it to him then as a thankyou for taking me and afterwards well ride the roller coaster on the pier and dadll play the crane grab for me hes quite good at the crane grab is dad yes i know i saw him work it once remember thats right you did hadiyyah said brightly would you like to come with us to the sea then barbara itll be such a special day were taking a picnic lunch and well go to the pleasure pier and theres the crane grab as well ill ask dad if you can come she scampered to her feet calling dad dad can barbara no barbara interrupted hastily hadiyyah no kiddo i cant go im in the middle of a case and ive got mountains of work i shouldnt even be here right now with all the calls i shouldve been making before bed but thanks for the thought well do it another time hadiyyah stopped door knob in hand were going to the pleasure pier she coaxed ill be with you in spirit barbara assured her and she thought about the resilience of children and she marveled at their capacity for taking what came considering what had occurred the last time hadiyyah had been to the sea barbara wondered that she wanted to go again but children arent like adults she thought what they cant endure they simply forget chapter least were running round incognito was dc winston nkatas announcement as they pulled into the boltons a small neighbourhood shaped like a rugger ball sandwiched between the fulham and old brompton roads it consisted of two curving leafy streets that formed an oval round the central church of st mary the boltons and its predominant characteristics were the number of security cameras that were mounted on the exterior walls of the mansions and the ostentatious display of rollsroyces mercedesbenz and rangerovers that were tucked behind the iron gates of many of the properties when lynley and nkata pulled into the boltons the streetlamps had not yet switched on and the pavements were largely deserted the only sign of life came from a cat who slinked along the gutter in pursuit of another slinking feline and a filipinadressed in the anachronistic blackandwhite garb of a housemaidwho tucked a handbag under her arm and slid into a ford capri across the street from the house that lynley and nkata were seeking nkatas remark was in reference to lynleys bentley as perfectly at home in this neighbourhood as it had been in notting hill but other than being in possession of the car the two detectives couldnt have been more out of place in the area lynley for his choice of occupation so unlikely in a man whose family could trace its roots back to the conqueror and whose more recent ancestors would have considered the boltons a step down from their usual haunts and nkata for the obvious caribbeanviasouthbankofthethames sound of his voice dont spect they see much rozzer action here nkata said as he stood surveying the iron railings the cameras the alarm boxes and the intercoms that appeared to be the feature of every dwelling but it makes you wonder what the point isall that moneyif you got to wall yourself up to enjoy it i wouldnt disagree lynley said and he accepted an opal fruit from the detective constables portable stash unwrapping it and carefully folding the paper into his pocket so as not to foul the pristine footpath with litter lets see what sir adrian beattie has to say lynley had recognised the name when tricia reeve had spoken it in notting hill sir adrian beattie was the uks answer to christiaan barnard hed performed the first heart transplant in england and hed successfully kept performing them round the world for the last several decades establishing a record of success that had assured his place in medical history and guaranteed his wealth this latter was on display in the boltons beatties home was a fortress of glacially white walls and gridiron windows with a front gate barring entrance to anyone who couldnt provide its inhabitants with an acceptable identity through an intercom from which a disembodied voice demanded yes in a tone suggesting that not just any answer would do assuming that new scotland yard would have a cachet unavailable to the simple word police lynley used their place of employment along with their ranks when he identified himself and nkata in reply the gate clicked ajar by the time lynley and nkata had mounted the six front steps the door had been opened by a woman wearing an incongruous coneshaped party hat she introduced herself as margaret beattie daughter of sir adrian the family were having a birthday party at the moment she explained hastily unhooking the hats elastic strap from her chin and removing the cone from her head her daughter was this very evening celebrating the happy negotiation of five years among her fellow men was there something wrong in the neighbourhood not a burglary she hoped and she glanced past them anxiously as if breaking and entering in the boltons were a daily occurrence that she might inadvertently encourage by holding the front door open for longer than necessary they were there to see sir adrian lynley explained and no their visit had nothing to do with the neighbourhood and its vulnerability to professional thieves margaret beattie said doubtfully i see and admitted them into the house she said that if theyd wait in her fathers study upstairs she would fetch the man himself i hope it wont take too long what youve come to see him about she said with the sort of gentle smiling insistence a wellbred woman always uses to imply what she wants without stating it directly mollys his favourite grandchild and hes told her she can have him all to herself tonight hes promised to read her a whole chapter of peter pan he asked her what she wanted for her birthday and that was it remarkable dont you think quite obviously pleased margaret beattie beamed directed them to the study and went seeking her father sir adrians study was on the first floor of the house at the top of a wide staircase decorated with burgundy leather armchairs and fitted with forestgreen carpet the room contained a plethora of volumes from the medical to the mundane and it acted as a silent testimony to the two disparate aspects of sir adrians life the professional side was represented by medallions certificates awards and mementos as diverse as antique surgical instruments and centuriesold engravings of the human heart the personal side showed itself in dozens of photographs they stood everywhereon the mantelpiece tucked into random spaces in the bookshelves lined up like dancers ready to high kick across the top of the desk their subjects were the doctors family on holiday at home at school and through the years lynley picked up one picture and examined it as nkata bent to scrutinise the antique instruments that were arranged on the top of a dwarf breakfront bookcase the doctor had four children it seemed in the picture lynley held beattie posed among them and among their spouses a proud paterfamilias with his wife standing next to him and eleven grandchildren clustered about him like tiny beads of oil round a larger central drop that seeks to absorb them the occasion of the photograph had been a christmas celebration with each of the children holding a gift and beattie himself decked out as father christmas sans beard everyone in the picture was either smiling or laughing and lynley wondered how their expressions would have read should sir adrians liasion with a dominatrix have become publicor even familialknowledge detective inspector lynley lynley swung round at the sound of the pleasant tenor it should have been voiced by a younger man but it came from the rotund surgeon himself who stood in the doorway a papier mâché captains hat on his head and a flute of champagne in his hand he said were about to toast our little molly shes going to open her presents can this wait another hour im afraid not lynley replaced the photograph and introduced nkata who reached in his jacket pocket for his notebook and pencil beattie saw this with apparent consternation he entered the room and shut the door behind him is this a professional call has something happened my family he looked in the direction from which he had come and dismissed whatever it was that hed intended to say bearing bad news about a member of his family could not be the reason that the police had come calling his family members were all in his house a young woman called nicola maiden was murdered in derbyshire on tuesday night lynley told the surgeon in reply beattie was stillness itself waiting incarnate his eyes were on lynley his surgeons handsan old mans hands that still looked as nimble as the hands of a man three decades youngerneither trembled grasped the glass more tightly nor moved in any visible way his glance went to nkata dropping to the little leather notebook in the dcs big palm then back to lynley lynley said you knew nicola maiden didnt you sir adrian although perhaps you knew her by her professional name only nikki temptation beattie advanced across the carpet and set his champagne glass upon the desk with studied care he placed himself behind the desk in a highback chair and canted his head at the leather armchairs he finally said please sit inspector you as well constable and when they had done so he went on with ive not seen a paper what happened to her please it was the sort of question that a man who was used to being in charge might have asked of a subordinate in reply however lynley sought to communicate which of them would be controlling the direction of the conversation he said evenly you did know nicola maiden then beatties fingers folded round each other two of them lynley saw had nails that were blackened both of them deformed by some sort of fungus that apparently grew rampant beneath them it was a disconcerting sight in a man of medicine and lynley wondered that beattie didnt do something about it yes i knew nicola maiden beattie said tell us about your relationship behind goldframed spectacles the eyes were wary am i a suspect everyone who knew her is a suspect you said tuesday night i did say that yes i was here on tuesday night in this house not here but in london at my club in st jamess shall i arrange for corroboration inspector thats the word i want isnt it corroboration lynley said tell us about nicola when did you see her last beattie reached for his champagne and drank to gain time to still nerves it was impossible to tell the morning of the day before she left for the north this would be last june nkata asked and when beattie nodded nkata added in islington islington beattie frowned no here she came to the house she always came to the house when i when i needed her your relationship was sexual then lynley said you were one of her clients beattie turned his head away from lynley looking towards the mantelpiece with its copious display of family photos i expect you know the answer to that question youd hardly have come calling on a saturday evening had you not been told exactly where i fitted in nikkis life so yes i was one of her clients if thats what youd like to call it what would you call it we had a mutually beneficial arrangement she provided an indispensable service i paid her generously for it youre a man with a high public profile lynley pointed out youve a successful career a wife and children grandchildren and all the external trappings of a fortunate life ive all the internal trappings as well beattie said it is a fortunate life so why would i risk losing it by having a liaison with a common prostitute thats what you want to know isnt it but thats just the point you see inspector lynley nikki wasnt common in any way music started somewhere in the house a furious and proficient playing on a piano chopin it sounded like then the tune broke off abruptly amid some shouting to be replaced by a spritely cole porter piece that was accompanied by exuberant voices not bothering to aim for the appropriate key call me irresponsible call me unreliable the group partly howled partly laughed partly sang much guffawing and goodnatured derision followed this the happy family in celebration so im learning lynley agreed youre not the first person to mention the fact that she was a cut above the ordinary but actually why you were willing to risk everything with an affair thats not what it was with an arrangement then why youd risk everything for that isnt what i want to know im more interested in discovering exactly what youd be willing to do to safeguard what you havethese external and internal trappings of your lifeif the continuing possession of them was threatened in some way threatened beatties voice was too perplexed for lynley to believe the reaction was ingenuous surely the man knew how much he put at jeopardy by having a prostitute operating on the periphery of his life every man has enemies lynley told him even you i dare say should someone untrustworthy have found out about your arrangement with nicola maiden should someone have decided to harm you by revealing that arrangement you would have lost a great deal and not all of it tangible ah i do see the traditional outcome of societal defiance who steals my purse beattie murmured then he went on more conversationally giving lynley the oddest sensation that they might have been discussing the next days weather forecast that couldnt have happened inspector nikki came to the house as i said she dressed conservatively carried a brief case and drove a saab to all appearances she was arriving to take dictation or to help plan a party and as our encounters took place well away from windows there was absolutely nothing for anyone to see she herself didnt wear a blindfold i expect of course she didnt she could hardly do that and be of any satisfactory service to me so youll no doubt agree that she might have been in possession of certain details about you details which if revealed could confirm a storyperhaps one sold to a tabloidthat would prove whatever facts she might choose to lay before a public for whom gossip can never be salacious enough beattie said sounding pensive good my god so corroboration is in order as you guessed lynley said well need the name of your club are you suggesting that i killed nikki because she wanted more from me than i was paying or because id decided i didnt need her any longer and she was threatening to go public if i didnt keep paying her he drank a final mouthful of his champagne afterwards giving a rueful laugh and shoving the glass away he lumbered to his feet saying mother of god if that had only been the case wait here please and he left the room nkata rose quickly in response guv shll i wait lets see he could be on the phone setting up his alibi i dont think so lynley couldnt have explained why he had that feeling save the fact that there was something decidedly odd in sir adrian beatties reactions not only to the news of nicola maidens murder but also to the logical implication that his involvement with her had vast potential to destroy everything he appeared to value when beattie returned some two minutes later he brought with him a woman whom he introduced to the detectives as his wife lady beattie he titled her and then to the woman herself chloe these men are here about nikki maiden lady beattiea thin woman with wallis simpson hair and skin made shiny by too many faceliftsreached for the triplestrand pearls that were slung round her neck like souvenir golf balls she said nikki maiden shes not in some kind of trouble i hope unfortunately shes been murdered my dear her husband said and he placed a hand at her elbow perhaps on the chance that shed find the news distressing which she apparently did saying oh my god adrian and reaching for him he slid his hand down her arm and took her own clucking at it with what looked to lynley like genuine tenderness awful he said ghastly rotten these policemen have come because they think i might be involved because of the arrangement lady beattie disengaged her hand from her husbands she raised a shapely eyebrow saying but isnt it much more likely that nikki could have hurt you and not the opposite she didnt allow anyone to dominate her did she i remember her being quite specific about that the very first time we interviewed her i wont be the bottom is exactly what she said i only tried it once and i found it revolting and then she pardoned herself thinking she might have offended you i remember that perfectly dont you dear i dont expect she was killed during a session beattie told his wife theyve said it was in derbyshire and shed got that summer job with the solicitor you remember and in her free time she didnt that was only in london as far as i know i see lynley found himself feeling as if hed just stepped through the looking glass he glanced at nkata and saw that the dc his face a study in stupefaction felt the same lynley said perhaps youd explain the arrangement to us sir adrian lady beattie the background will allow us to see what were dealing with of course lady beattie and her husband were pleased as punch to give a full account of sir adrians sexual proclivities lady beattie sat gracefully on a sofa near the fireplace the men went back to their original positions and while her husband outlined the exact nature of his relationship with nicola maiden she added salient details wherever he forgot them hed met nicola maiden round the first of november the previous year perhaps nine months after his chloes arthritis had become too painful in her hands for her to be able to perform the rites of discipline that theyd learned to enjoy throughout their marriage we thought at first that wed simply go without sir adrian said the pain i mean not the sex itself we thought wed just cope be traditional and all that but it wasnt long before we saw that my need he paused as if seeking an abbreviated way to explain that would not take them through the cobwebbed labyrinth of his psyche it is a need you see you must understand that if youre to understand anything go on lynley said he shot a look at nkata the dc had resumed his scrupulous notetaking although his expression was telegraphing oh lord whats my mum going to say bout this as eloquently as if he were speaking it realising that sir adrians need was going to have to be met if the beatties wanted to continue their own sexual relations theyd sought someone young healthy strong andmost importantentirely discreet to minister to him nicola maiden lynley said discretion wasiscritical sir adrian said for a man in my position obviously he couldnt select a dominatrix blindly by choosing someone from a phone box card or a magazine advert he could hardly ask friends and colleagues for recommendations and going to ans m clubor even to one of the lesser flesh pits in soho in the hope of meeting a likely candidatewasnt a wise option since there was always the chance of being seen being recognised and consequently being subjected to the sort of tabloid treatment guaranteed to cause excruciating agonies to his children the spouses of his children and their offspring and to chloe of course sir adrian added with a nod for while she knewhas always known in factabout the hunger her friends and relations dont know and i expect shed like to keep it that way thank you darling chloe said so sir adrian had contacted an escort serviceglobal escorts to be preciseand through that institution had ultimately met nicola maiden their first interviewconsisting of tea scones and satisfactory conversationhad been followed by a second in which the initial deal had been struck deal lynley asked when her services would be required chloe explained what they would entail and what she would be paid for them chloe and i talked to her together for both interviews to make the arrangements sir adrian said it was crucial that she understand there would be nothing gained by holding over my head a liaison potentially painful to my wife because it wasnt painful chloe said at least not to me will you show them the chamber darling sir adrian asked his wife ill pop down to the children and let them know well be with them before too much longer of course she replied come with me inspector constable and as gracefully as shed sat she rose leading them to the door and up two flights of stairs as sir adrian went off to have a few words with his partying offspring they were ironically crooning i get no kick from champagne lady beattie showed them up to the top floor of the house from deep within an old clothes press that stood in the narrow corridor there she took a key which she used on one of the doors she swung it open preceded the police into the room and switched on a lowwattage light he actually wanted only discipline at first she explained which while i found it a bit odd frankly i was able to give him rulers on the palm paddles on the bottom the strap against the back of his legs but after a few years he wanted more and when it got to the point that i wasnt strong enough well hes already explained that hasnt he at any rate heres where they had their sessionswhere he and i had them as well when i was able the chamber as theyd called it had been fashioned out of several of the erstwhile servants bedrooms by knocking out walls padding them installing a ventilation system that obviated the use of windowswhich were themselves shuttered against potential outside curiositythe beatties had created a fantasy world that was in part headmasters office operating theatre dungeon and mediaeval torture chamber a line of cupboards had been fitted under the eaves and lady beattie opened these to display the various costumes and devices of discipline as she called them that had been used on sir adrian it was clear why the maiden girl had brought nothing with her to the house save her desire to be useful to sir adrian and to be paid well for her usefulness the costumes in the cupboards ranged from a heavy wool nuns habit to a prison guards uniform complete with truncheon there was of course the more traditional garb associated with thes m game pvc getups of red or black leather teddies and masks highheeled boots and the instruments of sir adrians discipline tidily arranged like the antique surgical instruments in the study also explained why shed been able to make her calls so lightly burdened everything necessary for discipline pain and humiliation had been collected and housed together from his years in policing lynley knew that he should by now have seen it all but every time he thought he had something in life caught him by surprise and in this case it wasnt so much the presence of the chamber in the beatties house that took his breath away it was the attitude to it taken by the couple themselves particularly the wife she might have been showing them a stateoftheart kitchen she seemed to realise this watching lynley from her position in the doorway observing nkata wandering the length of the room with an expression on his face that suggested how actively his imagination was supplying him with images of the uses to which the costumes and the equipment were put she said quietly i wouldnt have had it this way had i been given a choice one does expect a traditional marriage but loving someone means compromise occasionally and once he explained why it was so important to him she gestured at the room with a hand whose knuckles were enlarged from the disease that had necessitated nicola maidens entrance into the beatties private world need is just need so long as judgement remains apart from it need has no real power to hurt us did you mind another woman seeing to the need my husband loves me ive never had any doubt about that lynley wondered sir adrian rejoined them saying to her youre wanted below darling mollys not to be denied her presents another five minutes but will you they communicated in that way peculiar to couples whod been married for more than a generation as soon as i finish here it wont be long when shed left them sir adrian waited for a moment before he said quietly theres a part of course that id rather chloe didnt know it would only hurt her unnecessarily nkata made his notebook ready as lynley thought about what the surgeons statement implied he said you paged hernicolathroughout the summer but as she couldnt have serviced you with discipline from derbyshire ive a feeling your arrangement was something more than you wanted to say in front of your wife youre very good inspector beattie closed the chamber door i was in love with her not at first naturally we didnt know each other but within a month or two i realised how strongly i was feeling about her initially i told myself it was only addiction a new woman doing the discipline heightened my excitement and i wanted that excitement more and more often but it went beyond that in the end because she was far more than i expected so i wanted to keep her as your wife i love chloe but theres more than one kind of love in a mans lifewhich you may know already or will come to know eventuallyand selfishly i hoped to experience it he dropped his gaze to the deformed nails at the ends of his fingers he said i felt sexual love for nikki the sort that has to do with physical possession animal craving my love for chloe on the other hand is the stuff of our history when i knew i had this other love for nikkithis sexual thing that i found i couldnt get out of my mind the more we meti told myself it was natural to feel it she was meeting a tremendous need of mine and no matter what i wanted she was willing to do it to me but when i saw there was so much more to her than domination you became reluctant to share her with other men an intuitive leap yes you are very good nicola visited the boltons at least five times a week beattie told them and he explained the frequency of their sessions to chloe by talking about the heightened stress of his work as younger doctors and advances in medicine had increased his level of anxiety to the point that only discipline could relieve it i told nikki that when the craving came upon me i wanted her available to gratify it at once he said but the reality was more complicated than that the reality was infinitely simple i couldnt cope with imagining nikki doing to othersand being to otherswhat she was doing and being to me thinking of her with anyone else was a quick descent into hell and i didnt expect that to feel that way about a tart but then when i took her on i didnt know how much more than a tart she was going to be without his wifes knowledge hed offered nicola a special deal he would pay to keep herand pay her more than shed ever dreamed of being paidin whatever situation she fancied for herself a flat a house a hotel suite a country cottage he didnt care just so long as she promised him that her time would be kept open solely for him i claimed that i didnt want to stand in a queue or book an appointment any longer beattie explained but if i wanted her available to me at any hour i had to place her in a position where she was free the maisonette in fulham gave her that position and since nicola always came to sir adrian and not the reverse it was of little account to him that she asked to be allowed a flatmate as company for the periods of time when he didnt want her services that was fine with me he told them all i wanted was her to be available whenever i phoned and for the first month thats what she was five or six days a week sometimes twice a day shed arrive within an hour of being paged shed stay as long as i wanted her to be here the arrangement worked well but then she returned to derbyshire why she claimed that she needed to honour a commitment to work for a solicitor up there that shed be gone only for the summer i was a fool in love but not so much of a fool as to believe that i told her i wouldnt go on paying for the fulham place if she wasnt going to be in town for me but she went anyway she was willing to risk losing what she had from you what does that suggest the obvious i knew that if she was returning to derbyshire despite what i was paying herand providing herto be here in london there had to be a reason and the reason was money someone there was paying her more than i was which meant of course another man the solicitor i accused her she denied it and i have to admit that an ordinary solicitor couldnt have afforded her not without an independent source of income so it was someone else but she wouldnt name him no matter what i threatened its only for the summer she kept saying and i kept bellowing i dont bloody care you quarreled bitterly i withdrew my support i knew shed have to go back to the escort serviceor perhaps even to the streetif she wanted to keep the maisonette when she returned to london and i was betting that she wouldnt want to do that but i bet wrong she left me anyway and i lasted four days before i was on the phone ready to give her anything to return to me more money a house god even my name but she wouldnt return she didnt mind being on the street she said casually this was as if id asked her how she was finding derbyshire weve got cards printed and vis are already out there she said minell be out there as well when i get back to town i have no hard feelings about whats happened between you and me ady and anyway vi says the phones ringing day and night so well be fine did you believe her i accused her of trying to drive me mad i railed then i apologised then she played up to me on the phone then i wanted her desperately and couldnt bear to think of what she was giving him whoever he was then i railed at her again stupid bloody stupid but i was desperate to have her back i would have done anything he stopped seeming to realise how his words could be interpreted lynley said on tuesday night sir adrian inspector i didnt kill nikki i couldnt have harmed her i havent even seen her since june id hardly be standing here telling you all this if id i couldnt have hurt her your clubs name brooks s i met a colleague there for dinner on tuesday hell confirm i dare say but my god you wont tell him that i no one knows inspector its something thats between chloe and me and anyone nicola maiden chose to tell lynley thought what would it mean to sir adrian beattie to have his most closely guarded secret held over his head like damocles sword what would he do if threatened with exposure did nicola ever introduce you to her flatmate once yes when i gave her the keys to the maisonette so vi nevin the flatmate knew about the arrangement perhaps i dont know but why even take the risk of someone knowing lynley wondered why allow a flatmate into the mix and face the dangers inherent in an outsiders having knowledge of a sexual proclivity that could cause such humiliation to a man in beatties position beattie himself seemed to read the questions in lynleys eyes he said do you know what it feels like to be that desperate for a woman so desperate that youll agree to anything do anything to have her thats what it was like what about terry cole how did he fit in i dont know a terry cole lynley tried to gauge the level of veracity in the statement he couldnt do so beattie was too good at maintaining his expression of guilelessness but that alone increased lynleys suspicion he thanked the surgeon for his time and he and nkata took their leave giving beattie back into the arms of his family incongruously the man had kept his papier mâché captains hat on throughout their interview lynley wondered if the wearing of that hat kept him firmly anchored in his family life or acted as a spurious symbol of a devotion that he did not feel once out on the street nkata said my sweet lord what people get themselves into spector hmm yes lynley agreed and what they get themselves out of as well you dont believe his story lynley answered indirectly talk to the people at brooks s theyll have records showing when he was there then head over to islington youve seen sir adrian beattie in the flesh youve seen martin reeve as well talk to the maiden girls landlady the neighbours lets see if anyone can recall glimpsing either of those gentlemen there on the ninth of may asking a lot guv four months back ive faith in your powers of interrogation lynley disarmed the bentleys security system saying over the cars roof climb in ill drop you at the tube whats on for yourself vi nevin if anyone can confirm beatties story shes going to be the one azhar wouldnt hear of barbara walking the seventy or so yards alone to her bungalow at the bottom of the garden she might be mugged raped accosted or attacked by a cat with a proclivity for thick ankles so he tucked his daughter into her bed scrupulously locked the door of his flat and ushered barbara round the side of the house he offered her a cigarette she accepted and they paused to light up the flaring match emphasising the contrasting colours of their skin as she held the cigarette to her lips and he sheltered the flame near to her mouth nasty habit she said conversationally hadiyyahs after me all the time to stop after me as well azhar said her mother isat least she wasquite a militant nonsmoker and hadiyyah has apparently inherited not only angelas dislike of tobacco but also her crusading spirit the words constituted the most azhar had yet said about the mother of his child barbara wanted to ask him whether hed informed his daughter that her mother was gone for good or if he was still holding firmly to the fairy tale of angela westons holiday in canada one which had now extended itself for nearly five months but she said nothing beyond yeah well youre her dad and i expect shed like to keep you round for a few more years they followed the path that led to her digs thanks for the dinner azhar it was lovely when i get beyond reheating pizza i want to return the favour if youll let me that would be a pleasure barbara she expected him to turn back for his flather own small hovel being well in view so there was little chance that shed come to trouble in a fivesecond saunter down the rest of the garden path to it but he continued to walk along with her in his quiet way they reached her front door she hadnt locked it and when she swung it open azhar frowned and said that her sense of security was not as heightened as it ought to be she said yeah but shed intended only to pop round for a moment and apologise to hadiyyah for having forgotten the sewing lesson that shed promised to attend she hadnt intended to stay for dinner and thank you for that meal by the way you are a brilliant cook or have i said that already azhar politely pretended that she hadnt mentioned his cooking until that moment after which he insisted that he be allowed inside to make certain there were no unwanted visitors lurking in the shower or under the day bed having examined the bungalow to his satisfaction azhar advised her to lock her door carefully when he left but then he didnt leave instead he glanced at the dining room table where barbara had flung her belongings upon arriving home from work these consisted of her shapeless old shoulder bag and a manila folder into which shed tucked the roster of employees from soho square her own surreptitiously duplicated copy of the postmortem that shed delivered to st james and the rough draft of the report shed crafted for lynley delineating the information shed gleaned from reading the so files of andy maiden azhar said this new investigation keeps you busy you must be gratified to be back among your colleagues yeah barbara said it was a long patch of waiting regents park and i were becoming a bit more acquainted than id thought we might be when it all began azhar drew in on his cigarette watching her over it and then through the smoke she never liked it when he looked at her this way it was a look that always left her wondering what was supposed to happen next she said thanks again for the meal thank you for sharing it with us but still he made no move to leave and she realised why when he finally said the letters d and c barbara theyre an indication of rank in the police force are they not her heart sank she wanted to divert the conversation they were about to have but she couldnt think of a quick way to do so so she said yeah generally i mean i suppose it depends on what theyre attached to those letters like washington dc thats not a rank but of course its not a police force either she smiled far too brightly she decided but attached to your name dc detective constable yes damn barbara thought but what she said was oh yeah right then youve been demoted i saw the letters on that note that the gentleman left for you i thought at first there was some sort of mistake but as youve not been working with inspector lynley dont always work with the inspector azhar sometimes we take different parts of a case do you but she could see he didnt believe the story or at least that he thought there was something more to it demotion and yet theres been no reduction in the force has there i believe you told me that earlier didnt you and if thats the case it seems that you must be avoiding a truth with me that is i find myself wondering why azhar im not avoiding anything hell we dont exactly live in each others knickers do we barbara said and then found her face blazing with the implication of an intimacy which she hadnt intended bloody hell she thought why was conversation with this man such a verbal minefield i mean we dont do a lot of job talk you and i we never have done you teach your classes at the university i saunter round the yard and try to look indispensable demotion is serious in any profession and in this case i expect that it comes from your time in essex doesnt it what happened there barbara whoa howd you make that jump he crushed out his cigarette in an ashtray from which at least ten dog ends of players protruded from the burnt tobacco like burgeoning vegetables he regarded her i am correct in the surmise am i not you were disciplined because of your work in essex last june what happened barbara its sort of a private situation she temporised i mean you know its a personal thing why dyou want to know because i find myself in a state of confusion about british law and i wish to understand it better how can i be of assistance to my people when they have legal difficulties if i dont clearly see how the laws of your country are applied to the individual who breaks them but this wasnt a case of breaking a law barbara said and that she told herself was merely a mild prevarication after all she hadnt been in the dock defending herself against a charge of assault or attempted murder so shed been able to convince herself that lawwise shed always been in the clear nonetheless as you are my friendat least i hope that you are of course i am then perhaps youll help me to understand more about your society bollocks barbara thought he understood more about british society than she herself did but she could hardly take the discussion in that direction where it would soon enough crumble into a punch and judy of yes you do no i dont so she said its nothing much i had a row with the dci in charge of the case out in essex azhar we were in the middle of a chase and the one thing an underling isnt supposed to do is to question an order in the middle of a chase thats what happened and thats why i lost my rank for questioning an order i tend to question more forcefully than the average bird she said airily its a habit that i learned in school im short i get lost in a crowd if i dont make myself heard you ought to hear me order a pint of bass in the load of hay when the football crowds watching an arsenal match on the telly but when i used the same approach with dci barlow she didnt much like it yet to lose your rank its a draconian measure certainly are you being made an example of can you not protest it is there not a union or organisation who might represent you aggressively enough to in a situation like this barbara cut in its best not to make waves let the smoke clear you know let sleeping dogs lie she groaned inwardly the queen of cliché anyway when enough time passes itll sort itself out the situation you know she smashed her own cigarette among the others putting an end to their discussion she waited for him to bid her goodnight instead he said hadiyyah and i go to the seaside tomorrow she told me shes looking forward to it the pleasure pier especially and shes expecting a big win from the crane grab azhar so i hope youve been practising with the pincers he smiled she asks for so little and yet life appears to give her so much phaps thats why barbara pointed out if you dont spend your time looking for something particular what you end up finding suits you just fine wise words he acknowledged wisdoms cheap barbara thought she rustled in the manila folder on the table and brought out the roster of names from soho square duty was calling her action told him and azhar was nothing if not astute at drawing inferences from unspoken implications the journey from sir adrian beatties home to vi nevins maisonette was little more than a cruise down the fulham road in rather light traffic it didnt take long but it was long enough for lynley to consider what hed heard from beattie and what he felt about what hed heard after years in cid he realised that there was no real place in the investigation for him to be dwelling upon what he felt about anyones revelations least of all sir adrians but he found that he couldnt help himself and he justified the direction his thoughts were taking by declaring them natural sexual deviance was as much a curiosity as a twoheaded kitten one might shudder at the sight of such an anomaly but one still looked at it however briefly and thats what he was doing looking at the deviant behaviour for its anomaly quotient first then evaluating the possibility that sexual deviance in itself was the relevant detail that would allow him to unearth nicola maidens killer the only problem he was having with attempting to use sexual deviance as a means of finding a killer was that he was discovering himself incapable of moving beyond the mere presence of the deviance in the first place why was this he wondered was he titillated by it sententiously condemnatory intrigued appalled seduced what he couldnt have said he knew it existed of course what some would call the dark side of desire he was aware of at least some of the theoretical frameworks that students of the psyche had constructed to explain it depending upon what school of thought one wished to enroll in sadomasochism could be considered an erotic blasphemy born of sexual dissent an upperclass vice growing out of spending ones formative years in boarding schools where corporal punishment was the order of the dayand the more ritualised the better a defiant reaction to a rigidly conservative upbringing an expression of personal loathing for the simple possession of sexual drives or the sole means of physical intimacy for those whose terror of the mere prospect of intimacy was greater than their willingness to overcome it but what he didnt know was why at the moment the thought of deviancy was eating away at him and it was the why of that eating away that plagued his mind what has all this to do with love lynley had wanted to ask the surgeon what did being bruised beaten bloodied and humiliated have to do with the ineffable andyes all right it was absurdly romantic but hed use the term anywaytranscendent joy that was attached to the act of possessing and of being possessed by another person wasnt that joy the outcome to which sexual partners ought to aspire when they engaged in intercourse or was he too new a newlywed to be making any assessments at all about what went for devotion between consenting adults and did sex have anything to do with love anyway and should it for that matter or was that where everyone went wrong in the first place assigning an importance to a bodily function that should have no more importance than cleaning ones teeth except that direction of thought was sophistry wasnt it one didnt need to clean ones teeth one didnt even feel the need and it was the feeling of that needthe slow building up of a tension at first subtle and ultimately impossible to ignorethat told the real tale in life because it was that feeling of need which led to a hunger that insisted upon gratification and it was the desire for gratification that caused one to abjure everything that rose up to forbid the satiety one sought one willingly disregarded honour responsibility tradition fidelity and duty in pursuit of ones passion and why because one wanted if he cast himself back more than twenty years lynley could see how the wanting had rent his own family or at least how he himself had allowed the wantingwhich he had then only imperfectly understoodto rend it honour had bound his mother to his father responsibility and tradition had tied her to the family home and to the more than two hundred and fifty years of asherton countesses who had overseen its maintenance and its glory duty had demanded that she concern herself with her husbands failing health and her childrens welfare and fidelity had required that she do it all without openly inwardly or privately acknowledging that she herself might want something differentor at least something morethan the lot shed chosen as an eighteenyearold bride shed coped with everything well until disease began to gnaw at her husband even then shed managed to hold together life as the family had always known it until the very act of having to cope of having to act a role instead of simply being able to live it had made her long for rescue and rescue had come if only temporarily bitch whore tart hed called her and he would have struck herthe mother hed adoredhad she not struck him first and with a violence a frustration and an anger that had given to the blow a force which split open his upper lip why had he reacted so violently to the knowledge of her infidelity lynley wondered now as he braked to avoid a pack of cyclists who were negotiating the right turn onto north end road he watched them idlyall business in their helmets and spandexand considered the question not only for what it revealed about his adolescence but also for what its answer implied about the case in hand the answer he decided had to do with love and with the insidious and often unreasonable expectations that always seemed to attach themselves to the very fact of loving how often we want the love object to be an extension of ourselves he thought and when that doesnt happenbecause it never canour frustration demands that we take action to alleviate the turmoil we feel but he realised there was more than one kind of turmoil that was becoming apparent in the relationships that nicola maiden had had while thwarted desire played a part in her lifeand very possibly in her deathhe couldnt overlook the place that was occupied by jealousy revenge avarice and hate all those crippling passions caused turmoil any one of them could drive someone to murder rostrevor road was a mere half mile south of fulham broadway and the door of vi nevins building was propped open when lynley climbed the steps a handlettered sign on the jamb explained why as did the noise coming from a ground floor flat whose door was also propped open tildy and steves digs at the rear were the words written out in multicoloured felt pen on a sheet of heavy paper smoke outside please was the request made beneath the noise from within was considerable as the partygoers were enjoying the musical talents of an unidentifiable group of males who were gutturally advising members of their sex to use her abuse her have her and lose her all to the accompaniment of percussion electric guitar and brass none of this sounded particularly mellifluous in combination lynley decided he was getting olderand alas stuffierthan he thought he headed for the stairs and dashed upwards the corridor lights were on a timer with a push button at the bottom of the stairs there were windows on the landing but as darkness had fallen these did very little to dispel the gloom above the ground floor of the building so lynley punched for the lights on vi nevins floor and strode towards her door she hadnt been willing to tell the truth about how shed come to meet nicola maiden in the first place she hadnt been willing to name the man who had originally financed the rooms in which she lived there were probably a score of other facts that she could part with if the psychological thumbscrews were applied with enough finesse lynley felt up to the task of applying them although vi nevin was nobodys fool and unlikely to be tricked into revealing information she was also living at the edge of the law and like the reeves shed be willing to compromise if compromise was what would keep her in business he rapped sharply on her door there was a brass knocker so he knew shed be able to hear his knock despite the music and shouting from the party below however there was no answer from within which upon reflection was hardly a circumstance worthy of suspicion since it was a saturday night andwhether she was out servicing a client or otherwise engageda woman away from home on a saturday night was nothing to raise the alarm about he removed one of his cards from his jacket put on his glasses and slid a pen from his pocket to leave her a note he wrote and returned the pen to his pocket he fixed the card to the door at the height of the knob and then he saw it blood an unmistakable thumbprint upon the door knob a second smear some eight inches higher rising at an angle on the door from the jamb christ lynley used his fist against the door miss nevin he called then he shouted vi nevin there was no answer there was no sound from within lynley pulled his wallet from his trouser pocket extracted a credit card and applied it to the old banham latch chapter do you have any idea what youve done any idea at all how long had it been since shed shot up martin reeve wondered and could he hope against unlikely hope that the pathetic smackhead had hallucinated the encounter and not actually lived it in the first place strictly speaking that was possible tricia never answered the door when he wasnt in her paranoia was far too advanced for that so why the hell would she have answered it this time when nearly everything that comprised their lifestyle was sitting at the edge of a cliff just waiting for someone to make a wrong move and send it hurtling down to the boulders below but he knew the answer to that question well enough she would have answered the door because she was brainless because she couldnt be trusted to think in a straight line from action to consequence of action for five minutes because if anyone on the face of the earth even prompted her to think that her pipeline of dope was in danger of being stopped up in some way she would do anything to prevent that happening and answering a door was the least of that anything she would sell her body she would sell her soul she would sell them both down the god damn river which was apparently what the airheaded bitch had actually managed to do while he was out hed found her in their bedroom nodding away in her white wicker rocker next to the window with a swords width of illumination from the streetlight outside falling across her left shoulder and gilding her breast she was completely nude and an oval cheval mirror drawn near to the rocker reflected the ghostly perfection of her body hed said what the hell are you doing tricia not entirely unpleasantly since he was after twenty years of marriage to the woman quite used to finding his wife in an array of conditions from dressed to the nines in a little designer number that cost a small fortune to tucked up in bed at three oclock in the afternoon wearing babygro and sucking on a bottle of piña colada so at first hed thought shed arranged herself for his delectation and while he hadnt been in the mood to fuck her hed still been capable of acknowledging that the money hed spent on beverly hills surgeons had been cash invested with visually enjoyable results but that thought had died like a candles flame in a draught when martin saw how far his wife was gone on the stuff while her shitinduced semisomnolence generally inspired him to take her in that masteroftheragdoll fashion which he vastly preferred when coupling with any woman openly willing to receive his ministrations the afternoon and evening hadnt worked out according to his plans and he knew the workings of his body and his mind well enough to realise that if he roused himself to take another woman todayespecially one who wouldnt put up a gratifying fight against himit wasnt going to be a female whose range of response was similar to that of a bottle of plasma that would hardly provide him with the distraction hed been looking for so at first hed dismissed both her and the possibility of receiving a coherent answer to the question hed asked her and hed ignored her altogether when shed murmured got tgo tmelbourne marty got tgets there straightaway typical strungout nonsense hed thought he went into the bathroom turned on the shower to heat up and lathered his hands beneath the tap soothing both his knuckles and his face with the creamy soap that tricia favoured by the window she spoke again this time louder so as to be heard over the rush of water s i made some calls tsee wha iss cost us to go soons we can marty babe you hear tha got tgo tmelbourne he went to the doorway drying his hands and face gently on a towel she saw him smiled and ran her manicured fingers up her thigh across her stomach and teasingly round her nipple the nipple hardened she smiled wider martin did neither i wonder bout the heat in stralia she said i know you dont much fancy heat bu we got go tmelbourne cause i promised him martin had begun to take her more seriously at that it was the him that caught his attention what are you talking about tricia she said with a pout no listning marty i hate it when you dont listen to me martin knew the importance of keeping his voice pleasant at least for the moment i am listening darling melbourne the heat australia a promise ive heard it all i just dont understand how it fits together and what it relates to perhaps if youll explain what it relates to she waved airily round the room at everything and at nothing then she changed gears abruptly in that jekyllhyde move so common to loadies saying scornfully you soun like such a poof marty prhaps if youll splain martins reservoir of patience was nearly depleted another two minutes of verbal blind mans buff and he was likely to throttle her tricia if youve something of importance to relate tell me otherwise im taking a shower all right ooohhh she mocked hes taking a shower and i spect we know why if we sniff him up we know what well smell so who was it this time which one of the ladies di you have today an don he bout it marty cause i know whats what with you n the girls they tell me yknow they even complain which i spect youd never think of them doing would you for a moment martin considered believing her god knew there were times when the act of simply demanding and taking what wasnt on offer wasnt enough to satisfy him every now and then events piled one upon the other in such a way that only a certain level of ferocity was able to compensate him for his lack of control over the countless daily irritations that swirled round him like gnats but tricia didnt know that beyond a shadow of a doubt and there wasnt a single girl in his stable whod be stupid enough to tell her so martin turned away from his wife without making a response to her remark he stripped off his shirt in preparation for his shower she said from the bedroom so say byebye byebye to all this you ready to do that marty he unzipped his trousers and let them drop to the floor he peeled off his socks he made no reply she went on calling he said if we wen t stralia you and me hed keep his mug shut bout the busness so i spect thats what we got to do he martin reentered the bedroom clad only in his shorts he he said again tricia he within his gut a roiling began a nascent nausea suggesting that something previously inconceivable might actually have happened in the time during which hed left his wife alone in the house righ she said just like a chocolate bar he was and just as sweet i spect if id wanted t try him he dint come with that cow this time round so i couldve i spose only he dint come alone jesus martin thought theyd come back the bastards and theyd got into the house and theyd talked to his airhead nitwit of a wife he strode over to the rocker he knocked her hand from her breast tell me he said sharply the police were here tell me she said hey in protest and reached for her nipple again he caught her fingers in his hand he squeezed them till the bones ground together like brittle twigs he said ill cut it off you like that pretty tit of yours i think you wouldnt want it to go missing would you so tell me right now or i wont answer for the consequences and just to make certain she understood he moved his clasp from her fingers to her hand and then to her wrist a good twist hed found long ago was worth a hundred lashes and more important it didnt leave a significant mark to show mummy and daddy later tricia cried out he increased the torque she shrieked marty he said talk she tried to slither from the rocker to the floor but he had the better position and he straddled her an arm across her throat and he had her head flung back into the wicker chair do you want more he asked or is this enough she opted for the second she told the story he listened with incredulity mounting wanting so much to pound in his wifes face that he wasnt quite sure how hed keep himself from doing it that shed let the cops in the house in the first place bordered on the absolutely fantastic that shed spoken to them about the escort service ventured into the unbelievable but that shed actually given them the name and address of sir adrian beattiejust blithely handed it over without even considering what it meant to break the confidence of a man whose peculiar needs had been serviced by global escorts in the past and whose same peculiar needs would want servicing by global escorts anew now that the maiden tart was finally out of the wayconstituted such an act of insanity that martin didnt know how he could contain his fury so he said do you have any idea what youve done as his insides tightened like a wrungout rag any idea at all and he grabbed her hair and jerked her head back viciously stop it tha hurts marty stop do you know what youve done you stupid little cunt have you any idea how thoroughly youve finished us no hurts oh darling im glad of it and he yanked her head so far back that he could count the muscles down the front of her neck youre worthless beloved he said into her ear youre trash in a bun little wife of mine if your father had just half a dozen fewer connections id throw you on the street and be done with you she began to cry at that she was afraid of him had always been so and that knowledge usually acted like an aphrodisiac upon him but not tonight tonight on the contrary he wanted to kill her they were going to arrest you she cried wha was i sposed to do just let it happen he moved his other hand under her jaw thumb on one side and index finger on the other this grip could cause a mark or two but by god she was such an exceptional imbecile that the consequences of damaging her seemed almost worth it oh were they he said again into her ear and upon what charge marty they knew everthing they knew about global and nicola and about vi and her going off on their own i dint tell them any of that but they knew they asked where you were on tuesday night i told them the resrant but it wasnt enough they were going t search and get our books and give them to the inland revenue and charge you with keeping a disorderly house and stop babbling he pressed thumb and index finger more deeply into her skin to emphasise his point he needed time to think what to do and he wasnt going to be able to manage it with her spewing nonsense like a vomiting cat all right he thought one hand still in tricias hair and the other at her throat the worst had happened his dearly belovedpossessing all the presence of mind of a melting ice cubehad been the one to parry with the cops on their second go in lansdowne road that was unfortunate but it couldnt be helped now and sir adrian beattie not to mention the thousands he was willing to spend in a single month just to gratify the more eccentric of his urges was undoubtedly lost to their ability to regain his custom he might take others with him if he was willing to spread the word to his fellow puling bottoms that his name and inclinations had been made known to the police by a source hitherto unapproachable but there was a saving grace the cops had nothing on martin reeve in the long run had they just the blathering of a smack user whose credibility was about as unimpeachable as a con mans in the act of selling eighteen karat gold necklaces at knightsbridge station they might come to arrest him martin thought well frigging let them he had a solicitor whod have him out of the slammer so fast the cell bars might have been coated with axle grease in anticipation of his rapid departure and if he ever had to stand in front of a magistrate or if he was ever charged with something other than introducing gentlemen with a taste for quirky encounters to appealing and intelligent young women willing to take an active part in those encounters he had in his possession a list of clients from so many lofty positions of influence that the multitudinous strings that could be called upon to pull on his behalf would make the inns of court the old bailey and the metropolitan police look like marionette conventions no he had nothing to worry about in the long run and he was as likely to have to go to australia as to the moon things might be a little unpleasant for a while certain newspaper editors might have to be paid to quash a story here and there but that would be the extent of it aside from the cash hed also probably have to pay out to his solicitor and that likelyand significantexpenditure pissed him off in a very big way so much so in fact that when he thought about it when he added it all up when he dwelt for so much as a nanosecond on the fucking cause of all these added aggravations jesus he just wanted to crush in her face break open her nose blacken her eyes ram himself into her when she was dry and unwilling and likely to scream and beg him to stop so that just for a moment hed be so supreme that no one no one no one in his life would ever again look at him and think he was less than or smaller than or weaker than or god god god how he wanted to hurt her and mutilate everyone else who said martin reeve without mister in front of it who smiled from faces with eyes of derision who crossed his path without stepping aside who dared to even thinktricia had ceased moving she wasnt thrashing her legs were motionless her arms had gone limp martin looked down at her down at his hand whose thumb and index finger made a half circle high on his wifes throat he jumped up jumped off her backed away in a rush she was white in the moonlight as still as marble tricia he said hoarsely god damn you bitch lynleys credit card was sufficient to slide the latch of the lock from its housing the maisonettes door swung open inside all was darkness there was no sound save what drifted upwards from the drinks party going on in the ground floor flat miss nevin lynley called there was no response the light from the corridor provided a glowing parallelogram on the floor in it a large cushion lay half in and half out of its yellow cover of fine brocade next to this a pool of spilled liquid had soaked into the carpet in an alligator shape while just beyond the drinks trolley stood upended and surrounded by its bottles its decantersnow upstoppered and emptiedits glasses and its jugs lynley reached for a switch on the wall to the right of the door he flipped it on recessed lights sprang to life in the ceiling revealing the extent of the chaos beneath them from what he could see from the doorway the maisonette was in ruins sofa and love seat overturned with cushions torn from their covers pictures off the walls and looking as if theyd been broken deliberately across someones knee stereo system and television flung to the floor and destroyedthe backings on everything from the speakers to the television hacked awaya portfolio ripped into two pieces with its photographs left scattered round the room not even the fitted carpet had escaped jerked back from the wall with the sort of strength that spoke of a rage long anticipated and fully indulged the devastation in the kitchen was similar crockery lying shattered on the whitetiled floor shelves swept clean of every object which now lay where it had apparently fallen either on work tops or broken beneath them the refrigerator had been dealt with as well if only in part everything from the freezer was dewing with moisture among the rest of the detritus while the contents of the crisping drawers were smashed like victims of runaway lorries leaving smears of their juices on the tiles in the grout and against the cupboard doors from the ruins of a bottle of ketchup and ajar of mustard footprints led from the kitchen towards the outer corridor one of them was perfectly formed as if brushed onto the tiles with dark orange paint along the ascent of the stairs pictures torn from the walls had met a fate similar to those in the sitting room and as he climbed lynley felt the burning of a slow hard anger begin in the middle of his chest it mixed there however with the chill of fear and he found himself praying that the condition of the maisonette meant vi nevin had been absent from the building when the intruderso obviously bent upon harming herhad taken out his frustration on her possessions he called her name again again there was no reply he flicked on the light in the first of the bedrooms illumination fell upon utter ruin not one stick of furniture had been left untouched he murmured christ which was when the pulsation from the music below ceased abruptly as perhaps a new selection of entertainment was made and then in that sudden quiet he heard it a scrabbling like rodents running on wood it came from the bedroom in which he was standing from behind the beds mattress which canted drunkenly against one of the walls in three strides he was at it he shoved it aside he said jesus god and bent to the battered form whose hairso long so aliceinwonderland blonde where it wasnt bloodsoakedtold him that vi nevin had indeed been at home when vengeance had come calling in rostrevor road the scrabbling had come from her fingernails plucking spasmodically at the white baseboard which was splodged with her blood and the blood itself came from her head particularly from her face which had been bashed repeatedly destroying the littlegirl prettiness that had been her hallmark and her stockintrade lynley held her small hand he didnt want to take the risk of moving her had he been willing to do so he would have grabbed her up once hed phoned for help and cradled her battered body until the ambulance arrived but he couldnt tell howor ifshe was injured internally so he simply held on to her hand the ensanguined weapon lay nearby a heavy hand mirror it appeared to have been fashioned from some sort of metal but now it was crimson with gore and made repulsive with strands of blonde hair and small bits of flesh lynley closed his eyes briefly when he saw it having observed far worse crime scenes and far more grievously wounded victims he could not have said why an object as simple as a hand mirror affected him so except that the mirror was such an innocent object really a piece of feminine vanity that suddenly made vi nevin more of a living presence to him than she had been before why he wondered and even as he asked himself the question he saw helen with just such a mirror in her own hand examining the way shed arranged her hair saying what a mess i look like a curledup hedgehog lord tommy how can you love a woman whos so utterly useless and lynley wanted her to be there in that moment he wanted to hold her as if the simple primitive act of holding his wife could safeguard all women from every possible harm vi nevin moaned lynley tightened his grip on her hand youre safe miss nevin he told her although he doubted that she could either hear or understand him an ambulance is coming just hold on until it gets here i wont leave you youre safe youre really quite safe he noticed for the first time that she was dressed for her work she wore a schoolgirls uniform with the skirt hiked high up on her thighs beneath it tiny bits of black lace served as knickers and lacy stockings were fastened to a matching suspender belt she had knee socks on over the stockings she wore regulation schoolgirl shoes on her feet it was doubtless an ensemble designed to titillate with vi nevin presenting herself to her client as the bashful schoolgirl he desired god lynley wondered why did women make themselves so vulnerable to men who could harm them why did they ever involve themselves in a pursuit that was guaranteed to destroy if not in one way then certainly in another the first of the sirens shattered the night as the ambulance made the turn into rostrevor road moments later below stairs the door to the maisonette crashed open up here lynley shouted and vi nevin stirred forgot she murmured likes honey forgot and then the bedroom filled with paramedics while below on the street more sirens sounded as the local police arrived while in the building itself a selection of music having apparently been made the musical score to rent began playing the ensemble sang their paean to love chapter it was part blessing and part curse that a good number of the forensic scientists at the police lab were lads and lasses of insatiable curiosity the blessing rose from their willingness to work days nights weekends and holidays if they were intrigued enough by evidence that was presented for their evaluation the curse rose from ones personal knowledge of the existence of the blessing for realising that the forensic lab employed scientists whose inquisitive natures prompted them to remain at their microscopes when saner individuals were at home or out on the town one felt obliged to gather the information that those scientists were so willing to provide thus on a saturday night di peter hanken found himself not in the bosom of his family in buxton but rather standing before a microscope while miss amber kubowskychief evidence technician of the momentwaxed enthusiastic about what shed discovered regarding the swiss army knife and the wounds that had been made on the body of terry cole the blood on the knifeshe was happy to confirm as she went at her scalp with the rubber end of a pencil as if wishing to erase something that was scribbled on her skullwas indeed coles and upon carefully prising apart the knifes various blades and devices shed been able to ascertain that the left blade of the scissors was as reported by andy maiden broken off thus the ineluctable conclusion one would normally reach was that the knife in question not only inflicted the wounds found upon terry coles body but also bore a marked resemblance to the knife that andy maiden had allegedly passed on to his daughter right hanken said she looked pleased at his affirmation of her remarks she said have a look at this then and nodded towards the microscope hanken squinted through the lens everything miss amber kubowsky had said was so achingly obvious that he wondered at her level of excitement things must be as bland as yesterdays porridge in the laboratorynot to mention in her lifeif the poor lass got herself worked up over this what exactly am i supposed to be looking for he asked miss kubowsky raising his head and gesturing at the microscope this doesnt much look like a scissor blade to me or blood for that matter it isnt she said happily and thats the point di hanken thats whats so damned intriguing about everything hanken glanced at the clock on the wall hed been working nonstop for more than twelve hours and before the day was through he still wanted to coordinate his information with whatever was being accumulated at the london end of the case so the last entertainment he was willing to engage in was a guessing game with a frizzyhaired forensic technician he said if its not the blade and its not coles blood why am i looking at it miss kubowsky its nice youre so polite she told him not every detective has your manners i find she was going to find out a hell of a lot more if she didnt start elucidating hanken thought but he thanked her for the compliment and indicated that hed be happy to hear whatever else she had to tell him as long as she told him post haste oh of course she said thats the scapula wound youre looking at there well not all of it if you magnified the whole thing it would be twenty inches long probably this is just a portion of it the scapula wound right it was the biggest gash on the boys body did the doctor say on his back the boy not the doctor that is hanken recalled dr myless report one of the wounds had chipped the left scapula and come near to one of the hearts arteries miss kubowksy said i wouldnt have bothered with it normally except i saw on the report that the scapulathats one of the bones in the back did you knowhad a weapon mark on it so i went ahead and compared the mark with the knife blades with all the knife blades and what do you know what the knife didnt make that mark inspector hanken no way not for a minute uhuh and forget it hanken stared at her he tried to assimilate the information more he wondered if shed made a mistake she looked so scattyher lab coat had half its hem ripped out and a coffee stain on the front of itthat it was hardly beyond the realm of possibility that she was less than proficient in her own line of work amber kubowsky apparently not only saw the doubt on his face but also understood the necessity for dispelling it when she went on shed become perfect science speaking in terms of xrays blade widths angles and micromillimeters she didnt complete her remarks until she was certain he understood the import of what she was saying the tip of the weapon that had pierced terry coles back chipped his scapula and scored the bone was shaped unlike the tip of any of the swiss army knifes blades while the knife blades tips were pointedobviously because how could they be knife blades if they werent pointed she asked reasonablythey broadened out at an entirely different angle from the weapon that had marked the bone in terry coles back hanken whistled tonelessly shed given an impressive recitation but he had to ask are you sure id swear to it inspector we wouldve all missed it if i didnt have this theory about xrays and microscopes that i wont go into at the moment but the knife made the other wounds on the body except for the scapula wound yes thats right she had other information to impart as well and she took him to another area of the lab where she held forth on the topic of a pewterlike smear shed also been asked to evaluate when hed heard what amber kubowsky had to say on this final subject hanken headed immediately for a phone it was time to track down lynley hanken rang the other dis mobile and found lynley in the casualty ward of chelsea and westminster hospital lynley put him into the picture tersely vi nevin had been brutally attacked in the maisonette that she and nicola maiden had shared whats her condition there was noise in the background someone shouting over here and the increasingly loud howl of an ambulances doublenote siren thomas hanken raised his voice whats her condition have you got anything from her nothing lynley finally replied from london we havent been able to manage a statement yet we cant even get close theyve been working on her for an hour what do you think related to the case whats happened id say thats likely lynley went on to catalogue what hed learned since their last conversation beginning with his interview of shelly platt continuing with a precis of his experience at mkr financial management and ending with his meeting with sir adrian beattie and his wife so weve managed to unearth the london lover but hes got an alibistill to be confirmed by the way even if he hadnt an alibi i have to say i cant see him slogging across the moors to knife one victim and chase down the other he must be over seventy so upman was telling the truth hanken said at least in regard to the pager and those phone calls that the maiden girl took while she was at work it looks that way peter but beattie claims there had to be someone in derbyshire supplying her with money or she wouldnt have gone there in the first place upman cant be making that much from his divorcees he said he wasnt in london in may by the way he said his diary could prove it what about britton hes still on my list i got waylaid by the swiss army knife hanken brought lynley uptodate in that respect adding the news about the scapula wound another weapon he told lynley had evidently been used upon the boy another knife possibly and maidens got one he even produced it for my inspection you arent thinking andys fool enough to show you one of the murder weapons peter hes a cop not a cretin wait when i saw it at first i didnt think maidens knife could have been used on the boy because the blades are too short but i was thinking of the other wounds then not the blow to the scapula how far is the scapula beneath the skin anyway and if kubowsky dismissed one swiss army knife for the scapula wound does it follow that none other could have done the job were back to motive peter andy hasnt got one but every other man in her lifenot to mention one or two womenhas dont be so quick to dismiss him hanken objected because theres more listen to this ive identification on the substance we found on that odd chrome cylinder from the boot of her car what dyou expect it is tell me semen and there were two other semen deposits on it as well weve two from secretorsthats counting the one you and i sawand the other not the only thing kubowsky couldnt tell me is what the damn cylinder is in the first place ive never seen anything like it and neither has she its a ball stretcher lynley told him a what hang on pete at the other end of the line hanken heard the rumble of male voices with continued hospital noises as counterpoint lynley got back to him saying shell pull through thank god can you get to her unconscious at the moment and then to someone else roundtheclock protection no visitors without first clearing them with me and ask for their ids if anyone shows up no i have no idea right then he was back sorry where was i a ball stretcher ah yes hanken listened as his colleague explained the device of torture he felt his own testicles shrink in response my guess is that it rolled out of one of her cases when she was en route to or from a client while she worked for reeve lynley concluded it could have been in the boot of her car for months hanken reflected on this and saw another possibility he knew lynley would fight it so he broached the subject with care thomas she might have used it in derbyshire perhaps on someone whos not admitting it i dont see either upman or britton going in for the whipsandchains routine and ferrer seems more likely to use something on his women rather than vice versa who else is there her dad christ peter thats a bloody sick thought isnt it just but the whole s m scenes sick and from what youve just told me its major players look normal as hell there is no way just listen and hanken reported his interview with the dead girls parents including nan maidens interruption of that interview and andy maidens feeble alibi so whos to say beyond doubt that nicola wasnt servicing her dad along with everyone else peter you cant keep reinventing the case to fit your suspicions if she was servicing her fatherwhich by the way i would go to the rack protestingthen he cant have killed her because of her lifestyle whichas you recallwas your earlier position then you agree he has a motive i agree that youre twisting my words a new spate of noise then ensued sirens and a babble of voices it sounded to hanken as if the other di were conducting their conversation in the middle of a motorway when the noise abated slightly lynley said theres still what happened to vi nevin to consider what happened tonight if thats related to the doings in derbyshire youve got to see that andy maiden isnt involved then who my moneys on martin reeve he had a bone to pick with both of the women lynley went on to say that their best hope was having vi nevin regain consciousness and name her attacker then they would have immediate grounds to drag martin reeve into the met where he belonged ill stay for a while to see if she comes to he said if she doesnt in an hour or two ill have them ring me the moment her condition changes what about you hanken sighed he rubbed his tired eyes and stretched to ease the tension he was feeling in the muscles of his back he thought of will upman and his stress management massages at the manchester airport hilton he could have done with one of those himself ill get on to julian britton he said truth to tell though i cant see him as anyones killer a bloke dandling puppies in his spare time doesnt strike me as someone whod bash in his lovers skull and as for knifing a bloke into minced beef more likely hed sick the harriers on someone but if he believed he had powerful cause to kill her lynley asked oh to be sure hanken agreed someone believed he had powerful cause to kill nicola maiden the doctor had given her sleeping pills but nan maiden hadnt taken them after the first night she couldnt afford to be less than vigilant so she did nothing to encourage slumber when she went to bed at all she dozed but most of the time she either walked the corridors in a corporeal haunting or sat in the overstuffed armchair in their bedroom and watched her husbands fitful rest this night her pyjamaclad legs curled beneath her and a handknitted blanket drawn round her shoulders nan huddled into the armchair and observed her husband thrashing round in the bed she couldnt tell if he was really asleep or just feigning sleep but in either case it didnt matter the sight of him there roused within her a complicated tangle of emotions more important to consider at the moment than the authenticity of her husbands repose she still wanted him odd after all these years that she still felt desire for him in the same old way but she did and that desire had never abated for either of them rather it seemed to have increased over time as if the length of their marriage had somehow seasoned the passion they felt for each other so shed noticed when andy first stopped turning to her at night and shed noticed when he stopped reaching for and claiming her with the assurance and familiarity that were born of their long and happy marriage she dreaded what that change in him meant it had happened once beforethis loss of interest on andys part in what had always been the most vital area of their relationshipand so long ago that nan liked to believe shed nearly forgotten it had happened at all but that wasnt the real fact of the matter and nan could admit that much in the safety of darkness as her husband did or did not sleep some six feet away from her hed been undercover in a drugs operation seduction had been called for as the drama played out remaining true to his assigned role required him to accept all advances made in his direction no matter the nature those advances took and when several of them were overtly sexual what else could he do that would keep him in character he asked her later how else could he act so as not to betray the entire operation and endanger the lives of the officers involved but he took no pleasure from any of it hed said as he confessed to her there had been nothing for him in the firm young beautiful flesh of girls young enough to be his daughters what hed done hed done because it had been required of him and he wanted his wife to grasp that fact there was no joy in such an act of coupling there was only getting through the act itself which was robbed of feeling when it was done without love they were lofty words they demanded of an intelligent woman her compassion forgiveness acceptance and understanding but they were also words which made nan wonder at the time why andy had felt it necessary to confess his transgression to her at all but shed learned the answer to that question through the years as she slowly developed a knowledge of her husbands ways and shed seen the alterations that had come upon him whenever he was untrue to who he actually was which was why so had ultimately become such a nightmare because he was forced day in and day out and month after month to be someone who he simply was not required by his job to live through great periods of untruth he found that his mind his soul and his psyche would not permit dissimulation without making a demand for some sort of payment from his body that payment had shown itself in ways that had been extremely easy to ignore at first to label as an allergic reaction to something or the initial harbinger of approaching old age the tongue grows old so the food stops tasting right and the only way to give it flavour is to soak it in sauce or blizzard it with pepper and what did it really mean when one failed to catch the subtle scent of nightblooming jasmine or the musty odour of a country church those little occasions of sensory deprivation were easy to overlook but then the more serious deprivations began the sort that couldnt be ignored without risk to ones well being and when the doctors and the specialists had run their tests tried out their diagnoses and finally shrugged their shoulders in a maddening combination of fascination perplexity and defeat the psychiatric warriors had boarded the ship of andys condition setting sail like vikings towards the uncharted waters of her husbands psyche there was never a name applied to what ailed him just an explanation of the human condition as some people experienced it so he fell apart by inches and degrees with confession the only means by which he could put his life in order once again reclaiming who he was through an act of purgation but ultimately all the diary writing analysing discussing and confessing were not enough to make him completely well unfortunately considering the type of work he does your husband simply cant live a dichotomous life she was told after months and years of visiting doctors not that is if he wishes to be completely integrated as an individual shed said what a dichotomous what andrew cant live a life of contradictions mrs maiden he cant compartmentalise he cant assume an identity at odds with his central persona its the adoption of a succession of identities that appears to be causing this failure of part of his nervous system another man might find that sort of life excitingan actor for example or at the other extreme a sociopath or a manicdepressivebut your husband does not but isnt it just like playing dressingup shed asked when hes undercover i mean with enormous attendant responsibility shed been told and even more enormous stakes and costs shed thought at first how lucky she was to be married to a man who could only be exactly what he was and in all the years since hed taken his retirement from new scotland yard the future that theyd worked upon in derbyshire had obliterated every one of the lies and the complicated subterfuges that andy had been forced to make part of his life in the past until now she should have realised when he hadnt noticed those burnt pine nuts in the kitchen despite the way the smell had permeated the air of the hall like overloud music played enthusiastically and in every wrong key she should have realised then that something was wrong but she hadnt noticed because everything had been right for so many years cant say andy murmured from the bed nan leaned forward anxiously she whispered what he turned burrowing his shoulder into the pillow no it was sleep talk no no nans vision blurred she cast back through the last few months in a desperate attempt to find something that she might have done to alter this ending that they had reached but she could come up only with having had the courage and the willingness to ask for honesty in the first place which had not been a realistic option andy turned again he punched his pillow into shape and flopped from his side onto his back his eyes were closed nan left her chair and went to the bed where she sat she reached forward and brushed her fingertips across her husbands forehead feeling his skin both clammy and hot for thirtyseven years hed been at the centre of her world and she wasnt about to lose her worlds centre at this autumnal date in her life but even as she made that determination nan knew that life as she currently experienced it was filled with uncertainties and it was in her uncertainties that her nightmares lay another reason for her refusal to sleep lynley unlocked his front door just after one in the morning he was exhausted and heavy of heart it was difficult to believe that his day had begun in derbyshire and more difficult to believe that it had ended in the encounter hed just experienced in notting hill men and women possessed limitless potential to astonish him hed long ago accepted that fact but he realised now that he was getting weary of the constant surprises they had to offer after fifteen years in cid he wanted to be able to say hed seen it all that he hadntthat someone could still do something to amaze himwas a fact that weighed in his gut like a boulder not so much because he couldnt understand a persons actions but because he continually failed to anticipate them hed remained with vi nevin until she regained consciousness hed hoped shed be able to name her attacker and thus provide him with an immediate reason for arresting the bastard but shed shaken her swollen bandaged head as lynley questioned her all he was able to glean from the injured woman was that shed been set upon too suddenly to manage a clear look at her assailant whether that was a lie that she told to protect herself was something that lynley couldnt discern but he thought he knew and he cast about for a way to make it easier for her to say the necessary words tell me what happened then moment by moment because there may be something a detail you recall that we can use to thats quite enough for now the sister in charge of casualty intervened her blunt scots face a picture of steely determination male or female lynley pressed the injured woman inspector i made myself clear the sister snapped and she hovered protectively over her childlike patient making what seemed like unnecessary adjustments to bedclothes pillows and drips miss nevin lynley prodded nonetheless out the sister said as vi murmured a man upon hearing that lynley decided enough identification had been established she wasnt after all telling him anything that he didnt already know hed merely wanted to eliminate the possibility that shelly plattand not martin reevehad come calling on her old flatmate having done that much he felt justified in taking matters to the next level hed begun that process at the star of india in old brompton road where a conversation with the maitre d established that martin reeve and his wife triciaboth of whom were regulars in the restauranthad indeed taken a meal there earlier in the week but no one could say on what evening theyd occupied their table by the window the waiters were evenly divided between monday and tuesday while the maitre d himself seemed able to recall only that which he had written evidence of in his reservations folder i see they did not book he said in his lilting voice ah one must book at the star of india to guarantee a seating yes she claims they didnt book lynley told him she said that was the cause of a row between you and her husband on tuesday night i do not row with the customers sir the man had said stiffly and the offence he took at lynleys remark had coloured the rest of his memory the indefinite nature of the corroboration from the star of india gave lynley the impetus to call upon the reeves despite the hour and as he drove to do so he fixed in his mind the image of vi nevins ruined face when finally hed negotiated his way to the top of kensington church street and made the turn into notting hill gate he was feeling the sort of slowburning anger that made it easy for him to persist at the doorbell of mkr financial management when no one answered his initial ring do you have any idea what time it is was martin reeves greeting to him upon jerking open the door he didnt even need to identify himself for lynley to know who he was the overhead light which illuminated his face and glowed brightly against four fresh deep scratches on his cheek told the tale well enough he strongarmed reeve backwards into the entry corridor of the house he muscled him into the walleasy enough to do since the pimp was so much smaller than lynley had anticipatedand held him there with one cheek pressed into the tastefully striped wallpaper hey reeve protested what the hell do you think youre tell me about vi nevin lynley demanded wrenching his arm hey if you think you can barge in here and another wrench reeve howled fuck you not even in your dreams lynley pressed up against him and jerked his arm upwards he spoke into his ear tell me about your afternoon and your evening mr reeve give me every detail im done in and i need a fairy tale before i go to bed oblige me please are you out of your fucking mind reeve twisted his head towards the stairs he shouted trish tricia trish phone the cops nice try lynley said but the cops have arrived come along mr reeve lets talk in here he shoved the smaller man in front of him inside the reception office he threw reeve into a chair and switched on a light youd better have an eighteen karat reason for this reeve snarled because if you dont you can anticipate a lawsuit the likes of which youve never seen in this country spare me the threats lynley replied they might work in america but theyre not going to get you a cup of coffee here reeve massaged his arm well see about that ill count the moments till we do where were you this afternoon this evening as well what happened to your face what the word was spoken incredulously dyou think ill answer those questions if you dont want this building boarded up by the vice squad i expect youll give me chapter and verse and dont push me mr reeve ive had a long day and im not a reasonable man when im tired fuck you reeve turned his head to the door and shouted tricia get your ass down here phone polmanteer im not paying through the nose for his sorry butt lynley grabbed a heavy ashtray from the reception desk and hurled it at reeve it skimmed past his head and slammed into a mirror shattering it jesus reeve shouted what the hell afternoon and evening i want the answers now when reeve didnt reply lynley advanced on him grabbed the collar of his pyjama top yanked him backwards into the chair and twisted the collar till it was tight round his neck tell me who scratched you mr reeve tell me why reeve made a choking sound lynley found that he liked it or shall i fill in the blanks myself i dare say i know the dramatis personae another twist with each name as he said vi nevin nicola maiden terry cole shelly platt as well if we come down to it reeve gasped f king out of mind his hands clawed his throat at which lynley released him flinging him forward like a discarded rag youre trying my patience im beginning to think a phone call to the local station isnt a bad idea a few nights with the boys in the ladbroke grove lockup might be just what we need to oil your tongue your ass is history i know enough people wholl ive no doubt of that you probably know people from here to istanbul and while every one of them would happily rise to your defence were you brought up on charges of pandering youre going to find that assaulting women doesnt go down such a treat among the big public profiles not when you think of the fodder theyd be giving the tabloids if word got out that they came to your aid as it is theyre going to find it a delicate enough business lending you a hand once i run you in as a pimp to expect more from them i wouldnt be so unwise mr reeve now answer the question what happened to your face reeve was silent but lynley could see his mind working the other man would be assessing what facts the police had he hadnt lived on the periphery of the law for as long as he had without acquiring some knowledge about the laws application to his own life he would know that had lynley possessed anything solidlike an eyewitness or the signed statement of his victimhe would have made an immediate arrest but he would also know that living outside the law as he did he had fewer options when caught up in a dicey situation reeve said all right its tricia shes on the shit i came home from looking in on two of my girls whose works fallen off she was smacked out i lost it jesus i thought she was dead i got physical with her slapped her around part fear and part anger and i found out she wasnt as out of it as id thought she got physical back lynley didnt believe a word he said youre trying to tell me that your wifestrung out on drugsdid that to your face she was upstairs in a nod the worst shes been in months i couldnt deal with it on top of the girls and their troubles i cant be everyones daddy so i lost it what troubles what the girls their troubles reeve looked towards the reception desk and upon it the display of brochures that ostensibly advertised mkrs financial services i know you know about the business but you probably dont know what lengths i go to to keep them healthy blood tests every four months drug screening physical exams balanced diet exercise a real drain on your financial resources lynley noted dryly hell i dont care what you think this is a service industry and if someone doesnt offer it someone else will im not apologising i supply clean healthy educated girls in a decent environment any guy who spends time with one of them gets value for his money and no threat of disease to take home to the ballandchain and thats what i was uptight about when i got home two girls with trouble disease genital warts chlamydia so i was pissed off and then when i saw tricia i snapped thats it if you want their names addresses and numbers im happy to oblige lynley watched him carefully wondering if it was all a calculated risk on the part of the pimp or an actual coincidence that hed bear his wifes defensive marks on his face on the very same evening that vi nevin had been attacked he said lets have mrs reeve down here to tell her side of the story then oh come on shes asleep that didnt appear to bother you a moment ago when you were howling for her to phone the police and polmanteer your solicitor is that we can still phone him if youd like reeve stared at lynley disgust and dislike on his features he finally said ill get her not alone im afraid the last thing lynley wanted to do was to give reeve an opportunity to coerce his wife into supporting his story fine then come along reeve led the way up two flights of stairs to the second floor in a bedroom overlooking the street he walked to a bed the size of a playing field and switched on the bedside lamp light from it fell upon the form of his wife she lay on her side curled foetally deeply asleep reeve flipped her onto her back grabbed her under the armpits and pulled her upright her head lolled forward like a rag dolls he tipped her backwards and propped her up against the headboard good luck he said to lynley with a smile he pointed out a string of nasty bruises round her throat saying i had to get rougher than i wanted with the bitch she was out of control i thought shed kill me lynley jerked his head away from the woman indicating he wanted reeve to back off reeve did so lynley took his place at the bed he reached for tricias arm saw the angry tracks of injections felt for a pulse as he did this she heaved in a deep breath making his gesture unnecessary lightly he slapped her face mrs reeve he said mrs reeve can you wake up reeve moved behind him and before lynley realised what he intended hed grabbed a vase of flowers tossed the blooms to the floor and dashed the water across his wifes face god damn it trida wake up stand back lynley ordered tridas eyes fluttered open as the water dripped down her cheeks her dazed glance went from lynley to her husband she flinched that reaction said it all lynley said through his teeth get out of here reeve fuck that reeve said and he went on tersely he wants you to tell him we fought tricia that i went after you and you went after me you remember how it happened so tell him that you went for my face and hell clear the hell out of our house lynley surged to his feet i said get out reeve stabbed a finger at his wife just tell him he can see we fought when he looks at us but hes not about to take my word unless you tell him its the truth so tell him lynley threw him from the room he slammed the door he returned to the bed there tricia sat as hed left her she made no move to dry herself there was an en suite bathroom and lynley went to this and fetched a towel he used it gently against her face against her damaged neck against her sopping chest tricia looked at him numbly for a moment before she turned her head and gazed at the door through which hed ejected her husband he said tell me what happened between you mrs reeve she turned back to him she licked her lips your husband attacked you didnt he did you fight back it was a ludicrous question and he damn well knew it how he wondered could she possibly have done so the last thing heroin users were good for was a vigorous round of selfdefence let me phone someone for you you need to get out of here you must have a friend brothers or sisters parents no she grabbed his hand her grip wasnt strong but her nailslong and as artificial as the rest of herdug into his flesh i dont believe for a moment that you put up a fight against your husband mrs reeve and my failure to believe that is going to make things difficult for you once your husband bails himself out of custody id like to get you out of here before all that happens so if youll give me a name of someone to phone arrest she whispered and she seemed to be making a monumental effort to clear her head youll arrest but you said i know but that was earlier somethings happened this evening that makes it impossible for me to keep my word im sorry but i have no choice in the matter now id like to phone someone for you will you give me a number no no it was i hit him i did i tried bite mrs reeve i know youre frightened but try to see that i scratched him my nails his face scratched scratched because he was choking me and i wanted him stop please please i scratched face i made him bleed i did lynley saw her rising agitation he cursed silently he cursed reeves slippery and successful insinuation of himself into the interview with his wife he cursed his own damnable inadequacies the largest of which was the loss of temper that always obscured his vision and clouded his thinking as it had done on this night now in his house in eaton terrace lynley reflected on everything his sense of grievance and his need to avenge vi nevin had got in his way allowing martin reeve to outmanoeuvre him tricias fear of her husbandprobably in combination with a heroin addiction which he no doubt fedhad prompted her at long last to confirm reeves every word lynley still could have run the soulless little rat into the nick for six or seven hours of interrogation but the american hadnt got where he was by being ignorant of his rights he was guaranteed legal representation and he would have claimed it before hed left the house so what would have been gained was a sleepless night for everyone concerned and in the end lynley would have found himself no closer to an arrest than hed been upon his arrival in london that morning but things had ended in notting hill the way they had ended because of a miscalculation on lynleys part and he had to admit that in his anxiety to have tricia reeve conscious and coherent enough to take part in a conversation hed allowed her husband enough time in her presence to give her the script she needed in her interview with lynley thus hed lost whatever advantage he might have established over martin reeve in arriving at his home in the dead of night it was a costly mistake the sort of error that was made by a rank beginner he wanted to tell himself that the miscalculation was the product of a long day a misguided sense of chivalry and outandout exhaustion but the disquiet in his soul which hed begun feeling the moment he saw the card with nikki temptations advertisement on it spoke of another source altogether and because he didnt wish to consider either the source or the implications of the source lynley descended to the kitchen where he rooted round in the refrigerator until he found a container of leftover paella he fetched a heineken to go with his makeshift meal and he cracked it open and carried it to the table he dropped wearily into one of the chairs and took a deep swig of the lager a slim magazine lay next to a bowl of apples and while he waited for the microwave to work its magic on his food lynley reached in his pocket for his spectacles and had a look at what turned out to be a souvenir theatre programme denton he saw had managed to prevail over the masses who were attempting to obtain tickets to the seasons hottest show in the west end the single word hamlet made a bold graphic design in silver on an ebony cover along with a rapier and the words kingryder productions tastefully arranged above the plays title lynley shook his head with a chuckle as he flipped through the pages of glossy photographs if he knew denton the next few months in eaton terrace were going to be an endless exposure to whatever melodies from the pop opera resonated within his stagestruck soul as he recalled it had taken nearly nine months for denton to stop warbling the music of the night at the drop of a hat at least this new production wasnt lloydwebber he thought with some gratitude hed once considered homicide the only viable alternative to having to listen to denton crooning the mainand what seemed like the onlymelody from sunset boulevard for weeks on end the microwave signaled and he scooped out the container and dumped its contents unceremoniously onto a plate he tucked into his latenight meal but the action of forking up the food chewing and swallowing was not enough to divert his thoughts so he cast about for something else to distract him he found it in the consideration of barbara havers she must have managed to gather something useful by now he thought shed been on the computer since the morning and he could only assume that hed finally managed to pound into her skull the message that he expected her to continue at cris until she had something valuable to report he reached for the phone that sat on the work top and mindless of the hour he punched in her number the line was engaged he looked at his watch christ who the hell would havers be talking to at onetwenty in the morning no one that he could name so the only conclusion was that shed taken her phone off the hook the bloody woman he dropped his own receiver into the cradle and gave idle thought to what he was going to do with havers but going down that path only promised him a tempestuous night which would do nothing to improve his performance in the morning so he finished his meal with his attention on the hamlet programme once again and he thanked denton silently for having provided him with a diversion the photographs were good and the text made interesting reading david kingryders suicide was still fresh enough an event in the public consciousness to give an air of romance and melancholy to anything associated with his name besides it was no arduous task having to gaze upon the voluptuous maiden whod been cast as the productions ophelia and how clever of the costume designer to have her go to her death in a gown so diaphanous as to make the wearing of it practically unnecessary backlit she stood poised to drown herself a creature already caught between two worlds the gauzy gown claimed her soul for heaven while her earthbound body chained herin all her sensual beautyfirmly to the earth it was the perfect combination ofare you actually leering tommy married three months and ive already caught you leering at another woman helen stood in the doorway blinking sleep tousled tying her dressing gown belt at the waist only because you were asleep lynley said that reply came too readily i expect youve used it a bit more often than id like to know she padded across the room to him looked over his shoulder placing one slender cool hand on the back of his neck ah i see a little light reading with dinner helen nothing more than that hmm yes shes beautiful isnt she she oh ophelia you mean i hadnt really noticed he flipped the programme closed and took his wifes hand pressing her palm against his mouth you make a poor liar helen kissed his forehead disengaged her hand from his and went to the refrigerator where she took out a bottle of evian she leaned against the work top as she drank watching him fondly over the top of her glass you look ghastly she noted have you eaten today no dont answer thats your first decent meal since breakfast isnt it am i meant to answer or not he asked reasonably never mind i can read it all over your face why is it darling that you can forget to eat for sixteen hours while i cant manage to put food from my mind for ten simple minutes its the contrast between pure and impure hearts now thats a new slant on gluttony lynley chuckled he rose he went to her and took her into his arms she smelled of citrus and sleep and her hair was as soft as a breeze when he bent his head to press his cheek against it im glad i woke you he murmured and he settled into their embrace finding within it enormous comfort i wasnt asleep no no just making an attempt but not getting very far with it im afraid thats not like you it isnt i know somethings on your mind then he released her and looked down at her smoothing her hair away from her face her dark eyes met his and he made a study of them what they revealed and what they tried to hide tell me she touched his lips with the tips of her fingers i do love you she said much more than when i married you more even than i loved you the first time you took me to bed im glad of it but something tells me thats not whats on your mind no thats not whats been on my mind but its late tommy and youre far too exhausted for conversation lets go to bed he wanted to do so nothing sounded better than sinking his head into a plump down pillow and seeking the soothing oblivion of sleep with his wife warm and comforting by his side but something in helens expression told him that would not be the wisest course to take at the moment there were times when women said one thing when they meant another and this appeared to be one of those times he said half truth and half lie i am done in but weve not talked properly today and i wont be able to sleep till we do really you know how i am she searched his face and seemed satisfied with what she saw she said its really nothing much mental gymnastics i suppose ive been thinking all day about the lengths people go to when they want to avoid confronting something a shudder passed through him what she asked someone walking on my grave what brought all this up the wallpaper wallpaper for the spare rooms you remember i narrowed the choices down to sixwhich seemed quite admirable considering what a muddle i was in about having to choose in the first placeand i spent all afternoon pondering them i pinned them to the walls i set furniture in front of them i hung pictures round them and still i couldnt make up my mind because you were thinking of this other he asked about people not confronting what they need to confront no thats just it i was consumed with wallpaper and making a decision about itor rather finding myself incapable of making a decisionbecame a metaphor for living my life do you see lynley didnt he was too wrung out to see anything at all but he nodded looked pensive and hoped that would do you would have chosen and had done with it but i couldnt do that no matter how hard i tried why i finally asked myself and the answer was so simple because of who i am because of who i was moulded to be from the day of my birth to the morning of my wedding lynley blinked who you were moulded to be your wife she said or the wife of someone exactly like you there were five of us and each of usevery one of us tommywas assigned a role one moment we were safe in our mothers womb and the next we were in our fathers arms and he was looking down at us saying hmmm wife of a count i think or i dare say shell do as the next princess of wales and once we knew what role hed assigned us we played along oh we didnt have to of course and god knows neither penelope nor iris danced to the music hed written for them but the other threecybele daphne and iwhy the three of us were nothing more than warm clay in his hands and once i realised that tommy i had to take the next step i had to ask why why you were warm clay yes why and when i asked that question and took a hard look at the answer what do you expect it was his head was spinning and his eyes burned with fatigue lynley said reasonably enough he thought helen what does this have to do with wallpaper and knew a moment later hed failed her in some way she released herself from his embrace never mind this isnt the moment i knew that i can see youre exhausted lets just go to bed he tried to regroup no i want to hear this i admit that im tired and i got lost following all the dancing warm clay but i want to talk and to listen and to know to know what he wondered he couldnt have said she frowned at him a clear warning sign that he should have heeded and did not what dancing warm clay what are you talking about im talking about nothing it was stupid im an idiot forget it please come back i want to hold you no explain what you meant helen it was nothing it was just an inanity just an inanity rising from my conversation he sighed im sorry youre right im done in when i get like this i say things without thinking you said that two of your sisters didnt dance to his tune while the rest of you did which made you warm clay i took that and wondered how warm clay could dance to his music and sorry it was a stupid remark im not thinking right and im not thinking at all she said which i suppose shouldnt come as a surprise to either of us but thats what you wanted isnt it what a wife who couldnt think he felt slapped helen thats not only bloody nonsense its an insult to us both he went to the table for his plate and cutlery which he carried to the sink he rinsed them spent far too much time watching the water swirl round the drain and finally said on a sigh damn he turned to her im sorry darling i dont want us to be at odds with each other her face softened we arent she said he went back to her pulled her to him once again then what he asked im at odds with myself chapter trying to pin down the individual whom terry cole had gone to see at kingryder productions hadnt been as easy as barbara havers anticipated after her conversation with neil sitwell even with the list of employees in her possession not only were there three dozen of them listed but on a saturday night most of those three dozen had not been at home they were after all theatre people and theatre peopleso she discoveredwere not in the habit of vegetating blissfully under their own roofs when they could be out on the town so it had been after two in the morning before shed tracked down terry coles contact at soho square matthew kingryder son of the deceased founder of the theatrical production company hed agreed to see herafter nine if you dont mind im completely fagged outat his home in baker street it was half past nine when barbara found the address that had been listed along with matthew kingryders name and phone number it was a mansion block she saw one of those enormous brick victorian structures thatat the end of the nineteenth centuryhad signaled an alteration in lifestyle from the spacious and gracious to the more understated and the somewhat confined relatively speaking of course compared to barbaras hovel kingryders flat was a virtual palace although it did appear to be one of those illthoughtout conversions of a larger flat in which crossventilation and natural lighting had been sacrificed to the cause of lining someones pockets with monthly rental payments or such was barbaras assessment of the flat when matthew kingryder admitted her to it he asked her to excuse the mess please im getting ready to move house in reference to a pile of rubbish and bin bags waiting for the mansion blocks cleaners outside his front door and he led her down a short and badly lit corridor to a sitting room there gaping cardboard boxes displayed books trophies and various ornaments indifferently wrapped in newspaper and framed photographs and theatrical posters leaned in stacks against the walls waiting for a similar disposition im finally entering the world of property ownership kingryder confided ive got enough for the house but not enough for the house and the removal men so its a bit of a doitmyself job hence the mess sorry here have a seat he swept a stack of theatre programmes to the floor would you like a coffee i was just about to make some for myself sure barbara said he went to the kitchen which lay just beyond a dining nook a hatch had been crafted into one of the walls and he spoke through this casually as he dumped a measure of coffee beans into a grinder ill be south of the river which wont be as convenient for getting to the west end but its a house not a flat and it has a decent garden and more important its freehold and its mine he canted his head and grinned in her direction sorry im rather excited thirtythree and ive finally got a mortgage who knows itll probably be marriage next i like it strong the coffee that is s that okay with you strong was fine by her barbara told him the more caffeine the better as far as she was concerned idly she flipped through one of the stacks of framed photos near to her chair as she waited most of them depicted the same familiar individual posing through the years alongside a score of even more familiar theatrical faces this your dad barbara called out conversationallyalbeit unnecessarilyover the gravely roar of the coffee grinder kingryder glanced through the hatch and saw what she was doing oh he said yeah thats my dad the two men looked very little alike matthew had been blessed with all the physical advantages that nature had denied his father while father had been short and froglike of face with the exophthalmic eyes of a thyroid patient the jowls of a ban viveur and the facial warts of a fairytale villain son had been blessed with greater stature with an aristocratic nose and with the sort of skin eyes and mouth that women would pay plastic surgeons handsomely to possess you didnt look much alike barbara said you and your dad from the kitchen matthew shot her a regretful smile no he wasnt much to look at was he and he knew it unfortunately took a lot of bullying when he was a boy i think thats why he kept going after new women through the years to prove something to himself too bad about his death i was sorry to hear well you know barbara felt uncomfortable what did one say about a suicide after all matthew nodded but made no reply he went back to his coffee making and barbara went back to the pictures she saw that only one of them featured father and son together an ancient school photo in which a small matthew stood with a trophy in his hand and an enraptured smile like a blaze on his face while his father held a rolledup programme of some kind and frowned with an inner preoccupation matthew was proudly clad in athletics kit a leather strap diagonally bisecting his torso in the fashion of a soldier from world war i david was clad in his own version of uniform a business suit that spoke of a score of important meetings he was missing he doesnt look too happy in this shot barbara noted removing the picture from the stack and studying it oh that sports day at school dad really hated it he was about as athletic as an ox but mum was good at pushing the guilt buttons when she could get him on the phone so he generally showed up but he didnt much like it and he was good at letting one know when he didnt much like doing what he was doing typical artist he was that must have hurt not really they were divorced by thenmy parentsso my sister and i took what we could get of his time where is she now isadora she does costume design for the rsc mostly youve both followed in his footsteps then isadora more than me like dad shes on the creative end im just a numbers cruncher he returned to the sitting room bearing an old tin tray on which hed placed mugs of coffee a jug of milk and some sugar cubes on a saucer he balanced this on top of a stack of magazines that sat on an ottoman and went on to explain that he had been his late fathers business manager and agent he negotiated contracts tracked royalty money from the numerous productions of his fathers work all round the globe sold rights to future productions of the plays and kept his fingers on the pulse of expenditures when the company mounted a new pop opera in london so your work doesnt end with your fathers death no because his workthe music itself that isdoesnt actually end does it as long as his operas are being mounted somewhere my work will continue eventually well reduce the staff at the production company but someone will have to keep tabs on all the rights and therell always be the fund to look after as well the fund matthew plunked three sugar cubes into his mug and stirred it with a ceramichandled spoon his father he explained had established a foundation some years ago to fund creative artists the money was used to send actors and musicians to school to back new productions to launch new plays by unknown playwrights to support lyricists and composers who were just starting their careers with david kingryders death all monies accrued from his work would go into that fund aside from a bequest to his fifth and final wife the david kingryder fund was the sole beneficiary of kingryders will i didnt know that barbara said impressed generous bloke nice of him to give others a legup he was a decent man my dad he wasnt that much of a father when my sister and i were young and he didnt believe in handouts or in coddling anyone but he supported talent wherever he found it if the artist was willing to work and thats a brilliant legacy if you ask me too bad what happened i mean you know thanks it was i still dont understand it matthew examined the rim of his coffee mug what was so bloody strange was that he had a hit after all those rotten years the audience went wild before the curtain call began and he was there he saw it even the critics were on their feet so the reviews were going to be like a miracle he had to have known barbara knew the story opening night of hamlet a brilliant success after years of failure no note left behind to explain his actions the composerlyricist offed himself with a single shot to the head while his wife was having a bath in the very next room you were close to your dad barbara noted seeing the grief still evident in matthew kingryders expression not as a child or an adolescent but in the final years i was yes i was but obviously not close enough matthew blinked and took a gulp of his coffee right then enough youve come on business you said you wanted to see me about terence that boy in black who came to see me in soho yes terence cole barbara gave matthew the facts in anticipation of his verifying them neil sitwellhes the head muckety over at bowers in cork streetsaid he sent him to you with a piece of handwritten music by michael chandler that hed come across he figured youd know how terry could contact the solicitors for the chandler estate matthew frowned he did thats extraordinary you wouldnt know how to contact those solicitors barbara asked that hardly seemed credible matthew hastened to correct her obviously i know the chandler solicitors i know the chandlers themselves if it comes down to it michael had four children and theyre all still in london as is his widow but the boy didnt mention bowers when he came to see me he didnt mention a neil sitwell either and most important he didnt mention any music he didnt then why did he ask to see you he said hed heard about the fund well he would have done wouldnt he since it got a lot of press when dad died cole hoped for patronage he brought me some photos of his work barbara felt as if cobwebs were filling her skull so unprepared had she been for this information are you sure of course im sure he had a portfolio with him and i thought at first he was hoping for financial support while he studied to be a set or costume designer because like i said those are the people the fund supports artists whore connected with the theatre in one way or another not artists in general but he didnt know this or he misunderstood or hed misread the details somewhere i dont know did he show you what he had in the portfolio pictures of his work most of it pretty awful gardening tools bent this way and that i dont know much about modern art but from what i could see id say he needed to think about another profession barbara mused when she asked had the visit from terry cole occurred matthew thought for a moment and left the room to fetch his diary which he carried back to the sitting room open upon his palm he hadnt recorded the visit since the cole boy hadnt phoned for an appointment in advance but it had been a day when ginnyhis fathers widowhad been in the office and he had made note of that matthew gave barbara the date it was the very day of terry coles death of course i didnt tell him what i actually thought of his work there would have been no point in that and besides he seemed so earnest about it cole never mentioned music a piece of sheet music or michael chandler or even your dad not at all of course he knew who my father was he did say that but that could have been merely because he was hoping to get some money off the fund oiling his way with the odd compliment or two if you know what i mean but that was it matthew sat down again closed his diary and took up his mug sorry i havent helped much have i i dont know barbara replied thoughtfully may i ask why youre collecting information on the boy has he done something i mean you are the police somethings been done to him he was murdered the same day he saw you the same god thats nasty youre on the trail of his killer barbara wondered about that it had certainly felt like a trail it had looked like smelled like and acted like a trail but for the first time since inspector lynley had directed her back to the criminal record information system with the order to explore andrew maidens past cases for a potential connection to his daughters death and for the first time since shed rejected that line of enquiry as useless to the case she was forced to wonder if she was following a fox or a herring cured and dyed she couldnt have said so she dug her car keys out of her bag and told matthew kingryder she would be in touch if she had further questions and if he should happen to recall anything more from his time with terry cole she handed over her number would he phone she asked him certainly matthew kingryder told her and in case terry cole had unearthed the name of the chandler solicitors without the aid of kingryder he wanted the police to have the name of the firm and their telephone number he flipped to the back of his diary accessed a directory and ran his finger down a page of names and numbers finding the one he wanted he recited the information barbara took it down she thanked the young man for his cooperation and wished him luck in his move south of the river he saw her to the door in the manner of all wise londoners he bolted it behind her alone in the corridor outside his flat barbara considered what shed heard and she pondered howand ifthe information she was gathering fitted into the puzzle of terry coles death terry had talked about his big commission she recalled could he have been speaking about his hopes for a grant from the kingryder fund shed leapt to the conclusion that his visit to kingryder must have had to do with the michael chandler music in his possession but if hed been informed that the music was worthless to him why would he have gone to the trouble of tracking down solicitors and turning the music over to chandlers family certainly he might have hoped for a reward from the chandlers but even if hed been given one could it possibly have matched an artistic grant from kingryder which would have allowed him to pursue his questionable career in sculpting hardly barbara decided far better to make an attempt to impress an established benefactor with his talent than to hope for the generosity of unknown people grateful to have their own property returned yes there was sense in this and chances were that terry cole had shrugged off every consideration of making money from chandlers handwritten score once he knew how necessary were the kindness and generosity of strangers to the successful fulfillment of his ambition after speaking to sitwell hed probably chucked the music out or taken it home and left it somewhere among his things which of course begged the question of why she and nkata hadnt come across it when theyd searched the flat but would they even have noticed a sheet of music among his gear especially when one considered the bombardment their senses had taken with the art of both the occupants of the flat art there was a point of connection for all the details in the case she thought art artists the kingryder fund matthew had said that grants were given only to artists connected with the theatre but what was to prevent an artist switching to the theatre just to cut in on some money if terry cole had twigged to this idea if hed actually presented himself as a designer and not a sculptor if indeed his big commission was in reality a fraud perpetrated against a fund that was intended as a lasting memorial to a giant of the theatre no she was getting ahead of herself she was mixing too many possibilities into the brew she was going to give herself a headache and she was going to turn cloudy water to mud she needed to think to get out in the air to have a brisk walk in regents park so she could sort out everything that was piling up inbarbaras thoughts stopped their tumble as her gaze settled on the collection of rubbish outside kingryders door she hadnt given it any notice on the way in but now she did theyd talked about artists about not knowing much about modern art and what she saw outside kingryders door intruded upon her notice because theyd had that conversation a canvas was among the rubbish that kingryder was discarding it leaned with its face against the wall rubbish bags piled up against it barbara looked left and right she made the decision to see what went for artdiscarded or otherwiseto matthew kingryder she eased the rubbish bags away from the canvas and eased the canvas away from the wall bloody hell she whispered when she saw what shed uncovered a grotesque blonde woman her huge mouth gaping open to display a cat defecating on her tongue barbara had seen a dozen or more variations on this questionable theme already shed seen and talked to the artist as well cilia thompson whod announced proudly that shed sold a painting to a gent with good taste only last week barbara examined the closed door to matthew kingryders digs a chill ran through her a killer lived within she decided and she determined then and there that she was just the rozzer who would bring him to justice lynley found barbara havers report on his desk when he arrived at the yard at ten oclock that morning he read the summaries and conclusions shed developed regarding the files shed explored on cris and he took note of the implication of grievance which coloured her choice of words at the moment though he couldnt afford to give weight to her thinly veiled criticism of the orders hed given her the morning had already been a wrenching one and he had other more pressing matters on his mind than a dcs unhappiness with her assignment hed taken a detour from his normal route from eaton terrace to victoria street dropping down to fulham where he checked on vi nevins condition at the chelsea and westminster hospital the young womans doctors had granted him quarter of an hour with her but shed been deeply sedated and during that time she hadnt stirred a plastic surgeon had arrived to examine her which necessitated the removal of her bandages and she slept through this activity as well in the midst of the surgeons attention to her friend shelly platt arrived at the hospital in a linen trouser suit and sandals her orange hair hidden beneath a widebrimmed raffia hat and her eyes concealed by a pair of sunglasses with the excuse of offering sympathy upon the death of nicola maiden shed been phoning vi repeatedly since lynleys visit to her earls court bedsit unable to raise her shed finally gone to rostrevor road where the attack on her old flatmate was the talk of the neighbourhood i got tsee her was what lynley heard from within as the plastic surgeon studied the ruin of vis face and talked quietly about bones shattered like glass skin grafts and scar tissue with the disinterested air of a man more suited to medical research than to the treatment of patients recognising the glottal stops if not the voice itself coming from the corridor lynley excused himself and went out to find shelly platt trying to elbow past the police guard and a nurse from the floor he did it dint he shelly platt cried when she saw him i tol him and he found her dint he he did and he got her just like i thought he would and now hell come for me if he knows i tol you the truth about his business how is she hows vi lemme see her i got to her voice rose towards hysteria and the nurse asked if this creature was a relative of the patient shelly took off her sunglasses exposing bloodshot eyes that she rolled towards lynley in mute appeal shes her sister lynley informed the nurse guiding shelly by the arm shes allowed inside within shelly threw herself at the bed where another nurse was replacing vi nevins bandages as the plastic surgeon washed his hands at the basin and then departed shelly began to cry she said vi vi vi baby doll i dint mean none of it not one single word and she took up the limp hand that lay on the bedclothes and pressed it to her heart as if the beating within her bony chest would somehow confirm what she was saying whas the matter with her she demanded of the nurse whave you done to her shes sedated miss the nurse pursed her lips in disapproval as she put the final bit of tape on the gauze but shell be all right won she lynley glanced at the nurse before saying shell recover bu her face all them bandages whas he done ther face thats where he beat her shelly platt wept harder no no oh vi im that sorry i dint mean no real harm on you i was cheesed off thas all you know how i am the nurse crinkled her nose at this display of emotion she left the room shes going to need plastic surgery lynley told shelly when they were alone and then he sought a clear but compassionate way of explaining to the girl what the future was likely to hold for vi nevin theres a very good chance shes going to find her professional options narrower than they were before he waited to see if shelly would understand without a more graphic explanation unpretty as she was but still on the game she would have to know what facial scars presaged for a woman whod earned her substantial keep by playing lolita for her clients shelly moved an anguished gaze from lynley to her friend ill take care of her then fm now on and every single minute ill take care of my vi she kissed vis hand and clutched it harder and wept harder still she needs to rest now lynley told her im not leaving vi till she knows im here you can wait with the constable ill see to it that he allows you in the room once an hour shelly parted with vis hand only reluctantly in the corridor she said youll go affer him won you youll cart him off to the nick straightaway and it was those two questions that haunted lynley all the way to the yard martin reeve had it all in the attack on vi nevin motive means and opportunity he had a lifestyle to maintain and a wife whose drug habit needed feeding he couldnt afford to lose any income if one girl managed to leave him successfully there was nothing to prevent another girlor ten girlsfrom following suit and if he allowed that to happen hed soon be out of business altogether because the two necessary participants in prostitution are the prostitutes themselves and their willing punters pimps are expendable and martin reeve was aware of that fact he would rule over his women by example and fear by illustrating the extremes he was willing to go to to protect his domain and by implyingthrough those extremesthat what happened to one girl could easily happen to another vi nevin had served as an object lesson for the rest of reeves women the only question was whether nicola maiden and terry cole were object lessons as well there was one way to find out get reeve to the yard without a solicitor in tow and outsmart him once he was present but to do that lynley knew that he was going to need to outmanoeuvre the man and his options in that particular realm were limited lynley looked for a means of manipulation in the photographs of the maisonette which the police photographer had rushed to him that morning he studied in particular a shoe print on the kitchen floor and he wondered if the pattern of hexagons on the shoes sole was rare enough to count for something certainly it ought to be sufficient to get a warrant and warrant in hand three or four officers could tear apart mkr financial management and find evidence of reeves true business dealings even if hed been clever enough to rid himself of the shoes with those hexagonally marked soles once they had that evidence theyd be in a position to intimidate the pimp which was exactly where lynley wanted to be he looked through more of the pictures flipping them one by one onto his desk he was still in the process of examining them for something useful when barbara havers charged into his office holy hell she said without preamble wait till you hear what ive got inspector and she began to chatter about an auction house on cork street someone called sitwell soho square and kingryder productions so i saw this painting when i left his digs she concluded triumphantly and believe me sir if youd got a glimpse of cilias work in battersea youd agree its a hell of a lot more than a simple coincidence that id stumble across anyone in gods creation whod actually bought one of her disgusting pieces she flopped into one of the chairs in front of his desk and scooped up the photographs she said giving them a cursory examination kingryders our boy and you can write that in my blood if youd like to lynley observed her over the top of his spectacles what led you in that direction is there a connection between mr kingryder and maidens so time that youve uncovered because in your report you didnt mention he paused wondering and not liking his wondering havers how did you get on to kingryder she kept up a resolute study of the pictures as she replied but she spoke in a rush it was like this sir i found a business card at terry coles flat an address as well and i thought well i know i should have turned it over to you straightaway but it slipped my mind when you sent me back to cris and as things turned out i had a bit of free time yesterday when i finished the report and she hesitated her attention still on the pictures but when she finally looked up her expression had altered less sure now than when shed strode into the room since i had that card and the address i went over to soho square and then down to cork street and inspector gosh what difference does it make what led me to him kingryders lying and if hes lying we both know theres just one reason why lynley placed the rest of the pictures on his desk he said im not following this weve established the connection between our two victims prostitution and the advertisement of prostitution weve developed an understanding of another possible motive a common pimps vengeance for an act of betrayal by two girls in his stable one of whomby the wayhe beat up last night no one can confirm that pimps alibi for tuesday night other than his wife whose word doesnt appear to be worth the breath she uses to speak it what we have left to root out is the missing weapon which may very well be sitting somewhere in martin reeves house now all of that being established havers and establishedid like to addthrough doing the sort of police work you appear to be avoiding these days id be grateful if you would list the facts that establish matthew kingryder as our killer she didnt reply but lynley saw the ugly flush begin to splodge her neck he said barbara im hoping your conclusions are the result of footwork and not intuition havers colour deepened you always say that coincidence doesnt exist when it comes to murder inspector so i do but whats the coincidence that painting the cilia thompson monstrosity whats he doing with a painting by terry coles flatmate you cant argue hes bought it to hang on his wall when it was out with his rubbish so its got to mean something and i think it must mean you think it means hes a killer but you have no motive for his committing this killing have you ive just begun i only went to see kingryder initially because terry cole had been sent there by this bloke neil sitwell i didnt expect to uncover one of cilias paintings by his door and when i did i was gobsmacked well who wouldnt be five minutes earlier and kingryder was telling me that terry cole came to talk to him about a grant i leave the flat trying to adjust my thinking to the new information and theres this painting in the rubbish that tells me kingryder has a connection to this killing hes not talking about a connection to the killing lynley allowed his scepticism to underscore the words havers all youve uncovered at the moment is the fact that kingryder may have a connection to someone whos connected to someone whos been murdered in the company of a woman with whom he has no connection at all but no no but havers no and and no if if it comes down to it youve been fighting me every inch of the way on this case and thats got to stop ive assigned you a task which youve largely ignored because you dont like it youve gone your own way to the detriment of the team thats not fair she protested i did the report i put it on your desk yes and ive read it lynley rooted out the paperwork he picked it up and used it to emphasise his words as he went on barbara do you think im stupid do you suppose im incapable of reading between the lines of whats posing as the work of a professional she lowered her eyes she was still holding some of the photographs of vi nevins destroyed home and she fastened her gaze upon these her fingers whitened as her grasp on them tightened and her colour deepened its revealing hue thank god lynley thought he finally had her attention he warmed to his theme when youre given an assignment youre expected to complete it without question or argument and when you complete it youre expected to turn in a report that reflects the dispassionate language of the disinterested professional and after that youre expected to await your next assignment with a mind that remains open and capable of assimilating information what youre not expected to do is create a disguised commentary on the wisdom of the investigations course should you happen to disagree with it thishe slapped her report against his palmis an excellent illustration of why youre in the position youre in right now given an order that you neither like nor agree with you take matters into your own hands you go your own way with complete disregard for everything from the chain of command to public safety you did that three months ago in essex and youre doing it now when any other dc would be toeing the line in the hope of redeeming his name and reputation if not his career youre still pigheadedly trotting along on whatever path pleases you most at the moment arent you head still lowered she made no reply but her breathing had altered becoming shallow with the effort to hold back emotion she seemed at least for the moment suitably chastened he was gratified to see it all right he said now hear me well i want a warrant to tear reeves house apart i want a team of four officers to do the tearing i want from that house a single pair of shoes with hexagons on the soles and every scrap of evidence you can find on the escort service may i put you on this and be assured that youll carry through as directed she made no reply he felt exasperation plague him havers are you listening to me a search yes thats what i said i want a search warrant and when youve got it i want you on the team that goes to reeves house she raised her head from the pictures a bloody search she said and her face was unaccountably altered now bright with a smile yes yes bloody hell inspector by god thats absolutely it thats what dont you see she shook one of the pictures in her excitement sir dont you see youre thinking of martin reeve because his motives been established and its so bloody obvious that any other motive is small beans in comparison and because his motives so out there for you everything you come across ends up getting attached to it whether it belongs attached or not but if you forget about reeve for a moment you can see in these pictures that havers lynley fought against the tide of his own incredulity the woman was unquashable unsinkable and ungovernable for the first time he wondered how hed ever managed to work with her at all im not going to repeat your assignment after this im going to give it to you and youre going to do it but i only want you to see that no god damn it enough get the warrant i dont care what you have to do to get it but get it put together a team from cid go to that house tear it apart bring me shoes with hexagonal markings on the sole and evidence of the escort service better yet bring me a weapon that could have been used on terry cole is that clear now go she stared at him for a moment he believed she would actually defy him and in that moment he knew how do barlow must have felt out on the north sea in pursuit of a suspect and having her every decision secondguessed by a subordinate who was incapable of keeping her opinions to herself havers was damned lucky barlow hadnt been the officer with the gun in that boat had the do been armed that north sea chase might have come to a very different conclusion havers rose carefully she placed the photographs of vi nevins maisonette on his desk she said a warrant a search a team of four officers ill see to it inspector her tone was measured it was utterly polite deeply respectful and completely proper lynley chose to ignore what all of that meant martin reeves palms itched he pressed his fingernails into them they began to burn tricia had backed him when he needed her to back him with that butthole of a cop but he couldnt depend on her to hold to the story if someone promised her enough of the beast at a moment when her stash was low and she wanted to crank up shed say or do anything all the cops had to do was to get her alone get her away from the house and shed be butter on their toast in less than two hours and he couldnt watch over her every frigging minute of every god damn day for the rest of their lives to make sure that didnt happen whattaya wanna know gimme the stuff just sign on the line mrs reeve and youll have it and it would be done no better he would be done so he had to firm up his story on the one hand he could muscle a lie from someone who already knew firsthand what could come from refusing his request on the other hand he could demand the truth from someone else who might take an appeal for common veracity as a sign of weakness go the first way and he ended up owing a favour which handed the reins of his life to someone else go the second way and he looked like a pantywaist who could be dissed without fear of reprisal so the situation was a basic nowinner caught between a rock and a hard place martin wanted to find enough dynamite to blast a passageway while keeping the damage from falling stones to a minimum he went to fulham all his current troubles had their genesis there and it was there that he was determined to find the solutions as well he got into the building on rostrevor road the easy way he rang each bell in rapid succession and waited for the fool who would buzz him inside without asking him to identify himself over the intercom he dashed up the stairs but at the landing he paused a sign was affixed to the maisonettes door and even from where he stood he could read it crime scene it announced do not enter shit martin said and he heard the cops low terse voice once again as clearly as if he were on the landing as well tell me about vi nevin fuck martin said was she dead he dug up the answer by descending the stairs and knocking up the residents of the flat directly beneath vi nevins front door theyd been giving a party on the night before but they hadnt been too occupied with their guestsor too smashedto take note of the arrival of an ambulance much had been done by the paramedics to shield the shrouded form they carried out of the building but the haste with which they removed her and the subsequent appearance of what had seemed like a score of policemen who began asking questions throughout the building suggested that shed been the victim of a crime dead martin grabbed onto the young mans arm when he would have turned back into his flat to catch up on more of the sleep of which martins appearance at his door had robbed him wait damn it was she dead she wasnt in a body bag was the indifferent reply but she mightve popped her clogs in hospital during the night martin cursed his luck and back in his car got out his london streetfinder the nearest hospital was the chelsea and westminster on the fulham road and he drove there directly if she was dead he was done for the nurse in casualty informed him that miss nevin had been moved was he a relative an old friend martin told her hed been to her home and discovered thered been an accident some sort of trouble if he could see vi and set his mind at rest that she was all right so that he in turn could let their mutual friends and her relatives know he should have shaved he thought he should have worn the armani jacket he should have prepared for an eventuality beyond the simple knocking on a door gaining admittance and coercing cooperation miss schubertfor such was the name on her identification badgeeyed him with the open animosity of the overworked and the underpaid she consulted a clipboard and gave him a room number he didnt miss the fact that when he thanked her and headed towards the elevators she reached for a phone thus he wasnt entirely unprepared for the sight of a uniformed constable seated outside the closed door of vi nevins room he was however completely unprepared for the appearance of the orangehaired harpy in a crumpled pantsuit who was sitting next to the cop she leapt to her feet and came hurtling in martins direction the moment she saw him she shrieked its im its im its im she flew at martin like a starving hawk with a rabbit in sight and she sank her talons into the front of his shirt and screeched ill kill you bastard bastard she shoved him into the wall and butted him with her head his own head flew back and smacked against the edge of a notice board his jaw clamped shut teeth sinking into his tongue he tasted blood shed ripped the buttons from his shirt and gone for his neck when the constable finally managed to pull her off whereupon she began screaming arrest him hes the one arrest him arrest him and the constable asked for martins id he somehow dispersed a small crowd that had gathered at the end of the corridor to watch the unfolding scene a minor kindness for which martin was grateful the woman held at arms length from him martin was able to recognise her at last it was the hair colour that had thrown him off when theyd metwhen shed come for her first and only interview at mkrshed been blackhaired otherwise she was little changed still skeletal still sallowskinned with very bad teeth even worse breath and the body odour of threedayold halibut shelly platt he said you did it you tried to kill her martin wondered how his day could possibly get worse he had his answer a moment later the constable studied his identification still holding shelly in a deathgrip he said miss miss one thing at a time and he took her with him while he went to the phone at the nurses station and punched in a number look martin called to him i only want to know if miss nevins all right i spoke to someone in casualty i was told shed been transferred here he wants to kill her shelly cried dont be an idiot martin responded id hardly show up in the middle of the day and present my id if i planned to kill her what the hell happened as if you dont know i just need to talk to her he told the constable when he was returned his id and refused admittance thats all it probably wont take five minutes sorry was the reply look i dont think you understand this is an urgent matter and aren you going tarrest him shelly demanded whas he have tdo to her before you lot cart him off to the nick will you at least shut her up long enough for me to explain to you that ordersre orders the constable said and he loosened his grip on shelly platt just enough to indicate to martin that a temporary retreat was called for he made that retreat with as much grace as he could muster considering that the orangehaired termagant had raised enough ruckus for him to become the cynosure of the entire hospital floor he returned to the jaguar threw himself inside and flicked its air conditioning on full blast with every vent pointing at his face shit he thought fuck hell shit he had little doubt about who had been on the receiving end of that constables phone call so hed put himself in line for another visit from the cops he considered what sort of light he was going to shine upon his trip to the chelsea and westminster hospital getting corroboration for my story last night hardly seemed credible when one considered from whom he was attempting to wrest corroboration in the first place he jerked the car into gear and roared out of the car park on the fulham road once more he pulled down the sun visor and used the recessed mirror within it to examine the damage shelly platt had done to him jesus she was a vicious little cat shed managed to draw blood on his chest when shed grabbed his shirt hed be wise to get a tetanus shot pronto he cut up finborough road heading for home and considering what options were available to him now it appeared that there was no way he was going to get close to vi nevin any time soon and since the cop on guard in front of her room had no doubt phoned that goon whod dropped by lansdowne road in the middle of the previous night it also appeared that there was no way he was going to get close to her any time at all at least not while the cops were doing their bloodhound bit on the maiden whores killing and that might go on for months he had to develop another plan to get corroboration for his alibi and he found his mind feverishly coming up with one scenario only to dismiss it and come up with another on the exhibition hall side of earls court station he stopped for a traffic light he waved off a street urchin who wanted to wash his windscreen for fifty p and he observed a hooker in negotiations with a potential client by the underground entrance he made an instant evaluation of her in a kneejerk reaction to the sight of her bandaidsize skirt of magenta spandex her black polyester blouse with its plunging neckline and its senseless ruffles her stiletto heels and her fishnet stockings she was a handormouth bitch only he decided twentyfive pounds if the john was desperate no more than ten if she and her coke habit were working the street together the light changed and as he drove off martins sense of grievance against the police began to grow in him he was doing the whole shitting city one hell of a favour he decided and no oneleast of all the copsseemed to realise or appreciate that his girls didnt clutter up the sidewalks making deals with clients and they sure as hell didnt pollute the landscape by dressing like something out of an adolescents wet dream they were refined educated attractive and discreet and if they did take money for engaging in the odd sexual encounter or two and if they did pass on a percentage to him who made it possible for them to be in the company of wealthy and successful men who were willing to recompense them richly for their services who the hell cared who the hell did it hurt no one the bottom line was that sex had a place in mens lives that it did not have in the lives of women for men it was a signature act primal and necessary to their identity their wives grew tired of it or bored by it but the men did not and if someone was prepared to provide those men with access to women who welcomed their attentions women willing to allow their bodies to be the soft and pliable wax into which those men poured their juices not to mention left the indelible impression of their very characters why couldnt money be exchanged for such a service and why couldnt someonelike himselfwith the organisational skills and the vision to recruit exceptional women for the entertainment of exceptional men be allowed to make a living doing it if the laws had been written by visionaries like himself and not by a group of spineless jerks who were more concerned with being able to feed at the public trough than they were with being even marginally realistic about activities participated in by consenting adults martin thought then he wouldnt have been in the position he was in at this very moment he wouldnt be scrambling for someone who could vouch for his whereabouts and get the police off his back because the police would never have been on his back in the first place and even if they had come calling and had asked their questions and made their demands they wouldnt have had a single thing to hold over his head to gain cooperation because he wouldnt have been living on the wrong side of the law in the first place and what sort of country was it anyway where prostitution was legal but living off prostitution wasnt what was prostitution but a means of livelihood and who the hell were they kidding trying to regulate it from westminster when threequarters of those hypocrites who planted their asses on those green leather benches were screwing their eyeballs out with any secretary student or parliamentary assistant who appeared even remotely willing fuck it the entire situation made him want to punch holes through walls and the more he thought of it the angrier he became and the angrier he became the more he focused on the cause of all his current troubles forget maiden and nevin he realised they were taken care of after all they hadnt been the ones to spill their miserable guts to the cops tricia on the other hand remained to be dealt with he spent the rest of the drive considering how best to do this what he came up with wasnt pleasant but when was it pleasant when a notable figure on the social scene loses his wife to heroin despite his best efforts to save her from herself and to shield her from the displeasure of her family and the censure of an unforgiving public he felt his mood lift his lips curved upwards and he began to hum he made the turn from lansdowne walk into lansdowne road and there he saw them four men were mounting the front steps to his house with plainclothes cops written all over them they were beefy tall and designed to tyrannise they looked like gorillas in fancy dress martin hit the accelerator he swerved into the drive he was out of the jaguar and up the steps in their wake before they had a chance to ring the bell what do you want he demanded gorilla one removed a white envelope from the pocket of a leather bomber jacket search warrant he said what search for what are you opening the door or are we breaking it down im phoning my solicitor martin shoved past them and unlocked the door whatever you want gorilla two said they followed him inside gorilla one gave instructions as martin raced for the phone two of the cops were right on his heels and into his office the other two pounded up the stairs shit he thought and he shouted hey my wifes up there theyll say hello gorilla one said as martin frantically punched in the phone number one began removing books from the shelves and two went for a filing cabinet i want you fuckers out of here martin told them right said two i spose you do and we all want something said one with a smirk upstairs a door crashed back against a wall muffled voices accompanied the noise of furniture being roughly shoved round a room in martins office the cops made their search with a minimum of effort and a maximum of mess they strewed books on the floor took pictures from the walls and emptied the filing cabinet in which martin kept scrupulous records for the escort service gorilla two bent and with cigarstub fingers began sifting through them shit martin hissed receiver to his ear where was that fucker polmanteer on the other end of the line the phone at his solicitors home doublerang four times his answer machine clicked on martin cursed disconnected and tried the solicitors mobile where would he be on a sunday for gods sake the slimy bastard couldnt have gone to church the mobile brought him no better results he slammed down the receiver and rooted in his desk for the solicitors card gorilla two elbowed him to one side he said sorry sir cant let you remove im not removing a fucking thing im looking for my solicitors pager wouldnt keep it in your desk would he one asked from the shelves where he continued his work books thunked to the floor you know what i mean martin said to two i want the number of his pager its on a card i know my rights now step aside or i wont be responsible martin what is it whats going on therere men in our room and theyve emptied the wardrobe and whats going on martin spun round tricia was in the doorway unshowered undressed and unpainted she looked like the hags who sat on their sleeping bags and begged money in the subway at hyde park corner she looked like what she was a smackhead his hands started to burn once again he dug his nails into his palms tricia had been the single cause of his every difficulty for the last twenty years and now she was the cause of his downfall he said god damn it god damn it you and he plunged across the room he grabbed her by the hair and managed to ram her head against the door jamb before the cops were on him stupid cunt he shouted as they dragged him off her and then to the police all right all right as he shook off their hold on him call your asshole boss tell him im ready to deal chapter it was nearly midday before simon st james was able to give his time to the derbyshire postmortem reports that lynley had sent him via barbara havers he wasnt sure what he was supposed to be looking for the examination of the maiden girl appeared in order the conclusion of epidural haematoma was consistent with the blow to her skull that it had been administered by a righthanded person attacking her from above was consistent with the hypothesis that shed been running and had trippedor been tackledin her flight across the moor in the darkness apart from the blow to her head and the scrapes and contusions one would expect to find after a rough fall on uneven ground there was nothing on her body that suggested anything curious unless of course one wanted to consider the extraordinary number of holes shed had pierced in everything from her eyebrows to her genitals as a point of interest and that hardly seemed a reasonable route to go when driving needles through various body parts had long ago become one of the relatively few acts of defiance left to a generation of young people whose parents had already engaged in them all from his reading of the maiden report it seemed to st james that all the bases had been covered from the time cause and mechanism of death to the evidenceor lack thereofof a struggle xrays and photographs had been duly taken and the body had been examined from top to bottom the various organs had been studied removed and commented upon samples of body fluids had been sent to toxicology for their findings at the end of the report the opinion was stated briefly and clearly the girl had died as the result of a blow to the head st james went through the findings once more to make sure he hadnt missed any pertinent detail then he turned to the second report and immersed himself in the death of terence cole lynley had phoned him with the information that one of the wounds on the boy hadnt been inflicted by the swiss army knife that had apparently been responsible for the others including the fatal piercing of the femoral artery after reading through the basic facts in the report st james gave a more careful scrutiny to everything related to this particular wound he noted its size its position on the body and the marking left on the bone beneath it he stared at the words and then walked contemplatively to the window of his lab where he watched as peach rolled blissfully below him in a patch of garden sunlight exposing her furry dachshund belly to the twelve oclock heat the swiss army knife he knew had been found in a grit dispenser why hadnt the secondary weapon been left in the same place why cache one weapon but not the other those questions of course belonged in the realm of the case detectives and not the scientists but he believed they needed to be asked nonetheless once they were asked there seemed to be only two possible answers either the second weapon identified the killer too closely to be left at the scene or the second weapon had been left at the scene and the police had mistaken it for something else if the first supposition was the case he could be of no assistance in the matter if the second was the case a more detailed study of the crime scene evidence was in order he had no access to that evidence and he knew he wouldnt be welcome in derbyshire to finger through it so he returned to the postmortem report and he sought anything within it that might give him a clue dr sue myles hadnt missed a thing from the insects that had taken up residence in and on both of the bodies during the hours theyd lain undiscovered on the moor to the leaves flowers and twigs that had become caught up in the hair of the girl and the wounds on the boy it was this final detaila sliver of wood some two centimeters long found on the body of terence colethat st james closed in on curiously the sliver had been sent on to the lab for analysis and someone had appended a note in pencil in the margin of the report identifying it from a phone call doubtless when officers were pressed they didnt always wait for official word from the police lab before they moved on cedar someone had printed neatly in the margin and next to it in parentheses the words port orford st james was no botanist so port orford illuminated nothing for him he knew it was unlikely that hed be able to track down on a sunday the forensic botanist whod identified the wood so he gathered up his paperwork and descended the stairs to his study deborah was within absorbed in the sunday times magazine she said trouble love he replied ignorance which is trouble enough he found the book he was looking for among the dustier of his volumes he began leafing through the pages as deborah joined him by the shelves what is it i dont know he said cedar and port orford mean anything to you sounds like a place port isaac port orford why a sliver of cedar was found on terence coles body the boy on the moors tommys case hmm st james flipped to the back of the book and ran his finger down the index under cedar atlas blue chilean incense did you know there were so many kinds of cedar is it important im beginning to think it could be he ran his gaze further down the page and then he saw the two words port orford they were listed as a variety of the tree he turned to the indicated page where first he took note of the picture which featured a sample of the coniferous trees foliage and then read the entry itself this is curious he said to his wife what she asked sliding her arm through his he told her what the postmortem had claimed that a wooden sliver identified by the forensic botanist as port orford cedar had been found in one of the wounds on the body of terence cole deborah looked thoughtful as she shrugged back a heavy mass of her hair whys that curious they were killed out of doors werent they out on the moors and then her eyes widened oh yes i do see exactly st james said what kind of moor has cedars growing on it but its more curious than that my love this particular cedar grows in america in the states oregon and northern california it says the tree could have been imported couldnt it deborah asked reasonably for someones garden or for a park or even a greenhouse or conservatory you know what i mean like palm trees or cactuses she smiled her nose wrinkling or is that cacti st james walked to his desk and put the book down he lowered himself slowly into his chair thinking all right lets say it was imported for someones garden or a park of course she was with him tagging her own thought onto his that still begs the obvious question doesnt it how did a cedar tree meant for someones garden or a park get to the moor and how did it get to a part of the moor thats nowhere near someones garden or a park in the first place someone planted it there for religious reasons more likely no one planted it at all but you said deborah frowned oh yes i see i suppose the forensic botanist must have made an error then i dont think so but simon if there was only a sliver to work with thats all a good forensic botanist would need st james went on to explain even a fragment of wood he told her bore the pattern of tubes and vessels that transported fluids from the bottom to the top of a tree softwood treesand all conifers he told her are among the soft woodsare less developed evolutionary and consequently easier to identify placed under microscopic analysis a sliver would reveal a number of key features that distinguish its species from all other species a forensic botanist would catalogue these features plug them into a keyor a computer identification system for that matterand derive from the information and the key an exact identification of the tree it was a faultlessly accurate process or at least as accurate as any other identification made from microscopic human and computer analysis all right deborah said slowly and with some apparent doubt so its cedar yes port orford cedar i think we can depend on that and its a piece of cedar thats not from a tree growing in the area yes yes as well so were left with asking where that piece of cedar came from and how it came to be on the boys body they were camping werent they the girl was yes in a tent well what about a tent peg from the tent what if the peg was made from cedar she was hiking i doubt it was that kind of tent deborah crossed her arms and leaned against the desk considering this what about a camp stool then the legs for instance possibly if a stool was among the items at the site or tools she would have had camping tools with her an axe for wood a trowel something like that the sliver could be from one of the handles tools would have to be lightweight though if she was carrying them in a rucksack what about cooking utensils wooden spoons st james smiled gourmets in the wilderness dont laugh at me she said laughing herself im trying to help ive a better idea he told her come along he led her upstairs to the laboratory where his computer hummed quietly in a corner near the window there he sat down and with deborah at his shoulder he accessed the internet saying lets consult the great intelligence online computers always make my palms sweat st james took her palm unsweaty and kissed it your secrets safe with me in a moment the computer screen came to life and st james selected the search engine he generally used he typed the word cedar into the search field and blinked with consternation when the result was some six hundred thousand entries good lord deborah said thats not very helpful is it lets narrow our options st james altered his selection to port oxford cedar the result was an immediate change to one hundred and eightythree but when he began to scroll through the listing he saw hed come up with everything from an article written about port orford oregon to a treatise on wood rot he sat back reflected for a moment and typed in the word usage after cedar adding the appropriate inverted commas and addition signs that gleaned him absolutely nothing at all he switched from usage to market and hit the return the screen altered and gave him his answer he read the very first listing and said good god when he saw what it was deborah whose attention had drifted towards her darkroom came back to him what she said what its the weapon he said and pointed to the screen deborah read for herself and drew in a sharp breath shall i get in touch with tommy st james considered but the request to study the postmortem reports had been relayed to him from lynley via barbara and that served as sufficient indication of a chain of command which gave him the excuse he needed in order to attempt to make peace where there was strife lets track down barbara he told his wife she can be the one to take the news to tommy barbara havers zoomed round the corner of anhalt road and hoped her luck would hold for another few hours shed managed to find cilia thompson in her railway arch studio applying her talents to a canvas on which a cavernous mouth with tonsils like bellows opened upon a threelegged girl skipping rope on a spongylooking tongue a few questions had been enough to ascertain fuller information about the gent with good taste whod purchased one of cilias masterworks the previous week cilia couldnt remember his name off the top of her head come to think of it she reported hed never told her but hed written her a cheque which shed photocopied the betterbarbara thoughtto prove to the world of artistic doubting thomases that shed actually managed to sell a canvas she had that photocopy taped to the inside of her wooden paintbox and she showed it off willingly saying oh yeah the blokes names right here gosh look at this i wonder if hes any relation matthew kingryder barbara saw had paid an idiotically exorbitant amount for one dog of a painting hed used a cheque drawn on a bank in st helier on the island of jersey private banking was embossed above his name hed scrawled the amount as if hed been in a hurry as perhaps he had been barbara thought how had matthew kingryder happened to turn up in portslade street shed asked the artist cilia herself would admit wouldnt she that this particular row of railway arches wasnt exactly heralded throughout london as a hotbed of modern art cilia shrugged she didnt know how hed happened upon the studio but obviously she wasnt the sort of girl who looked at a gift horse crosseyed when hed shown up asked to have a look about and demonstrated an interest in her work she was as happy as a duck in the sun to let him browse right through it all she could report in the end was that the bloke with the chequebook had spent a good hour looking at every piece of art in the studioterrys as well barbara wanted to know had he asked about terrys art using terrys name no he just wanted to see her paintings cilia explained all of them and when he couldnt find anything he liked he asked if she had any others tucked away that he could see so shed sent him round to the flat having phoned mrs baden and told her to show him up when he arrived he went straight there and made his selection from one of those paintings he sent her a cheque promptly by post on the following day gave me the asking price as well cilia said proudly no dickering about it and that point alonethat matthew kingryder had gained access to the digs of terry cole for whatever reasonmade barbara push the accelerator floorward as she whipped through battersea back to cilias flat she didnt give a thought to what she was supposed to be doing instead of reversing into a parking space at the end of anhalt road shed got the search warrant as directed and shed put together a team shed even met them in front of snappy snaps in notting hill gate and put the whole boiling kettle of them in the picture on what the inspector wanted them to look for in martin reeves home shed merely omitted the information that she was supposed to accompany them it was easy enough to justify this omission the team shed assembledtwo members of which were amateur boxers in their free timecould shake up a house and intimidate its inhabitants far better if they had no female presence among them diluting the threat implied by their imposing physiques and their tendency to communicate in monosyllables besides wasnt she killing two birdsthree or four perhapsby sending officers to notting hill to shake up and shake down the reeves without her while they were doing that she would be using the time to see what information could be harvested from the battersea end of things delegation of responsibility and the mark of an officer with leadership potential she called the situation and she pushed from her mind the nasty little voice that kept trying to call it something else she pressed the bell for mrs badens ground floor flat the faint sound of hesitantly played piano music halted abruptly the sheer curtains in the bay window flicked an inch to one side barbara called out mrs baden barbara havers again new scotland yard cid the buzzer sounded to release the lock barbara scurried inside mrs baden said graciously goodness me id no idea detectives were expected to work on sundays i hope they give you the time to go to church she herself had attended the early service the woman confided without waiting for a response from barbara and afterwards shed joined a meeting of the wardens in order to put forward her opinions on the subject of establishing bingo nights to raise money to replace the roof of the chancel she was in favour of the idea although in general she didnt approve of gambling but this was gambling for god which was altogether different to the sort of gambling that lined the secular pockets of casino owners who made their fortunes by offering games of chance to the avaricious so ive no cake to offer you im afraid mrs baden concluded regretfully i took the rest with me to serve at the wardens meeting this morning its far more pleasant engaging in debate over cake and coffee than over grumbling stomachs dont you agree especially and here she smiled at her witticismwhen grumbling enough is already going on for a moment barbara looked at her blankly then she recalled her previous visit oh the lemon cake i expect that went down a real treat with the wardens mrs baden the elderly woman lowered her gaze shyly i think its important to make a contribution when ones part of a congregation before these dreadful shakes of mine beganhere she held up her hands whose tremors today were making her look like a victim of aguei used to play the organ at services i liked the funerals best frankly but of course i wouldnt have admitted that to the wardens as they might have found my taste a bit macabre when the shakes started i had to give all that up now i play the piano instead for the infant schools choir where it doesnt much matter if i hit a wrong note from time to time the children are quite forgiving about that but i suppose people at funerals have far less reason to be understanding dont they that makes sense barbara agreed mrs baden ive just seen cilia she went on to explain what shed learned from the artist as she spoke mrs baden went to the old upright piano at one side of the room where a metronome was ticktocking rhythmically and a timer whirred she ceased the metronomes movement and turned off the timer she put the pianos bench back into place tapped several sheets of music neatly together replaced them on their holder and sat with her hands folded looking attentive across from the piano the finches twittered in their enormous cage as they flew from one perch to another mrs baden glanced at them fondly as barbara went on oh yes he was here that gentlemen mr kingryder mrs baden said when barbara had concluded i recognised his name when he introduced himself of course i offered him a piece of chocolate cake but he didnt accept didnt even step over my threshold he was quite intent on seeing those pictures did you let him into the flat terry and cilias i mean cilia phoned me and said that a gentleman was coming round to look at her pictures and would i unlock the door for him and let him see them she didnt give me his namethe silly child hadnt even asked him can you imaginebut as theres not generally a queue of art collectors ringing my bell and asking to see her work when he showed up i assumed he was the one and anyway i didnt let him stay in the flat alone at least not until id checked with cilia so he was alone upstairs once youd checked with her barbara rubbed her hands together mentally now at last they were getting somewhere did he ask to be alone once i took him up to the flat and he saw how very many paintings are in it he said that hed need some time to really study them before he made his selection as a collector he wanted did he say he was a collector mrs baden art is his abiding passion he told me but as he isnt a wealthy man he collects the unknowns i remember that especially because he talked about the people whod bought picassos work before picasso was well before picasso was picasso they just went on faith and left the rest to art history he said he told me that he was doing the same so mrs baden had left him alone in the flat upstairs and for more than an hour hed contemplated cilia thompsons work until hed made his choice he showed it to me after hed locked up and returned the key she told havers i cant say i understood his choice but then well im not a collector am i aside from my little birds i dont collect anything at all are you sure he was up there as long as an hour more than an hour you see i practise my piano in the afternoons ninety minutes every day not very much use at this point of course with my hands getting so bad but i believe in trying no matter what id just wound up the metronome and set the timer when cilia rang to say hed be coming i decided not to start my practise till hed come and gone i deplore interruptions but of course please dont take that personally dear this conversation is an exception to the rule thanks and and when he said he wanted to take his time having a good long look at the paintings i decided to go ahead with my practise id been at itnot very successfully im afraidfor an hour and ten minutes when he knocked at my door a second time he had a painting under his arm and he asked would i tell cilia that hed be sending her a cheque in the post oh my goodness mrs baden suddenly straightened one hand at her throat where a quadruplestrand choker of knobby beads circled her crepey neck did he not send cilia that cheque my dear he sent the cheque the hand dropped thank heavens im so relieved to know it granted i was terribly preoccupied with my music that day because i wanted to play at least one piece for dear terry by the end of the week after all it was a sweet present not my birthday or mothering sunday or anything and there he was not that id expect something on mothering sunday from a boy not my son mind you but he was a dear and always so generous and i felt i ought to show him how much i appreciated his generosity by being able to play it but it hadnt been going well at allmy practise that isbecause my eyes arent what they used to be and reading music thats been handwritten is rather a problem so i was quite preoccupied you see but the young manmr kingryder this isseemed honest and truthful so when it came to taking his word about a cheque why i didnt once think that he might be untruthful and im glad to know that he wasnt barbara only half heard her final comments she was transfixed instead by the womans earlier words she said mrs baden quite slowly drawing in a breath carefully as if to do it with too much energy might frighten away the facts which she believed she was about to coax from the older woman are you telling me that terry cole gave you some piano music certainly my dear but i believe i mentioned that the other day when you were here such a lovely boy terry such a good boy really he was always willing to do the odd job or two round the house if i needed him he fed my little birds if i was out as well and he loved to wash windows and hoover the rugs at least thats what he always said she smiled gently barbara dragged the old woman away from her carpets and back to the topic mrs baden do you still have that music she asked well certainly i do i have it right here lynley had martin reeve delivered to one of the yards interview rooms hed refused to talk to him on the phone when dc steve budde from the search warrant team had placed a call to the yard from the pimps notting hill home relaying reeves offer to strike a deal reeve budde said wished to produce information that might be valuable to the police in exchange for the opportunity to emigrate to melbourne a city that reeve appeared newly eager to embrace what did di lynley want done about the matter scotland yard lynley said didnt make deals with killers he told dc budde to relay that message and to bring the pimp in as lynley had hoped reeve arrived without his solicitor in tow he was haggard unshaven and wearing jeans and a boxy hawaiian shirt this gaped open on a pallid chest the sanguinolent path of someones fingernails still fresh upon it call off your goons reeve said without preamble when lynley joined him this dickheads palswith a jerk of his head at dc buddeare still trashing my house i want them out of there pronto or im not cooperating lynley nodded constable budde into a seat against the wall where he assumed a watchful position the dc was the size of bigfoot and the metal chair creaked beneath him lynley and reeve took places at the table where lynley said youre not in a position to make demands mr reeve the fuck im not i am if you want information get those assholes out of my house lynley in response lynley put a fresh cassette into the tape player pushed the record button and gave the date the time and the names of everyone present he recited the formal caution for reeves benefit saying are you waiving your right to a solicitor jesus what is this dyou guys want the truth or a tap dance just answer me please i dont need a solicitor for what im here for the suspect waives his right to legal representation lynley said for the record mr reeve were you acquainted with nicola maiden lets cut to the chase all right you know i knew her you know she worked for me she and vi nevin quit last spring and i havent seen either one of them since end of story but thats not what im here to talk how long was it after their departure before shelly platt informed you that the maiden girl and vi nevin had set themselves up privately in prostitution reeves eyes became hooded who shelly what shelly platt you cant be denying that you know her according to my man at the hospital she recognised you the moment she saw you this morning lots of people recognise me i get around so does tricia our faces must be in the papers once a week shelly platt states that she told you about the two girls going into business for themselves you cant have liked that it cant have done much to enhance your reputation as a man with his stable under control look if a flatbacker wants to go it alone i could give a shit all right they find out soon enough how much work and moneys involved in attracting the calibre of clients theyre used to then they come back and if theyre lucky and im in the mood i take them back its happened before itll happen again i knew it would happen to maiden and nevin if i waited them out long enough and if they didnt want back in if they were more of a success than you anticipated what then and what can you do to prevent the rest of your girls from trying their luck as independents reeve leaned back in his chair are we here to talk about the pussy game in general or do you want some straight answers to last nights questions your choice inspector but make it quick i dont have the time to sit here and chew the fat with you mr reeve youre not in a bargaining position one of your girls is dead the otherher partnerhas been beaten and left for dead either this is a remarkable coincidence or the events are related the link appears to be you and their decision to leave you which makes them not my girls any longer reeve said im not involved so youd like us to believe that a call girl can leave you set herself up in business in competition with you and not expect any reprisal free market economy with the spoils going to him or her with the superlative product is that it i couldnt have put it better the best man wins or the best woman for that matter the first precept of business inspector i understand so youll have no objection to telling me where you were yesterday while vi nevin was being assaulted as my half of the deal im happy to tell you once i learn what your halfs going to be lynley felt weary with the pimps manoeuvring put him on the charge sheet he said to dc budde assault and murder the constable rose hey wait a minute i came here to talk you offered a deal to tricia yesterday im claiming it today all you need to do is put it on the table so we both know what were agreeing to thats not how things work lynley got to his feet dc budde took the pimps arm lets go reeve shook him off fuck that shit you want to know where i was all right ill tell you lynley sat again he hadnt switched the recorder off and the pimp in his agitation hadnt noticed go on reeve waited until budde had returned to his seat he said keep a collar on rufus i dont like being manhandled well take note of that reeve rubbed his arm as if contemplating a future suit charging policy brutality he said all right i wasnt at home yesterday i went out in the afternoon i didnt get back till night nine or ten oclock where were you then reeve looked as if he was calculating the damage he was about to inflict upon himself he said i went there i admit it but i wasnt there when for the record lynley said you went to fulham to rostrevor road she wasnt there id been trying to track them down all summer vi and nikki when those two copsthe black and the dumpy broad with chipped front teethcame round for a chat with me on friday i had a feeling they could lead me to vi if i played it right so i had them followed i went back the next day he grinned something of a turnaround huh tailing the cops instead of the reverse for the tape mr reeve you went to rostrevor road yesterday and she wasnt there no one was there why did you go to see her reeve examined his nails they looked freshly buffed his knuckles however were swollen and bruised lets say i went to make a point in other words you beat vi nevin no way i said i didnt get the chance and you sure as hell cant arrest me for what i wanted to do if i even wanted to beat her in the first place which im not admitting to by the way he adjusted his position in his chair more comfortable now more sure of himself like i said she wasnt there i went back three times during the afternoon but my luck didnt change and i started getting antsy when i get like that reeve used his fist against his palm i do i act i dont go home like a limp dick pantywaist and wait for somebody else to screw me over did you try to find her you must have had a list of her clients at least those she serviced when she worked for you if she wasnt at home it stands to reason that youd begin a search for her especially if you werehow did you put itgetting antsy i said i do lynley i act when im getting riled okay i wanted to make a point with the whore and i couldnt do it and that pissed me off so i decided to make a point with someone else i dont see how that served your needs it served my needs of the moment just fine because i started thinking it was time to put a tighter rein on the rest of them i dont want them even beginning to think about taking a page from the nikkivi book whores think men are cocksuckers so if you want to run them youd better be willing to do what it takes to keep their respect it takes violence id assume lynley marveled at reeves hubris how could the pimp not know he was digging his own grave with every sentence he spoke did he actually think he was ameliorating his position with his declarations reeve went on hed begun paying visits to his employees during the afternoon he said surprise visits that were designed to reinforce his authority over them he appropriated their bank books diaries and bills with the intention of comparing them to his own records he listened to messages on their answer machines to learn if theyd encouraged their clients to bypass global escorts when booking a session he went through their wardrobes checking for clothing that revealed a higher income than he was shelling out to them he examined their supplies of condoms lubricating jellies and sex toys to see if everything matched what he knew of each girls clientele some of them didnt like what i was doing reeve said they complained so i straightened them out you beat them beat them reeve laughed hell no i fucked them thats what you saw on my face last night i call it fingernail foreplay theres another word for it i didnt rape anyone if thats where youre heading and theres not a single one among them wholl say that i did but if you want to bring them inthe three i fuckedand grill them go right ahead and do it ive come to give you their names anyway theyll back my story im sure they will lynley said obviously the woman who doesnt is inclined to experience your brand of what did you call it straightening out he got to his feet and ended the taped interview he said to dc budde i want him charged get him to a telephone because hell be howling for his solicitor before weve even begun to hey reeve jumped up whatre you doing i didnt touch either one of those cunts youve got nothing on me youre a pimp mr reeve i have your own admission of that on tape its a decent start you offered a deal im here to collect it im talking and then im clearing out to melbourne you put that on the table for tricia and and tricia may collect it if she chooses to do so lynley said to budde well want to send a team from vice back to lansdowne road phone over there and tell havers to wait till they arrive hey listen to me reeve came round the table dc budde grabbed onto his arm get your fucking hands off shes probably had time to pull together enough evidence to hold him on a pandering charge lynley told budde thatll do for now you assholes dont know who youre dealing with dc budde tightened his grip havers guv shes not in notting hill jackson stille and smileyre doing the search you want me to track her down anyway lynley said not there then where reeve struggled against budde ill have your butts for this steady on mate youre not going anywhere budde said to lynley she met us there and handed over the warrant do you want me to try to fuck this shit the door to the interview room swung open spector it was winston nkata need some help in here its under control lynley said and to budde get him to a phone let him call his solicitor then get on the paperwork to charge him budde danced reeve past nkata and down the corridor lynley remained by the table fingers on the tape recorder for want of something to ground himself through touch if he did anything else without taking time to consider the consequences of every possible action he knew hed regret it eventually havers he thought christ what was it going to take shed never been the easiest officer to work with but this was outrageous it was beyond comprehension that shed defied a direct order after what shed already been through either she had a death wish or shed lost her mind no matter which it was though lynley knew hed finally reached the end of his tether with the woman took some time to track down which clamping unit works the area but it paid off big nkata was saying lynley looked up sorry he said i was miles away whatve you got winnie i checked beatties club hes in the clear i went on to islington nkata said i did a talk with the neighbours at the maiden girls old digs no one matched up any visitors with beattie or reeve even when i showed them pictures found one of each bloke at the daily mail by the way always helps to have snouts in the newspaper offices but no joy from that direction not to speak but while i was there i saw a clamped vauxhall sitting on double yellow which got me to thinking bout other possibilities nkata reported that hed phoned all the london wheel clamping agencies to see which of them served the islington streets it was a shot in the dark but since no one hed spoken to had been able to identify either martin reeve or sir adrian beattie as visitors to nicola maidens bedsit prior to her removal to fulham he decided to see if anyone clamped in the area on the ninth of may might match up with anyone connected to nicola maiden and thats where i struck gold he said well done winnie lynley said warmly nkatas initiative had long been one of his finest qualities what did you get something dicey dicey why because of who got clamped the dc looked suddenly uneasy which should have been a warning but lynley didnt see it and at any rate he was distracted by feeling too decidedly positive about how things had gone with martin reeve who he asked andrew maiden nkata said seems he was in town on the ninth of may he got clamped round the corner from nicolas digs lynley felt a tight sickness in the pit of his stomach as he closed his front door and began to climb the stairs he went to his bedroom pulled out the same suitcase hed brought back from derbyshire on the previous day and opened it on the bed he started to pack for the return journey tossing in pyjamas shirts trousers socks and shoes without giving a thought to what hed actually need when he got there he packed his shaving gear and nicked helens bar of soap from the bath his wife came in as he was closing the lid on a packing job that would have sent denton into fits she said i thought i heard you whats happened are you off again so soon tommy darling is something wrong he set the suitcase on the floor and cast about for an explanation he went with the facts without attaching an interpretation to them the trails leading back to the north he told her andy maiden appears to be involved helens eyes widened but why how lord thats terrible and you admired him so didnt you lynley told her what nkata had discovered he related what the dc had learned earlier about the argument and the threat heard in may he added to that what he himself had put together from his interviews with the so officer and his wife he finished with the information that hanken had passed along on the phone what he didnt embark on was a monologue dealing with the probable reason that andy maiden had requested one di thomas lynleya notable washout from so as the scotland yard officer sent north to assist in the investigation he would face that subject later when his pride could stand it it made sense to me at first to look at julian britton he said in conclusion then at martin reeve i stuck with one and then the other and ignored every detail that pointed anywhere else but darling you may still be right helen said especially about martin reeve he has more of a motive than anyone hasnt he and he could have tracked nicola maiden to derbyshire and out onto the moor as well lynley said how could he possibly have managed that perhaps he followed the boy or had the boy followed by someone else theres nothing to say reeve even knew the boy helen but he may have learned about him through the phone box cards hes someone who watches the competition isnt he if he found out who was placing vi nevins cards and began to have him trailed just as he had barbara and winston trailed to fulham why couldnt he have tracked down nicola that way someone could have been following the boy for weeks tommy knowing hed eventually lead the way to nicola helen warmed to her theory why she asked could someone employed by reeve to trail the boy not have followed him out of london up to derbyshire and onto the moors to meet nicola once the girl was located a single phone call to martin reeve from the nearest pub would have been all that it took reeve could have ordered the murders from london at that point or he could have flown up to manchesteror driven to derbyshire in less than three hoursand gone out to the ancient stone circle to settle with them himself it doesnt have to be andy maiden she concluded lynley touched her cheek thank you for being my champion tommy dont discount me and dont discount yourself from what youve told me martin reeve has a motive carved out of marble why on earth would andy maiden kill his daughter because of what she became lynley replied because he couldnt talk her out of becoming it because he couldnt stop her by means of reasoning persuasion or threat so he stopped her the only other way he knew but why not just have her arrested she and the other girl vi nevin yes vi nevin there were two of them in business doesnt it constitute a brothel if therere two couldnt he merely have phoned an old friend in the met and brought her down that way with all his former colleagues knowing what shed become what his own daughter had become hes a proud man helen hed never go for that lynley kissed her forehead then her mouth he picked up his suitcase ill be back as soon as i can she followed him down the stairs tommy youre harder on yourself than anyone i know how can you be certain that youre not just being hard on yourself now and with far more disastrous consequences he turned to answer his wife but the doorbell rang the ringing was insistent and repeated as if someone outside was leaning on the bell their caller turned out to be barbara havers and when lynley set his suitcase by the door and admitted her into the house she charged past him with a thick manila envelope in her hand saying holy hell inspector im glad i caught you were one step closer to paradise she greeted helen and went into the drawing room where she plopped onto a sofa and spilled the contents of her envelope onto a coffee table this is what he was after she said obscurely he spent over an hour at terry coles flat pretending to look at cilias paintings she thought he was in love with her work havers ruffled her hair energetically the signature gesture of her excitement but he was alone in that flat inspector and he had plenty of time to search it stem to stern he couldnt find what he wanted though because terry had given it to mrs baden when hed realised he wasnt going to be able to flog it at a bowers auction and mrs baden just gave it to me here have a look lynley stayed where he was by the door to the drawing room helen joined barbara and glanced through the numerous sheets of paper that shed dumped from the envelope its music barbara told him a whole slew of music a whole bloody slew of michael chandler music neil sitwell at bowers told me he sent terry cole to kingryder productions to get the name of the chandler solicitors but matthew kingryder denied the whole thing he said terry came to get an artistic grant from him so why the hell has no one weve talked to said a single word about terry and a grant you tell me lynley said evenly havers ignoredor didnt noticethe tone because kingryder is lying his head off he followed him he trailed terry cole round london everywhere he went trying to get his mitts on this music why because the milk cows dead havers sounded triumphant and kingryders only hope of keeping the ship floating for a few more years was to be able to produce another hit show youre mixing your metaphors lynley remarked tommy helens expression carried an unspoken entreaty she knew him better than anyone after all and unlike havers shed noted his tone shed also noted his unchanged position at the door to the room and she knew what that meant oblivious havers continued with a grin right sorry anyway kingryder told me that his dads will leaves all the profits from his current productions to a special fund that supports theatre types actors writers designers that sort his last wife gets a bequest but shes the sole beneficiary not a penny goes to matthew or his sister hell have some sort of position as chairman or leader or whatever of the fund but how can that compare to the lolly hed be gathering if he mounted another of his dads productions a new production inspector a posthumous production a production not governed by the terms of the will theres your motive he had to get his maulers on this music and eliminate the only person who knew michael chandlerand not david kingryderhad written it and vi nevin lynley enquired how does she fit into the picture havers her face grew even brighter kingryder thought vi had the music he hadnt found it at the flat he hadnt found it when he followed terry cole and offed him and tore that camp site apart looking for it so he came back to london and paid a call on vi nevins flat when she was out he was tearing it apart looking for that music when she surprised him that flat was destroyed it wasnt searched havers no way inspector the pictures show a search look at them again thingsre flung round and opened up and shoved onto the floor but if someone wanted to put vi out of business hed spraypaint the walls hed slice up the furniture and cut up the carpets and punch holes in the doors and hed batter her face in lynley injected which is what reeve did kingryder did it shed seen him or at least he thought shed seen him and he couldnt take a chance that she hadnt for all he knew she was wise to the musics existence too because she knew terry as well at any rate what does it matter lets haul him in and hold his feet to the flame for the first time she seemed to see the suitcase that stood in the doorway she said wherere you going anyway to make an arrest because while you were larking round london dc nkatain compliance with orderswas doing the footwork hed been assigned to in islington and what hes uncovered has sod all to do with matthew kingryder or anyone else with that surname havers blanched next to her helen set a sheet of music which shed been inspecting onto the pile she raised a cautionary hand resting it at the base of her throat lynley recognised the gesture but ignored it he said to havers you were given an assignment i got the warrant inspector i set up a team for the search and i met them i told them what they you were directed to be a part of that team havers but the thing is that i believed i had this gut feeling no there is no thing there is no gut feeling not in your position helen said tommy he said no forget it its done youve defied me every inch of the way havers youre off the case but do you want chapter and verse tommy helen reached in his direction he could see that she wanted to intercede between them she so hated his anger for her sake he did his best to control it anyone else in your positiondemoted having barely escaped criminal prosecutionand with your history of failure in cid thats low havers words sounded faint would have toed every line that was drawn from the instant ac hillier pronounced sentence hilliers a pig you know it anyone else he went doggedly on would have dotted every i in sight and doublecrossed every t for good measure in your case all that was asked of you was a bit of research through some so cases research which you had to be ordered back to on more than one occasion in the last few days but i did it you got the report i did it and after that you went your own way because i saw those pictures in your office this morning i saw that the flat in fulham had been searched and i tried to tell you but you wouldnt hear me out so what could i do she didnt wait for an answer likely knowing what he would say and when mrs baden handed over that music and i saw whod written it i knew wed found our man inspector all right i should have gone with the team to notting hill you told me to go and i didnt but cant you please look at how much time i ended up saving us youre about to trot back up to derbyshire arent you ive saved you the trip lynley blinked he said havers do you actually think i give credence to this nonsense nonsense she mouthed the word rather than to speak it helen looked from one of them to the other she dropped her hand expression regretful she reached for a sheet of the music havers looked at her which sparked lynleys anger he wouldnt have his wife put into the middle report to webberly in the morning he told havers whatever your next assignment is get it from him you arent even looking at whats in front of you havers said but she no longer sounded argumentative or defiant merely mystified which angered him more do you need a map out of here barbara he asked her tommy helen cried sod you havers said she rose from the sofa with a fair amount of dignity she took up her tattered bag as she moved past the coffee table and sailed out of the room five sheets from the chandler music fluttered to the floor chapter the derbyshire weather matched di peter hankens mood grim while a silver sky dissolved into rain he navigated the road between buxton and bakewell wondering what it meant that a black leather jacket was missing from the evidence taken from nine sisters henge the missing rain gear had been easy to explain the missing jacket was not for a single killer did not need two articles of clothing to cover up the blood from a choppedup victim he hadnt made the search for terry coles missing leather jacket entirely unassisted dc mott had been with him a flapjack in his hand as evidence officer motts presence was essential but he did little enough to help with the search instead he munched loudly and appreciatively with much smacking of lips and pronounced that hed never seen no black leather jacket guv throughout hankens inspection motts record keeping had been vindicated there was no jacket that message transmitted to london hanken set out for bakewell and broughton manor jacket or no there was still julian britton to clear off or keep on their list of suspects as hanken cruised over the bridge that spanned the river wye he unexpectedly entered another century despite the rain that was continuing to fall unabated like a harbinger of grief to come a fierce battle was going on round the manor house on the hillside that descended to the river five or six dozen royalist soldiers wearing the varied colours of the monarch and the nobility were flailing swords with an equal number of armoured and pothelmeted parliamentarians on the meadow beneath them more armoured soldiers were rolling cannon into position while on a far slope a pistolwielding division of helmeted infantry made for the south gate of the manor house with a battering ram trundling along among them the cavaliers and the roundheads were refighting a battle of the civil war hanken concluded julian britton was engaged in yet another means of raising money for the restoration of his home a seventeenthcentury milkmaid standing beneath a burberry umbrella waved hanken to a makeshift car park a short distance from the house there various other players in the reenactment drama were milling about in the guise of royals peasants farmers noblemen surgeons and musketeers eating from a soup tin in the door of a caravan illfated king charlesa bloody bandage round his headchatted up a wench who was carrying a basket of bread getting soaked by the rain not far away a blackgarbed oliver cromwell struggled out of his armour attempting the feat without untying the lacing dogs and children dashed in and out of the crowd while a snack stall did a thriving business in whatever they could serve that was hot and steaming hanken parked and asked where the brittons were hiding he was directed to a viewing area within the third of the manors ruined gardens there on the southwest side of the house a stalwart crowd huddled on makeshift stands and deck chairs to watch the unfolding reenactment from beneath a motley mushrooming of umbrellas to one side of the viewers a lone man sat on a tripod stool of the type used at the turn of the century by artists or hunters on safari he wore an antique tweed suit and an old pith helmet and he sheltered himself from the rain with a striped umbrella he watched the action with a collapsible telescope a walking stick lay by his feet jeremy britton hanken thought dressed as always in his forebears clothing hanken approached him mr britton you wont remember me di peter hanken buxton cid britton half turned on the stool hed aged greatly hanken thought since their sole encounter at the buxton police station five years in the past britton had been drunk at the time his car had been broken into on the high street while he was taking the watersundoubtedly a euphemism for his imbibing something considerably stronger than the towns mineral waterand he was demanding action satisfaction and immediate vengeance upon the illdressed and worsebred hooligans whod violated him so egregiously looking at jeremy britton now hanken could see the results of a lifetime spent in drink liver damage showed in the colour and texture of brittons skin and in the cookedeggyolk look of his eyes hanken noted the thermos on the far side of the camp stool on which britton was sitting he doubted it contained either coffee or tea im looking for julian hanken said is he taking part in the battle mr britton julie britton squinted through the rain dont know where hes gone off to not part of this though he waved at the drama below the battering ram was mired in the mud and the cavaliers were taking advantage of this blip on the screen of the roundheads plans swords drawn a crush of them were swarming down the slope from the house to fend off the parliamentary forces julie never did like a good dustup like this britton said slipping slightly with dust hed added an h cant think why he agrees to let the grounds be used this way but its great fun what everyone seems to be fully involved hanken agreed are you a history buff sir nothing like it britton said and shouted down at the soldiers traitors be damned youll burn in hell for harming one hair on the head of gods anointed royalist hanken thought odd position for a member of the gentry to have taken at the time but not unheard of if the gentleman in question had no ties to parliament where can i find him carried off the field sporting a head wound no one could cuse the poor sod of not having his share of courage could they i meant julian not king charles ah julie with an irresolute grip britton fixed his telescope towards the west a fresh band of cavaliers had just arrived by coach that vehicle was disgorging them on the far side of the bridge where they were racing to arm themselves among them an elaborately clad nobleman appeared to be shouting directions shouldnt allow that you ask me britton commented if they arent here on time they should forfeit what he swung back to hanken the boy was here if thas why youve come does he get to london much with his late girlfriend living there i expect girlfriend britton blew out a contemptuous breath rubbish girlfriend says theres give and take involved there was none of that oh he wanted it julie he wanted her but she wasnt having anything from him other than a shag if the mood was on her if hed only used the eyes god gave him he wouldve seen that from the first you didnt like the maiden girl she had nothing to add to the brew britton looked back at the battle shouting watch your backs you blighters at the parliamentary soldiers as the cavaliers forded the river wye and began charging wetly up the hillside towards the house a man of easy allegiance hanken thought he said will i find julian in the house mr britton britton watched the initial clash as the cavaliers reached those of the roundheads who were straggling behind in the effort to free the battering ram from the mud suddenly the tide of the battle shifted the roundheads looked outnumbered three to one run for your lives you idjits britton shouted and he laughed with glee as the rebels began to lose the uneasy purchase they had on their footholds several men went down losing their weapons britton applauded hanken said ill try him inside britton stopped the detective as he turned to depart i was with him on tuesay night you know hanken turned back with julian where what time was this in the kennels dont know the time probaly round eleven a bitch was delivering julie was with her when i spoke to him he made no mention of your being there mr britton he wouldntve done didnt see me when i saw what he was about i lef him to it i watched for a bit from the doorwaysomething special about the birthing process no matter whos delivering dont you thinkthen i went off is that your normal routine to visit the kennels at eleven at night dont have a normal routine at all do what i want when i want what took you to the kennels then britton reached in his jacket pocket with an unsteady hand he brought out several heavily creased brochures wanted to talk to julie about these they were hanken saw all leaflets from clinics that offered programmes for alcoholics smudged and dogeared they looked like refugees from the oxfam book section either britton had been caressing them for weeks on end or hed found them secondhand somewhere in anticipation of a moment just like this want to take the cure britton said bout time i think dont want julies kids to have a sot for a granddad julians thinking of marrying is he oh thingsre definitely brewing in that direction britton extended his hand for the brochures hanken bent towards the umbrella to give them back hes a good boy our julie britton said taking the leaflets and stuffing them back in his jacket pocket dont you forget it hell make a good father and ill be a granddad he can be proud of there was at least a fragment of doubt to that brittons breath could have been lit with a match so heavily was it laden with gin julian britton was conferring with the reenactments organisers on the rooftop battlements when di hanken appeared hed seen the detective in conversation with his father and hed watched as jeremy produced his treatment brochures for the other mans inspection he knew how unlikely it was that hanken had come to broughton manor to have colloquy on the subject of alcoholism with his father so he wasnt unprepared when the policeman finally tracked him down their conversation was brief hanken wanted to know the exact last date that julian had been in london julian took him down to his office where his diary lay among the discarded account books on his desk and he handed it over his record keeping was faultless the diary showing that his last trip to london had been at easter in early april hed stayed at the lancaster gate hotel hanken could phone to verify because the number was next to the hotels name in his diary i always stay there when im in town julian said why do you want to know hanken answered the question with one of his own you didnt stay with nicola maiden she had only a bedsit julian coloured besides she preferred me to stay in a hotel but youd gone to town to see her hadnt you he had it had been stupid really julian told himself now as he watched hanken work his way back through the cavaliers that crowded the courtyard bunched under awnings and umbrellas as they prepared for the next phase of the battle hed gone to london because hed sensed a change in her not only because she hadnt come to derbyshire for easteras had been her habit during every holiday while she was at universitybut because at each of their meetings from the autumn onwards hed felt a greater distance developing between them than had existed at the meeting before he suspected another man and hed wanted to know the worst firsthand he gave a bitter brief laugh as he thought of it now that trip to london hed never asked her directly if there was someone else because at heart he hadnt wanted to know hed allowed himself to be satisfied with the fact that his surprise visit hadnt caught her out with someone else and that a surreptitious look in the bathroom cupboards the medicine cabinet and her chest of drawers hadnt turned up anything a man might keep there for mornings after nighttime assignations on top of that shed made love with him and hopeless numbskull that hed been at the time hed actually thought that her lovemaking meant something but it was just part of her line of work he realised now just part of what nicola did for money alls clear with the coppers julie my boy julian swung round to see that his father had joined him in the manor office apparently having had enough of the rain the reenactment or the company of other spectators jeremy had a dripping umbrella hanging over his arm a camp stool in one hand and a thermos in the other his greatuncles telescope poked from the breast pocket of his grandfathers jacket jeremy smiled looking pleased with himself gave you an alibi son concrete as the motorway it was julian stared at him what did you say told the copper i was with you an the new pups on tuesday saw them pop out and saw you catch them i said but dad i never said you were there i never told them julian sighed he began sorting through the account books he stacked them in order of year theyre going to wonder why i never mentioned you you see that dont you dont you dad jeremy tapped a trembling finger to his temple thought that out in advance my boy said i never disturbed you there you were acting the part of midwife and i didnt like to break your concentration said i went to talk to you bout getting off the drink said i went to show you these once more jeremy produced the brochures nspired wasnt it you already saw them see so when he asked you bout them you tol him right he didnt ask me about tuesday night he wanted to know when id last been to london so no doubt hes wondering why you took the trouble to give me a damn alibi when he wasnt even asking for one past his exasperation julian suddenly realised the implication behind what his father had done he said why did you give me an alibi dad you know i dont need one dont you i was with the dogs cassie was delivering and anyway how did you know to tell them that your cousin tol me sam why she says the policere looking at you funny and she doesnt like that as if julie would raise his hand against anyone she says all righteous anger she is julie quite a woman loyalty like that its something to behold i dont need sams loyalty or your help for that matter i didnt kill nicola jeremy shifted his glance from his son to the desktop no ones saying you did but if you think you have to lie to the police that must mean dad do you think i killed her do you honestly believe jesus now dont get yourself twisted youre red in the face and i know what that means i didnt say i thought anything i dont think anything i just want to ease the way a bit we dont have to take life as it comes so much julie we can do something to shape our destinies yknow and thats what you were doing shaping my destiny he shook his head selfish bastard im shaping my own he lifted the brochures to his heart i want to get dry its time i want it but god knows and i know i cant do it alone julian had been round his father long enough to recognise a manipulation when he heard one the yellow flags of caution went up dad i know you want to get sober i admire you for it but those programmes the cost you cn do this for me you cn do it knowing id do it for you it isnt as if i dont want to do it for you but we havent the funds i looked through the books again and again and we just havent got them have you thought about phoning aunt sophie if she knew what you intend to do with the money i expect shed lend lend bah jeremy swept the notion aside with the brochures he held your auntll never go for that hell stop when he wants to stop is what she thinks she wont lift a finger to help me do it what if i phoned her whore you to her julie just some relative shes never seen come begging for a handout from what her own husband worked hard to make no you cant be the one to do the asking if you spoke to sam then jeremy waved the idea off like a gnat cant ask her to do that shes been giving us too much as it is her time her effort her concern her love i cant ask her for anything more and i wont he heaved a sigh and shoved the brochures back into his pocket never mind then ill soldier on i could ask sam to speak to aunt sophie i could explain no forget it i cn bite the bullet ive done it before too many times julian thought his fathers life spanned more than five decades of broken promises and good intentions come to nothing hed seen jeremy give up drink more times than he could remember and just as many times hed seen jeremy return to the bottle there was more than a simple grain of truth in what he said if he was going to beat the beast this time he was not going to go into battle alone look dad ill talk to sam i want to do it want to jeremy repeated really want to not think you have to because of whatever you owe your old man no wantto ill ask her jeremy looked humbled his eyes actually filled with tears she loves you julie fine woman like that and she loves you son ill speak to her dad the rain was still falling when lynley turned up the drive to maiden hall barbara havers had actually provided him with a few minutes distraction from the turmoil he felt over what hed learned about andy maidens presence in london indeed hed managed to exchange the turmoil for an anger over barbaras defiance that hadnt been the least palliated by helens gentle attempt to wring reason from the constables behaviour perhaps she misunderstood your orders tommy shed said once havers had taken herself away from eaton terrace in the heat of the moment she might have assumed you didnt intend her to be part of the notting hill search christ hed countered dont defend her helen you heard what she said she knew what she was supposed to do and she chose not to do it she went her own way but you admire initiative you always have done youve always told me that winstons initiative is one of the finest god damn it helen when nkata takes matters into his own hands he does it after hes completed an assignment not before he doesnt argue whinge or ignore whats in front of him because he thinks hes got a better idea and when hes been correctedwhich is damn seldom by the wayhe doesnt make the same mistake twice one would think that barbara would have learned something this summer about the consequence of defying an order but she hasnt her skull is lead helen had carefully gathered together the sheets of music that barbara had left behind she placed them not in the envelope but in a pile on the coffee table she said tommy if winston nkata and not barbara havers had been in that boat with dci barlow if winston nkata and not barbara havers had taken up that gun shed gazed at him earnestly would you have been so angry his response had been both swift and hot this isnt a bloody issue of gender you know me better than that i do know you yes had been her quiet reply still hed considered her question more than once during the first one hundred miles of the drive to derbyshire but every way he examined his possible responses both to the question and to havers incredible act of insubordination on the north sea his answer was the same havers had engaged in assault not initiative and nothing justified that had winston nkata been wielding the weaponwhich was as risible an image as lynley could inventhe would have reacted identically he knew it now as he pulled into the car park of maiden hall his anger had long since abated to be replaced by the same disquiet of spirit that had descended upon him when hed learned about andy maidens visit to his daughter he stopped the car and gazed at the hotel through the rain he didnt want to believe what the facts were asking him to believe but he drew in what resolve he could muster and reached in the back seat for his umbrella he walked through the rain across the car park inside the hotel he asked the first employee he saw to fetch andy maiden when the former so officer appeared five minutes later he came alone tommy he greeted him youve news come with me he led the way to the office near reception he shut the door behind them tell me about islington in may andy lynley said without preamble because he knew that to hesitate was to offer the other man an opening into his sympathy that he couldnt afford to allow tell me about saying ill see you dead before i let you do it maiden sat he indicated a chair for lynley he didnt speak until lynley was seated and even then he seemed to go inward for a moment as if he was gathering his resources before he replied then he said the wheel clamp to which lynley replied no one could ever accuse you of being an incompetent cop the same could be said of you youve done good work tommy i always believed youd shine in cid if anything the compliment was like a slap in the face hearkening as it did to all the nowobvious reasons that andy maiden had chosen himblinded as he was by admirationto come to derbyshire lynley said steadily i have a good team tell me about islington they were finally upon it and maidens eyes bore so much anguish that lynley found he stilleven nowhad to steel himself against a rush of pity towards his old friend she asked to see me maiden said so i went last may to london lynley clarified you went to islington to see your daughter thats right hed thought nicola wanted to make arrangements to move her belongings back to derbyshire for the summer preparatory to taking her holiday job with will upman as theyd arranged in december so hed driven the landrover the better to be able to haul things home if she was willing to part with them a few weeks before her classes ended at the college of law but she didnt want to come home maiden said thats not why shed called me to london she wanted to tell me her future plans prostitution lynley said her setup in fulham maiden cleared his throat roughly and whispered oh god even hardening himself against empathy lynley found he couldnt force the man to lay out the facts that hed gathered that day in london so he did it for him lynley went through everything as he himself had learned it from nicolas employment first as a trainee then as an escort at mkr financial management to her partnership with vi nevin and her choice of domination as her speciality he concluded with sir adrian believes there could be only one reason why she came north for the summer instead of remaining in london money it was a compromise she did it for me theyd argued bitterly but hed finally got her to agree to work for upman during the summer at least to try the law as a career by paying her more than she would have made remaining in london he said he garnered her cooperation hed had to take out a bank loan to raise the sum she demanded as recompense but he considered it money well spent you were that confident that the law would win her over lynley asked the prospect hardly seemed likely i was confident that upman would win her over maiden replied ive seen him with women he has a way i thought he and nicola tommy i was willing to try anything the right man i kept thinking could bring her to her senses wouldnt julian britton have been a better choice he was already in love with her wasnt he julian wanted her too much she needed a man whod seduce her but keep her guessing upman seemed right for the job maiden appeared to hear his own words because he flinched a moment after hed made the declaration and finally he began to weep oh god tommy she drove me to it he said and he held a fist at his mouth as if this could deaden his pain and lynley was at last facetoface with what he hadnt wanted to see hed turned away from the guilt of this man because of who he had been at new scotland yard while all the time who he had been at new scotland yard illuminated his culpability as nothing else could a master of deception and dissimulation andy maiden had spent decades moving in that netherworld of undercover where the lines between fact and fantasy between illegality and honour first became blurred and ultimately became altogether nonexistent tell me how it happened lynley said stonily tell me what you used besides the knife maiden dropped his hand god in heaven his voice was hoarse tommy you cant be thinking then he appeared to reflect back over what hed said to locate the exact point of misunderstanding between them she drove me to bribery to paying her to work for upman so that he could win her so that her mother would never discover what she was because it would have destroyed her but no no you cant think i killed her i was here the night she died here in the hotel and my god she was my only child and shed betrayed you lynley said after all youd done for her after the life youd given her no i loved her do you have children a daughter a son do you know what it is to see the future in your child and know youll live on no matter what happens just because she herself exists as a whore lynley asked as a woman on the game who makes her money paying house calls on men she whips into submission ill see you dead before i let you do it those were your words and she was returning to london next week andy youd bought yourself only a reprieve from the inevitable when you paid her to work in buxton i didnt tommy listen to me i was here on tuesday night maidens voice had risen and a knock sounded on the door it opened before either man could speak nan maiden stood there she looked from lynley to her husband she didnt speak but she didnt need to say a word in explanation of what lynley read on her face she knows what he did he thought my god shes known from the first leave us andy maiden cried out to his wife i dont think that will be necessary lynley said barbara havers had never been to westerham and she discovered soon enough that there was no easy way to get there from the st james home in chelsea shed made a quick run to the st jameses upon leaving eaton terracewhy not shed thought since she was in the area so close to the kings road a short jaunt down which would take her to cheyne rowand shed been dead eager to let off steam to the couple who she very well knew were most likely to have also experienced inspector lynleys brand of priggish irrationality firsthand at one time or another but she hadnt had a chance to tell her story for deborah st james had answered the door given a happy shout in the direction of the study and pulled her inside the house like a woman greeting someone unexpectedly back from the war simon look shed announced isnt this just meant and the meeting between the three of them had been the spur that sent barbara into kent to get there however shed had to battle the maze of unmarked streets that made the words south of the river synonymous with a sojourn in hell shed got lost on the far side of albert bridge where one moment of inattention resulted in twenty minutes of exasperation driving round clapham common in a futile search for the a once shed found it and worked her way over to lewisham shed begun wondering about the efficacy of using the internet to locate ones expert witnesses the witness in this case lived in westerham where he also ran a small business a short distance away from quebec house you wont be able to miss it hed told her on the telephone quebec house sits at the top of the edenbridge road its got a sign at the front its open todayquebec houseso therell probably be the odd coach in the car park im less than five hundred yards to the south so he was she found in a clapboard construction that bore the sign quiver me timbers above its door his name was jason harley and his business shared room with his house the original home having been halved by a wall that ran down its middle like solomons judgement an overly wide door had been set into this wall and it was through this door that jason harley rolled himself in the high performance wheelchair of a marathon athlete when barbara rang the bell outside the shop door youre constable havers harley asked barbara she said he tossed back a mass of hair that was blond very thick and straight as a ruler barbara then lucky you caught me at home i usually shoot on sundays he rolled himself back and beckoned her inside saying make sure the sign stays on closed wont you ive got a local fan club that likes to drop by when they see im open he made this last remark ironically trouble barbara asked him thinking of louts hooligans and what torments they could inflict on a paraplegic nineyearold boys i spoke at their school now im their hero harley grinned affably so how can i help you barbara you said you wanted to see what i have right theyd found him on the internet where his business had a web page and his proximity to london had been the deciding factor in barbaras selection of him as her expert witness on the phone which rang in his house as well as in his shop jason harley had told her he wasnt open on sundays but when shed explained the reasons behind her call hed agreed to see her now she stood in the close confines of quiver me timbers and she glanced over its merchandise the fibreglass yew and carbon of jason harleys trade racks stood against walls display cases lined the shops single wide aisle an assembly area spanned the farther end and central to everything was a maple stand in which a ribboned medal was encased in glass it was an olympic gold barbara saw when she examined the medal not only in westerham was jason harley somebody when she gave her attention back to him she saw he was watching her im impressed she said did you do it from your chair could have done he told her would do today as well if i had a bit more free time to practise but i wasnt in a chair back then the chair came later after a hanggliding accident rough she said i cope better than most i dare say now how can i help you barbara tell me about cedar arrows she said jason harleys olympic gold medal represented the culmination of years of competition and practise years of competition and practise gave him rare expertise in the field of archery his hanggliding accident had forced him to consider how he might put his athletic prowess and his knowledge to use in order to support himself and the family he and his girlfriend wished to have the result was his shop quiver me timbers where he sold the fine carbon arrows shot by modern bows made of fiberglass or laminae of wood and where he handmade and sold the wooden arrows that were used with the traditional long bows for which english archery had historically been known from the battle of agincourt onwards in his shop he also provided his customers with the accoutrements of archery from the complicated hand and body pieces worn by archers to the arrow headscalled piles he told barbarathat differed depending upon the use to which the arrow was being put what about shooting a nineteenyearold boy in the back barbara wanted to ask the archer what kind of pile would you need for that but she went at it slowly knowing that she was going to need a volume of information to heave at lynley in order to make the slightest dent in his armour against her she asked harley to tell her about the wooden arrows he made particularly the arrows that he crafted from port orford cedar cedar arrows were the only ones he made at all he corrected her the shafts came to him from oregon there they were individually weighed graded and subjected to a bending test prior to being shipped theyre dependable as hell he told her which is important because when the pull weight of the bow is high you need an arrow thats made to withstand it you can get arrows of pine or ash he went on after a moment during which he handed her a finished cedar arrow for her inspection some from local wood and some from sweden but the oregon cedars more easily availablebecause of the quantity i supposeand i expect youd find every archery shop in england sells it he shepherded her to the back of his shop where his work area was there set at the height of his waist a mini assembly line allowed him to move easily from the round saw that cut the slot in the arrows shaft to the fletching jig where the cock and shaft feathers were glued into position araldite kept the pile in place and as hed said before the pile differed depending on the use to which the arrow would be put some archers prefer to make their own arrows he told her in summation but as its a labour intensive jobwell i suppose you can see that for yourself cant youmost of them find an arrow maker they like and they buy their arrows from him he can make them distinctive in any way they preferwithin reason of courseso long as they tell him what they want as a means of identification identification barbara asked because of the competitions harley said thats mostly what long bows are used for these days there were he explained two types of competitions that long bow archers engaged in tournament shooting and field shooting with the former they shot at traditional targets twelve dozen arrows fired at bullseyes from varying distances for the latter they shot in wooded areas or on hillsides arrows fired at animals whose images were depicted on paper but in either case the only way a winner could be determined was by the individual identification marks that were made upon the arrow that was fired and every competitive archer in england would be certain that his arrows could be distinguished from the arrows of every other archer who also competed how else could they tell whose arrow hit the target harley asked reasonably right barbara said how else shed read the postmortem report on terry cole she knew from her conversation with st james that lynley had been told of a third weapon beyond the knife and the stone theyd already identified as having been used on the victims now with that third weapon as good as identified she began to see how the crime had occurred she said tell me mr harley how fast can a good archerwith a decade or more of experience lets sayget off successive arrows at a target using a long bow that is he considered the question thoughtfully fingers pulling at his lower lip ten seconds id guess at the most as long as that let me show you she thought harley intended to demonstrate for her himself but instead he fetched a quiver from the display rack slid six arrows into it and motioned barbara to come to his chair righthanded or left he asked her right okay turn around feeling a little foolish she allowed him to slide the quiver onto her body and adjust the strap across her torso suppose the bows in your left hand he explained when he had the quiver in place now reach back for the arrow only one when she had itand not without a bit of unfamiliar gropinghe pointed out that she would next have to position it on the dacron string of the bow then she would have to draw the string back and take aim its not like a gun he reminded her you have to reload and reaim after every shot a good archer can do it in just under ten seconds but for someone like youno offence barbara laughed give me twenty minutes she looked at herself in the mirror that hung on the door through which jason had earlier rolled himself into the shop standing there she practised reaching back for the arrow she imagined herself with a bow and she tried to picture the target in front of her not a bullseye or a paper animal but a living human being two of them in fact sitting next to a fire that would have been the only light he didnt shoot the girl because he wasnt after the girl she thought but he had no other weapon with him and he was desperate to kill the boy so he had to use what hed brought and hope the shot would kill him becausewith another person presenthe wasnt going to have the chance to fire off another at cole so what had happened the shot hadnt gone true perhaps the boy had moved at the last moment perhaps aiming for the neck hed hit lower on the back instead the girl realising someone in the darkness was trying to harm them would have jumped to her feet and tried to flee and since she was running and since it was dark the bow and arrow were useless against her so hed have chased her down hed have dispatched her and gone back for the boy barbara said jason if you were shot in the back with one of these arrows what would you feel would you know youd been hit by an arrow i mean harley gave his attention to the rack of bows as if the answers were hidden among them i expect youd feel a terrific blow at first he said slowly rather like youd been hit with a hammer could you move stand i dont see why not until you realised what had happened to you of course and then youd probably go into shock especially if you reached back and felt the shaft sticking out of you god that would be grim that would be enough to make you faint barbara said pass out fall over right he agreed and then the arrow would break off wouldnt it depending on the way you fell it might do which would she concluded silently possibly leave a sliver of wood behind when the killereager to remove the one thing from the body that could ultimately identify him to the policepulled the remainder of the arrow from the victims back but he wouldnt have been deadterry coleat that point just in shock so the killer would have to finish him off once he returned from pounding in the girls skull he had no weapon with him other than the long bow his only choice was to find a weapon there at the campsite and having done that with the boy safely stabbed he himself was free to search for what he assumed terry cole had with him the chandler music the source of a fortune denied him by the terms of his fathers will there was only a final point to clarify with jason harley she said jason can an arrows tip the pile he corrected her the pile can it pierce human flesh i mean i always thought arrows had to have rubber ends or something if you took them out in public he smiled suction cups you mean like on kids bows and arrows he rolled past her and behind one of the display cases where he took out a small box and emptied it on the low glass counter these he told her were the piles used at the end of the cedar arrows the most common for field archery was the bodkin head barbara could test its sharpness if she wanted to she did so the metal piece was cylindrical in keeping with the arrows shape but it also narrowed to a nasty foursided point that would be deadly when propelled with force as she was pressing this tip into her finger experimentally harley chatted on about the other piles he sold he laid out broadheads and hunting heads and explained their use finally he separated from them the mediaeval reproductions and these he concluded are for demonstrations and battles battles barbara asked incredulously people actually shooting arrows at each other not real battles of course and when the fighting begins the arrows are fitted out with rubber bunts on the end so theyre not dangerous theyre reenactments the battles are a slew of weekend warriors gather together in the grounds of some castle or great house and play out the war of roses with one another it goes on all over the countryside people travel to reenactments do they with bows and arrows in the boots of their cars just like that yes they do chapter the rain was unrelenting the wind had joined it in the car park of the black angel hotel both the wind and the rain played a sodden game with the top layer of rubbish in an overloaded skip the wind lifted and hurled cardboard boxes and old newspapers into the air the downfall plastered both to the windscreens and wheels of the empty cars lynley climbed from the bentley and raised his umbrella against the late summer storm he hurried with his suitcase in hand round the side of the building and through the front door a coat rack just within the entrance sprouted the dripping coats and jackets of a dozen or more sunday patrons whose shapes lynley could see through the translucent amber glass of the upper half of the hotel bars door next to the rack a good ten umbrellas stood in an elongated iron stand and glistened wetly under the light of the entrance porch where lynley stamped the damp from his shoes he hung his coat among the others shoved his umbrella in with the rest and went through the bar to reception if the proprietor of the black angel was surprised to see him back so soon the man gave no indication tourist season after all was nearly at an end he would be happy enough for whatever custom came his way in the coming months he handed over a keydepressingly it was for the same room hed had earlier lynley sawand asked if the inspector wanted his bags taken up or would he rather see to them himself lynley handed over his suitcase and went to the bar for a meal sunday lunch was long since finished but they could do him a cold ham salad or a filled jacket potato he was informed as long as he wasnt overly particular about the potatos filling he said that he wasnt and he asked for both when the food was in front of him however lynley found that he wasnt as hungry as hed thought he dipped into the potato with its thatch of cheddar but when he brought the loaded fork to his mouth his tongue thickened at the thought of having to swallow anything solid chewed or not he lowered the fork and reached for the lager getting drunk was still an option he wanted to believe them he wanted to believe them not because they were able to offer him the slightest bit of evidence in support of their statements but because he didnt want to believe anything else cops went bad from time to time and only a fool denied that fact birmingham guildford and bridgewater were only three of the places that had numbers attached to themsix four and four respectivelyin reference to the defendants convicted on spurious evidence interrogation room beatings and manufactured confessions with signatures forged each conviction had been the result of police malfeasance for which not a single excuse could possibly be made so there were bad cops whether one called them overly zealous outright tendentious thoroughly corrupt or simply too indolent or ignorant to do the job the way the job was supposed to be done but lynley didnt want to believe that andy maiden was a cop whod gone bad nor did he even want to believe that andy was simply a father whod reached the end of his tether in dealing with his child even now after talking to andy after watching the interplay between the man and his wife and having to evaluate what every word gesture and nuance between them meant lynley found that his heart and his mind were still in conflict over the basic facts nan maiden had joined them in the airless little office behind reception in maiden hall shed shut the door her husband had said nancy dont bother the guests nan youre not needed in here and cast a beseeching look at lynley in an unspoken request that lynley did not grant for needed was exactly what nan maiden was if they were to get to the bottom of what had happened to nicola on calder moor she said to lynley we werent expecting anyone else today i told inspector hanken yesterday that andy was at home that night i explained yes lynley agreed ive been told then i dont see what further good can come from more questions she stood stiffly near the door and her words were as rigid as her body when she went on i know youve come for that inspector questioning andy instead of offering us information about nicolas death andy wouldnt look like thatlike hes being chewed up insideif you hadnt come to ask him if he actually if he went onto the moor so that he could and there her voice faltered he was here on tuesday night i told inspector hanken that what more do you want from us the absolute truth lynley thought he wanted to hear it more he wanted them both to face it but at the last moment when he could have revealed to her the real nature of her daughters life in london he didnt do it all the facts about nicola would come out eventuallyin interrogation rooms in legal depositions and in the trialbut there was no reason to drag them out now like the bones of a grinning skeleton forced from a cupboard that the girls mother didnt even know existed if nothing else he could honour andy maidens wishes in that matter at least for now he said who can support your statement mrs maiden di hanken told me that andy had gone to bed early in the evening did someone else see him who else would have seen him our employees dont go into the private part of the house unless theyre instructed to do so and you didnt ask one of them to check on andy during the evening i checked on him myself so you see the difficulty dont you no i dont because im telling you that andy didnt she clenched her fists at her throat and squeezed her eyes shut he didnt kill her so the words were said at last but even as they were said the one logical question that nan maiden might have asked went completely unspoken she never said the words why why would my husband have killed his own daughter and that was a telling omission the question was the single best way that nan maiden could have challenged the police conjectures about her husband it was a gauntlet that she could have thrown down one which called upon the police to give a credible reason why an unthinkable crime against human nature had been committed but she didnt ask it and like most people who dont ask questions when questions are called for she gave herself away for to ask the question gave lynley an opening to plant in her mind the seeds of a doubt that she obviously couldnt afford to let grow there better to deny and avoid than to have to think the unthinkable first than to have to learn to accept it second how much did you know about your daughters plans for her future lynley said to both of them giving andy maiden the opportunity of revealing to his wife the worst there was to know about their only child our daughter has no future nan answered so her planswhatever they might have beenare irrelevant arent they ill arrange to take a polygraph andy maiden said abruptly lynley saw in his offer how keen he was to keep his wife from hearing an account of their daughters london life that cant be so difficult to set up can it we can find someone i want to take one tommy andy no ill arrange for both of us to take one if you like maiden said ignoring his wife andy how else can we make him see that hes got it all maiden asked her but with your nerves she said with the state youre in andy theyll turn you and twist you dont do it im not afraid and lynley could see that he wasnt which was a point he clung to all the way back to tideswell and the black angel hotel now with his meal in front of him lynley considered that lack of fear and what it might mean innocence bravado or dissimulation it could be any one of the three lynley thought and despite everything hed learned about the man he knew which one he still hoped it was inspector lynley he looked up the barmaid stood there frowning down at his uneaten meal he was about to apologise for ordering that which he hadnt been able to consume when she said youve a call from london the phones behind the bar if you want to use it the caller was winston nkata and the constables words were urgent we got it guv he said tersely when he heard lynleys voice postmortem showed a piece of cedar found on the cole boys body st james says thfirst weapon was an arrow shot in the dark the girl took off running so he couldnt shoot at her had to chase her down and cosh her with the boulder nkata explained exactly what st james had seen on the report how he had interpreted the information and what henkatahad learned about arrows and long bows from a fletcher in kent killer wouldve taken the arrow with him from the scene because most long bowsre used in competitions nkata finished and all the long bow arrowsre marked to identify them marked in what way with the shooters initials good god that puts a signature on the crime isnt that true these initials cn be carved or burned into the wood or put on with transfers but in any case at a crime scene theyd be as good as dabs top marks winnie lynley said excellent work the dc cleared his throat yeah well got to do the job so if we find the archer weve got our killer lynley said looks that way nkata asked the next logical question you talk to the maidens spector he wants to take a polygraph lynley told him about his interview with the dead girls parents when hed finished nkata said make sure he gets asked if he plays the hundred years war on his free afternoons sorry thats what they do with long bows competitions tournaments and reenactments so is our mr maiden fighting the french for a lark up there in derbyshire lynley drew in a breath he felt as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders at the very same moment that a fog bank cleared from his brain broughton manor he said what where ill find a long bow lynley explained and ive a very good idea who knows how to shoot it in london barbara watched as nkata rang off he looked at her somberly what she felt a clenching round her heart dont tell me he didnt believe you winnie he believed me thank god she looked at him more closely he seemed so grave then what s your work barb i dont like taking credit oh that well you cant be thinking hed have listened to me if id phoned him with the news its better this way puts me in a better light than you i dont much like it when ive done nothing to get there forget it it was the only way leave me out of it so his nibship can keep his knickers from twisting whats he going to do she listened as nkata related lynleys plans to seek the long bow at broughton manor she shook her head at the futility of his thinking hes on a goose chase winnie theres not going to be a long bow in derbyshire how cn you be so sure i can feel it she gathered up what shed brought into lynleys office i may phone in with the flu for a day or two but you didnt hear that from me okay nkata nodded whatll you be up to then barbara held up what jason harley had given her before she left his shop in westerham it was a lengthy mailing list of individuals who received his quarterly catalogues hed generously handed this over along with the records of everyone who had placed orders with quiver me timbers in the last six months hed said i dont expect these will be much help because therere plenty of archery shops in the country that your man mightve ordered his arrows from but if youd like to have a go youre welcome to take them shed jumped at the offer shed even taken along two of his catalogues for good measure for some sundayevening light reading shed thought as shed tucked them into her bag as things were now she certainly had sweet fa else to do what about you she asked nkata the inspector give you another assignment sunday night off with my mum and dad now theres an assignment she saluted him and was about to stride off when the phone rang on lynleys desk she said uhoh forget sunday night winston hell he grumbled and reached for the phone his side of the conversation consisted of no not here sorry up in derbyshire dc winston nkata yeah right pretty much but its not xactly the same case im fraid a lengthier pause as someone went on and on followed by she is and a smile nkata looked at barbara and for some reason gave her a thumbsup good news that best news there is thanks he listened a moment longer and looked at the wall clock right will do say thirty minutes yeah oh we definitely got someone who can take a statement he rang off a second time and nodded at barbara thats you me hang on winnie youve got no rank to pull on me barbara said in protest seeing her sundayevening plans go down the sewer right but i dont think you want to miss out on this im off the case i know that but cording to the guv this isnt exactly on the case any longer so i dont see why you dont take it yourself take what vi nevin shes full conscious barb and someones got to take a statement from her lynley phoned di hanken at home where he found him sealed within his small garage apparently trying to make sense of instructions to assemble a childs swing set im not a bloody god damn engineer he fumed and seemed grateful for anything that promised to take him away from a hopeless endeavour lynley brought him into the picture hanken agreed that an arrow and its bow looked likely as their missing weapon explains why it wasnt stowed in that grit dispenser with the knife he said and if its initials that were going to find on the arrow ive a good idea whose theyre likely to be i recall your telling me about the various ways julian britton makes money at broughton manor lynley acknowledged it looks like were finally closing in on him peter im heading over there now to have a heading over where the hell are you hanken demanded arent you in london lynley was fairly certain in which direction hanken would run when he learned why lynley had returned so quickly to derbyshire and his fellow di did not disappoint him i knew it was maiden hanken exclaimed at the end of lynleys explanation he found that car on the moor thomas and theres no way in hell he would have found it had he not known where shed be in the first place he knew she was on the game in london and he couldnt deal with it so he gave her the chop it was the only wayi dare saythat he could keep her from spilling the news to her mum this was so close to what maidens actual desires were that lynley felt chilled by hankens perspicacity still he said andys said hell arrange to take a polygraph i cant think hed make an offer like that if he had nicolas blood on his hands the hell he wouldnt hanken countered this blokes an undercover cop lets not forget if he hadnt been able to lie with the best of them hed be a dead man now a polygraph taken by andy maidens going to be nothing more than a joke on us by the way julian brittons still got the stronger motive lynley said let me see if i can shake him up youre playing right into maidens hands you know that dont you hes working you like youre wearing the same school tie which they were in a manner of speaking but lynley refused to be blinded by their history he refused to be blinded in either direction it was as foolhardy to believe beyond doubt that andy maiden was the killer as it was to ignore the possible guilt of someone with a stronger motive hanken rang off lynley had made the phone call from his hotel room so he took five minutes to unpack his belongings before heading out to broughton manor hed left his umbrella and trench coat below in the entrance when hed gone upstairs to place the call so after tossing his room key onto the reception desk he went to fetch them the black angels earlier patrons had mostly departed he saw there were only three umbrellas left in the stand and apart from his own coat only a single jacket remained on the coat rack under other circumstances a jacket on a coat rack wouldnt have caught his attention but as he endeavoured to untangle the hook of his umbrella from the gaping ribs of another he knocked the jacket from its spot on the rack and thus felt obliged to pick it up from the floor the fact that the garment was leather didnt strike him at first nor did the fact that it was black make an immediate impression upon him it was only when the silence and darkness of the previously occupied hotel bar told him all the patrons were gone that he realised the jacket had no owner he looked from the darkened bar door to the black leather jacket feeling a tingling along his scalp he thought no it cant be but even as his mind formed the words his fingers contacted the stiffened liningstiffened the way only one substance can render an otherwise soft material stiff because the substance itself does not so much dry as coagulate lynley dropped his umbrella he took the jacket nearer to the entry porchs window where he could better examine it under the light and there he saw that in addition to that unnamed substance which had altered the texture of the lining the leather was damaged in another way a holeperhaps the size of a fivepence coinhad pierced the back apart from knowing that the lining of the jacket had once been soaked with blood lynley did not need to be a student of anatomy also to know that the hole in the jacket matched up precisely with the left scapula of the unfortunate person whod been wearing it nan maiden found him in his lair near their bedroom hed left the office as soon as the detective was out of the hotel and she hadnt followed him instead shed spent nearly an hour straightening the lounge after the last of the sunday guests and setting up the dining room for residents and others who would be requiring a light sunday supper when shed completed these tasks checked the kitchen to see that the evenings soup was being prepared and given directions to several american hikers who were apparently intent upon reenacting jane eyre at north lees hall she went in search of her husband her excuse was a meal she hadnt seen him eat for days and if he went on like this he would certainly fall ill the reality was something rather different andy couldnt be permitted to carry through his plan to be questioned with electrodes attached to his body none of his responses could possibly be accurate when one considered the condition he was in she loaded a tray with anything he might find tempting she included two drinks for him to choose from and she climbed the stairs to make her offering he was sitting at the kneehole and before him was a shoe box with its lid off and its contents spread across the secretaire drawer that was pulled out and open nan said his name but he didnt hear her so engrossed was he with the papers that had been in the box she approached over his shoulder she could see that he was looking at a collection of letters notes drawings and greeting cards spanning nearly a quarter of a century what had occasioned each one was different but their source was the same they represented every drawing or other communication that andy had received from nicola throughout her life nan put the tray down next to the comfortable old overstuffed chair where andy sometimes read she said ive brought you something to eat darling and was unsurprised when he didnt reply she didnt know if he could not hear her or if he merely wished to be alone and wasnt willing to say so but in either case it didnt matter she would make him hear her and she would not leave him she said please dont take that lie detector test andy your condition isnt normal and it hasnt been for months im going to ring that policeman in the morning and tell him youve changed your mind theres no sin in that youre perfectly within your rights hell know it andy stirred in his fingers he held a childs gawky drawing of dady gets out of his bath that had provoked in both of them such fond laughter so many years before but now the sight of that little girls rendering of her naked fathercomplete with a penis hilariously out of proportioncaused a shudder in nan followed by a shutting down of some basic function in her body and a shutting off of some essential emotion in her heart ill take the polygraph andy set the drawing to one side its the only way she wanted to say the only way to what and she would have done had she been more prepared to hear the answer instead she said and what if you fail he turned to her then he held an old letter between his fingers nan could see the words dearest daddy in nicolas bold firm hand why would i fail he asked because of your condition she answered if your nerves are going bad theyre going to send out incorrect readings the police will take those readings and misinterpret them the machine will say your bodys not working the police will call it something else theyll call it guilt the sentence hung between them it seemed to nan suddenly that she and her husband were occupying different continents she felt that she was the one whod created the ocean between them but she could not take the risk of diminishing its size andy said a polygraph measures temperature pulse and respiration there wont be a problem its nothing to do with nerves i want to take it but why why because its the only way he smoothed the letter against the top of the secretaire drawer he traced dearest daddy with his index finger i wasnt asleep he said to her i tried to sleep but i couldnt because i was so unnerved when my sight went bad so why did you tell them you checked on me nancy and then he looked up and held her gaze with his ive brought you something to eat andy she said brightly theres got to be something here to tempt you should i spread some pâté on a piece of baguette nancy he said please tell me the truth but she couldnt she couldnt hed created her life hed watched her grow hed kept every missive and treasured every word hed seen her through childhood illnesses and adolescent tantrums into an adulthood of which hed been so proud so if there was a chancejust the slightest possibilitythat his physical condition was unrelated to nicolas death then she would live by that chance shed die by it as well if that was necessary she was wonderful wasnt she nan maiden whispered gesturing to the memories of nicola that her husband had taken from their storage place wasnt our little girl just the best vi nevin wasnt alone in her room when barbara havers arrived at chelsea and westminster hospital sitting next to her bed with her head pressed into the mattress like an orangehaired supplicant at the feet of a heavily bandaged goddess was a girl with limbs like bicycle spokes and the wrists and ankles of a starvation dieter she looked up as the door swung shut behind barbara howd you get in she demanded rising and adopting a defensive stance with her inadequate body placed between the interloper and the bed that cop out there int sposed to let anyone relax barbara said excavating in her bag for identification im one of the good guys the girl sidled forward snatched barbaras warrant card and read it one eye on the card and the other on barbara lest she make any precipitate moves on the bed behind her the patient stirred she murmured s okay shell i saw her already with the black th other day you know shellwho said she was vis best friend on earth shelly platt who meant to take care of vi till the end of time and dont you forget itreturned barbaras identification and slunk back to her seat barbara rustled out a notepad and a chewedupon biro and pulled the rooms other chair into a position from which she and vi nevin could see each other she said im sorry about the beating i got one myself a few months ago rotten business but at least i could point the finger at the bastard can you what dyou remember shelly went to the head of the bed taking vis hand and beginning to stroke it her presence was an irritant to barbara like a sudden case of contact dermatitis but the young woman in the bed seemed to take comfort from it whatever helps barbara thought she sat with biro poised beneath the bandages what could be seen of vi nevins swollen face was her eyes a small portion of her forehead and a stitchedup lower lip she looked like a victim of the sort of explosive that threw off shrapnel she said in a voice so faint that barbara strained to hear it had a punter coming old bloke this is likes honey on him i coat him first you know then i lick it off what a treat barbara thought she said right you say honey brilliant go on vi nevin did so she said shed readied herself for her appointment in the schoolgirl costume that her client preferred but when shed brought out the honey jar shed realised that there wouldnt be enough to baste all the body parts he usually requested plenty for the prong vi said with the frankness of a professional but if he wanted more i needed to have it to hand ive got the picture barbara told her at the head of the bed shelly eased a skinny thigh onto the mattress she said i cn tell it vi youll wear yourself out vi shook her head and continued the story there was little enough of it shed popped out for the honey before her clients arrival when shed returned shed transferred the honey into its regular jug and shed assembled a tray with the linens and other assorted goodiesall of which appeared to be either edible or potablethat she used in her regular sessions with the man shed been carrying the tray into the sitting room when shed heard a sound from one of the bedrooms upstairs all right barbara thought her interpretation of the pictures taken at the fulham crime scene was about to be confirmed but to be absolutely sure she clarified with was it your client had he arrived ahead of you not him vi murmured shelly said to barbara you cn see shes knackered thats enough for now hang on barbara told her so a bloke was upstairs but he wasnt a client then howd he get in you hadnt bolted the door vi raised the hand that shelly wasnt clutching it rose two inches off the bed and fell back she reminded barbara only popped out for honey ten minutes is all so she saw no reason to bolt the door when she heard the noise above stairs she explained she went to investigate and found a bloke in her bedroom the room itself was in shambles you saw him only a shadowy glimpse of him as he lunged at her vi explained fine barbara thought because a glimpse might well do it she said thats good thats brilliant then tell me what you can anything at all a detail a scar a mark anything and she summoned into her mind the image of matthew kingryders face to match it up with whatever vi nevin said but what vi gave her was a description of everyman medium height medium build brown hair clear skin and while it fitted matthew kingryder to a t it also fitted at least seventy percent of the male population too fast vi breathed happened too fast but it wasnt the client youd been expecting you do know that vis lips curved and she winced as they pulled against their stitches eightyone that bloke is on his best day hardly can manage the stairs and it wasnt martin reeve she shook her head one of your other clients an old boyfriend perhaps she said shelly platt interrupted hotly im clearing the decks barbara told her its the only way you want us to nick whoever assaulted her right shelly grumbled and petted vis shoulder barbara tapped the pen against her notebook and considered their options they could hardly cart vi nevin to an identity parade and even if that were possible they hadat the momentno reason in hell to trot matthew kingryder into the local nick to stand in one so they needed a picture but it would have to come from a newspaper or a magazine or from kingryder productions on some sort of spurious excuse because one hint that they were on to him and kingryder would weigh down his long bow and arrows with concrete and dump them into the thames faster than you could say robin hoods merry men but getting a photo was going to take some time because they needed the real thingsharp and clearand not something sent over to the hospital via fax and fax or otherwise where the hell were they going to get a photo of matthew kingryder athere barbara looked at her watchhalf past seven on a sunday evening there was no way it was stabinthedark time she drew a deep breath and took the plunge dyou know a bloke called matthew kingryder by any chance vi said the completely unexpected yes lynley held the jacket by its satin lining it had doubtless been touched by a dozen people since being removed from terry coles body on tuesday night but it had been touched by the killer as well and if he hadnt realised that fingerprints could be lifted from leather nearly as easily as they could be lifted from glass or painted wood there was an excellent chance that hed left an unintentional calling card upon the garment once the proprietor of the black angel understood the import of lynleys request he fetched all the employees to the bar for some questions post haste he offered the inspector tea coffee or other refreshment to go along with his queries seeking to be helpful with the sort of anxiety to please that generally struck people who found themselves inadvertently living on the county line between murder and respectability lynley demurred at all refreshment he just wanted some information he said showing the jacket to the hotels proprietor and its employees didnt get him anywhere however one jacket was much like another to them none could say how or when the garment that lynley was holding had appeared at the hotel they made suitable noises of horror and aversion when he pointed out the copious amount of dried blood on the lining and the hole in the back and while they looked at him with properly mournful expressions when he mentioned the two recent deaths on calder moor not an eyelash among them so much as fluttered at the suggestion that a killer might have been in their midst i reckon someone left that thing here thas what happened no mistake about it the barmaid said coats hanging on the porch rack all winter long one of the room maids added i never take notice of them one day to the next but thats just it lynley said it isnt winter and until today i dare say there hasnt been rain enough for macs jackets or coats so what sr point the proprietor said how could all of you fail to notice a leather jacket on a coat rack if the leather jacket is hanging there alone the ten employees who were gathered in the bar shifted about looked sheepish or appeared regretful but no one could shed any light on the jacket or how it had come to be there they came in to work through the back door not through the front they told him they left the same way so they wouldnt have even seen the coat rack in the course of their normal workdays besides things often got left behind at the black angel hotel umbrellas walking sticks rain gear rucksacks maps everything ended up in lost property and until things got there no one paid them much mind lynley decided on a full frontal approach were they acquainted with the britton family he wanted to know would they recognise julian britton if they saw him the proprietor spoke for everyone we all know the brittons at the black angel did any of you see julian on tuesday night but no one had lynley dismissed them he asked for a bag in which to stow the jacket and while one was being fetched for him he walked to the window watched the rain fall and thought about tideswell the black angel and the crime he himself had seen that tideswell abutted the eastern edge of calder moor and the killervastly more familiar with the white peak than lynleywould have known that as well so in possession of a jacket with an incriminating hole that would have told the tale of the crime in short order had it been found on the scene he had to be rid of it as soon as possible what could have been easier than stopping at the black angel hotel on his way home from calder moor knowing as an habitué of the bar that coats and jackets accumulated for whole seasons before anyone thought to have a look at them but could julian britton have managed to hang up the leather jacket in the entrance without being seen by anyone inside it was possible lynley thought risky as the devil but possible and at this point lynley was willing to accept that which was possible it kept that which was probable out of his thoughts barbara leaned forward in her chair saying you know him matthew kingryder you know him and trying to keep the excitement from her voice terry vi murmured her eyelids were getting heavy but barbara pressed the young woman anyway against the rising protestations of shelly platt terry knew matthew kingryder how music vi said barbara felt immediately deflated damn she thought terry cole the chandler music and matthew kingryder there was nothing new in this they were nowhere again then vi said found it in the albert hall did terry barbaras eyebrows knotted the albert hall terry found the music there under a seat barbara was gobsmacked she tried to get her mind round what vi nevin was telling her even as vi continued to tell her in the course of his job as card boy terry put cards regularly in south kensington phone boxes he always did this work at night since there was less likelihood of finding himself on the receiving end of police aggro after dark hed been on his regular rounds in the neighbourhood of queens gate when the phone in one of the boxes rang on the corner of elvaston place and one of the mewses this was vi said for a lark terry answered to hear a male voice say the package is in the albert hall circle q row seat after which the line went dead the mysterious nature of the call piqued terrys interest the word packagewith its intimations of either a money drop a drug drop or a dead letter boxclinched the deal since he was so close to kensington gore where the royal albert hall overlooked the south border of hyde park terry went to investigate a concert audience was just leaving so the hall was open he tracked down the seat high in one of the balconies and found a package of music beneath it the chandler music barbara thought but what the bloody hell was it doing there he thought at first that hed been sent off on a fools errand intended for whatever fool was supposed to answer that phone on the corner of elvaston place and when hed met up with vi to collect a fresh batch of phone box cards hed told her about his brief adventure i thought there might be money to be made vi told barbara so did nikki when we told her about it shelly dropped vis hand abruptly saying i dont want to hear nothing about that bitch to which vi replied come on shell shes dead shelly flounced over to the chair shed been sitting on earlier she plopped down and began to sulk arms crossed over her bony chest barbara speculated briefly on the uneasy future of a relationship between two women when one of them was so perilously dependent vi ignored the demonstration of pique they all had ambitions she told barbara terry had his destination art and vi and nikki had plans to start up a first class escort business they also had a need to support themselves once nikki broke with adrian beattie both operations depended upon an infusion of cash and the music looked like a potential source of it see i remembered when sothebysor whoever it waswas set to auction a piece by lennon and mccartney and that was just one single sheet that was supposed to fetch a few thousand quid this was a whole packet of music i said terry ought to try to sell it nikki offered to do the research and find the right auction house wed split the money when the music sold but why cut you in barbara asked you and nikki it was terrys find after all yeah but he was soft on nikki vi said simply he wanted to impress her this was the way barbara knew the rest neil sitwell at bowers had opened terrys eyes to copyright law hed handed over the address for soho square and informed the boy that kingryder productions would put him in touch with the chandler solicitors terry had gone to matthew kingryder with the music in hand matthew kingryder had seen it and had realised how he could use it to make himself the fortune that his fathers will denied him but why not just buy the music from the boy right then she wondered why kill him to get it better yet why not just buy the rights to the music from the chandler family if the production that resulted from the music was anything like the kingryderchandler productions from the past there would have been plenty of lolly to go round in royalties even if fifty percent of it went to the chandlers vi was saying couldnt get the name when barbara roused herself from her thoughts she said what sorry what did you say matthew kingryder didnt give terry the solicitors name didnt even give him a chance to ask for it he booted him out of his office as soon as he saw what terryd brought with him when he saw the music she nodded terry said he called security two guards came up straightaway and threw him out but terry had gone there just for the chandler solicitors address hadnt he thats all he wanted from matthew kingryder he didnt want money a reward or something moneys what we wanted the chandlers to give him once we knew the music couldnt be auctioned a nurse came into the room then a small square tray in her hand a hypodermic needle lay on it time for pain medication the woman said one last question barbara said why did terry go up to derbyshire on tuesday because i asked him to vi said nikki thought i was being a fool about shelly here the other woman raised her head vi spoke to her rather than to barbara she kept sending these letters and hanging about and i was getting scared shelly raised a thin hand and pointed to her chest of me she asked you as scared of me nikki laughed them off when i told her about them i thought if she saw them herself we could plan to take care of shelly some way i wrote nikki a note and asked terry to take it and the letters up to her like i said he was soft on her any excuse to see her you know what i mean the nurse interposed at this juncture saying i really must insist and holding up the syringe yeah okay vi nevin said barbara stopped for groceries on her way back to chalk farm so it was after nine by the time she got home she unpacked her booty and stashed it within the cupboards and the munchkinsize fridge of her bungalow all the time in her mind she picked through the information that vi nevin had given her somewhere within their interview was buried the key to everything that had happened not only in derbyshire but also in london surely she thought a mere assembling of the information in the right order would tell her what she needed to know with a plate of reheatable rogan josh from the grocerys precooked sectionof which barbara had quickly become an habitué nonpareil when shed moved to the neighbourhoodshe settled herself at her tiny dining table next to the bungalows front window she accompanied her meal with a lukewarm bass and laid her notebook next to the coffee mug from which she was reduced to drinking since several days of crockery cutlery and glassware had piled in her kitchens diminutive sink she took a gulp of the ale forked up a portion of the lamb and flipped to the notes from her interview with vi nevin once the pain medication had been administered the patient had drifted off to sleep but not before answering a few more questions in her role of argos watching over io shelly platt had protested barbaras continued presence but vi lulled into a druginduced ease had whispered responses cooperatively until her eyes had closed and her breathing had deepened reviewing her notes barbara concluded that the logical place to begin in developing a hypothesis about the case would have to be with the telephone call that terry cole had intercepted in south kensington that event had set all others in motion it also stimulated enough questions to suggest that an understanding of the phone callwhat had prompted it and what exactly had arisen from itwould lead inexorably to the evidence that would allow her to nab matthew kingryder as a killer although it was now september vi nevin had been quite clear about the fact that terry cole had intercepted the phone call in south kensington in the month of june she couldnt give the exact date but she knew it was early in the month because shed collected a fresh batch of their phone box cards at the beginning of the month and she passed them to terry on the same day that she picked them up it was then that he told her about the curious call not the beginning of july barbara enquired not august not even september june it was vi nevin insisted she remembered because theyd already moved house to fulhamshe and nikkiand since nikki had gone on to derbyshire terry had questioned putting her cards in the phone boxes when she wasnt in town vi was quite sure of that shed wanted terry to put up her own cards as soon as possible she said so that she could continue to build her clientele and shed told the boy to hold nikkis cards for posting until the autumn when he was to place them in boxes a day before the young woman returned but why then had it taken terry so long to go to bowers with the music hed found first vi informed her because she didnt tell nikki straightaway about terrys find and second because once she did tell nikki and the plan was hatched among them to try to make some money from the music it took some time for nikki to research the best auction houses available to handle a sale of the sort they imagined didnt want to pay lots of sellers fees she murmured eyelids heavy nikki thought f a country auction first she made phone calls talked to people who knew and she came up with bowers s right vi turned on her side shelly raised the blanket round her charges shoulders and tucked her in up to her neck now munching her rogan josh in her chalk farm bungalow barbara reflected on that telephone call yet another time no matter which way she considered it however she arrived at the same conclusion the call had to have been intended for matthew kingryder who failed to be there at the designated hour to receive it hearing the single word yeah spoken by a male voiceby terry coles voicethe caller had assumed that his message about the albert hall was being received by the right person and since whoever had possession of the chandler music wished to remain anonymouswhy else make a call to a phone boxit seemed reasonable to conclude that either the passing of the music from his hand to kingryders constituted an illegality or the caller had come into possession of the music illegally or the music was going to be used by kingryder for a purpose that was itself illegal in any case the caller thought hed passed the music along to kingryder whod no doubt paid a significant sum to get his mitts on it with that sum in handprobably paid in advance and in cashthe caller faded into the fog of obscurity leaving kingryder out of the money out of the music and out of the picture as well so when terry cole had dropped into his office flashing a page of the chandler score matthew kingryder must have thought he was being deliberately ridiculed by someone who had already doublecrossed him because if hed arrived in south keninsgton just one minute late for that telephone call hed have stood round for hours waiting for that phone to ring and assuming hed been had hed want revenge for that hed also want that music and there was only one way to have both vi nevins story supported barbaras contention that matthew kingryder was the man they were looking for unfortunately it wasnt evidence and without something more solid than conjecture barbara knew that she had no case to lay before lynley and laying before him irrefutable facts was going to be the only way she could ever redeem herself in his eyes hed seen her defiance as further proof of her indifference to a chain of command he needed to see that same defiance as the dynamism that brought down a killer pondering this barbara heard her name called from outside the bungalow she looked up to see hadiyyah skipping down the path that led to the back garden the motiondetecting lights came on as she passed beneath them the effect wasnt unlike a dancer being spotlit as she flew across the stage were back were back were back from the sea hadiyyah sang out and look what dad won me barbara waved at the little girl and closed her notebook she went to the door and opened it just as hadiyyah was finishing a pirouette one of her long plaits had come loose from its restraining ribbon and was beginning to unravel trailing a tail of silver satin like a comet in the sky her socks were rucked and her tshirt was stained with mustard and ketchup but her face was radiant we had such fun she cried i wish and i wish that you couldve come barbara we went on the roller coaster and the sailing ships and the airplane ride andoh barbara waitll you heari got to drive the train we even went to the burnt house hotel and i visited mrs porter for a bit but not all day because dad fetched me back we ate our lunch on the beach and after we went paddling in the sea but the water was so cold that we decided to go to the arcade instead she gulped for breath im surprised youre still standing after a day packed like that i slept in the car hadiyyah explained almost all the way home she thrust her arm forward and barbara saw that she was carrying a small stuffed frog see what dad won me at the crane grab barbara hes ever so good at the crane grab its nice barbara told her with a nod at the frog good to practise with while youre young hadiyyah frowned and inspected the toy practise with right practise kissing barbara smiled at the little girls confusion she put her hand on her tiny shoulder ushered her to the table and said never mind it was a daft joke anyway im sure dating willve improved enormously by the time youre ready to try it so what else have you got what she had was a plastic bag whose handles were tied to one of the belt loops in her shorts she said this is for you dad won it as well at the crane grab hes ever so good at the crane grab barbara finished for her yeah i know because i already said but some things bear repeating barbara told her hand it over then lets see what it is with some effort hadiyyah untangled the bags handles and presented it to barbara she opened it to find inside a small plush red velvet heart it was trimmed with white lace well gosh barbara said she set the heart gingerly on the dining table isnt it lovely hadiyyah gazed upon the heart with no little reverence dad won it at the crane grab barbara just like the frog i said get her a froggie dad so shell have one as well and they can be friends but he said no a frog wont do for our friend little khushi thats what he calls me khushi yeah i know barbara felt a rapid pulse in her fingertips she stared at the heart like the votary of a saint in the presence of relics so he aimed for the heart instead it took him three tries to get it he couldve got the elephant i suppose because that wouldve been a lot easier or he couldve got the elephant first to get it out of the way and given it to me except i already have an elephant and i suppose he remembered that didnt he but anyway he wanted the heart i expect he mightve brought it to you himself but i wanted to and he said that was all right as long as your lights were on and you were still up was it all right you look a bit peculiar but your lights were on i saw you in the window should i not have given it to you barbara hadiyyah was watching her anxiously barbara smiled and put an arm round her shoulders its just so nice that i dont know what to say thanks and thank your dad for me wont you too bad expertise with the crane grab isnt a highly marketable skill hes ever so good right ive seen that firsthand if you recall hadiyyah recalled she rubbed her stuffed frog against her cheek its extra special to have a souvenir of a day at the sea isnt it whenever we do something special together dad buys a souvenir for me did you know so ill remember what a fine time we had he says thats important the remembering part he says the remembering is just as important as the doing i wouldnt disagree only i wish you couldve come what did you do today work im afraid barbara gestured at the table where her notebook lay next to it sat the mailing list and the catalogues from quiver me timbers im still at it then i mustnt stay she retreated towards the door its okay barbara said hastily she realised how much shed been longing for company i didnt mean dad said i could only visit for five minutes he wanted me to go straight to bed but i asked if i could bring you your souvenir and he said five minutes khushi thats what he calls you right i know he was ever so nice to take me to the sea wasnt he barbara the nicest there is so i must listen when he says five minutes khushi its a way of saying thankyou to him ah okay then youd better scoot but you do like the heart better than anything in the world barbara said once the child had left barbara approached the table she walked carefully as if the heart were a diffident creature who might be frightened away by sudden movement with her eyes on the red velvet and the lace she felt for her shoulder bag rooted out her cigarettes and set a match to one she smoked moodily and she studied the heart a frog wont do for our friend little khushi never had nine words seemed so portentous chapter hanken treated the black leather jacket with something akin to reverence he donned latex gloves before handling the bag into which lynley had deposited the garment and when he laid the jacket onto one of the tables in the empty dining room of the black angel hotel he did it with the sort of ecclesiolatry that was generally reserved for religious services lynley had phoned his colleague shortly after his futile interview with the black angels employees hanken had taken the phone call at dinner and vowed that hed be in tideswell within the half hour he was as good as his word now he bent over the leather jacket and examined the hole in the back of it freshlooking he noted to lynley who stood across the table from him and watched the other di scrutinise each millimeter of the perforations circumference of course they wouldnt know for certain until the jacket was placed under a microscope hanken continued but the hole appeared recent because of the condition of the surrounding leather and wasnt it going to be a treat if forensic came up with even a microscopic amount of cedar right on the edge of that hole once we have a match on that blood with terry coles any more cedar is academic isnt it lynley pointed out weve got the sliver from the wound after all we have hanken said but i like my cake with icing he bagged the jacket after examining its bloodsoaked lining thisll do to get us a warrant thomas thisll do a flaming treat to get us a warrant itll make things easier lynley agreed and the fact that he allows the manor to be used for tournaments and the like ought to be enough to allow us to hang on im not talking about a warrant to shovel through the brittons territory thishanken lifted the baggives us another nail to pound into maidens coffin i dont see how and then when he saw that hanken would expatiate on his reasons for seeking a warrant to search maiden hall lynley said quickly hear me out for a moment do you agree that a long bows probably our third weapon when i compare that suggestion to the hole in this jacket i do hanken said whatre you getting at im getting at the fact that we already know of a location where long bows have probably been used broughton manors been the site for tournaments hasnt it for reenactments and fetes from what youve told me that being the case and julian being the man who hoped to marry a woman whoas we knowbetrayed him in derbyshire alone with two other men why would we want to search maiden hall because the dead girls dad was the man who threatened her in london hanken countered because he was shouting that hed see her dead before hed let her do what she wanted to do because he took out a bloody bank loan to bribe her into living the way he wanted her to live and she pocketed that money played the game by his rules for three short months and then said right well thanks mounds for the corn its been great fun dad but im off to london to squeeze blokes bollocks in a cylinder for a living hope you understand and he didnt understand that is what dad would lynley said peter i know it looks bad for andy any way you rotate the roast on the spit it looks bad for andy but when i asked the hotel employees if any of them knew the brittons the answer was yes frankly it was more than yes it was we know the brittons by sight now why would that be lynley didnt wait for hanken to respond because they come here because they drink in the bar because they eat in the dining room and its easy enough for them to do that because tideswells practically on a direct route between broughton manor and calder moor and you cant go charging off to search maiden hall without stopping to consider what all of that means hanken kept his gaze fixed on lynley as he spoke when lynley had finished his polemic he said come with me lad and led his colleague to the reception counter of the hotel where he asked for a map of the white peak he took lynley through to the bar and opened this map on a table top in the corner lynley wasnt mistaken he acknowledged tideswell sat on the east edge of calder moor a decent hiker with murder in mind could start out from the black angel hotel climb to the top of the town and set off across the moor to nine sisters henge it would take a few hours considering the size of the moor and it wouldnt be as efficient as simply following the route the girl herself had taken from the site just beyond the hamlet of sparrowpit but it could be done on the other hand that same killer could arguably have accomplished everything by car parking in the same spot where nicola had left her saab behind the stone wall and after the killings returning home by way not only of the black angel hotel but also by way of the hamlet of peak forest near which he got rid of the knife exactly lynley said thats my point exactly so you do see but hanken argued if his colleague would take a closer look at the map he would see that the same short detour of less than two miles that their killer would have taken to drop the leather jacket at the black angel and then proceed homeward to the south towards bakewell and broughton manor was the identical short detour of less than two miles that their killer would have taken to drop the leather jacket at the black angel and then proceed homeward to the north to padley gorge and maiden hall lynley followed the two routes that hanken indicated he had to admit that the other di had a point he could see how their killerhaving left the murder site having driven through peak forest to dump the knife in the grit dispenser having detoured briefly to tideswell to place the jacket where it would hang unnoticedcould then have driven onwards to the junction that marked wardlow mires from there one road led towards padley gorge and the other towards bakewell and when means and opportunity aligned for two suspects in an investigation the police were bound by everything from logic to ethics to look first at the stronger suspect so a search of maiden hall was called for the event would be hell for andy and his wife but lynley had to conclude that it was an unavoidable hell still a remnant of the old loyalty he felt towards andy prompted him to ask hanken for a single assurance the maidens wouldnt be told of course what it was that the police were looking for in their search of maiden hall it stood to reason therefore that there was no need to make any further discussion of nicolas london life part of that inspection youre only postponing the inevitable thomas unless nan maidens dead before we make an arrest and go to trial shes eventually going to know the worst about the girl evenand i dont believe this but ill give it to you for the momenteven if dad didnt chop her if britton did the business on her hanken made an aimless gesture with his hand the worst will still out lynley finished silently he knew that but if he couldnt save his former colleague from the humiliation of a formal search of his home and his business at least he could spare him for the moment the added grief of having to be witness to the suffering of the only person left in his world well set it for tomorrow hanken said folding the map and taking up the bag with its incriminating contents ill take this to the lab you get some sleep it was hardly a directive hed be able to comply with lynley thought in london lynleys wife also slept fitfully and awakened in a thoughtful mood on the following morning sleeping fitfully was an anomaly for helen generally she sank into something resembling unconsciousness shortly after her head touched her pillow and she remained in that condition until morning thus helen found the fact of having slept poorly a sure indication that something was vexing her and she didnt have to excavate very far into her psyche to uncover what that something was tommys reactions to and dealings with barbara havers had been for the last few days like a very small splinter festering beneath the surface of helens skin something that she didnt necessarily have to confront in her normal routine but something that was both troubling and painful when brought to her awareness and brought to her awareness it had beenin neon lights actuallyduring her husbands final confrontation with barbara helen understood tommys position hed given barbara a series of directives and barbara had been less than cooperative in carrying them out tommy had seen this as an acid test which his former partner had failed barbara had seen this as an unfair punishment neither of them wished to acknowledge the others point of view and barbara was the one who stood upon the less solid ground when it came to arguing her perspective so helen found no difficulty in admitting that tommys ultimate reaction to barbaras defiance of his orders was justified and she knew his superior officers would agree with the action hed taken but that same action when considered in conjunction with his earlier decision to work with winston nkata and not barbara havers was what bothered helen what she wondered as she rose from her bed and donned her dressing gown was really at the heart of her husbands animus towards barbara the fact that she had defied him or the fact that she was a woman whod defied him of course helen had asked him a variation on this very question prior to his departure on the previous day and unsurprisingly hed hotly denied that gender had anything to do with how he was reacting towards barbara but didnt tommys entire history give the he to any denial he might make helen wondered she washed her face ran a brush through her hair and thought about the question tommy had a past that was littered with women women hed wanted women hed had women with whom hed worked his very first lover had been a school friends mother with whom hed carried on a tumultuous affair for more than a year and prior to his relationship with helen his most passionate attachment of the heart had been to the woman who was now the wife of his closest friend aside from that latter connection all tommys associations with women had one characteristic in common as far as helen could see it was tommy who directed the course of the action the women cooperatively went along for the ride this exercise of command was simple for him to gain and maintain myriad women over the years had been so taken by his looks his title or his wealth that giving over to him not only their bodies but also their minds had seemed of little consequence in comparison with what they hoped theyd be getting in return and tommy had become used to this power what human being wouldnt the real question was why hed grasped the power that very first time with that very first woman hed been young it was true but although he could have chosen to meet that lover and every lover that followed her on a playing field that he himself made level despite the womans reluctance or inability to insist upon that leveling he had not done so and helen was certain that the why of tommys sway over women was behind his difficulties with barbara havers but barbara was wrong helen could hear her husband insisting and theres no damn way you can twist the facts to make them read that she was right helen couldnt disagree with tommy on that but she wanted to tell him that barbara havers was only a symptom the disease she was certain was something else she left the bedroom and descended to the dining room where denton had assembled the breakfast she preferred she helped herself to eggs and mushrooms poured a glass of juice and a cup of coffee and set everything on the dining table where her mornings copy of the daily mail lay next to her cutlery and tommys times lay just beneath it she flipped through the morning post idly as she added milk and sugar to her coffee she set the bills to one sideno reason to spoil her breakfast she thoughtand she also set aside the daily mail upon whose front page the latest decidedly unattractive royal paramour was being acclaimed as looking radiant at the annual children in need tea no reason helen thought grimly to spoil her entire day as well she was just opening a letter from her eldest sisterits postmark from positano telling her that daphne had prevailed over her husband in terms of where to spend their twentieth wedding anniversarywhen denton came into the room good morning charlie helen said to him cheerfully youve excelled with the mushrooms today denton didnt return her greeting with similar enthusiasm he said lady helen and hesitatedor so it seemed to helensomewhere between confusion and chagrin i hope youre not going to scold me about that wallpaper charlie i phoned peter jones and asked for another day truly i did denton said no its not the wallpaper and he lifted the manila envelope he was holding bringing it level with his chest helen set down her toast what is it then you look so how did he actually look she asked herself he looked quite agitated she concluded she said has something happened youve not received bad news have you your familys well arent they oh lord charlie have you got yourself into trouble with a woman he shook his head helen saw that a duster hung over his arm and the pieces fell into place hed been doing a spot of cleaning up she realised and no doubt he wished to lecture her on the messier of her habits poor man he couldnt decide how best to begin hed come from the direction of the drawing room and helen recalled that she hadnt picked up those sheets of music that barbara had left upon her abrupt departure on the previous afternoon denton wouldnt like that helen thought he was so like tommy in his neatness youve caught me out she confessed with a nod at the envelope barbara brought that yesterday for tommy to look at im afraid i forgot all about it charlie will you believe me if i promise to do better next time hmm i suppose not im promising that constantly arent i where did you get this lady helen this i mean this and denton gestured with the envelope as if he had no words to describe what it contained ive just told you barbara havers brought it why is it important as an answer charlie denton did the unexpected for the first time since helen had known the man he drew a chair out from beneath the dining table and completely unbidden he sat the blood matches was hankens terse announcement to lynley he was phoning from buxton where hed just got the word from the forensic lab the jackets the boys hanken went on to tell him that they were moments away from getting a warrant to search maiden hall ive six blokes who can find diamonds in dog shit if hes stashed the long bow there well find it hanken groused about the fact that andy maiden had had more than enough time since the night of the murders to rid himself of the bow in three dozen locations round the white peak which made their job of finding it doubly difficult but at least he didnt know theyd twigged that an arrow was the missing weapon which gave them the advantage of surprise if he hadnt rid himself of the rest of his equipment we dont have the slightest indication that andy maidens an archer lynley pointed out how many parts did he play undercover was hankens riposte he rang off with youre in if you want to be meet us at the hall in ninety minutes heavy of heart lynley hung up the phone hanken was right in his pursuit of andy when virtually every piece of information that was gathered led to one particular suspect you proceeded with that suspect you didnt avoid thinking the unthinkable because you couldnt disengage your mind from a memory of your twentyfifth year and an undercover operation that you had so longed to be a part of you did what you had to do as a professional yet even though lynley knew that di hanken was following procedures as they were meant to be followed in his search of maiden hall he still found himself thrashing round in the quagmire of evidence facts and conjectures seeking something that would vindicate andy it was he stubbornly continued to believe the least he could do there appeared to be only one usable fact that nicolas rain gear had been missing from among her belongings at nine sisters henge alone in his room with the morning sounds of the hotel rising round him lynley considered nothing but that waterproof and what its absence from the murder scene meant theyd originally thought that the killer had taken the waterproof and worn it to cover his bloodstained clothes but if he had called at the black angel hotel on tuesday after the murder he would hardly have done so wearing rain gear on a fine summers night he wouldnt have been willing to run the risk of standing out and there wasnt much that would have been more conspicuous than a man walking round in rain gear in the midst of derbyshires long spell of perfect weather to make certain however lynley rang down to the black angels proprietor a single questionshouted round the ground floor from one employee to anotherwas sufficient for lynley to be assured that nothing like that had been played out at the hotel on any night in recent memory what then had become of the waterproof lynley began to pace the room he reflected on the moor the murders and the weapons and he dwelt upon the mental image hed constructed of how the crimes had been carried out if the killer had taken the garment from the scene but had not worn it from the scene there seemed to be only two possibilities for its use to him either the waterproof had been fashioned into a sort of carrier for transporting something from the henge when the killer left or it had been used in some way by the killer during the commission of the crime lynley dismissed the first prospect as unlikely the two victims had gone to the henge on foot what could they have carried in with them that would require something the size of a waterproof to transport out he went on to the second possibility and when he lined up all he knew about the killings what hed assumed about the killings and what hed discovered at the black angel hotel he finally saw the answer the killer had incapacitated the boy with an arrow hed then gone after the fleeing girl and dispatched her without much trouble returning to the henge hed seen that the boys wound was serious but not mortal hed cast about for a quick way of doing him in he could have stood the boy upfiringsquad fashionand made of him a modern st sebastian but the boy would hardly have cooperated in that plan so the killer had torn through the equipment at the site and found the knife and the rain gear hed put on the waterproof to protect his clothes while he was knifing the boy thus he could enter the black angel hotel with impunity later a bloodstained waterproof couldnt be left hanging with the black leather jacket however the blood on the jacket had soaked into its lining where it was camouflaged by the materials colour so the jacket might have taken months to be noticed but a bloodstained waterproof would not be so easily overlooked yet the killer had to get rid of it and sooner rather than later so where lynley continued to pace as he pictured that night the killings and their aftermath the knife had been left along the killers escape route it was easy enough to bury in a few inches of grit in a roadside container a process that would probably have taken no more than thirty seconds but the waterproof couldnt be buried there because there wasnt enough grit to do the job and besides that on a public road even at night it would have been sheer idiocy to stop for the length of time it would have taken to bury something so bulky in a roadside container yet something very like a roadside container would have worked well as a depository for a garment something that had an everyday use something that one saw without thinking about and something on the way to the hotel wherethe killer knewa black leather jacket could be stowed in plain sight with no one the wiser for ages a pillar box lynley wondered but he dismissed the possibility almost as soon as he considered it aside from the fact that the killer wouldnt have wanted to go to the effort of cramming the waterproof inch by inch into the slot for letters the post was collected every day someones rubbish bin but there again he encountered virtually the same problem unless the killer managed to bury it at the bottom of someones dustbin the first time the bins owner wished to discard a bag of rubbish the waterproof would be found unless of course the killer managed to find a bin that was constructed in such a way that rubbish already within it couldnt be seen when someone deposited more a bin in a public park might have worked for this one where refuse was shoved through an opening in the cover or the side but where on the route from calder moor to tideswell did such a park with such a container exist thats what he needed to find out lynley descended the stairs and got from reception the same map of the white peak that hanken had used on the previous evening upon examining the area the closest lynley could come to a public park was a nature reserve near hargatewall he frowned when he saw how far off the direct route it was it would have taken the killer a number of miles out of his way but it was worth a try the morning outside was much like the previous day grey windy and rainy but unlike the previous day when lynley had arrived the black angels car park was virtually deserted since it was far too early for even the most inebriated of the hotels regular patrons to be bellying up to the bar so with his umbrella raised and the collar of his waxed jacket turned up lynley dodged puddles and hurried round the side of the building to the only spot that hed been able to find for the bentley on the previous afternoon which was when he finally saw what hed seen without acknowledging upon his arrival the spot hed found for the bentley had been vacant yesterday because it would always be the last spot chosen to park ones car no one with half a care for his cars paint job would park it right next to an overloaded skip that was even now in the wind and the rain erupting with refuse of course lynley thought as the grinding of gears behind him spoke of a lorrys approach as it was he made it to the skip just a stride ahead of the local dustmen whod arrived to pick up the black angels weeks worth of rubbish samantha heard the noise before she saw her uncle the sound of bottles clinking together echoed on the old stone stairway as jeremy britton descended to the kitchen where samantha was doing the washing up from breakfast she glanced at her watch which shed set on a shelf near the kitchens deep sink even by uncle jeremys standards it seemed too early in the day to be drinking she scoured the frying pan in which shed cooked the mornings bacon and she tried to ignore her uncles presence footsteps shuffled behind her the bottles continued to clank when she could no longer avoid doing so samantha glanced round to see what her uncle was doing jeremy had a large basket crooked over his arm into this hed deposited perhaps a dozen bottles of spirits they were mostly gin he began going through the dole cupboards that they used for storage in the kitchen rustling through their contents to pull out more bottles these were miniatures and he took them from the flour bin from the containers of rice and spaghetti and dried beans from among the assorted tins of fruit from deep within the storage space for pots and pans as the collection grew in the basket on his arm uncle jeremy clanked and rattled round the kitchen like the ghost of christmas past he murmured going to do it this time samantha put the final pot on the drying rack and pulled the plug on the water in the sink she dried her hands on the front of her apron and watched her uncle looked older than he had done since shed been in derbyshire and the tremors that were jerking his body didnt help the overall impression he gave of serious illness in the offing she said uncle jeremy are you ill whats wrong coming off it he replied its the bloody devil gives you temptation then sends you to hell hed begun to perspire and in the kitchens meagre light his skin looked like a lemon coated with oil with unsteady hands he eased the loaded basket onto the draining board he clutched at the first of the bottles bombay sapphire his one true love he unscrewed the top and upended the bottle into the sink the smell of gin rose up like leaking gas when the bottle was empty jeremy broke it against the lip of the sink no more he said through with this poison i swear no more then he began to cry he cried with dry hard sobs that shook his body worse than the absence of alcohol in his veins he said so scared i cant do it alone samanthas heart went out to him oh uncle jeremy here let me help ill hold the basket shall i or shall i open the bottles for you she took one outbeefeaters this timeand offered it to her uncle itll kill me he cried s what its doing already look at me and he held up his hands to show her what shed already seen their terrible shaking he grabbed the beefeaters and broke the bottle against the lip of the sink without emptying it first gin splashed on both of them he grabbed another rotten he wept miserable sot drove three of em off but that wasnt enough no no hell not be content till the last ones gone samantha sorted through this his wife and the britton children she decided julians sister brother and mother had fled the manor ages ago but she couldnt believe that julian would ever desert his father she said julian loves you uncle jeremy he wont leave you he wants the best for you you must see thats why hes been working so hard to bring the manor back as jeremy dumped another half litre of gin into the sink hes a wonderful boy always was and i wont i wont no longer and another bottles contents joined the others s working so hard to make this place something and all the while his sot of a dads drinking everything away but no more the kitchen sink was rapidly filling with glass but that didnt matter to samantha she could see that her uncle was in the throes of a conversion so important that one or two kilos of broken glass were of small account in comparison she said are you giving up drinking uncle jeremy are you seriously giving up drinking she had her doubts about his sincerity yet bottle after bottle went the way of the first when jeremy was finished with the lot of them he leaned over the sink and began to pray with an earnestness that samantha could feel in her bones he swore on the lives of his children and his future grandchildren that he would not take another drop of drink he would not he said be an advertisement for the evils of lifelong inebriation he would walk away from the bottle here and now and he would never look back he owed that much if not to himself then to the son whose love had kept him here in the rotting family home when he could have gone elsewhere and lived a decent wholesome normal life hadnt been for me hed be married now wife kids a life an i took that from him i did it me uncle jeremy you mustnt think that julie loves you he knows how important broughton manor is to you at the end of the day and he wants to make it a home again and anyway hes not even thirty yet hes got years and years to have a family lifes passing him by jeremy said an itll go right by him while he struggles at home an hell hate me for that when he wakes up and sees it but this is life samantha placed a comforting hand on her uncles shoulder what were doing here at the manor every day this is life uncle jeremy he straightened from the sink reaching in his pocket as he did so bringing out a neatly folded handkerchief and honking into it before he turned to her poor man she thought when had he last wept and why were men so embarrassed when they finally broke with the force of a reasonable emotion want to be part of it again he said part of it life i want life sammy thishe made a gesture towards the sinkthis runs away from everything living i say enough odd samantha thought he suddenly sounded so strong as if nothing stood between him and his hope for sobriety and just as suddenly she wanted that for him the life he imagined for himself happy in his home occupied and surrounded by his darling grandchildren she could even see them those lovely grandchildren still unconceived she said im so glad uncle jeremy im so terribly terribly glad and julian juliell be so delighted hell want to help you i know he will jeremy nodded his gaze fixed on her you think he said hesitantly after all these years with me like this i know hell help she said i just know it jeremy straightened his clothes he blew his nose noisily once again and folded his handkerchief back into his pocket he said y love him dont you girl samantha shuffled her feet youre not like the other youd do anything for him i would samantha said yes i would when lynley arrived in padley gorge the search of maiden hall was in full swing hanken had brought six constables with him and hed deployed them economically as well as thoroughly three of them were searching the familys floor the residents floor and the ground floor of the hall proper one was searching the outbuildings on the property two others were searching the grounds hanken himself was coordinating the effort and when lynley pulled to a stop in the car park he found his fellow di smoking moodily beneath an umbrella near a panda car as the familyfloor constable made his report get out with the others on the grounds then hanken was instructing him if theres been any digging round here i want you lot on it like hounds down a foxhole understand and mind you dig up that new road sign at the bottom of the drive the constable trotted off in the direction of the slope that fell away towards the road there lynley could see two other policemen pacing along evenly beneath the trees in the rain nothing so far hanken told lynley but its here somewhere or something related to it is and well find it ive got the waterproof lynley said hanken raised an eyebrow and tossed his cigarette onto the ground have you indeed thats good work thomas whered you find it lynley told him about the thought process that had led him to the skip under a weeks worth of rubbish from the hotel hed found the rain gear by relying upon a pitchfork and the patience of the dustmen whod arrived just behind him to collect the skips contents you dont much look like youve been doing some skiptrolling hanken told him i showered and changed lynley admitted the rubbish in the skippiled up on the waterproof for nearly a weekhad ultimately protected it from the rain which might have otherwise washed away any evidence left upon it as it was the plastic garment hadnt been touched by anything other than coffee grounds vegetable peelings plate scrapings old newspapers and crumpled tissues and since it had been turned inside out anyway even these had only smeared its insides giving it the appearance of a discarded tarpaulin its exterior had been largely untouched so the blood splatters on it remained as they had been on the previous tuesday night mute witnesses to what had occurred inside nine sisters henge lynley had bundled the waterproof into a supermarket carrier bag it was he said in the boot of the bentley lets have it then first lynley said with a nod at the hall are the maidens here we dont need an id on the rain gear if its got the kids blood on it thomas i wasnt asking professionally how are they taking the search maiden claims hes found some bloke in london who can do a lie detector on him runs a business called polygraph professionals or something like that if hes willing bollocks hanken cut in irritably you know that polygraphs are worth sod all so does maiden but they make one hell of a delaying tactic dont they please dont arrest me ive got a polygraph organised bugger that for a lark lets have the waterproof lynley handed it over it was turned inside out as it had been upon his discovery of it but one of its edges was exposed where the blood made a purple deposit in the shape of a leaf ah hanken said when he saw it yes well get this over to forensic then but id say everythings over bar the shouting lynley didnt feel so certain but why he wondered was it because he couldnt believe andy maiden had killed his daughter or was it because the facts truly led elsewhere it looks deserted he said with a nod at the hall due to the rain hanken told him theyre inside though the lot of them most of the guestsre gone it being monday but the maidens are here as are the employees except for the chef he generally doesnt show up till after two they said have you spoken to them the maidens hanken appeared to read the underlying meaning because he said i havent told the wife thomas and then transferred the waterproof to the front seat of the panda car fryer he shouted in the direction of the slope the familyfloor constable looked up then came at a trot when hanken gestured him over the lab he said with a jerk of his head towards the car drive that bag over for a workup on the blood see if you can get the job done by a girl called kubowsky she doesnt let grass grow and were in a hurry the constable looked happy enough to be out of the rain he removed his limecoloured windcheater and hopped into the car in less than ten seconds he was gone exercise in going through the motions hanken said the bloods the boys doubtless lynley agreed still he looked towards the hall dyou mind if i have a word with andy hanken eyed him cant accept it can you i cant get away from the fact that hes a cop hes a human being governed by the same passions as the rest of us hanken said mercifully lynley thought he didnt add the rest andy maiden was better than most people at doing something about those passions instead hanken said mind you remember that and strode off in the direction of the outbuildings lynley found andy and his wife in the lounge in the same alcove where he and hanken had first spoken to them they werent together this time however rather they sat silent on the opposing sofas they were in identical positions leaning forward with their arms resting just above their knees andy was rubbing his hands together his wife was watching him lynley obliterated from his mind the shakespearean image that was invoked by andys attention to his hands he said his former colleagues name andy looked up whatre they looking for he asked lynley didnt miss the pronoun or its implication of a distinction between himself and the local police he said how are you both doing how do you expect were doing its not enough that nicolas been taken from us but now you come and tear apart our home and our business without having the decency to tell us why just waving a filthy piece of paper from a magistrate and barging inside like a group of hooligans with nan maidens anger threatened to give way to tears she clenched her hands in her lap and in a movement not unlike her husbands she beat them together as if this would allow her to maintain a poise shed already lost maiden said tommy lynley gave him what he could weve found her waterproof where theres blood on it the boys most likely we assume the killer wore it to protect his clothes there may be other evidence on it hed have pulled it on over his hair are you asking me for a sample you might want to arrange for a solicitor you cant think he did this nan maiden cried do you think i need a solicitor maiden asked lynley and both of them knew what he was really asking how well do you know me thomas and do you believe i am as i appear to be lynley couldnt reply in the way maiden wanted instead he said why did you ask for me specifically when you phoned the yard why did you ask for me because of your strengths maiden replied among which was always honour first i knew that i could depend on that youd do the right thing and if it came down to it youd keep your word they exchanged a long look lynley knew its meaning but he couldnt risk being played for a fool he said were approaching the end andy keeping my word or not isnt going to make a difference then a solicitors called for i dont need one of course you dont need one his wife agreed quietly having taken some strength it seemed from her husbands sense of calm youve done nothing you dont need a solicitor when youve nothing to hide andys gaze dropped back to his hands he went back to massaging them lynley left the lounge for the next hour the search of maiden hall and its environs continued but at the end of it the five remaining constables had come up with nothing that resembled a long bow the remains of a long bow or any item related to archery hanken stood in the rain with the wind whipping his mac round his legs he smoked and brooded studying maiden hall as if its limestone exterior were hiding the bow in plain sight his search team waited for further instructions their shoulders hunched their hair flattened against their skulls and their eyelashes spiked by the rain lynley felt vindicated by hankens lack of success if the other di was going to suggest that andy maiden as their killer had removed every last bit of evidence related to archery from his homewithout knowing theyd connected one of the two killings to archery in the first placehe was prepared to do battle on that front no killer thought of everything even if that killer was a cop he was going to make a mistake and that mistake would hang him eventually lynley said lets go on to broughton manor peter weve got the team and it wont take long to get a second warrant hanken roused himself he said get back to the station to his men and then to lynley when the constables had departed i want that report from so the one your man in london put together you cant still be thinking that this is a revenge killing at least not one thats connected with andys past i dont think that hanken said but our boywithapast might have used that past in a way weve not considered yet how to find someone willing to do a nasty spot of work for him come along inspector ive a mind to have a look through the records at your black angel hotel chapter although theyd been thorough the police had also been moderately gentle in their treatment of the maidens personal belongings and the halls furnishings andy maiden had seen far worse searches in his time and he tried to take comfort from the fact that his brother policemen hadnt decimated his dwelling in their search still the hall had to be put back into order again when the police had left andy his wife and their staff each took a separate section to straighten andy was relieved that nan had agreed to this reasonable plan of action it kept her away from him for a while he hated himself for wanting to be away from her he knew she needed him but with the departure of the police andy found himself desperate for solitude he had to think he knew he wouldnt be able to do so with nan hanging over him displacing her grief by locking her mind on the fruitless endeavour of caring for him he didnt want his wifes care right now things had progressed too far for that the wheel of nicolas death was coming closer and closer to breaking them both andy realised he could protect nan from it while the investigation was ongoing but he didnt know how he could continue to do so once the police made an arrest that they were getting closer to doing just that had been made only too evident by his brief conversation with lynley and in tommys suggestion that andy ask for his solicitors help there was fair indication of exactly what the detectives next move would be tommy was a good man andy thought but there was only so much you could ask of a good man when that good mans limit was reached you had to place your confidence in yourself this was a principle that nicola had seen blended with her insatiable desire to be gratifiednowwhenever she had an inclination towards something her reliance on herself before others had led her down the path shed taken andy had long known that his daughters ambition in life was simply expressed never to go without shed seen the economies her parents had employed both to save towards the purchase of a country home and to channel funds to andys father whose pension didnt cover his profligate ways and more than once especially when met with her parents refusal to accede to one of her demands shed announced that she would never find herself in a position of having to scrimp and save and deny herself lifes simple pleasures eschewing them for such barren activities as repairing sheets and pillowcases turning collars on shirts and darning socks youd better not end up like granddad dad shed said to andy on more than one occasion cause i plan to spend all my money on me yet it really wasnt avarice that dominated her behaviour rather it seemed to be a profound vacuity at the heart of her that she sought to fill with material possessions how often hed tried to explain to her mankinds essential dilemma we are born of parents and into families so we have connections but were ultimately alone our primitive sense of isolation creates a void within us that void can be filled only through the nurturing of spirit yes but i want that motorbike shed respond as if he hadnt just attempted to explain to her why the acquisition of a motorbike would not soothe a spirit whose singular needs were restless for acknowledgement or that guitar shed reply or that set of gold earrings that trip to spain that flashy car and if theres money enough to buy it i dont see why we shouldnt whats spirit got to do with whether one has the money to buy a motorbike dad even if i wanted to i cant spend money on my spirit can i so what am i supposed to do with money if ive ever got it throw it away and shed list those individuals whose achievements or position garnered them vast reserves of cash the royal family erstwhile rock stars business magnates and entrepreneurs theyve got houses and cars and boats and planes dad she would say and theyre never alone either and they dont look like theyve got some big hollow in the pit of their stomachs if you ask me nicola was a persuasive supplicant when she wanted something and nothing he could say was sufficient to make her see that she was merely observing the exterior lives of these people whose possessions she so admired who they were insideand what they feltwas something that no one but them could know and when she acquired what she had begged to possess she wasnt able to see that it satisfied her only briefly her vision was occluded from this knowledge because what stood in the way was always the desire for the next object that she believed would soothe her soul and all of thiswhich would have made any child difficult to rearwas combined with nicolas natural propensity for living life on the edge shed learned that from him from watching him shift from persona to persona over the years of undercover work and from listening to the tales told by his colleagues over family dinners when theyd all drunk too much wine andy and his wife had kept from their daughter the other side of those acts of bravado that so regaled her she never knew the personal price her father paid as his health crumbled beneath his minds inability to divide itself into separate arenas serving who he was and who his work forced him to pretend to be she was supposed to see her dad as strong complete and indomitable anything else would shake her foundations they assumed thus it was natural that nicola had thought nothing of it when it came to telling him the truth about her future plans shed phoned and asked him if he would come to london lets have a chickanddad date shed said delighted to think that his beautiful daughter would want to spend special time with him hed gone to london theyd have their datewhatever she wanted to do he told herand hed cart some of her belongings back to derbyshire for her summers employment it was when hed looked round her neat bedsit and rubbed his hands together and asked what she wanted him to load into the landrover that she told him the truth she began with ive changed my mind about working for will ive had another think about law as well thats what i wanted to talk to you about dad althoughwith a smile and god how lovely she was when she smiledour date was wonderful ive never been to the planetarium before she made them tea sat him down with a plate of sandwiches that she took from a marks spencer container and said did you ever get into the bondage scene when you were undercover dad hed thought at first that they were making polite conversation an ageing fathers reminiscences prompted by his daughters fond questions he hadnt done much ins m he told her that would have been handled by another division at the yard oh hed had to go into the s c m clubs and shops a few times and there was that party where an idiotic bloke dressed as a schoolgirl was being whipped on a cross but that had been the extent of it and thank god for that because there were some things in life that left one feeling too filthy for a simple bath to cure and sadomasochism was at the top of his list its just a lifestyle dad nicola told him reaching for a ham sandwich and chewing it thoughtfully after all youve seen im surprised youd condemn it its a sickness he said to his daughter those people have problems theyre afraid to face perversion looks like the answer while all the while its only part of what ails them so you think nicola reminded him gently the reality could be something different though couldnt it an aberration to you might be perfectly normal to someone else in fact you might be the aberration in their eyes he supposed this was the case he admitted but wasnt normality determined by the numbers wasnt that what the word norm meant in the first place wasnt the norm decided by what the most people did that would make cannibalism normal dad among cannibals among cannibals i suppose it is and if a group among the cannibals decides it doesnt like eating human flesh are they abnormal or can we say they have tastes that might have undergone a change and if someone from our society goes out and joins the cannibals and discovers he has a taste for human flesh that he wasnt aware he had is he abnormal and to whom andy had smiled at that hed said youre going to make a very fine lawyer and that comment had led them to hell as to that dad shed begun as to the law shed started with her decision not to work for will upman to remain for the summer in london instead hed thought at first that she meant shed found a placement more to her liking with a firm in town perhaps hed thought hopefully shes got herself established at one of the inns of court that wasnt where he dreamed shed end up but he wasnt blind to the compliment such a position paid to his daughter hed said im disappointed of course your mum will be as well but we always looked at will as a fallback if nothing better turned up what has she told him he thought at first that she was joking although nicola had never been a child to joke when it came to what she wanted to do in fact shed always stated her intentions exactly as she stated them that day in islington heres the plan heres why heres the intended result i thought you ought to know shed concluded you have a right since you were paying for law college and ill pay you back for that by the way again that smile that sweet and infuriating nicola smile which had always partnered whatever she announced as a fait accompli im running away shed tell her parents when theyd refused an unreasonable request i wont be here after school today in fact im not going to school at all dont expect me for dinner or for breakfast tomorrow im running away i should have the money to pay you before the end of summer i would have had it already but we had to buy supplies and they cost quite a lot would you like to see them by the way hed continued to believe it was some sort of joke even when shed brought out her equipment and explained the use of each obscene item the leather whips the braces studded with small chrome nails the masks and manacles the shackles and collars you see dad some people just cant get it off unless theres pain or humiliation involved she told her father as if he hadnt spent years exposed to just about every kind of human aberration they want the sexwell thats natural isnt it i mean dont we all want itbut unless its connected to something degrading or painful they either dont get satisfaction from it or they cant even do it in the first place and then there are others who seem to feel the need to atone for something its like theyve committed a sin and if they take their medicine like theyre supposed tosix of the best to naughty little boys and all thattheyre happy theyre forgiven and they get on with their business they go home to the wife and kiddies and they feel well they feel i suppose it sounds awfully odd to say it but they seem to feel refreshed she appeared to read something on her fathers face then that creased her own because she reached across the table at which they sat and earnestly covered andys clenched fist with her hand dad im always the dom you do know that dont you i wouldnt ever let someone do to me what i do to well im just not interested i do it because the moneys fabulous its just beyond belief and while im young and nicelooking and strong enough to do eight or nine sessions a day she smiled an impish smile as she reached for the final object to show him the pony tails the most ridiculous actually you cant imagine how silly a seventyyearold bloke looks when hes got this thing hanging out of his well you know say it hed said to her finding his voice at last shed looked at him blankly the black plastic plug with its black leather streamers dangling from her lovely slender hand what the word hanging from his what if you cant say it how can you do it oh that well i only dont say it because youre my dad and that admission had shattered something within him some last vestige of control and an outdated restraint born of lifelong repression arsehole hed shouted it hangs from his god damn arsehole nick and he swept from the dining table all the devices of torture that shed assembled for him to see nicola realisedfinallythat shed pushed him too far she backed away from him as he let his rage incomprehension and despair take whatever form they chose he upended furniture broke crockery and ripped her legal books from their bindings hed seen the fear in her and hed thought of the times that he could have inspired it in the past and had chosen not to and that enraged him further until the roaring destruction he visited upon her bedsit reduced his daughter to a cowering heap of the silk suede and linen that comprised her clothing she huddled in the corner with her arms over her head and that wasnt enough for him he hurled her filthy equipment at her and bellowed ill see you dead before i let you do it it was only later when he had time to think in the way that nicola thought that he realised there was another route to dissuading his daughter from her newly chosen vocation there was the route of will upman and the possibility that he would do to her what he had the reputation for doing to so many other women so hed phoned her two days after his london visit and hed offered her the deal and nicola seeing that she could make more money in derbyshire than in london was willing to compromise hed bought time he thought and they didnt discuss what had occurred between them that day in islington for nancys sake andy had spent the summer trying to pretend that everything would work out well in the end should nick return to the college of law in the autumn in fact hed have been willing to go to his death acting as if islington had never happened at all dont tell your mother any of this hed said to his daughter when they made their arrangements but dad mummy no god damn it nick im not going to argue i want your word to keep silent about all of this when you come home is that perfectly clear because if one whisper reaches your mother youll not have a penny from me and i mean it so give me your word she did and if there was any saving grace in the ugliness of nicks life and the horror of her death it was that nancy had been spared the knowledge of what that life had become but now that knowledge threatened to bring further destruction into andys world hed lost his daughter to degradation and defilement he wasnt about to lose his wife to the anguish and grief of learning about it he saw that there was only one way to stop the wheel of nicolas death in the midst of its cycle of destruction he knew he had the means to stop it he could only pray that at the last moment he would also have the will what did it matter that yet another life would pay the forfeit men had died for less if the cause was good so had women by monday midmorning barbara havers had increased her knowledge of archery by several degrees in the future shed be able to discuss with the best of them the merits of mylar instead of feathers for fletchings or the differences among long compound and recurve bows but as to getting any closer to pinning the william tell award on matthew kingryders jacket shed not had a breath of luck in that shed been through jason harleys mailing list shed even tracked down by telephone every name from the ust with a london address to see if kingryder was using a pseudonym but after three hours she was nowhere with the list and the cataloguewhile improving her backlog of trivia for those moments at ladeedah drinks parties when one racked ones brain for something to add to the conversationhad gained her nothing so when her phone rang and it was helen lynley on the line asking if she could come round to belgravia barbara was happy to comply helen was nothing if not scrupulous about her mealtimes and it was drawing towards lunch with nothing in the fridge but more reheatables in the rogan josh line barbara knew she could do with a change she arrived at eaton terrace within the hour helen herself answered the door she was as usual perfectly turned out in neat tan trousers and a forestgreen shirt seeing her barbara felt like a lump of mouldy cheese on the doorstep since shed called in ill to the yard shed dressed with even less care than was her norm she wore an oversize grey tshirt over black leggings and she was sockless in her red hightop trainers dont mind me im traveling incognito she said to lynleys wife helen smiled thanks for coming so quickly i would have come to you but i thought you might want to be in this part of town when weve finished finished barbara thought wonderful news then lunch was in the offing helen beckoned barbara inside calling out charlie barbara is here have you had lunch barbara well no barbara said and she addedi mean not exactly because brutal honesty strongarmed her into admitting that having toast with chicken tonight creamy garlic sauce on it for her elevenses might be considered an early lunch in some quarters ive got to go outpens coming up from cambridge sans children this afternoon and weve promised ourselves a meal in chelseabut charlie can do you a sandwich or a salad if youre feeling lightheaded ill survive barbara told her although even to herself she sounded doubtful she followed helen into the houses wellappointed drawing room where she saw that the breakfront cabinet which housed lynleys stereo system was standing open all of its various components were lit and a cds jacket lay splayed on the tuner helen beckoned barbara to sit and she took the same place shed taken on the previous afternoon before lynley had thrown her off the case she said i take it the inspector made it back to derbyshire in one piece as a conversational opener helen said im awfully sorry about the row between you two tommy is well tommys just tommy thats one way of putting it barbara admitted we have something wed like you to listen to helen said you and the inspector tommy no he knows nothing about this helen seemed to read something on barbaras face because she hastened to add rather obscurely its just that we werent certain how best to interpret what we had so i said lets phone barbara shall we we barbara said charlie and i ah here he is play it for barbara will you please charlie denton greeted barbara and passed to her what he carried into the room a tray on which sat a plate displaying a succulentlooking breast of chicken nestled in an arrangement of tricoloured pasta a glass of white wine and a roll accompanied this a linen napkin cocooned cutlery in an artistic fashion thought you might be able to do with a bite he told her i hope you like basil i consider it the answer to a young girls prayer denton grinned barbara tucked in as he went to the cabinet helen joined barbara on the sofa as denton fiddled with buttons and dials saying have a listen to this barbara did so munching dentons excellent chicken and as an orchestra began something heavy on the woodwinds she thought that there were certainly worse ways to spend an afternoon a baritone began singing barbara caught some but not all of the words to live to live to live onward or die the question lingers in the mind till mankind questions why to die to die to end the aching heart to nevermore be shocked and scored as flesh accepts its part in what it is to be a man vows made in haste afraid why not take death into my breast eternal sleep within my grave to sleep that sleep the terrors waiting there what dreams may come to men asleep who think without a care that theyve escaped the whips the scorns that time brings those who live that sleep allows a peace to grow within a man who cant forgive its nice barbara said to denton and helen its terrific in fact ive never heard it heres why helen handed over the very same manila envelope that barbara herself had brought to eaton terrace when she slid the stack of papers out barbara saw that they were the handscored music mrs baden had given her she said i dont get it look helen directed barbaras attention to the first of the sheets in very short order barbara found herself following along with what the baritone was singing she read the songs title at the top of the page what dreams may come and she took in the fact that the song had been written in his own hand with his very own signature scrawled across the top michael chandler her first reaction was a plummeting of her spirits she said damn as her theory of the motive behind the derbyshire murders was shot straight to hell so the musics already been produced that puts a serious screw in my thinking for there was certainly no point in matthew kingryders rubbing out terry cole and nicola maidennot to mention beating up vi nevinif the music he was purportedly after had already been produced he couldnt mount a brandnew production with old music he could only mount a revival and that was nothing worth killing over since the profits of a revival of anything by chandler and kingryder would be governed by the terms of his fathers will she started to flip the music onto the coffee table but helen laid a hand on her arm wait she said i dont think you understand charlie show her denton handed over two items one was the jacket of the cd that was playing the other was a souvenir theatre programme of the type that generally set one back rather considerably in the lolly department hamlet was emblazoned on both the cd and the programme and on the cd were the additional words lyrics and music by david kingryder barbara stared at this latter announcement for a number of seconds as she came to terms with everything it meant and its meaning boiled down to a single lovely fact she finally had matthew kingryders actual motive for murder hanken was adamant he wanted the black angel hotels records and he wasnt going to be pleasant to be around until he got them lynley could accompany him on the expedition or he could tackle broughton manor by himself which hanken didnt advise since hed done nothing to get a warrant to search broughton manor and he didnt think the brittons would take to their collective bosom anyone sifting through the muck and dross of a few hundred years of their family history its going to take a team of twenty to go through that place hanken said if we have to well do it but ill put money on the square that says we wont have to they had the hotel records in their possession in extremely short order while lynley phoned london to track down nkata for a fax of havers so findings hanken took the hotels registration cards through to the bar where pork with baked apples was on offer for lunch when lynley joined him with the fax of havers report the other di was dipping into the days speciality with one hand and going through the registration cards with the other a second platesteaming with a similar mealwas set opposite him a pint of lager next to it thanks lynley said handing over the report always go with the special of the day hanken advised him and nodded at the paperwork lynley was holding whatve we got lynley didnt think they had anything but he remembered three names that he had to admit even beyond his own prejudices in the matter bore looking into one of them was a former snout of maiden s two others were secondary shadowy figures whod operated at the periphery of maidens investigations but never served time at their monarchs pleasure ben venables was the snout clifford thompson and gar brick were the others on their way back to the black angel hanken had perfected a new theory maiden he said had far too much nouse to be such a fool as to kill his own daughter personally no matter how much he wanted her dead hed have hired the job out to one of the blighters from his past and hed have then misdirected the police by telling them it was a vengeance killing to keep them focused on the louts either in prison or on parole while all the others whod rubbed elbows with maiden but had no reason to revenge themselves upon him would escape police notice it was a clever ploy so hanken wanted that so report to see if any names on it matched up with anyone whod registered at the hotel you see how it could happen dont you hanken asked lynley all maiden would need to do after hiring this bloke would be to put him in the picture where the girl was camping and he knew where she was camping thomas weve seen that from the first lynley wanted to argue but he didnt andy maiden of all people would understand how risky it was to arrange a contract killing that he might have done so to rid himself of a child whose lifestyle he found intolerable was an unthinkable proposition if the man had wanted to eliminate nicola because he couldnt force her to change her ways he wouldnt have looked for someone else to do the job especially someone who might break easily under interrogation and point the finger back at him no if andy maiden had wanted to eliminate his daughter lynley knew he would have done so himself and they had sod all evidence to suggest that hed done it lynley picked at his food as hanken read the report the other di wolfed down his own meal he finished the report and the meal simultaneously and said venables thompson and brick in an impressive show of reaching the same conclusion as lynley himself had drawn but i say we check them all against the records which was what they did they took the records for the previous week and checked the names of all the hotels residents during that time against the names that were in havers report as the report covered more than twenty years of andy maidens police experience the project took some time but the end of their endeavour left them in the same position as theyd been in in the beginning no names matched it was lynley who pointed out that someone coming to kill nicola maiden would hardly have registered in a local hotel and used his own name hanken saw the reason in this but rather than use it to dismiss altogether the idea of a hired killer whod stayed at the hotel and left the jacket and waterproof behind he said obscurely of course lets get on to buxton but what about broughton manor lynley wanted to know were they going to let that slide in favour of what a chase for someone who might not exist the killer exists thomas hanken replied as he stood and ive an idea well track him down through buxton barbara looked at helen and said but whyd you phone me why not the inspector helen said thank you charlie will you see about getting those wallpaper books back to peter jones ive made my choice its marked denton nodded saying will do and took himself up the stairs after switching off the stereo and removing his cd thank god charlie loves west end extravaganzas helen said when she and barbara were alone the more i get to know him the more invaluable i find hes becoming and who would have thought it because when tommy and i married i wondered how id feel having my husbands valetor whatever charlie denton actually islurking about like a nineteenthcentury retainer but hes indispensable as youve just seen why helen barbara asked not put off by the other womans light remarks helens face softened i love him she said but hes not always right no one is he wont like your having shared this with me yes well ill deal with that as it comes helen gestured to the music what do you make of it in light of the murder and when helen nodded barbara considered all the possible answers david kingryder she recalled had killed himself on the opening night of his production of hamlet from his sons own words shed heard that kingryder had to have known that very same evening that the show was a smashing success nonetheless hed killed himself and when barbara blended this fact not only with the real authorship of the music and lyrics but also with the story that vi nevin had told her about how the music had come to be in terry coles hands she could arrive at only one conclusion someone out there had known that david kingryder had not written either the music or the lyrics to the show he was mounting under his own name that person had known because that same person had somehow got his hands on the original score and considering that the phone call intercepted by terry cole in elvaston place had been made in june when hamlet debuted it seemed reasonable to conclude that that phone call had been intended not for matthew kingryderhot to produce a show that would not be governed by the terms of his fathers willbut for david kingryder himself who was desperate to get that music back and to hide from the world the simple fact that it wasnt his work why else would kingryder have killed himself unless hed arrived at the phone box just five minutes too late to receive that call why else would he have killed himself unless he believed thatdespite having paid off a blackmailer who was supposed to phone him with directions where to pick up the packagehe was going to be blackmailed ad infinitum or worse yet he was going to be exposed to the very tabloids whod slagged him off for years of course hed kill himself barbara thought hed have had no way of knowing that terry cole received the phone call intended for him hed have had no way of knowing how to make contact with the blackmailer to see what had gone wrong so once that call hadnt come through in that phone box on elvaston place when he managed to get there hed have thought he was cooked the only question was who had blackmailed david kingryder and there was only one answer that was remotely reasonable his own son there was evidence for this if only circumstantial surely matthew kingryder had known before his fathers suicide that he stood to get nothing when david kingryder died if he was to head the kingryder fundand hed admitted as much when barbara spoke to himhe would have had to be told about the terms of his fathers will so the sole way he had to get his hands on some of his fathers money was to extort it from him barbara explained all this to helen and when she was finished lynleys wife asked but have you any evidence because without evidence her expression said the rest youre done for my friend barbara tossed the question round in her head as she finished her lunch and she found the answer in a brief review of her visit to kingryder in his baker street flat the house she said to lynleys wife helen he was moving house he said hed finally got the money together to buy himself a property south of the river but south of the river thats not exactly helen looked distinctly uncomfortable and barbara liked her for her reluctance to draw attention to lynleys considerable wealth one would need brass by the bucketful to buy even a cupboard in belgravia on the other hand south of the riverwhere the lesser mortals bought their homeswould not present such a problem kingryder could have saved enough to buy a freehold there barbara accepted that nonetheless she said theres no other explanation for what kingryders been up to lying about what happened when terry cole went to his office searching terrys flat in battersea buying one of cilia thompsons monstrosities going to vi nevins digs and trashing them hes got to put his hands on that music and hes willing to do anything to get it his dads dead and hes to blame he doesnt want the poor blokes memory shot to bits as well he wanted some of his lolly sure but he didnt want him destroyed helen considered this smoothing her fingers along the crease in her trousers i see how youre fitting it together she admitted but as to proof that hes even a blackmailer let alone a killer she looked up and opened her hands as if to say where is it barbara thought about what she had on kingryder besides what she knew about the terms of his fathers will terry had been to see him he had searched terrys flat hed gone to the studio on portslade road the cheque she said he wrote cilia thompson a cheque when he bought one of her nightmareintherailwayarches paintings all right helen said cautiously but where does that take you to jersey barbara said with a smile cilia made a copy of the chequeprobably because shes never sold a thing in her life and believe me shes going to want to remember the occasion since its never likely to happen again that cheque was drawn on a bank in st helier now why would our boy be banking in the channel islands unless he had money to hide helen like a major deposit of a few thousand quidmaybe a few hundred thousand quid bled out of his dad to keep a blackmailers mug pluggedthat he didnt want anyone asking questions about theres your evidence but still its all supposition isnt it how can you prove anything you cant get into those bank records can you so where do you go from here that was certainly a problem barbara thought she could prove nothing the police couldnt get their mitts on kingryders bank records and even if she herself could do that in some way what would a hefty deposit made prior to the june phone call prove aside from someones attempt to avoid the inland revenues prying eyes there was that footprint in the muck in vi nevins flat of course that shoe sole with its hexagonal markings but if such a shoe sole proved to be as common as toast on the breakfast table what did that add to the investigation of course kingryder would have left trace evidence all over vi nevins flat but he wasnt likely to cooperate if the coppers asked him for a few strands of hair or a vial of blood for a dna matchup and even if he gave them everything from his toe jam to his dental floss that did nothing to pin him to the derbyshire murders unless the rozzers had a packet of trace evidence left at the scene up there as well barbara knew shed be more than just demoted and off the case if she phoned up di lynley for a little discussion about the derbyshire evidence shed defied his orders shed gone her own way hed thrown her off the investigation what hed do if he discovered shed put herself back on the investigation did not bear thinking of so to bring kingryder down she had to go it more or less alone there was only the small point of trying to figure out how to do it hes been clever as the dickens barbara said to helen this blokes no slouch in the brains departmentbut if i can come up with a way to get a step ahead of him if i can use something that i know from everything ive gathered youve got the music helen pointed out which is what hes wanted from the first isnt it he sure as bloody hell searched high and low for it he tore apart that camping site he went through the flat in battersea he ripped up vis maisonette he spent enough time in the studio with cilia to suss out whether there was a hiding place there id say were safe in assuming hes after that music and he knows it wasnt with terry cilia or vi but he also knows its somewhere true barbara thought but where and with whom who was it that kingryder didnt know who would convince the man that the music had switched hands more than once and that hekingryderwould have to come forward to get that music and how the hell could the act of just coming forward for some musicwhich he could deny knowing about once he saw italso serve as the act that betrayed him as a killer bloody hell barbara thought it felt as if her brain were undergoing nuclear meltdown what she needed was to talk to another professional what she needed was a flaming good confab with someone who could not only see all the tentacles of this octopus crime but could also step forward offer the solution be part of the solution and defend himself against kingryder should everything go to hell in an instant inspector lynley was the obvious choice but he was out of the question so she needed someone like him she needed his clone she neededbarbara caught herself up and smiled of course she said helen raised an eyebrow youve got an idea ive got a bloody inspiration it wasnt until one oclock that nan maiden realised her husband was missing shed been occupied with putting the ground floor of maiden hall back in order and shed been making such an effort to act as if unexpected police searches were part of the normal routine that she hadnt noticed when andy disappeared when he wasnt in the house she first assumed he was in the grounds but when she asked one of the kitchen boys to take a message out to mr maiden offering him lunch the boy told her that andy had gone off in the landrover not half an hour before oh i see nan said and she tried to look as if this were perfectly reasonable behaviour under the circumstances she even tried to tell herself as much because it was inconceivable that andy would have gone off without a word to her after what they both had been through shed said a search to di hankens unmoving face but a search for what weve got nothing were hiding nothing youll find nothing love andy had said hed asked to see the search warrant and once hed seen it hed handed it back go on then he told hanken nan wouldnt consider what they were looking for she wouldnt consider what their presence meant when they left emptyhanded she felt such relief that her legs wobbled and she had to sit quickly or risk crumpling to the floor her easing of nerves at the failure of the police to find what they were looking for quickly gave way to anxiety however when she learned that andy was gone hanging over their heads was his declared willingness to find someone in the country who would give him a polygraph thats where hes gone nan decided hes found someone to give him that bloody test this search of the hall pushed him to it he means to have the test and prove himself to everyone by having it witnessed by someone from the investigation she had to stop him she had to make him see that he was playing into their hands theyd come with a warrant to search the premises knowing that such an action would unnerve him and it had done so it had unnerved them both nan tore at her fingernails had she not felt momentarily faint she could have gone to him she told herself they could have talked she could have drawn him to her and soothed his sore conscience andno she would not think of that not of conscience never of conscience she would think only of what she could do to turn the tide of her husbands intentions she realised that there was a single possibility she couldnt risk using the phone in reception so she went upstairs to the family floor to use the phone by their bed she had the receiver in her hand ready to punch in the number when she saw the folded piece of paper on her pillow the message from her husband comprised one sentence nan maiden read it and dropped the phone she didnt know where to go she didnt know what to do she ran from the bedroom she clattered down the stairs with andys note clutched in her hand and so many voices inside her head shouting for action that she couldnt make out one coherent word that would tell her what step was the first to take she wanted to grab each person she saw on the residents floor in the lounge in the kitchen at work on the grounds she wanted to shake them all she wanted to shout where is he help me what is he doing where has he gone what does it mean that hes oh god dont tell me because i know i know i know what it means and ive always known and i dont want to hear it to face it to feel it to somehow come to terms with what hes no no no help me find him help me she found herself running across the car park before she knew shed even gone there and then she understood that her body had taken control of a mind that had ceased to function even as she realised what she was meant to do she saw what she had already been told the landrover wasnt there andy had taken it himself because hed intended to leave her powerless she wouldnt accept that she spun and tore back into the hotel where the first person she saw was one of her two grindleford womenand why on earth had she always thought of them as the grindleford women as if they had no names of their ownand she accosted her nan knew she looked wild she certainly felt wild but that couldnt matter she said your car please which was as much as she could manage because she found that her breathing was erratic the woman blinked mrs maiden are you ill the keys your car its andy blessedly that was message enough within moments nan was behind the wheel of a morris so old that its drivers seat consisted of a thin layer of stuffing covering springs she revved the engine and took off down the incline her only thought was to find him where hed gone and why hed gone there was something she would not dwell upon barbara found that it was no mean feat convincing winston nkata to get involved it had been one thing for him to invite her into the investigation when she had been just another dc waiting for an assignmerit while he himself trekked off to derbyshire with lynley it was quite another for her to ask him to join her in a part of that same investigation once shed been dropkicked out of it her suggested little bout of houndschasingthefox wasnt authorised by their superior officer so when she spoke to nkata she felt a little like mr christian while her fellow dc didnt sound much like a man who wanted to take a cruise on the bounty he said no way barb thiss dodgy as hell she said winnie its a single phone call and thiss your lunch hour anyway isnt it or it could be your lunch hour couldnt it youve got to eat so just meet me there well have a meal in the neighbourhood well have anything youd like my treat i promise but the guv wont even have to know if it comes to nothing barbara finished for him and then she added winnie i need you he hesitated barbara held her breath winston nkata wasnt a man who rushed in with fools so she gave him the time to think about her request from every possible angle and while he did his thinking she prayed if nkata didnt enter into her plan she had no idea who else might be willing to he finally said guv asked for a fax of your report from cris barb see she replied hes still barking up that bloody stupid tree and theres nothing in the branches its nowhere winnie come on please youre my only hope this is it i know it all i need from you is a single little phone call she heard him sigh the sole word damn then give me a half hour he said brilliant she said and began to ring off barb he caught her dont make me regret this she took off to south kensington after cruising up and down every street from exhibition road to palace gate she finally found a place to park in queens gate gardens and walked over to the corner of elvaston place and petersham mews which was where the only phone boxes on elvaston place were located there were two of them and they were hung with at least three dozen of the sort of advertising postcards that barbara had found beneath terry coles bed nkata having to travel the greater distance from westminster had not yet arrived so barbara took herself across gloucester road to a french bakery shed spied on one of her circumnavigations of the neighbourhood in search of a parking space even from the street and inside her car shed smelled the siren fragrance of chocolate croissants with time to kill in the wait for winston she decided there was no point to ignoring her bodys desperate cry for the two basic food groups shed so far denied herself that day butter and sugar twenty minutes after her own arrival in the south kensington neighbourhood barbara saw winston nkatas lanky body coming up the street from the direction of cromwell road she shoved the rest of her croissant into her mouth wiped her fingers on her tshirt threw down the remains of a coke and dashed across the street just as he reached the corner thanks for coming she said if youre solid on this bloke why dont we just nick him nkata asked adding youve got chocolate on your chin barb with the nonchalance of a man whod long ago become familiar with the worst of her vices she used her tshirt to take care of the problem you know the dance whatve we got for evidence guvs found that leather jacket for one nkata gave her the details on lynleys discovery at the black angel hotel barbara was glad enough to hear them especially since they supported her conjecture that an arrow had been one of their killers weapons but nkata had been the one to pass along the arrow information to lynley and barbara knew that if he were now to phone the inspector another time and say by the way guv why dont we haul in this bloke kingryder for a lark and get his dabs while we grill him about leather jackets and trips to derbyshire lynley was going to see the name havers written all over the suggestion and hed order nkata to back off so far that hed be in calais before he stopped backing nkata wasnt a bloke to defy anyones orders for love or money and he certainly wouldnt undergo a sudden personality change for barbaras benefit so they had to keep lynley out of it at all costs until the birdcage was built and kingryder was sitting inside it singing barbara explained all of that to nkata the other dc listened without comment at the end he nodded but he said i still hate to go at it with him not knowing i know you do winnie but i dont see how hes given us any other choice do you nkata had to admit not he said with a nod to the phone boxes which one do i use then barbara said it doesnt matter for the moment so long as we keep both of them vacant once youve made the call but id go for the one on the left its got a brilliant card for tantalising transvestites in case youre looking for excitement some evening nkata rolled his eyes he went into the booth fished for some coins and made the call over his shoulder barbara listened to his side of the conversation he did west indian yobbo from south of the river since that was the voice of his first twenty years of life it was a stellar performance the script was simplicity itself once he got matthew kingryder on the phone i think i got a package you want mistah kingryder nkata said and listened for a moment oh i xpect you know which package i mean albert hall ring any special bells hey no way mon you need the proof you know the phone box you know the number you want the music you make the call he rang off and looked at barbara baits on the hook lets hope for a bite barbara lit a cigarette and walked the few feet to petersham mews where she leaned against the wing of a dusty volvo and counted fifteen seconds before pacing back to the phone box then once again to the car kingryder would have to think before he acted he would have to assess the risks and the payoffs of picking up the phone in soho and betraying himself this would take some minutes he was anxious he was desperate he was capable of murder but he wasnt a fool more seconds ticked by they turned into minutes nkata said hes not going for it barbara waved him off she looked away from the phone boxes up elvaston place in the direction of queens gate despite her own disquiet she found that she could picture how it had happened on that night three months before terry cole roaring up the street on his motorcycle hopping off to blu tack a fresh batch of postcards into the two phone boxes which were doubtless part of his regular route it takes him a few minutes he has a number of cards as hes sticking them up the telephone rings and on a whim he picks it up to hear the message intended for david kingryder he thinks why not see what thats all about and he goes to do so less than half a mile on his triumph and hes in front of the albert hall in the meantime david kingryder arrives five minutes too late perhaps even less he parks in the mews he strides to the phones he begins his wait a quarter of an hour passes perhaps more but nothing happens and he doesnt know why he doesnt know about terry cole eventually he thinks hes been had he believes hes ruined his careerand his lifeare fodder for a blackmailer who wants to destroy him they are in short history one single minute would be all that it took and how easy it was to be late in london when so much depended upon the traffic there was never really a way to know whether a drive from point a to point b would take fifteen minutes or fortyfive and perhaps kingryder hadnt been trying to get from a to b in town at all perhaps hed been corning in from the countryside on the motorway where anything could happen to throw a spanner into ones plans or perhaps hed had car trouble a dead battery a flat tyre what did the precise circumstance matter the only fact that counted was that hed missed the call the call made by his son the call not so different from the one which barbara and nkata were waiting for now nkata said its dead in the water barbara said god damn it and the telephone rang barbara threw her cigarette smouldering into the street she leapt towards the phone box it wasnt the same box from which nkata had made the call in the first place but the box standing next to it which could barbara thought mean nothing or everything since theyd never known which of the two had been the one where terry cole had intercepted the call nkata lifted the receiver on the third ring he said mistah kingryder as barbara held her breath yes yes yes she thought when nkata gave her a thumbsup at last they were in business god damn bloody computers whats the point of having them if they break down daily you tell me that damn you wpc peggy hammer had apparently heard this demand from her superior officer many times before its not actually broken sir she said with admirable patience its just like the other day were offline for some reason i expect the problems somewhere in swansea or i suppose it could be in london if it comes down to it then theres always our own im not asking for your analysis hammer hanken snapped im asking for some action theyd brought into the buxton incident room the stack of registration cards from the black angel hotel with what had seemed like simple instructions which would allow them to gather information in a matter of minutes get online to the dvla in swansea feed in the numbers on the plates of each car whose driver had stayed at the black angel hotel within the last two weeks get the name of the legal owner of that car match that name to the registrant on the hotel card purpose to see if anyone had checked into the hotel using a false name corroboration for that possibility one name on the registration card a different name in the dvlas system indicating ownership of the vehicle it was a simple task it would take a few minutes because the computers were fast and the registration cardsconsidering the size of the hotel and the number of rooms it hadwere not innumerable it would have been fifteen minutes of labour maximum if the sodding system had worked for bloody once lynley could see all of this reasoning going on in di hankens mind and he felt his own share of frustration the source of his agitation was different however he couldnt loosen hankens mind from the lock it had on andy maiden lynley understood hankens reasoning andy had motive and opportunity whether he also had the slightest idea how to use a long bow made no difference if someone who had checked into the black angel hotel under a false name possessed that ability and until they discovered whether any false identities had been used in tideswell lynley knew that hanken wasnt about to move on to another area of enquiry that logical area was julian britton that logical area had always been britton unlike andy maiden britton had everything they were looking for in their killer he had loved nicola enough to want to marry her and on his own admission hed visited her in london how likely was it that hed never come across something that had clued him in to her real life beyond that how likely was it that hed never had the slightest idea he wasnt her only derbyshire lover so julian britton had motive in spades he also had no solid alibi for the murder night and as for being able to shoot a long bow hed likely seen long bows aplenty at broughton manor during tournaments reenactments and the like how much of a stretch was it to posit that julian knew how to use one a search of broughton manor would tell that tale julians fingerprintsmatched to whatever prints forensic managed to pull off the leather jacketwould put a full stop to the piece but hanken wasnt about to budge in that direction unless the black angels records proved a dead end no matter that julian could have planted that jacket at the black angel no matter that he could have thrown that waterproof into the skip no matter that doing this would have taken him five minutes off the direct route from calder moor to his home hanken would deal exhaustively with andy maiden and until he had done julian britton might as well not exist when he was faced with the computer misfiring hanken soundly cursed modern technology he left the registration cards with wpc hammer and ordered her onto that antique means of communication the telephone ring swansea and tell them to do it by hand if they bloody have to he snapped to which peggy hammer said sir in meek compliance they left the incident room hanken was fuming that all they could bloody well do now was wait for wpc hammer and the dvla to come up with the information they needed and lynley was wondering how best he could turn the spotlight onto julian britton when a departmental secretary tracked them down to tell them that lynley was being asked for in the reception area its mrs maiden she said and i ought to warn you shes in something of a state she was ushered into hankens office a few minutes later she was panic personified she was clutching a crumpled piece of paper in her hand and when she saw lynley she cried out help me and to hanken you forced him you wouldnt leave it you couldnt leave it you didnt want to see that hed eventually do something hed do something and she brought her fist with the crumpled paper in it up to her forehead mrs maiden lynley began you worked with him you were his friend you know him you knew him you must do something because if you dont if you cant please please what the hells going on hanken demanded he had obviously little enough sympathy for the wife of his numberone suspect lynley went to nan maiden and took her hand in his own he lowered her arm and gently removed the note from her fingers she said i was looking i went out looking but i dont know where and im so afraid lynley read the words and felt a chill of apprehension im taking care of this myself andy maiden had written julian had just finished weighing casss puppies when his cousin came into the room shed evidently been looking for him because she said happily julie of course how silly of me i should have thought of the dogs at once he was using the aniseed oil on casss teats readying her puppies for the twentyfourhour test of their sense of smell as harriers they had to be excellent trackers cass growled uneasily when samantha entered but she soon settled when julians cousin adjusted her voice to the soothing tone that the dogs were more used to sam said julie i had the most extraordinary encounter with your father this morning i thought id be able to tell you at lunchtime but when you didnt turn up julie have you eaten anything today julian hadnt been able to face the breakfast table and his feelings hadnt much changed by lunch so hed busied himself with work instead inspections of some of the tenant farmers properties researching in bakewell what hoops one had to jump through when making changes in a listed building throwing himself into the myriad chores in the kennels thus hed been able to ignore everything that wasnt directly related to whatever he designated as the immediate task in hand sams appearance inside the kennels made any further efforts at distraction impossible nonetheless in an effort to avoid the conversation hed promised himself that hed have with her he said sorry sam i got caught up in work round here he tried to sound apologetic and in fact he felt apologetic when it came down to it because sam was working her heart out at broughton manor the least he could do to demonstrate his gratitude julian thought was to show up for meals in acknowledgement of her efforts he said youre holding us together and i know it thanks sam im grateful truly sam said warmly im happy to do it honestly julie its always seemed such a shame to me that weve never had much of a chance to she hesitated she seemed to sense the need to change gears its amazing when you think that if our parents had only mended their fences you and i could have another gear change i mean were family arent we and its sad not to get to know the members of your very own family especially when you finally do get to know them and they turn out to be well such fine people she fingered the plait that hung long and thick over her shoulder julian noticed for the first time how neatly it was braided he saw that it very nearly caught the light he said well im not always what i should be when it comes to saying thanks i think youre great he felt himself colour the curse of his complexion he turned from her and went back to the dog she asked what he was doing and why and he was grateful that an explanation of aniseed oil and cotton swabs provided them a means to get past an awkward moment but when hed said all there was to be said about pavlov conditioning and how the association of an unpleasant scent with their dams milk could be used to test the puppies developing sense of smell he and his cousin were back in that awkward moment again and again samantha was the one to save them she said oh lord ive completely forgotten why i wanted to talk to you your dad julie its remarkable whats happened julian rubbed the oil on casss last swollen teat and released the dog to her puppies he recapped the bottle as his cousin related what had occurred between herself and jeremy she concluded with it was every bottle julian every bottle in the house and he was crying as well he did tell me he wants to give it up julian said and out of strict fairness and a resolve to be truthful he added but hes said that before then you dont believe him because he was julie really you should have seen him it was like desperation came on him all at once and well frankly it was all about you me julian replaced the aniseed oil in the cupboard he was saying that hed ruined your life that hed driven off your brother and sister that was certainly true enough julian thought and that hed finally come to understand that if he didnt mend his ways hed drive you off as well of course i told him that youd never leave him after all anyone can see youre devoted but the point is that he wants to change hes ready to change and ive been looking for you because well i had to tell you arent you pleased and im not making up a word of what happened it was bottle after bottle gin down the drain and bottle smashed in the sink julian knew at heart that there was more than one way to look at what his father had done true as it might be that he wanted to get off the drink like all good alcoholics he could also be doing nothing more than positioning his players where he wanted them the only question was why he might be positioning his players at this precise moment what did he want and what did wanting it now mean on the other hand what if this time his father actually meant what he said julian wondered what if a clinic and whatever it was that could follow a clinic would be enough to cure him how could hethe only child jeremy had left with enough concern to do something about the situationbegin to deny him that opportunity especially when it would take so damn little to obtain the opportunity for him julian said im finished in here lets walk back to the house in a bid for time to gather his thoughts they left the kennels they started down the overgrown lane he said dads talked about giving up booze before hes even done it but he only makes it for a few weeks well once it must have been three and a half months but apparently now hes come to believe that he can do it samantha finished the thought for him and linked her arm with his she squeezed gently julie you should have seen him if you had done youd know i think that the key to success this time round is if we can come up with a plan that will help him obviously its done no good in the past to pour out the gin has it she gave him an earnest gaze perhaps seeking to see if shed somehow offended him by pointing out what hed previously done to attempt to wean his father from the piss and we cant exactly stop him going into an offlicence can we not to mention barring him from every hotel and pub from here to manchester right so if theres a way julian surely we can put our heads together and come up with something julian saw that his cousin had just given him the perfect opportunity to speak to her about money for the clinic but the words that went with that opportunity were large and unpalatable and they stuck in his throat like a piece of rotten meat how could he ask her for money for that much money how could he say could you give us ten thousand quid sam not lend us sambecause there wasnt a snowballs chance in the sahara that hed be able to repay her anytime soonbut give us the money lots of it and soon before jeremy changes his mind please make an investment in a yammering drunk whos never kept his word in his life julian couldnt do it despite his promises to his father he found that facetoface with his cousin he couldnt even begin to try as they reached the end of the lane and crossed the old road to make for the house a silver bentley pulled round the side of the building it was followed by a panda car two uniformed constables emerged first peering round the grounds as if they expected ninja warriors to be lurking in the bushes out of the bentley climbed the tall blond detective whod first come to broughton manor with inspector hanken his cousin laid a hand on julians arm through it he could feel how shed stiffened make sure the house is secure di lynley said to the constables whom he introduced as dcs emmes and benson then do the grounds its probably best to start with the gardens then go on to the kennel area and the woods emmes and benson ducked inside the courtyard gate julian watched astonished samantha was the one who said hang on you lot and her tone was angry what the hell are you doing inspector do you have a warrant what right have you to barge into our lives and i need you inside the house lynley told her quickly and now what samantha sounded incredulous if you think were going to jump just because you say so youd better think again julian found his voice whats going on you can see whats going on samantha said this twit has decided to search broughton manor hes not got a single reason in hell to tear things apart aside from the fact that you and nicola were involved which apparently is some sort of crime i want to see your warrant inspector lynley came forward and took her by the arm she said get your hands off me and tried to shake his grip he said mr brittons in danger id like him out of sight samantha said julian in danger julian blanched in danger from what whats going on lynley said that hed explain everything once the constables had ascertained that the house was safe inside the three of them retired to the long gallery which was lynley said when he saw it an environment that could be well controlled controlled julian asked from what and why so lynley explained his information was limited and direct but julian found that he couldnt begin to absorb it the police believed that andy maiden had taken matters into his own hands lynley told him which was always a risk if a member of a police officers family became the victim of a violent crime i dont understand julian said because if andys coming here here to broughton manor he tried to come to terms with the implication behind what the inspector had told him are you saying that andys coming after me were not certain whom hes after lynley replied inspector hankens seeing to the safety of the other gentleman the other oh my god samantha was standing next to julian and immediately she dragged him away from the long gallerys diamondpaned windows lets sit down here the fireplace its out of sight from the grounds and even if someone barges into the room well be too far from the doors julie julie please julian allowed himself to be led but he felt dazed he said what are you saying exactly to lynley does andy think i might have andy absurdly childishly he wanted to cry suddenly the last six terrible days sinceheart brimming with lovehed asked nicola to marry him came crashing down like a landslide and he could not bear another thing he was utterly defeated by this final fact that the father of the woman hed loved might actually believe he had killed her how strange it was he hadnt been defeated by her refusal when hed offered marriage he hadnt been defeated by the revelations shed made to him that night he hadnt been defeated by her disappearance his part in the search for her or her actual death but this simple thingher fathers suspicionwas for some reason the final straw he felt the tears coming and the thought of weeping in front of this stranger in front of his cousin in front of anyone burned in his throat samanthas arm went round his shoulders he felt her rough kiss against his temple youre all right she told him youre safe and who bloody cares what anyone thinks i know the truth and thats what matters what truth is this di lynley spoke from the window where he appeared to be waiting for a sign that the police constables had completed their securing of the house miss mccallin he said when samantha didnt answer oh stop she returned acerbically julian didnt kill nicola neither did i neither did anyone else in this house if thats what youre thinking so what truth is it that youre talking about the truth about julie that hes fine and good and that fine and good people dont go about murdering one another inspector lynley even di lynley said if one of them is less than fine and good i dont know what youre talking about i expect mr britton does she dropped her arm from his shoulders julian could feel her searching his face she said his name more hesitantly than she had yet done and she waited for him to clarify the detectives remarks and even now he could not do so he could see her stillso much more alive than he himself had ever once been grasping life he could not speak a single word against her no matter the cause he had for doing so in the measure and judgement of their everyday world nicola had betrayed him and julian knew that if he told the tale of her london life as shed revealed it to him he could call himself the deeply wronged party and so he would be seen by everyone he and nicola had known there was indeed some satisfaction to be taken from that but the truth of the matter would always be that only in the eyes of those who possessed the mere facts could he ever be seen as a man with a grievance those who knew nicola as she truly was and had always been would know hed brought his grief upon himself nicola had never once lied to him hed merely blinded himself to everything about her that he hadnt wanted to see she wouldnt have cared half a fig if he told the real truth about her now julian realised but he wouldnt do so not so much to protect her memory but to protect the people who had loved her without knowing all that she was i dont know what youre talking about julian told the london detective and i dont understand why you cant leave us alone to get on with our lives i wont be doing that until nicola maidens killer is found then look somewhere else julian said you wont find him here at the far end of the room the door opened and a constable escorted julians father into the long gallery he said to lynley i found this one in the parlour sir emmes has gone on to the gardens jeremy britton disengaged his arm from dc bensons hand he looked confused by the turn of events he looked frightened but he didnt look drunk he came to julian and squatted before him he said you all right my boy and although the words were ever so slightly slurred it occurred to julian that the enunciation was prompted by jeremys concern for him and not the result of his addiction to drink this realisation made his heart suddenly warm warm to his father warm to his cousin and warm to the connections implied by family he said im okay dad and he made room for jeremy on the floor by the fireplace he did this by scooting closer to sam in response she returned her arm to his shoulders im so glad of that she said chapter barbara chose a venue that matthew kingryder would know intimately the agincourt theatre where his fathers production of hamlet was being mounted but after nkata passed this message on to kingryder from the phone box in south kensington he made it clear that he wasnt about to let his fellow dc meet with a killer alone are you a convert to kingryderaskiller then barbara asked her colleague seems like only one reason hed know the number of this phone box nkata sounded mournful however and when he went on barbara understood why cant think why hed go after his own dad makes me wonder that he wanted more lolly than his dad left for him he saw only one way to get it but howd he come by that music in the first place his dad wouldntve told him would he tell your own sontell anyone in factthat youre plagiarising your old mates work i dont think so but he was his dads manager winnie he must have come across that music somewhere they walked to barbaras car in queens gate gardens nkata had told kingryder to meet him at the agincourt half an hour from the moment he rang off youre there too early and im not showing my face he had warned kingryder you just thank your stars im willing to negotiate on your own turf kingryder was to see to it that the stage door was unlocked he was also to see to it that the building was unoccupied the drive into the west end took them less than twenty minutes there the agincourt theatre stood next to the museum of theatrical history on a narrow side street off shaftesbury avenue its stage door was opposite a line of skips serving the royal standard hotel no windows overlooked it so barbara and nkata could enter the agincourt unobserved nkata took a position in the last row of the stalls barbara placed herself off stage in the deep darkness provided by a bulky piece of scenery although the traffic and the pedestrians outside the theatre had made a din that seemed to run the length of shaftesbury avenue inside the building it was tombsilent so when their quarry entered by the stage door some seven minutes later barbara heard him he did everything as nkata had instructed him he closed the door he made his way to the backstage area he flipped on the working lights above the stage he walked to stage centre he stood pretty much where hamlet would probably lie dying in horatios arms barbara realised it was such a nice touch he looked out into the darkened theatre and said all right damn you im here nkata spoke from the back where the shadows obscured him so i see kingryder took a step forward and said unexpectedly in a high pained voice you killed him you filthy bastard you killed him both of you all of you and i swear to god ill make you pay i didnt do no killing i done no traveling to derbyshire lately you know what im talking about you killed my father barbara frowned as she heard this what the hell was he on about seems like i heard that bloke shot himself nkata said and why just why the hell do you think he shot himself he needed that music and he would have had itevery sodding sheet of itif you and your fucking mates he shot himself because he thought he believed my father believed kingryders voice broke you killed him give me that music you killed him we need to make ourselfs an arrangement first come into the light where i can see you dont think so what i figure is this what you cant see you dont hurt youre mad if you think ill hand over a wad of money to someone i cant even see expected your dad to do the same though dont mention him to me youre not fit to speak his name feeling guilty just give me that god damn music step up here act like a man hand it over its going to cost you fine what what your dad had to pay youre mad nice little packet of dosh that was nkata said im happy to take it off your hands and play no games man i know the amount ill give you twentyfour hours to have it here in cash ispect things take longer when st heliers involved and im an understanding kind of bloke i am the mention of st helier took things too far barbara saw that when kingryders back stiffened suddenly as every nerve ending went on the alert no ordinary yobbo in an ordinary scam would have known about that bank in st helier kingryder moved away from centre stage he peered into the darkness of the stalls warily he said who the hell are you barbara took the cue i think you know the answer to that mr kingryder she stepped out of the darkness the musics not here by the way and to be honest it probably never would have surfaced at all had you not killed terry cole to get it back terry had given it to his neighbour the old lady mrs baden and she hadnt the least idea what it was you kingryder said right do you want to come quietly or shall we have a scene youve got nothing on me kingryder said i didnt say a damn thing that you can use to prove i lifted a finger against anyone somewhat true that nkata came forward down the centre aisle of the theatre but weve got ourselves a nice leather jacket up in derbyshire and if your dabs match up with the dabs we pull off it youre going to have one hell of a time dancing your way out of the dock barbara could almost see the wheels spinning wildly in kingryders skull as he dashed through his options fight flight or surrender the odds were against himdespite one of the opposition being a womanand while the theatre and the surrounding neighbourhood provided myriad places to run to and to hide even had he tried to flee it was only a matter of time before they nabbed him his posture altered again they killed my father he said obscurely they killed my dad it was when andy maiden hadnt materialised at broughton manor within two hours that lynley began to doubt the conclusions hed drawn from the note that the man had left in maiden hall a phone call from hankeninforming him of will upmans safetyfurther solidified lynleys doubts theres no sign of him here either lynley told his colleague pete im getting a bad feeling about this his bad feeling grew ominous when winston nkata phoned from london he had matthew kingryder at the yard nkata told him in a rapid recitation that offered no opportunity for interruption barbara havers had developed a plan to nab him and it had worked like a charm the bloke was ready to talk about the murders nkata and havers could lock him up and wait for the inspector or they could have at him themselves what were lynleys wishes it was all about that music barb found in battersea terry cole got between the music and what was supposed to happen to the music and kingryders dad blew his brains out over it matthew was venging himself for the death so he claims course he wanted that music back as well lynley listened blankly as nkata talked about the west end the new production of hamlet phone boxes in south kensington and terry cole when he had finished and he repeated his questiondid the inspector want them to wait until his return to take matthew kingryders statementlynley said numbly what about the girl nicola what about her just in the wrong place at the wrong time nkata replied kingryder killed her because she was there when the arrow hit terry she saw him with the bow barb says she saw a picture in his flat by the way matthew as a kid posing with dad on sports day at school he was wearing a quiver she says she saw the strap of it running across his chest i xpect if we get a warrant well find that long bow in his digs dyou want me to get on to that as well how was havers involved she grilled vi nevin when the girl came to last night she got most of the details from her lynley could hear nkata draw a deep breath to hurry on since nevin didnt seem like part of the case spector because of that islington business the threat the wheel clamp and andy maiden and all i told her to do it i told barb to talk to her if things come down to reprimands ill take the rap on that lynley felt stunned by the amount of information nkata had passed on to him but he found the voice to say well done winston i just went along with barb spector then well done to constable havers as well lynley rang off he found that his movements were slower than normal surpriseshockwas the cause but when hed finally managed to take in the extent of what had occurred in london during his absence he felt apprehension descend like a cloud after her appearance at the buxton police station nancy maiden had gone home to await word of her husbands whereabouts stubbornly refusing the offer of a female constable to remain with her until andy turned up shed said find him please to lynley as shed left the station and her eyes had tried to communicate something that she wouldnt put into words he realised the challenge that a search for andy maiden presented if hed learned nothing else in the past few days hed come to know that the peak district was vast crosshatched by hiking trails distinguished by utterly different topographical phenomena and marked with five hundred thousand years of mans habitation upon it but when he considered the desperate state that andy had been in when theyd last spoken and he combined this state with the words im taking care of this myself he had a fairly good idea where his search should begin lynley told the brittons and samantha mccallin to remain in the long gallery with their police guards until further notice he left them there he sped north from broughton manor towards bakewell propelled by an urgency born of dread andy believed that the investigation was heading unstoppably in his direction and everything lynley and hanken had done and said at their last two meetings with the man had communicated that brutal fact should he be arrested for his daughters murdershould he even be questioned more thoroughly about his daughters murderthe truth of nicolas life in london would come out and hed already demonstrated the extremes to which he was willing to go in order to keep the truth of that life hidden lynley tore across the district to sparrowpit and flew along the country road beyond it to the white iron gate behind which lay the unbroken expanse of calder moor a land rover stood at the far end of the truncated lane that led onto the moor directly behind it was a rusting morris lynley set off at a jog along the muddy rutfilled footpath because he did not wish to consider the extreme andy might have gone to in order to keep nicolas secrets from her mother he concentrated on the one recollection that had bound him to the other man for more than ten years wearing a wire is the easy part boyo dennis hextell had told him opening your mouth without sounding like youve got starch in your knickers is something else hextell had despised him had patiently anticipated his failure to portray himself undercover as anything other than what he was the privileged son of a privileged son andy maiden on the other hand said give him a chance den and when that chance had resulted in an entire lorry of semtexintended as baithijacked by the very people it was intended to entrap the message americans dont use the word torch jack arrived at the met within the same hour and served as illustration of how a single syllable can cost lives and destroy careers that it hadnt destroyed lynleys was owing to andy maiden hed taken the stricken young officer aside after the subsequent belfast bombing and said come in here tommy talk to me talk and lynley had done eventually he had poured out his guilt his confusion and his sorrow in a manner that ultimately told him how badly he needed a figure to act the role of parent in his life andy maiden had stepped into that part without ever questioning why lynley had needed him so desperately to do so hed said listen to me son and lynley had listened in small part because the other man was his superior officer in large part because no one before had ever used the word son when speaking to him lynley came from a world where people recognised their individual places in the social hierarchy and generally kept to them or felt the consequences for not doing so but andy maiden was not such a man youre not cut out for so andy had told him what youve been through proves that tommy but you had to go through it to know dyou understand and theres no sin in learning son theres only sin in refusing to take what youve learned and do something with it that guiding philosophy of andy maidens life reverberated now in lynleys mind the so officer had used it to map his entire career and there was very little in the past few days of their reacquaintance to reassure lynley that andy wouldnt follow that same philosophy today lynleys fears drove him towards nine sisters henge when he reached it the place was silent except for the wind this gushed and ceased and gushed in great gusts like air from a bellows it blew from the east off the irish sea and promised more rain in the coming hours lynley approached the copse and entered the ground was still damp from the morning rain and leaves fallen from the birches made a spongy padding beneath his feet he followed the path that led from the sentry stone into the middle of the copse out of the wind only the tree leaves susurrating provided sound aside from his own breathing which was harsh from exertion at the final moment he found that he didnt want to approach he didnt want to see and more than anything he didnt want to know but he forced himself forward into the circle and it was at the circles centre that he found them nan maiden halfsat and halfknelt her legs folded beneath her and her back to lynley andy maiden lay one leg cocked and the other straight out with his head and shoulders cradled in his wifes lap the rational part of lynleys mind said that would be where all the blood is coming from from his head and his shoulders but the heart of lynley said good god no and wished what he saw as he circled round the two figures was only a dream a nightmare coming as all dreams come from what lies within the subconscious and cries for scrutiny when one is most afraid he said mrs maiden nancy nan raised her head shed bent to andy so her cheeks and her forehead were splodged with his blood she wasnt weeping and perhaps beyond tears at this point she hadnt wept at all she said he thought hed failed and when he found that he couldnt make things good again her hands tightened on her husbands body trying to press closed the gash in his neck where the blood had throbbed out of him bathing his clothes and pooling beneath him he had to do something lynley saw that a bloodspattered paper lay crumpled on the ground next to her on it he read what hed expected to see i did it nancy im sorry andy maidens brief and apocryphal confession to the murder of a daughter he had deeply loved i didnt want to believe you see nan maiden said gazing down at her husbands ashen face and smoothing back his hair i couldnt believe and live with myself and continue to live with him i saw that something was terribly wrong when his nerves went bad but i couldnt think hed ever have hurt her how could i think it even now how mrs maiden lynley had no words for her she was too much in shock to comprehend the scope of what lay behind her husbands actions right now her horrorborn of her husbands putative murder of their daughterwas quite enough for her to contend with lynley squatted next to nan maiden and put his hand on her shoulder mrs maiden he said come away from here ive left my mobile in the car and were going to need to phone the police he is the police she said he loved that job he couldnt do it any longer because his nerves wouldnt take it yes lynley said yes ive been told which is why i knew you see but still i couldnt be sure i could never be sure so i didnt want to say i couldnt risk it of course lynley tried to urge her to her feet mrs maiden if youll come i thought if i could just protect him from ever having to know thats what i wanted to do but it turns out that he knew about everything anyway didnt he so we might have actually talked about it andy and i and if wed talked about it do you see what that means if wed talked i could have stopped him i know it i hated what she was doingat first i thought id die from the knowledge of itand if id known that shed told him what she was doing as well nan bent to andy again we would have had each other at the very least we could have talked and i would have said the right words to stop him lynley dropped his hand from her shoulder hed been listening all along but he suddenly realised that he hadnt been hearing the sight of andyhis throat slashed open by his own handhad clouded all his senses save his vision but he finally heard what nan maiden was saying hearing he finally understood you knew about her he said you knew and a yawning chasm of responsibility opened up beneath him as he saw the part he himself had played in andy maidens purposeless death i followed him matthew kingryder said theyd taken him to an interview room where he sat at one side of a formicatopped table while barbara havers and winston nkata sat on the other side in between them at one end of the table a tape player whirred recording his answers kingryder appeared defeated by more than one aspect of his present situation his future sealed by the existence of a leather jacket and the presence of a sliver of port orford cedar in the wound of one of his victims he had apparently turned to a review of some of the unpleasant realities that had led him to this juncture those past realities joined with his future prospects to alter him appreciably upon his entry into the interview room the vengeancefueled anger that had defined his arrival at the agincourt theatre had become the devastated submission of the fighter who faces surrender he told the first part of his story in a monotone this was the background in which he laid out the grievance that had prompted him to blackmail his own father david kingryder worth so many millions that it took the services of a team of accountants to keep track of all his money had decided to put his fortune into a fund for creative artists upon his death leaving not a penny of it to his own children one of these children accepted the terms of the kingryder will with the resignation of a daughter who knew only too well that it would be profitless to argue against such a course of action the other childmatthewhad sought a way round the situation id known about the hamlet music for years but dad didnt know that matthew told them he wouldnt have known since he and my mother were long divorced when michael wrote the score and he never realised that michael had kept in touch with us he was actually more like a dad to me than dad was michael chandler he played the score for meparts of it that iswhen i visited him for tea at halfterms and holidays he wasnt married then but he wanted a son and i was happy enough for him to act the part of my father david kingryder hadnt thought the hamlet score had much potential so upon michael chandlers completion of it the partners had filed it away twentytwo years ago there it had remainedburied among the kingryderchandler memorabilia in the offices of kingryder productions in soho thus when david kingryder had presented it as his latest effort matthew had instantly recognised not only the music and the lyrics but also what they represented to his father a final attempt to salvage a reputation that had been all but destroyed by two successive and expensive failures as a solo act once his longtime partner had drowned it hadnt taken much effort for matthew to find the original score and once he had it in his hands he saw how he could make some money from it his father wouldnt know who had the scoreanyone from the production offices could have nicked it from the files if theyd known where to lookand because his reputation was paramount to him hed pay whatever was asked to get the music back in that way matthew would have the inheritance his fathers will denied him the scheme had been simple four weeks before the opening of hamlet matthew had sent a page of the score to his fathers home with an anonymous note if one million pounds wasnt paid into an account in st helier the score would be sent to the biggest tabloid in the country just in time for opening night once the money was in the bank david kingryder would be informed where to pick up the rest of the music when i had the money i waited till a week before the opening matthew told them i wanted him to sweat he sent his dad a note then and gave him the instructions to go to the phone boxes in south kensington and wait for further instructions at ten oclock he told him david kingryder would be informed where the music could be found but terry cole answered the phone that night not your dad barbara said why didnt you recognise the different voice he said yeah thats all matthew told her i thought he was nervous in a hurry and he sounded like someone who was expecting the call in the days that followed hed seen that his father was agitated about something but hed assumed that kingryder was in a state about having had to pay out one million pounds hed had no way of knowing that his father was daily growing more frantic as the phone call he kept hoping to receivefrom the blackmailer who he believed had failed to contact him at the phone box in elvaston placedid not materialise as the premier of hamlet approached david kingryder had started to see himself in the power of someone who was either going to bleed him dry with more demands for money over the years or ruin him forever by releasing michael chandlers music to the tabloids when he hadnt heard by opening night and the production was such a success you know what happened he blew out his brains barbara said thats owing to you i didnt mean him to die kingryder cried he was my dad but i thought it wasnt fair that all his money every penny of his money except that measly bequest to ginny he lowered his gaze spoke fiercely to hands rather than to barbara and winston he owed me something he hadnt been much of a father to me he owed me at least this much why didnt you just ask him for it nkata asked matthew breathed out a bitter laugh dad worked to be who and where he was he expected me to do the same and i always didi worked and i workedand i would have kept on working but then i saw that he was going to take a shortcut to his own success through michaels music and i decided that if he could take a shortcut so could i and it would have come out all right in the end if that bloody little bastard hadnt showed up and then when i saw that he intended to use the music and to play the same rotten game with me i had to do something i couldnt just sit there and let it happen barbara frowned everything until that moment had fitted perfectly into the picture she said play the same game what blackmail matthew kingryder said cole walked into my office with that smirk on his face and said i got something here that i need your help with mr kingryder and as soon as i saw ita single sheet just like id sent to my dadi knew exactly what that little shit had in mind i asked him how he came to have it in his possession but he wouldnt tell me so i threw him out but i followed him i knew he wasnt in it alone on the trail of the music hed followed terry cole to the railway arches in battersea and from there to his flat on anhalt road when the boy had gone inside the studio matthew had taken a chance and riffled through the saddlebags hanging from his motorcycle when hed found nothing he knew he had to continue following till the kid led him either to the music or to the person who had the music it was when hed followed him to rostrevor road that hed first believed he was on the right trail for terry had emerged from vi nevins building with a large manila envelope which hed placed in his saddlebag and that matthew kingryder had believed had to contain the music when he took to the motorway id no idea where he was going but i was committed to seeing things through so i followed him and when hed seen terry and nicola maiden having their meeting out in the middle of nowhere hed been convinced that they were the principals behind his fathers death and his own misfortune his only weapon was the long bow he had in his car he went back for it waited till nightfall then dispatched them both but there was no music at the camping site matthew said just an envelope of letters pastedup letters from magazines and newspapers so hed had to keep looking he had to find that score to hamlet and hed returned to london and searched in those places terry had led him i didnt think of the old woman he said finally you should have accepted when she offered you cake barbara told him once more matthews glance fell to his hands his shoulders shook he began to cry i didnt mean harm to come to him i swear to god if hed only just said hed leave me something but he wouldnt do that i was his son his only son but i wasnt meant to have anything oh he said i could have his family pictures his bloody piano and guitar but as for the money any of the money a single penny of his god damn money why couldnt he see that it made me worth nothing to be overlooked i was supposed to be grateful just to be his son just to be alive on account of him hed give me a job but for all the rest no i had to make it entirely on my own and it wasnt fair because i loved him all the years when he failed i still loved him and if hed continued to fail it wouldnt have made a difference not to me his distress seemed real and barbara wanted to feel sorry for him but she found that she couldnt as she realised how much he wanted her pity he wanted her to see him as a victim of his fathers indifference no matter that hed destroyed his father for one million pounds no matter that hed committed two brutal murders they were meant to feel sorry that circumstances beyond his control had forced his hand that david kingryder hadnt seen fit to leave him the money in his will which would have precluded the crimes ever happening in the first place god barbara thought there it was the malaise of their time do it to julia hurt someone else blame someone else but dont hurt or blame me she wouldnt begin to buy that line of thinking any pity barbara might have mustered for the man was erased by two senseless deaths in derbyshire and the image of what hed done to vi nevin hed pay for those crimes but a prison termno matter its lengthdidnt seem enough recompense for blackmail suicide murder assault and the aftermath of each she said you might want to know the truth of the matter about terry coles intentions mr kingryder in fact i think its important that you know and so she told him that all terry cole had wanted was a simple address and telephone number in fact had matthew kingryder offered to take the music off his hands and pay him handsomely for bringing it to the offices of kingryder productions the boy would probably have been thrilled to the dickens he didnt even know what it was barbara said he hadnt the slightest idea in the world that hed put his hands on the music to hamlet matthew kingryder absorbed this information but if barbara had hoped she was dealing him a mortal blow that would worsen his coming life in prison she was disabused of that notion when he replied hes to blame for it all if he hadnt interfered my dad would be alive lynley reached eaton terrace at ten that night he found his wife in the bathroom sunk in a fragrant citrus froth of bubbles her eyes were closed her head cradled in a towelling pillow and her handsgarbed incongruously in white satin glovesrested on the spotless stainless steel tray that spanned the width of the bath and held her soaps and her sponges a cd player sat on the vanity amid a clutter of helens unguents potions and creams music emanated from it a soprano sang they lay himgently and softlyin the cold cold ground they lay himgently and softlyin the cold cold ground and here am i a child without a light to see me through the coming storm with no one here to tell me i am not alone lynley reached for the off button ophelia i expect once hamlets killed polonius helen splashed in the bath behind him tommy you frightened me half to death sorry have you just now got in yes tell me about the gloves helen the gloves helens glance shifted to her hands oh the gloves its my cuticles im giving them a treatment a combination of heat and oil thats a relief he said why had you noticed my cuticles no but i thought you were anticipating a future as the queen which would mean our relationship has come to an end have you ever seen the queen without her gloves hmm i dont think i have but you dont suppose she actually bathes with them on do you its a possibility she may loathe human contact even with herself helen laughed im so glad youre home she peeled off the gloves and plunged her hands into the water she settled back against her pillow and regarded him tell me she said gently please it was her way and lynley hoped it would always be her way to read him so swiftly and to open herself to him with those three simple words he pulled a stool over to the side of the bath he took off his jacket dropped it onto the floor rolled up his sleeves and reached for one of the sponges and some soap he took her arm first and ran the sponge down its slender length and as he bathed her he told her everything she listened in silence watching him the worst of it all is this he said in conclusion to his tale andy maiden would still be alive if id stuck to procedure when we met yesterday afternoon but his wife came into the room and instead of questioning her about nicolas life in londonwhich would have revealed that shed known about it even longer than andy that nicola had told her months before she told her fatheri held back because i wanted to help him protect her when she didnt need his protection at all helen said yes i see how it happened how dreadful but tommy you were doing the best you knew at the time lynley squeezed the sponge and let the soapy water run against his wifes shoulders before he returned the sponge to its tray the best i knew at the time was to stick to procedure he was a suspect so was she i didnt treat either one of them that way had i done so he wouldnt be dead lynley couldnt decide what the worst of it had been seeing the bloody swiss army knife still clutched in andys stiffened hand trying to get nancy maiden away from her husbands corpse hiking back to the bentley with her in tow and every moment fearing that her shock would give way to a raving grief which he would not be able to handle waitingendlessly it seemedfor the police to arrive facing the corpse a second time and this time without andys wife present to deflect his attention from his former colleagues manner of death looks like the knife he showed me hanken had said observing it on the ground it would be wouldnt it was lynleys only reply then passionately blast it god damn it peter its all my fault if id showed them every one of my cards when they were both with me but i didnt i didnt hanken had nodded at his team then directing them to bag the body hed shaken a cigarette from his packet and offered the packet to lynley hed said take one god damn it you need it thomas and lynley had complied theyd left the ancient stone circle but remained by the sentry stone smoking their marlboros no one operates by rote hanken said half of this job is intuition and that comes from the heart you followed your heart in your position i cant say i would have done differently cant you no but lynley had known the other man was lying because the most important part of the job was knowing both when to follow your heart and when to do so would lead to disaster barbara was right from the first lynley told helen as she rose from the bath and took the towel he extended to her had i even seen that this wouldnt have happened because id have stayed in london and reined back the derbyshire end of things while we brought down kingryder if thats the case helen said quietly as she wrapped the towel round her body then im equally to blame for whats happened tommy and she told him how barbara had come to be tracking down kingryder once shed been thrown off the case i could have phoned you when denton told me about the music i didnt make that choice i doubt i would have listened if id known that what you were telling me was going to prove barbara right as to that darling helen went to the vanity and took up a small bottle of lotion which she began to smooth against her face what is it really thats bothered you about barbara about this north sea business and her firing that gun because i know you know shes a fine detective she may go her own way now and again but her heart is always in the right place isnt it and there it was again that word heart and everything it implied about the underlying reasons behind a persons actions hearing his wife use it lynley was reminded of anothers use of it so many years before of a woman weeping and saying to him my god tommy whats become of your heart when he refused to see her to speak to her even in the aftermath of discovering her adultery and then he finally knew he understood for the very first time and the understanding made him recoil from who he had been and what he had done for the last twenty years i couldnt control her he said quietly far more to himself than to his wife i couldnt mould her into the image id had of her she went her own way and i couldnt bear it hes dying i thought and she should damn well act like a wife whose husband is dying helen understood ah your mother i thought id forgiven her long ago but perhaps i havent forgiven her at all perhaps shes always therein every woman i have to deal withand perhaps i keep trying to make her be someone she doesnt want to be or perhaps youve simply never forgiven yourself for not being able to stop her helen set down her lotion and came to him we carry such baggage dont we darling and just when we think weve finally unpacked there it all is again waiting in front of our bedroom door ready to trip us when we get up in the morning shed had her head wrapped in a turban and she took this off and shook her hair out she hadnt completely dried herself so drops of water glistened on her shoulders and gathered in the hollow of her throat your mother my father she said as she took his hand and pressed it to her cheek its always someone i was all in a muddle because of that ridiculous wallpaper id decided that if i hadnt become the woman my father intended me to bethe wife of a man in possession of a titleid have known my own mind with regard to that paper and because i didnt know my own mind i blamed him my father but the truth of the matter is that i could always have gone my own way as pen and iris did i could have said no and i didnt because the path laid out was so much easier and so much less frightening than forging my own would have been lynley smoothed her cheek fondly he traced her jaw and the length of her long and lovely neck sometimes i hate being a grownup helen told him theres so much more freedom in being a child isnt there he agreed he put his fingers to the towel that wrapped her body he kissed her neck her shoulders and her mouth but theres more advantage in adulthood i think he loosened the towel and drew her to him chapter at the sound of her alarm the next morning barbara havers rolled out of bed with a blazing headache she stumbled to the bathroom where she rattled round for several aspirin and fumbled with the handles of the shower bollocks she thought shed obviously been leading much too exemplary a life in the last few years as a result shed become grossly out of condition in the partying arena it hadnt even been that much of a celebration after theyd finished taking matthew kingryders statement she and nkata had gone out for a minor frolic theyd visited only four pubs and neither one of them had drunk the truly hard stuff but what theyd drunk had been enough to do the trick barbara felt like a lorry had driven over her head she stood under the shower and let the water beat against her until the aspirin began to take effect she scrubbed her body and washed her hair swearing off everything even remotely alcoholic on week nights henceforth she thought about phoning nkata to see if he was experiencing a morningafter as well but she considered how his mother would react to her favourite childs receiving a phone call from an unknown woman before seven in the morning and she abandoned the idea no need to worry mrs nkata about her darling winnies purity of flesh and spirit barbara would see him at the yard soon enough her morning ablutions performed barbara padded over to her wardrobe and pondered what sartorial statement she could make today she opted for discretion and pulled out a trouser suit that she hadnt thought to wear for at least two years she flung it onto the rumpled bed and went to the kitchen the electric kettle plugged in and watermelon poptarts in the toaster she toweled her hair dry and threw on her clothes she turned on the bbc breakfast news to see that road works were delaying traffic into the city there was a pileup on the ml just south of junction four and a burst water main on the a had created a lake to the north of streatham it was another day of commuting hell the kettle clicked off and barbara toddled to the kitchen to spoon some coffee powder into a mug decorated with a caricature of the prince of wales chinless head bulbous nose and flapping ears sitting on a diminutive tartanclad body she grabbed her poptarts plopped them onto a kitchen towel and carried this wellbalanced nutritional masterpiece over to the dining table the velvet heart sat in the centre where barbara had placed it when hadiyyah had presented it to her on sunday evening there it waited for her reflections upon it a selfsatisfied little valentine of sorts edged with white lace and filled with implication barbara had avoided thinking about it for more than thirtysix hours and since shed not seen either hadiyyah or her father during that time shed been able to skip mentioning it in all conversations as well but she couldnt exactly do that forever good manners if nothing else demanded that she make some sort of remark to azhar the next time she saw him what would it be after all he was a married man true he wasnt living with his wife true the woman hed been living with since hed been living with his wife was not his wife true that woman had apparently done a permanent runner leaving behind a charming eightyearold girl and a sombrealbeit thoughtful and kindthirtyfiveyearold man in need of adult female companionship however none of that went any distance towards making the situation into something that could be addressed easily under the timehonoured rules of etiquette not that barbara had ever bothered to concern herself with the timehonoured rules of etiquette but that was because shed never really been in a spot where rules applied not manwoman rules that is and not manwomanchild rules and certainly not manwifenonwifechildadditionalwoman rules but still when she next saw azhar she needed to be prepared she needed to have something quick useful direct meaningful casual and reasonable to say and it had to spring from her tongue spontaneously as if the thought that prompted it had come upon her that instant so what would it be thanks awfully much old bean just what are your intentions how sweet of you to think of me bloody hell barbara thought and crammed the rest of her poptart into her mouth human relationships were murder a sharp knock sounded once on her door barbara started and looked at her watch it was far too early for religious zealots to be out on the streets and the british gas meter reader had been the social highlight of her previous week so who chewing she got to her feet she opened the door azhar was standing there she blinked at him and wished shed taken her rehearsal of grateful remarks more seriously she said hullo er morning he said you returned quite late last night barbara well yeah the case was tied up i mean it was tied up as much as these things can be tied up when we make an arrest which is to say the materials have to be drawn together still in order to give them to the crown prosecutors but as for the actual investigation she forced herself to stop yeah we made an arrest he nodded his expression seriousthis is good news good news yes he looked beyond her she wondered if he was trying to suss out whether shed celebrated the investigations conclusion with a chorus line of dancing greek boys who were still lounging somewhere within but then she remembered her manners and said oh come in coffee ive only got instant im afraid and she added this morning as if every other day she stood in the kitchen furiously grinding beans he said no he couldnt stay long just a moment in fact because his daughter was dressing and he would be needed to plait her hair right barbara said but you dont mind if i and she indicated the electric kettle using her prince of wales mug to do so no of course i have interrupted your breakfast such as it is barbara admitted i would have waited until a time more convenient but i found this morning that i could no longer do so ah barbara went to the kettle and switched it on wondering about his gravity and what it portended while it was true that hed been grave at their every meeting all summer there was something added to his gravity this morning a way of looking at her that made her wonder if she had poptart frosting on her face somewhere well have a seat if youd like and therere fags on the table youre sure about the coffee perfectly yes but he helped himself to one of her cigarettes and watched her in silence as she made her second cup of coffee it was only when she joined him at the tablethe velvet heart like an unmade declaration between themthat he spoke again barbara this is difficult for me i am uncertain how to begin she slurped her coffee and tried to look encouraging azhar restlessly reached for the velvet heart essex essex barbara repeated helpfully hadiyyah and i were at the seaside on sunday in essex as you know he reminded her yeah right now was the moment to say thanks for the heart but it wouldnt come out hadiyyah told me what a good time you had she mentioned you dropped in at the burnt house hotel as well she dropped in he clarified that is to say that i took her there to wait with the good mrs porteryou remember her i believe barbara nodded sitting behind her zimmer frame mrs porter had looked after hadiyyah while her father acted as liaison between the police and a small but restless pakistani community during the course of a murder enquiry right she said i remember mrs porter nice of you to go to see her as i said it was hadiyyah who visited mrs porter i myself visited the local police at this barbara felt her defences rising she wanted to make some sort of remark that would derail the conversation they were about to have but she couldnt think of one quickly enough because azhar went on i spoke to constable fogarty he told her constable michael fogarty barbara barbara nodded yeah mike right hes the weapons officer for the essex police yeah mike weapons thats right he told me what happened on the boat barbara what dci barlow said about hadiyyah what she intended and what you did azhar he rose he walked to the day bed barbara grimaced to see that shed not yet made it and the loathsome happy face tshirt that she wore at night was still lying in a tangle with the sheets she thought for a moment that he intended to straighten the bedhe was the most compulsively neat person shed ever metbut he turned to face her she could see his agitation how do i thank you what can i say that could possibly thank you for the sacrifice you have made for my child no thanks are needed this is not true dci barlow em barlow was born with too much ambition azhar that bollocksed up her judgement it didnt mess with mine but as a result you have lost your position you have been disgraced your partnership with inspector lynleywhom i know you esteemhas been dissolved has it not well things between us arent exactly peachy barbara agreed but the inspectors got rules and regulations on his side so hes within his rights to be cheesed off at me but this all this is due to what you did to your protection of hadiyyah when dci barlow wanted to leave her when she called her a paki brat and was indifferent to her drowning in the sea he was so distressed that barbara wished fervently that constable michael fogarty had been taken ill on sunday absenting himself from the police station and leaving dci barlow the only one present who couldand wouldgive a seriously sanitised account of the north sea chase that had ended with barbara firing a weapon at her as it was she could only be grateful for the single fact that fogarty in making his report to azhar had mercifully not included the god damn that emily barlow had used before the words paki brat that day i didnt think about the consequences barbara told azhar hadiyyah was what was important and shes still whats important full stop i must find a way to show what i feel he said despite her words of reassurance i must not let you think that your sacrifice believe me it wasnt a sacrifice and as to thanks well youve given me a heart havent you and thatll do fine a heart he looked confused then he followed the direction of barbaras extended hand and saw the heart that hed won from the crane grab game that the heart but that is nothing i thought only of the words on it barbara and how you might smile when you saw them the words yes did you not see and he came to the table and flipped the heart over on its obverse sidewhich shed have seen well enough if shed had the courage to examine the damn thing when hadiyyah had given it to herwas embroidered i essex it was a joke you see because after what you went through in essex you can of course hardly love it but you did not see the words oh those words barbara said hastily with a hearty haha that was designed to illustrate the degree of her complicity in his little joke yes the old i love essex routine just about the last spot on earth that i want to return to thanks azhar thiss far better than a stuffed elephant isnt it but its not enough and theres nothing else that i can give you in thanks nothing that is equal to what you gave me barbara remembered what shed learned about his people lenādenā the giving of a gift that was equal to or greater than the one which had been received it was the way they indicated their willingness to engage in a relationship an overt manner of declaring ones intentions without the indelicacy of speaking them openly how sensible they were the asians she thought nothing was left to guesswork in their culture your wanting to find something of equal value is what counts isnt it barbara asked him i mean we can make the wanting to find something count if we want to cant we azhar i suppose we can he said doubtfully then consider the equal gift given and go and plait hadiyyahs hair shell be waiting for you he looked as if he might say more but instead he came to the table and crushed out his cigarette thank you barbara havers he said quietly cheers she replied and she felt the ghost of a touch on her shoulder as he passed her on the way to the door when it was shut behind him barbara chuckled wearily at her boundless folly she picked up the heart and balanced it between her thumbs and index fingers i love essex she thought well there were worse ways he could have joked with her she dumped the rest of her coffee in the sink and quickly did her few morning chores teeth cleaned and hair combed with a smudge of blusher on each cheek in a bow to femininity she grabbed her shoulder bag locked the door behind her and sauntered up the path towards the street she went out the front gate but halted when she saw it lynleys silver bentley was parked in the driveway youre off your patch arent you inspector she asked him as he got out of the car winston phoned me he said youd left your car at the yard last night and took a taxi home wed guzzled a few drinks and it seemed the better course so he said it was wise not to drive i thought you might like a lift into westminster there are problems on the northern line this morning when arent there problems on the northern line he smiled so thanks she slung her shoulder bag into the passenger seat and climbed inside lynley got in beside her but he didnt start the car instead he took something from his jacket pocket he handed it over barbara looked at it curiously hed given her a registration card for the black angel hotel it wasnt a blank card however which might have inspired her to think that he was offering her a holiday in derbyshire rather it was filled in with a name an address and other pertinent information about car types number plates passports and nationalities it had been made out to an m r davidson who had listed an address in west sussex and an audi as the vehicle that had carried him or her to the north okay barbara said ill bite what is it a souvenir for you ah barbara anticipated his starting the bentley he didnt do so he merely waited so she said a souvenir of what he said di hanken believed that the killer stayed at the black angel hotel the night of the murders he ran the cards of all the hotel guests through the dvla to see if any of them were driving cars that were registered to a name different from the name they had put on the card that was the one that didnt match up davidson barbara said examining the card oh yes i see davids son so matthew kingryder stayed at the black angel not far from the moor not far from peak forest where the knife was found not far as it turns out from anything and the dvla showed this audi as registered to him barbara concluded and not to an m r davidson things happened so quickly yesterday that we didnt actually see the report from the dvla till late in the afternoon the buxton computers were down so the information had to be compiled by phone if they hadnt been down lynley looked through the windscreen and spoke meditatively i want to believe that the fault lies in technology that had we only got our hands on the dvla information quickly enough andy maiden would still be alive what barbara breathed the word astounded still be alive what happened to him lynley told her he spared himself nothing barbara saw but then that was his way he concluded with it was a judgement call on my part not to talk directly about nicolas prostitution when her mother was present it was what andy wanted and i went along had i simply done what i should have done he gestured aimlessly i let my feelings for the man get in the way i made the wrong call and as a result he died his blood is on my hands as indelibly as if id wielded the knife thats being a little rough on yourself barbara said you didnt exactly have time to ponder the best way to handle things once nan maiden barged into your interview no i could see that she knew something but what i thought she knewor at least believedwas that andy had murdered their daughter and even then i didnt bring the truth to light because i couldnt believe hed murdered their daughter and he hadnt barbara said so your decision was right i dont think you can separate the decision from the outcome lynley said id thought so before but i dont think so now the outcome exists because of the decision and if the outcome is an unnecessary death the decision was wretched we cant twist the facts into a different picture no matter how much wed like to do so it sounded like a conclusion to barbara she treated it as such she reached for her seat belt and pulled it round her she was about to fasten it when lynley spoke again you made the right decision barbara yeah but i had the advantage over you barbara said id talked to cilia thompson in person you hadnt id talked to kingryder in person as well and when i saw that hed actually bought one of her gruesome paintings it was easy for me to reach the conclusion that he was our man im not talking about this case lynley said im talking about essex oh barbara felt herself grow unaccountably small that she said essex yes essex ive tried to separate the judgement call you made that day from its outcome i kept insisting that the child might have lived had you not interfered but you didnt have the luxury to make calculations about the boats distance from the child and someones ability to throw a life belt to her did you barbara you had an instant in which to decide what to do and because of the decision you made the little girl lived yet given the luxury of hours to think about andy maiden and his wife i still made the wrong call in their case his deaths on my shoulders the childs life is on yours you can examine the situations any way you want to but i know which outcome id prefer to be responsible for barbara looked away in the direction of the house she didnt quite know what to say she wanted to tell him that she had lain awake nights and paced away days waiting for the moment when hed say he understood and approved what shed done that day in essex but now that the moment had finally come she found that she couldnt bring herself to say the words instead she muttered thanks inspector thanks and she swallowed hard barbara barbara the cry came from the flagstone area in front of the ground floor flat hadiyyah was standing there not on the stones but on the wooden bench in front of the french windows to the flat she shared with her dad look barbara she crowed and danced a little jig i got my new shoes dad said i didnt have to wait till guy fawkes look i got my new shoes barbara lowered her window excellent she called youre a picture kiddo kiddo
