alexander kent band of brothers bolitho for you boo with my love the way ahead midshipman richard bolitho threw up one hand to shade his eyes surprised by the fierce reflected glare from the water alongside he waited while two seamen lurched past him half carrying half dragging some bulky objects wrapped in canvas toward the open deck and the hard sunlight after the semidarkness of gorgons between decks it only added to his sense of unreality he calmed himself another day for most people anyway he glanced down at his uniform his best he wanted to smile the only uniform that would pass muster and avoid criticism he flicked off several strands of oakum which he had collected somewhere along the way from the midshipmens berth his home in gorgon for the past year and a half was that really all it was he took another deep breath he was ready and it was not just another day he walked on to the main deck adjusting his mind to the noise and outward confusion of a ship undergoing the indignities of a badly needed overhaul chisels and handsaws and the constant thud of hammers in the depths of the hull while elsewhere men swarmed like monkeys high above the decks repairing the miles of standing and running rigging which gave life to a fighting ship and the sails that drove her and now it was almost finished the stench of tar and paint the heaps of discarded cordage and wood fragments would soon be a cursed memory until the next time he gazed across the nearest eighteenpounders black muzzles at rest inboard of their ports still smart disdaining the disorder around them and beyond to the land hard and sharply etched in the morning light the rooftops and towers of old plymouth with an occasional glitter of glass in the sun and beyond them the familiar rolling hills more blue than green at this hour he tried not to quicken his pace to reveal that things were different merely because of this particular day the new year of was barely a few days old but it was different some seamen flaking down halliards glanced at him as he passed he knew them well enough but they seemed like strangers he reached the entry port where the captain was piped aboard and ashore and important visitors were greeted with the full ceremonial of a kings ship wardroom officers were also permitted here but not a midshipman unless on duty in his proper station richard bolitho was not yet eighteen and he wanted to laugh to shout to share it with someone who was free of doubt or of envy out of the blue and with less than a few days warning the signal had arrived the appointment every midshipman knew was inevitable welcome dread even fear he might receive it with all or none of these emotions others would decide his fate he would be examined and be subject to their decision and if successful he would receive the kings commission and take the monumental step from midshipman to lieutenant he watched a schooner passing half a cable or so abeam her sails hard in the wind although the waters of plymouth sound were yet unbroken a deep swell lifting the slender vessel as if it were a toy ah here you are mr bolitho it was verling the first lieutenant perhaps he was waiting to board a boat himself on some mission for the captain it was unlikely he would be leaving the ship his ship for any other reason at a time like this from dawn until sunset he was always in demand supervising working parties checking daily even hourly progress above and below decks missing nothing he was the first lieutenant and you were never allowed to forget it bolitho touched his hat aye sir he was ahead of time and verling would expect that he was tall and thin with a strong beaky nose which seemed to guide his pitiless eyes straight to any flaw or misdemeanour in the world around him his world but his appearance now was unexpected and almost unnerving verling had turned his back on the usual handful of watchkeepers who were always close by the entry port marine sentries in their scarlet coats and white crossbelts a boatswains mate with his silver call ready to pipe or pass any command immediately when so ordered the sideboys smart in their checkered shirts nimble enough to leap down and assist any boats coming alongside and the officer of the watch who was making a point of studying the gangway log and frowning with concentration for verlings benefit no doubt bolitho knew he was being unfair but could not help it the lieutenant was new to the ship and to his rank he had been a midshipman himself only months ago but you would never know it from his manner his name was egmont and he was already heartily disliked verling said remember what i told you it is not a contest nor an official corroboration of your general efficiency the captains report will have dealt with that it goes deeper much deeper his eyes moved briefly to bolithos face but seemed to cover him completely the board will decide and that decision is final he almost shrugged this time in any case he touched the watch fob that hung from his breeches pocket but did not look at it he had made his point so you had not forgotten mr dancer i am glad to know it sir as if in confirmation eight bells chimed out from the forecastle belfry attention on the upper deck face aft calls trilled and from across the water came the measured blare of a trumpet part of life itself colours were being hoisted and there would be several telescopes observing from the shore and the flagship to make certain that no one and no ship was caught unawares midshipman martyn dancer exhaled slowly and nodded to his friend had to go back to the mess dick forgot my protector today of all days it was a small grotesque carving more like a demon than a symbol of good fortune but dancer was never without it bolitho had first seen it after his ordeal with the smugglers dancer still bore the bruises but claimed that his protector had saved him from far worse verling was saying i wish you well we all do and remember this the pair of you you speak for yourselves but today you represent this ship he permitted himself a thin smile go to it boats alongside sir bolitho grinned at his friend it was only right that they should be together today after all that had happened lieutenant montagu verling watched them climb down to the launch which had hooked on to the stairs beneath the port had he ever been like that he wondered cast off shove off forrard the boat caught on the tide veered away from the big twodeckers side oars upright in twin lines the coxswain gripping the tillerbar gauging the moment verling was still watching them it was not like him and he was a little surprised by it the carpenter and the boatswain would be waiting with yet more lists work to be done stores or cordage not yet arrived or the wrong sort if they had for he was the first lieutenant right aft beneath that big ensign curling in a steady southwesterly the captain was in his quarters secure in the knowledge that this refit would be completed on time that would please the admiral and so on up the chain of command verling saw the oars fanning out on the launchs sides like wings while the crew leaned aft to take the strain perhaps one day soon give way together he swung round and saw the new lieutenant trying to catch his eye it was wrong to harbour personal dislikes in your own wardroom he turned and stared across the sharkblue water but the launch was already out of sight amongst other anchored ships suddenly he was glad that he had made a point of being here when the midshipmen had departed whatever the outcome of their examinations today he rearranged his features into the mask of command and strode toward a working party struggling with another tackleload of timber take a turn you perkins jump about man the first lieutenant had returned in spite of the deep swell the gorgons launch soon gathered way once clear of the twodeckers side fourteen oars doublebanked pulling in a strong but unhurried stroke carried her past other anchored menofwar with apparent ease the coxswain a tough and experienced seaman was unconcerned the ship had been so long at anchor during the overhaul that he had grown used to most of the other vessels and the comings and goings of their boats on the endless errands of the squadron and the man whose flag flew above the powerful threedecker which he could see in miniature framed between the shoulders of his two bowmen the flagship like most of his mates the coxswain had never laid eyes on the admiral but he was here a presence and that was enough bolitho tugged his cocked hat more tightly over his forehead he was shivering and tightened his fingers around the thwart damp and unyielding beneath his buttocks but it was not the cold nor the occasional needles of spray drifting aft from the stem they had all discussed it of course something far away in the future vaguely unreal he glanced at his companion even that was unreal what had drawn them to one another in the first place and after today would they ever meet again the navy was like that a family some described it but it was hard on true friendship they were the same age with only a month between them and so different they had joined gorgon together martyn dancer having been transferred from another ship which in turn had been going into dock for a complete refit about sixteen months ago before that he had by his own admission served only three months and two days in his britannic majestys service bolitho considered his own beginnings he had entered the navy as a midshipman at the tender age of twelve he thought of falmouth of all the portraits the faces that watched him on the stairs or by the study the bolitho familys might have been a history of the royal navy itself he thought too of his brother hugh who had been in temporary command of the revenue cutter avenger less than two months ago he and martyn had been ordered to join him an odd and daring experience he looked over at his friend that had been unexpected too hugh his only brother had been the stranger he turned to watch the flagship closer now her reefed topsails and topgallants almost white in the glare the viceadmirals flag streaming from the foremast truck like blood and she had been martyns last ship his only ship three months and two days but he was here today for examination like me bolitho had served for five years there would be others today bracing themselves gauging the odds did hardened seasoned officers like verling ever look back and have doubts he stared up at the towering masts the tracery of black rigging and shrouds close to she was even more impressive a secondrate of ninety guns with a company of some eight hundred officers seamen and marines a world of its own bolithos first ship had been a big threedecker also and even after some four years aboard in that cramped and busy space there were faces he had never seen twice the hull loomed over them the long bowsprit and jib boom sweeping like a lance and the figurehead poseidon the god of the sea resplendent in new gilt paint which alone must have cost a months pay the gilt on the gingerbread the sailors called it the coxswain called stand by bows the two bowmen stood and tapped their blades together to signal the crew to be ready a ship shall be judged by her boats there were other boats at the booms or hooked on to the chains bolitho saw a lieutenant gesturing to the launch heard the coxswain mutter i can see you sir martyn touched his sleeve here we go dick their eyes met well show them eh like those other times not arrogance or conceit a sort of quiet assurance he had seen it in the rough and tumble of the midshipmens berth and again in the face of real chilling danger all in so short a while and yet they were like brothers boat yer oars the hull lurched against fenders and the coxswain stood by the tillerbar again his hat in one hand he looked at the two midshipmen one day theyd be like that bloody lieutenant up there at the nettings waving his arms about but he said good luck they were on their own the officer of the watch checked their names against a wellthumbed list and regarded the newcomers with a cold stare as if to ensure that they were presentable enough to be allowed further he glanced at dancers leather crossbelt take in the slack he looked on critically while dancer tugged the dirk into place and added this is the flagship so dont you forget it he signalled to a young messenger hell take you to the captains clerk show you where to wait bolitho said are there many here for the board sir the lieutenant considered it theyre not dragging their feet ill say that for them he relented a little you will be the last today he swung round to beckon to another seaman and dancer said quietly i hope we can get something to eat while were waiting bolitho smiled and felt sheer hilarity bubbling up like a dam breaking dancer could do always do it no matter how tense the situation they followed the messenger the ship reaching around and above them a teeming world of packed humanity separated only by the invisible boundaries of status or rank as a mere boy it had been like being carried on a tide with all the bumps and bruises spiritual as well as physical you might expect along the way and the characters the good and the bad those you trusted on sight and others on whom you would never turn your back without risk and always busy ceremonial one moment court martial the next he felt the smile on his lips again and always hungry the captains clerk was a pale solemn individual who would have passed as a clergyman ashore or in more suitable surroundings his cabin was close to the marines messdeck and stores the barracks as they termed it and above the other shipboard sounds they could hear the clatter of weapons and military equipment and the thump of heavy boots the captains clerk colchester seemed oblivious to everything but his own work and the position which set him apart from the crowded world around him he waited for the two midshipmen to seat themselves on a bench halfcovered by documents neatly tied with blue ribbon it looked chaotic but bolitho had the feeling that colchester would know immediately if a single item was misplaced he regarded them with an expression that might have been patience or boredom the board today consists of three captains unlike the more usual practice of one captain and two junior officers he cleared his throat the sound like a gunshot in the paperfilled cabin three captains dancer had told him what to expect to warn him this very morning while they had been trying to dress and prepare themselves mentally in the noise and upheaval of the midshipmens berth it had seemed worse than usual and the mess space was further reduced by stores and bedding from the sick quarters nearby how had dancer known about the boards members he did not seem troubled by it but that was dancer his way his shield no wonder he had won a kind of respect even from some of the hard men in gorgons company and from bolithos sister nancy in the short time dancer had stayed at the house in falmouth she was only sixteen and it was hard for bolitho to accept her as a woman she was more used to the youngsters around falmouth farmers sons and the callow young men who made up the bulk of the officers at the garrisons in pendennis and truro but it had not been merely his imagination she and dancer had seemed to belong together three captains there was no point in wondering why a sudden sense of urgency unlikely there were far too many officers in a state of stalemate with no prospect of promotion only war increased demand and cleared the way on the navy list or perhaps it was the admirals idea he looked over at dancer who appeared serenely oblivious colchester said you will wait here until you are called he got slowly to his feet his lank hair brushing the deckhead beams be patient gentlemen always fire on the uproll dancer watched him leave and said if i get through today dick i shall always owe it to you not so confident then bolitho looked away the words lingering in his mind he had thought it was the other way around not a contest waiting was the worst part more than either of them would admit and here they were shut off from life while the great ship throbbed and murmured above and around them the clerks cabin consisted merely of the screens which separated it from the marines quarters and stores and was devoid of ports the only light came from vents above the door and two small lanterns how colchester coped with his letters and files was a mystery it was now afternoon and apart from a brief visit by a young midshipman who had hovered half in and half outside the screen door as a seaman had delivered a plate of biscuits and a jug of wine they had seen nobody the midshipman whom bolitho thought was about twelve years old seemed almost too frightened to speak as if he had been ordered not to confide in or converse with anyone waiting to face the board so young i must have been like that in manxman it had been his first ship even now poseidon was evoking those memories constant movement like a small town the click of heels the thud of bare feet and the heavier stamp of boots he cocked his head the marines must have abandoned their barracks to carry out drills on the upper deck or some special ceremony this was the flagship after all dancer was on his feet again his face almost pressed against the door im beginning to think my father was right dick that i should have followed his advice and stayed on dry land they listened to the rumble of gun trucks one of the upper deck twelvepounders being moved to train a new crew or for care and maintenance at least they were doing something dancer sighed and sat down again i was just thinking about your sister he ran his fingers through his fair hair a habit bolitho had come to know and recognise he was coming to a decision it was such a pleasure to meet her nancy i could have talked with her for ages i was wondering they both turned as the door clicked open another seaman this time but the same midshipman hovering at a distance the white patches on his uniform very clean and bright in the filtered sunlight from a grating above his head just come for this gear sir the seaman gathered up the plates and the wine jug which was empty although neither of them could recall drinking the contents he half turned as the midshipman outside the door answered someone who was passing friends or a matter of duty it was not clear but it was like a signal he looked quickly at dancer then leaned over toward bolitho i served with capn james bolitho sir in the old dunbar it was he darted another glance at the door but the voices were continuing as before he added quietly e were good to me i said id never forget bolitho waited afraid to interrupt this man had served under his father the dunbar had been james bolithos first command well before his own time but as familiar to him as the family portraits the seaman was not going to ask any favours he wanted to repay one and he was afraid even now my father yes he knew dancer was listening but keeping his distance possibly with disapproval capn greville he leaned closer and bolitho could smell the heavy rum e commands the odin he reached out as if to touch his arm but withdrew just as quickly perhaps regretting what he had begun the young midshipman was calling tomorrow at noon john ill not forget bolitho said quietly tell me you can rest easy the ship named odin was a seventyfour like gorgon and in the same squadron and that was all he knew except that it was important to this seaman who had once served his father the plates and the jug clashed together and the man blurted out grevilles bad right the way through he nodded to emphasise it right through the door swung slightly and the young voice rapped come along webber dont take all day the door closed and they were alone again he might have been a ghost bolitho spread his hands maybe i was wrong to let him speak like that because he knew my father i suppose but the rest dancer made a cautioning gesture it cost him something to come here he was afraid more than afraid he seemed to be listening one thing i do know captain greville is on the board here and now he regarded bolitho steadily his eyes very blue like the sky which had begun the day so be warned my friend the door swung open follow me if you please bolitho walked out of the cabin trying to remember exactly what the unknown seaman had said but he kept hearing his fathers voice instead seeing him it was the closest they had been for a long long time the young midshipman trotted briskly ahead of them as if he were afraid they might try to break the silence he had maintained perhaps it was policy in the flagship to keep candidates from any contact that might prepare or warn them against what lay in store it was certainly true that they had seen no other young gentlemen here for the same rendezvous up another ladder and past one of the long messdecks scrubbed tables and benches between each pair of guns home to the men who worked and fought the ship and the guns were always here from the moment when the pipe called them to lash up and stow their hammocks to sunset and pipe down the constant reminder that this was no safe dwelling but a manofwar dancer was close behind him and bolitho wondered if he remembered these surroundings as intensely after so many months like his own first ship the noise and the smells men always in close contact cooking or stale food damp clothing damp everything most of the hands were at work but there were still plenty of figures between decks and he saw a glance here and there casual or disinterested it was hard to distinguish in the gloom the gunports that lined either beam were sealed a wise precaution against the january chill and the keen air from the sound as in gorgon only the galley fires provided any heat and they would be kept as low as possible to avoid wasting fuel the purser would make sure of that another climb now to the impressive expanse of the quarterdeck where the day seemed startlingly clear and light bolitho stared up at the towering mizzen mast and spars the furled sails and the ensign he had seen from the launch this morning still lifting and curling beyond the poop about seven hours ago and the ordeal had not even begun they had talked about it often enough been warned what to expect even if they survived the selection process today being successful and actually receiving the coveted commission were often two very different matters a sign of the times with promotion only for the lucky and the clouds of war as yet unknown to those of their own age and service a tall lieutenant was standing by the hammock nettings a telescope trained on the shore and a boatswains mate waiting close by apart from two seamen polishing the fittings around the compass box and the great double wheel by the poop ladders the deck was deserted after the confines of the world below it seemed an almost sacred place bolitho looked at the land the hills were edged with copper hard to believe it would be dark before long perhaps the examination had been postponed cancelled so the last two the lieutenant had moved and sounded impatient you know what to do he hardly spared them a glance get along with you he was already striding to the quarterdeck rail straightening his coat as he went bolitho stared at the fresh gilt paintwork the scrubbed gratings and perfectly flaked lines and halliards the empty marines mess the sound of oars alongside no doubt at the ornate entry port the admiral was about to go ashore or visit another ship of the line in his command their youthful guide quickened his pace past the wheel and bolitho saw that the two seamen were packing away their cleaning gear down another hatchway where the deck planking was covered with blackandwhite chequered canvas he could see that the hand ropes were smartly pipeclayed and a marine sentry or at least the lower half of one was standing rigidly beside the screen doors of the great day and dining cabin the admirals quarters wait another screen loomed before them freshly painted like white glass in the light from the quarterdeck similar to the one directly beneath them dancer nudged him with his elbow the admirals on the prowl and i thought it was all for us he was even smiling a servant ushered them into a lobby partitioned from the main cabin by more screens which could be hoisted and bolted to the deckhead if the ship was cleared for action there were two or three comfortable chairs sharing the deck space with one of the after batterys twelvepounders the cabin servant studied them severely and pointed to a bench by a sealed port when you are called he had the stiff tired face of a man who had seen it all before their midshipman guide had vanished they sat side by side almost soundless here the highest part of the ship there was a skylight almost directly above them and bolitho could see the mizzen shrouds and part of a spar the sky holding its light beyond after all this time nearly six years of his life in the navy and he still had no head for heights even now when the sails cracked and shook and the pipe shrilled all hands aloft he had to force himself to respond when we get back to gorgon dick dancer was gazing at the screen door i have something hoarded away for this occasion nervous now unsure it went far deeper he said lightly youll be fine martyn under full sail remember dancer said in an odd voice youll never know but the smile was back bless you mister midshipman dancer they were both on their feet unconsciously and the screen door was being held partly open by the cabin servant as if he were guarding it there was no time for words perhaps there were none to say they touched hands like two friends passing in the street and bolitho was alone he wanted to sit down to gather his thoughts perhaps in one of those comfortable chairs as some act of defiance instead he stood directly beneath the skylight and stared up at the mizzen shrouds and the empty sky and very slowly an inch at a time made his mind and body relax come to terms with this moment they had even joked about it looked sometimes at the lieutenants and wondered if they had ever had qualms and in some cases how they had passed and again the face and the words of the seaman kept coming back he should have stopped him there and then they were all told often enough never to listen to gossip or condone it in the crowded world of a manofwar it could end in facetoface confrontation insubordination or worse he concentrated on the screen door the great cabin was part of but so completely separate from this vast threedecker here the captain could entertain his particular friends and favoured subordinates even the most junior if it suited him bolitho himself had been invited into the captains quarters aboard gorgon on two occasions once on the kings birthday when as the youngest present he had been required to give the loyal toast and another to wait upon some female guests and ensure that they did not stumble on the ladders between decks or entangle their gowns while entering or leaving the boats alongside he thought of dancer again always so at ease with women outwardly anyway it was not something false or done for effect bolitho had known plenty like that martyn dancer was of a different breed something he had noticed even when they had first met his father was a wealthy worldly man of influence and authority who had made it plain from the outset that he was opposed to his sons choice of career throwing his wits to the wind as he had put it more than once and he had seen it in his sisters eyes when she and martyn had talked and laughed together and in the watchful glances from his mother he walked to the opposite end of the screened lobby and peered through to the big double wheel at the scrubbed gratings where two or more helmsmen would stand when the ship was under way and heeling over to her towering pyramid of canvas another grating was propped upright by the mizzen probably to dry but suddenly reminiscent of those faroff days in manxman and the first flogging he had ever witnessed it was something you had to accept a necessary discipline what else would deter the persistent offender accept perhaps but bolitho had never grown accustomed to it and yet he had seen some of the older hands bare their backs and boast of their endurance of the cat as if the terrible scars were something to be carried with pride he could still remember standing with the other midshipmen the very first time he had heard the pipe all hands lay aft to witness punishment he had found himself gripping the arm of another middy his entire body shaking to every crack of the lash across the torn skin and that other stark and brutal memory which never completely left him months or even a year after that when he had been facetoface with an enemy unskilled and desperate and carried bodily by the stamping cursing crush of boarders across the other vessels deck pirates smugglers rebels they were the enemy cutlass pike and boarding axe their faces masks of hate and anger sailors he knew or thought he knew stabbing and hacking heedless of the screams men falling voices urging them forward and then there had been one face so near that he could smell the sweat and feel his breath and eyes which had seemed to fill it he remembered seeing the blade like a cutlass and had wanted to cry out he had been gripping the hanger in his fist as if he were holding on to life itself the blow to his shoulder had numbed it before the agony began but the eyes were still staring at him fixed with shock or disbelief and then he fell the weight of his body almost dragging the blade from bolithos fingers and a harsh voice almost in his ear he had never discovered whose leave im es done for done for he had killed someone a lifetime ago he could still feel the blade jerk in his fist as if he had only just been called to action and seen a human being fall beneath his stroke he swung round and found the cabin servant watching him no sound no word he had even lost track of time come sir it was too soon where was martyn but the door to the inner cabin was open waiting he thought suddenly wildly of lieutenant verlings words this morning it is not a contest he strode past the servant and heard the screen door close behind him two tables had been placed end to end across the big dining cabin behind which sat the three captains of the board it was like walking onto a stage with no audience only the three motionless figures who were framed against the flag captains private day cabin behind them the stern and quarter windows held and reflected every sort of light from the sea below and beyond the poop to the deepening purple haze of the main anchorage there were already candles burning so that the three figures on the other side of the table were almost in shadow there was one tall chair facing them if any uncertainty still lingered in the newcomers mind it was quickly dispelled a sword complete with belt was laid across it bolitho stood beside it and said richard bolitho midshipman sir even his voice sounded unfamiliar he thought fleetingly of dancer how had he fared at this table all it needed was the sword lying across it with the point toward him and it would be more like a courtmartial than an interview that might lead to promotion be at your ease mr bolitho you are here today because others are prepared to recommend you be truthful and frank with us and my brother officers and i will be likewise captain sir william proby did not trouble to introduce himself there was no need an unorthodox some said eccentric officer who had distinguished himself in the seven years war and in two campaigns in the caribbean he had served until recently as actingcommodore with the channel fleet it was rumoured that he was next in line for flag rank bolitho had seen him several times when carrying despatches to his present command the scylla a seventyfour like gorgon but half her age the officer sitting on his right he also knew captain robert maude was comparatively young with an alert intelligent face and he commanded the condor a sleek thirtytwo gun frigate and was doubtless envied by many because of it condor was rarely at anchor for long even now maude was glancing through the adjoining cabin perhaps at the shadows on the water or the small boat passing the flagships quarter and showing a solitary lantern the third member of the board sat with one elbow on the table his free hand resting on some certificates and a midshipmans log my log even if he had never met or spoken with the unknown seaman he felt he would have recognised captain john greville of the odin he could still hear the voice grevilles bad right the way through a narrow pointed face not unlike that of verling but tightlipped very contained the eyes were in shadow proby said in matters of general seamanship your reports read well it seems you suffer from an acute dislike of heights but you have overcome it a hint of a smile outwardly at least having taken charge of a landing party with ships boats what cover would you prepare if resistance was expected round shot if a gun was available sir to give time for my people to move into position proby opened his mouth as if to answer and frowned as captain greville said sharply grape or canister would be far more effective i would have thought later perhaps sir but there is too much risk with either of hitting my own men greville ruffled the corners of the papers a few eggs have to be broken sometimes bolitho proby tapped the table they are people john not eggs but he was smiling as he turned to his other side you have some points on gunnery maude while we touch upon the subject polite but strangers maude leaned forward and bolitho guessed that he was very tall it would be a constant handicap below decks in a frigate in a large ship of the line a threedecker he lifted his hand this one for instance the order to beat to quarters has just been called and the ship cleared for action you are stationed on the lower gun deck and in charge of a division what precautions will you take the hand gestured again consider it he was leaning back in his chair now his head slightly on one side as if completely relaxed and bolitho felt his own tension slipping away in response maudes voice or perhaps his manner seemed to exclude the others and ease his uncertainty it was almost like having a conversation with an old friend he said lower gun deck thirtytwo pounders long nines the hand moved very slightly and he went on nine feet long sir he saw him nod as if to encourage him seven men in each gun crew the captain responsible for giving a set task to each one and assigning a number to each the lower the number the greater the skill proby cleared his throat loudly suppose this ship is about to engage an enemy to windrd with the deck tilting to the wind how would seven men manage to haul the gun up to its port a long nine weighs a pretty piece id say bolitho wanted to lick his dry lips anything he answered three tons sir he waited but nobody commented i would take men from the gun on the opposite side with the same precautions to ensure no hands and feet were broken or damaged when the gun recoiled but bandages should always be close by you seem to care a great deal for their welfare bolitho but the fight should always come first bolitho felt his fingers relax he had not realised that his hands had been so tightly clenched it was greville in some strange way the challenge was almost a relief he said badly injured men cannot fight a gun sir it could delay a complete broadside but the battle is joined it was maude again loading firing and once more running out provided of course that you have enough men is there anything else against which you should guard every third shot or so ill have the barrel cleaned out its full length with the worm and then the sponge remove any burning fragment and to prevent a misfire when a new charge is rammed home maude nodded discipline is everything in gunnery as in most matters in our service all orders will be obeyed without question i daresay you have heard that a few hundred times since you donned the kings coat bolitho looked at him a strong proud face not unlike the sketches of captain james cook he had seen in the gazette accompanying tales of his latest voyages a man you would willingly serve no matter what he said it is far easier to drive than to lead sir but i believe that trust is all important on both sides maude folded his arms only then will you get the dedication you need when the odds are against you proby glanced past him is that all maude and swung round abruptly on his chair what the hell i gave strict orders but all three captains were on their feet and the air was suddenly sharp blowing from the outside world the creaking of the rigging was audible now and the occasional scream of gulls circling over incoming fishermen bolitho wanted to turn and identify the newcomer who had burst uninvited and unexpectedly into this meeting like waking from a bad dream he thought a nightmare the three captains rigid behind the table and maudes height indeed compelling him to bend beneath the deckhead beams excuse my untimely interruption gentlemen my barge is alongside and i would not wish to keep my coxn waiting much longer but i wanted to bid you farewell and thank you for carrying out these duties from which we shall all benefit in due course bolitho flinched as a hand touched his sleeve and who is this i was assured that you had finished here today it sounded more like an accusation than an apology bolitho turned and faced him he had seen him only once before when his own boat had tossed oars to the barge and he had had the briefest glimpse of viceadmiral sir james hamilton the great man himself his uniform and lace gleaming in the reflected light cocked hat casually balanced in his other hand half smiling now cornishman eh he knew his mouth had moved and he had said something but it had been like hearing someone else blurting out his name the admiral was looking keenly at him it felt like being stripped then he nodded as if some thought had dropped into place some inner reference been made i hope the future is kind to you er bolitho he turned away the contact broken now i must leave you i have duties ashore events are moving once more he reached the door and bolitho could see the flag captain hovering with a boat cloak draped carefully across his arm for a long time or so it seemed they all stood in silence swaying only occasionally as the flagship pulled at her cable bolitho realised that sir william proby was seated once again his expression a mixture of bemusement and relief an unforeseen interruption gentlemen he paused to listen as calls trilled in the distance followed by the muffled bark of commands the admirals barge was casting off if you have no further questions he was not apparently anticipating any he looked at bolitho be seated if you please bolitho stared at the solitary chair the sword had vanished proby scratched his quill across a certificate and said on behalf of this board mr bolitho i congratulate you he came around the table before bolitho could lever himself out of the chair proby was a substantial figure but he had scarcely seen him move he was on his feet finally and proby was shaking his hand and saying we wish you a speedy promotion now it was maudes turn shaking his hand abruptly and looking down at him with a smile he would always remember he had passed it might be next month or a year from now before he actually received that lieutenants commission but he had passed the cabin servant was placing some fine goblets on a tray but there were only three he took a deep deep breath wanting to laugh or cry it was over and it was dark beyond the stern windows he picked up his hat and walked to the door almost expecting his legs to fail him it was over he must find martyn make sure that he paused and glanced back at the cabin the hands reaching for filled glasses tomorrow they would have forgotten him put it behind them it was only another examination captain greville had not shaken his hand and he was glad of it he saw the bench where they had waited no turning back no matter what i am a kings officer almost then he did touch his eyes a favour for the captain lieutenant montagu verling stood at gorgons quarterdeck rail his hands on his hips watching a party of seamen clambering over the boattier below him one of the ships two cutters swayed across the nettings like an ungainly whale while hoggett the boatswain gestured with his fist his voice carrying easily above the noise of other work and the clatter of loose rigging this will not take long verling swore softly as a seaman slithered and fell on the wet planking it had been raining all night and now in the grey forenoon the weather showed little improvement plymouth was almost hidden in mist a spire or rooftop showing here and there like projections of a reef bolitho was also watching the cutter now being moved into position above the tier at last they were replacing things and most of the debris left by the refit had vanished some lashings remained to be done and canvas awnings had been spread to protect paintwork and fresh pitch between decks order had already been restored with stores and spare equipment stowed away and messdecks cleared of clutter and gear that belonged elsewhere in the hull he tried to stifle a yawn surprised that he had been able to drag himself out of sleep and present himself on deck at the chime of the bell he turned to peer above the quarterdeck nettings with their neatly stacked hammocks the cold air wet on his face even that did not revive him and there was a painful crick in his neck he saw the topmasts of the big threedecker drifting out of the mist at the far end of the anchorage the flagship he could even make out the vague dash of colour from her ensign the bulk of the ship remained hidden by the fog he winced but his spirits soared at the memory had that been only yesterday was it possible lower away andsomely there hoggetts voice which seemed even louder on this raw morning the cutter began to descend the men on the tackles taking the strain feet somehow finding a grip on the slippery planking vast lowering he heard dancer give a groan my head dick i feel like death even the board itself was hard to fix in the mind like a dream fast disappearing only certain moments remained clear the three figures at the table an empty chair and the sudden startling interruption when the admiral had made his entrance perhaps the handshakes remained most vivid in his memory we wish you a speedy promotion then back to gorgon in darkness passing an overloaded boat full of sailors all of whom sounded drunk probably just paid off from some merchantman he and dancer had been unable to stop laughing at the string of curses launched by their own coxswain then in the midshipmens berth the heavy silence of some hunched over written notes studying or pretending to by the flickering light of glims or apparently asleep being shattered as they had risen as one a midshipmans salute to any successful candidate for promotion hoarded drinks appearing which had ranged from blackstrap to cognac helped down by beer from the mess cask with a mock fight known as boarders away to round off the occasion it had taken threats of physical violence from the warrant officers mess to quieten the celebration bolitho cleared his throat or tried to and now the captain wanted them aft in the great cabin verling waved to the boatswain as the cutter finally came to rest on the tier even the new paint was unmarked he said the captain is going over to poseidon very soon the admiral has called a conference all senior captains somethings in the wind he gazed critically at the two midshipmen under the circumstances i suppose he left the rest unsaid bolitho thought of the admiral again the hand on his arm i have duties to perform events are moving once more was that the real reason he had interrupted the examination without it what might have happened he recalled grevilles sarcasm his refusal to shake his hand he had mentioned it to dancer and he had passed it off by saying greville shook my hand but i could have done without it i still cant remember half of what i said to them i was in a daze it was something shared after that real they had hugged one another each glad for the other and now they were to see the captain after all this time he remained remote almost unknown and yet nothing had any real purpose without him without his presence at any ceremonial or drill with sails and guns he was always there usually with verling nearby an extension of himself he was there to announce any achievement by the ship or even an individual and to read the articles of war before awarding punishment bolitho had once heard a friend of his fathers say that when a kings ship was away from the fleet and free of the admirals apron strings all that stood between a captain and chaos were the articles of war and a line of marines across the poop and he still recalled his fathers quick retort it would all depend on that captain only yesterday and yet he could feel the change in himself sense the scrutiny of the younger midshipmen as if he represented something some possibility no longer beyond their grasp how does it feel to be one of them he was still grappling with his own emotions and the prospect of a new future verling had tugged out his watch i shall take you aft he faced them again several others failed to satisfy the almighty yesterday he did not smile not certain what i would have decided they followed him aft not quite reassured captain beves conway was standing by a small desk fastening the cuff of his shirt his dress uniform coat hung across the back of a chair with his hat nearby he was preparing for the admiral they had passed gorgons surgeon as he was leaving a stooping figure of indeterminate age with a thin almost lipless mouth bolitho had heard some of the old jacks say that he would rather bury you than cure you if you ever fell into his hands but they said that about most surgeons he wondered what he had been doing for the captain he had noticed that conway sometimes held one shoulder stiffly like now as he slipped into his coat a wound he had taken during the caribbean campaign against the french he had heard although others had hinted at a duel fought of course over a lady he realised that there was another person in the cabin perched on a chest by the screen the captains coxswain a big powerful man always smart and instantly recognisable in his giltbuttoned coat and nankeen breeches he seemed to come and go as he chose more like a trusted companion than a subordinate he was holding a drawn sword now running a cloth slowly up and down the blade he glanced briefly at the two midshipmen but nothing more he belonged they were merely visitors conway smiled you did well both of you full credit to the ship also verling said ill come aft when youre ready sir the screen door closed behind him he had spoken to the marine sentry by name when they had arrived at the lobby a gift or careful training it was impossible to know but bolitho guessed it was rare enough he had known some officers who had never cared to learn a name and match it to a face he had heard verling quietly rebuking one of the senior midshipmen who had since gone to another ship they are people flesh and blood remember that will you bolitho wondered if he had passed or failed at his board the captain said suddenly a moment and beckoned come and see condor spread her skirts a sight that never fails to excite any true sailor they followed him into the main cabin where the stern windows reached from quarter to quarter and the panorama of ships and anchorage shimmered against the saltsmeared glass like some unfinished painting and here was the frigate condor topsails and forecourses already set and filling to the wind now shredding the sea mist her masthead pendant and ensign stiff and bright as metal against the clouds yesterday her captain twisting round in his chair aboard the flagship gauging the sea the mood of the weather impatient to go and no wonder he turned as conway asked do you see yourself in command of a frigate one day bolitho given the chance sir he got no further conway moved closer watching condors outline shorten her yards shifting as she changed tack toward open water and the sea he said dont wait to be given the chance take it or others will he turned abruptly and walked across the cabin bolitho wanted to hold the moment cherish it this was the captain as he might never see him again perhaps older than he had thought but virile and vigorous something the streaks of grey at his temples and the crows feet around his eyes could not flaw or diminish he said this damned overhaul is all but finished thank god he looked up and around the cabin perhaps without seeing it or seeing it in a way they could not yet understand this lady will be fit and ready for sea again if i and the first lieutenant have any say in the matter after that he touched the chair that stood squarely facing the constantly changing panorama who can say his expression changed and seemed angry embarrassed he said almost sharply i have a favour to ask ive taken enough of your time and the ships as it is bolitho saw dancer gripping a fold of his coat another habit he had come to recognise and sometimes understand it happened when he was surprised or moved by something he had not anticipated captain beves conway experienced post captain who had seen action and served in most waters where the ensign commanded respect had a favour to ask beyond these massive timbers the other world continued to function unimpaired the trill of a boatswains call and a shouted command too muffled to distinguish the squeal of tackles as another load of stores or equipment was hoisted aboard a ship preparing for sea it was what conway cared about most perhaps all he cared about he said you will be leaving gorgon shortly on a brief passage duty there was a suggestion of a smile not like your daring adventure with the revenue service bolitho i believe your own brother was in command on that occasion a family affair it would seem the smile was gone but it will stand you in good stead when you are finally commissioned mr verling will give you the details it was like a fist striking out of nowhere conway was leaving the ship giving up command and it was all he had a new midshipman is joining tomorrow forenoon his name is andrew sewell and he is fifteen years old he glanced from one to the other suddenly relaxed as if some weight had been lifted from him a mere boy compared with you seasoned mariners he has everything to learn and it was his fathers dearest wish that he should follow his familys tradition and become a sea officer his father was a great friend of mine perhaps my best but alas now dead just offer him a hand when it is needed will you do that like a challenge for me bolitho turned as dancer asked first ship sir not his first conway looked at the reflections rippling across the curved deckhead he has served for two months in odin captain greville and before that in the ramillies with the downs squadron he looked from one to the other i know from your behaviour and your reports and what i have seen for myself that you are well suited to your profession maybe because you come from very different backgrounds or in spite of it it might be said that young andrew sewell is totally unsuited a victim of circumstances he shrugged and bolitho saw the flicker of pain in his face the marine sentry stamped his feet somewhere beyond the screen verling must be back and was waiting conway said my old friend is dead it is the last thing i can do for him and perhaps the least his coxswain had appeared his hat beneath his arm and conways sword in his fist no words like an understanding between them dancer offered my father was firmly against my going to sea sir bolitho nodded and i never had any choice sir conway held out his arms as his coxswain deftly clipped the sword into place so be it and i thank you young andrew must learn that you do not necessarily have to leave your own deck to confront an enemy he shook hands gravely with both of them may good fortune go with you he half turned as if unwilling to leave his coxswain had already departed and verlings shadow stood across the outer screen when you return to the ship your new orders may be waiting for you if not then be patient he picked up his hat and visibly squared his shoulders he was in command again the two midshipmen waited without speaking listening to the shouted commands and eventually the calls as the side was piped and conways gig pulled away then dancer murmured whatever ship i join ill never forget him they left the great cabin in silence passing the same marine sentry their weariness headaches and sore throats forgotten bolitho considered the passage duty conway had mentioned probably helping to move another ship to different moorings for some refit or overhaul and after that he glanced over at dancer they would be parted it was the way of the navy like conway saying goodbye the hardest duty of all hotspur martyn dancer gripped the launchs gunwale and pointed across the larboard bow there she is dick the hotspur ill not want to leave this beauty when the time comes excitement or sheer pleasure bolitho had not seen him like this before perhaps strain and uncertainty which he had always been able to conceal were at last giving way bolitho felt it too the hotspur which had not even been discussed until today as if it were a sworn secret was a topsail schooner small if set against any frigate or brig but her style and lines would catch any real sailors eye immediately she was lying at her anchor and rolling evenly in the swell showing her copper bright in the forenoon sun and the rake of her twin masts a thoroughbred and said to be new and untried straight from her builder but the ensign flying from her gaff and the few uniforms moving about her deck were identical to those they had left astern in gorgon and all the other menofwar that lay at plymouth she was a kings ship it was difficult to accept the speed of the events which had brought them here from the moment they had reported to the first lieutenant their feet had barely stopped until now verling had explained almost curtly they were to be part of a passage crew not to move some hulk or ship awaiting overhaul but to deliver hotspur to the authorities in guernsey as a replacement for an older vessel used in the waters around the channel islands for patrol and pilotage it was another world to them and an escape after all the waiting and doubt and then yesterdays climax again he felt the exhilaration run through him like his friend beside him dancer was pointing at the schooner again calling something to the cutters coxswain and it was the same coxswain and boats crew which had taken them to the flagship he heard dancer laugh and nudged him sharply with his elbow this sense of lighthearted freedom and excitement would cut no ice with verling who was sitting silent and straightbacked by the tiller the first lieutenant was always very strict when it came to behaviour in boats maintaining that the ship would be judged accordingly as every middy soon learned when he came under that disapproving eye but even verling seemed different it was something in the air from the start of the day when the hands had been called to lash up and stow their hammocks bolitho had seen the captain speaking with him just before the cutter had cast off maybe it was only imagination but conway too seemed altered unlike that brief interlude in the great cabin the mood of defeat almost valediction had vanished and the old conway had returned bolitho had seen him clap verling on the shoulder this morning had even heard him laugh there were rumours of course in a hull crammed with some six hundred sailors and marines there were always those but this time there was substance the reason for the captains conference they said more trouble in the colonies particularly in boston massachusetts unrest fuelled by increased taxes and repressive legislation from london had taken a more aggressive form too often clashing with the local administration and so eventually the military although the british were hardened to war and the threat of rebellion the infamous memory of what had come to be called the boston massacre had left a far deeper scar on the public conscience than might have been expected a radical press had made certain of that bolitho had still been serving in manxman when it had happened and remembered poring over accounts in the newssheets a crowd of young people disturbing the peace on a winters night and coming facetoface with soldiers from the local garrison common enough here in england but more incendiary in a colony chafing under what it believed to be unjust taxation and seeking a louder voice in its own affairs at a different time perhaps a different man might have diffused the situation but the officer who was present had been convinced that only a show of force would disperse the crowd and the resulting volley of shots had killed half a dozen of the troublemakers it was hardly a massacre but it was bloodshed and the echoes of those muskets had never since been allowed to fade but to those who lived and all too often died on the sea it meant something else the need for readiness ships to be brought out of dock and stagnation men to be found to crew and if required fight them and perhaps officers of merit and experience captains like conway would view any unrest in america as a fresh chance of personal survival bolitho had heard his own brother hugh say as much during their time together in the revenue cutter avenger just weeks ago and it already seemed like an eternity his brother had been reserved almost unknowable and not only because he had been in temporary command he looked over at dancer it was strange he had heard hugh speaking earnestly and intently to him on several occasions when they had been on watch together two people who could have so little in common and yet theyve seen us at last thought theyd bin so long at anchor theyd forgot what they joined for that was the cutters other passenger tinker thorne gorgons senior boatswains mate there was no yarn that might be spun around him that could not be true it was impossible to guess his age although bolitho had heard that tinker had served in one ship or another for twentyfive years originally from dublin a patlander as all irishmen were nicknamed by the lower deck it was said he came of gypsy stock and had begun life mending pots and selling fishing gear on the roads he was not tall but stocky and muscular with skin like old leather and fists that could handle any unruly hawser or argumentative seaman before you could guess the next move he was watching the hotspur her tapering masts rising now above the doublebanked oars his expression amused and a little critical his eyes were bright blue like those of a much younger man looking out from a mask admired respected or hated its up to you boyo as he was heard to say when the occasion arose he shifted around on the thwart and said let some other jack take the strain while were away eh sir nobody else in the ship could speak so offhandedly to verling verling was still looking astern his face was hidden but his thoughts were clear enough i hope so tinker if weve forgotten anything ah even the cook knows what to do sir bolitho watched them with interest it was important that hotspur was in safe hands until she was delivered to her destination and verling had despatches with him from conway and probably the admiral it seemed significant and would do verlings own chances of promotion no harm but every pull of the oars was taking verling away from the ship and the life he cared about most and like bolithos brother hugh he had become unfamiliar it was like meeting a stranger he returned his attention to the schooner larger and heavier than he had first thought but with a grace any true sailor would relish tinker thorne saw his eyes and grinned old john barstow is the finest builder in the west country that he is a strange one an no mistake swears to god hes only once sailed out of sight of land an that was when he was caught in a fog off the lizard if you can swallow that the coxswain brought the cutter smoothly alongside with oars tossed and a bowman ready with his boat hook verling seized the ladder and said you can carry on swain watch those tackles when you stow the boat on the tier its all new untried aye sir ill keep a weather eye on things he might have been mistaken but bolitho thought he and tinker winked at one another but verling was turning to look once more at gorgon a small side party had assembled on the schooners deck and a net was rigged to hoist any personal gear on board they waited for verling as senior in the boat to leave first and dancer murmured look whos here dick surely hes not coming with us it was egmont the newest and most junior in gorgons wardroom he raised his hat in salute as verling climbed over the gunwale while the side party came stiffly to attention or tried to the schooner was no twodecker and the seamen were more used to gorgons massive bulk than a hull that seemed alive in the offshore current egmont almost lost his balance but managed to blurt out welcome aboard sir verling returned his salute coolly and paused to look forward along the deck bolitho could not see his face but guessed he was missing nothing not even the young lieutenants discomfort and anger and he saw he had no difficulty in keeping his balance verling said i trust everything is in hand mr egmont i see that the boats are stowed so nobody is still ashore egmont straightened his back as ordered sir ready for sea bolitho knew he was being unfair to egmont but it sounded like a boast as if he had manned and prepared the hotspur for duty singlehanded verling snapped where is mr sewell our new midshipman he should be here bolitho glanced at dancer verling was back in his proper role he even remembered the midshipmans name when he could hardly have found time to meet him egmont licked his lips below sir being sick he licked his lips again just the mention of it in this choppy sea was having its effect verling had not missed that either dismiss the hands we shall go aft i trust the chart and sailing instructions are ready too he did not wait for an answer but pulled out his watch and flicked open the guard with his thumbnail so be it the tide is right we shall weigh at noon and to the thickset boatswains mate carry on tinker you know your men picked em meself sir even the use of his nickname seemed correct and formal only verling could have carried that off he stopped in his stride stow your gear then report to me he saw dancer peering around and added calmly this is no lineofbattle ship mr dancer i expect you to know every stay block and spar by the time we drop anchor again the deck lurched as the schooner snubbed at her anchor cable and dancer said quietly winds getting up shant be sorry when we do get under way a moment you two it was egmont recovered it seemed from his performance earlier i know both of you have just satisfied the board yesterday wasnt it and you heard what mr verling said remember it well board or no board therell be no passengers on this deck ill make certain of that now stow your gear and be sharp about it they watched him turn away and gesticulate at some seamen his words lost in the wind dancer shrugged he needs a bigger ship that one if only for his head bolitho laughed lets go and find our fellow middy i suspect it wasnt only the motion that made him vomit verling paused on the after ladder his eyes level with the deck coaming it would be good to get away from the endless overhaul clearing up disorder and making the ship his ship ready to take her place again in response to any demand in gorgon he was still the first lieutenant transferred to any other ship he would be just another member of the wardroom with seniority but no future he felt the hull shiver again heard the clatter of loose rigging she was alive eager to go he touched the shining paintwork so be it then as tinker thorne had firmly declared the men chosen for hotspurs passage crew were all skilled and experienced hands who would be badly missed if their old twodecker was suddenly ordered to sea bolitho recognised most of them and felt a sense of belonging which was hard to understand although he had often heard older sailors describe it the initial unfamiliarity was gone at the moment of weighing anchor with the first pressure of bodies leaning on the capstan bars and the slow clank clank clank as the pawls started to respond all spare hands thrusting in time to tinkers hoarse commands midshipmen as well even the cook in his white smock two men on the wheel others waiting to let go an haul when the anchor broke free of the ground every piece of rigging joining the din blocks taking the strain ready for the canvas to fill and take command verling stood by the compass box his body poised for the moment of truth clank clank clank slower now a seaman right forward above the bowsprit peered aft and cupped his hands even so his voice was almost drowned by the noise of wind and rigging he had seen the stout cable now taut like a bar and pointing directly at the stem upanddown then anchors aweigh it was something bolitho would never forget nor want to the sudden slackness on the capstan as the cable came home the deck tilting so steeply that the lee scuppers were awash as the hull continued to heel over it was exciting awesome not even in the lively revenue cutter avenger had he known anything like it the great sails cracking and filling to the wind spray sluicing over them like icy rain feet sliding and kicking against the wet planking gasps and curses from men bent almost double in the battle against wind and rudder bolitho had watched plenty of smaller craft getting under way in a brisk wind it had always fascinated and moved him like seeing some great seabird spread its wings and lift from the water even through and above the noise he could hear verlings occasional commands could imagine him down aft by the wheel angled against the tilt of the deck watching each sail and the moving panorama of the land blurred now as if seen through wet glass and over all tinker thornes voice urging threatening catch another turn on that pin morgan move your bloody self will you or what dyou mean atkins you think leave that to jacks with brains bolitho saw the land a white tower or beacon bursting spray rocks along the headland a ship too moving anchored or aground it was impossible to tell he knew verling had put two leadsmen on either bow a necessary precaution when leaving harbour for the first time but it would take more than lead and line to save them if they misjudged the next cable or so over here tinker again you as well mr bolitho he was even managing to grin through the spray streaming down his leathery face remember what you was told no passengers despite the movement and confusion bolitho found he could smile even laugh suddenly into the spray the deck was steadier the snaking halliards and braces stiff and taut in their blocks and each great sail throwing its own pale reflection on the churning water alongside steady as you go verling now probably watching the final spur of headland that will be penlee point he almost slipped but a hand reached from somewhere and steadied him the face he knew but all he could gasp was bless you for that the seaman ducked to avoid another snake of wet cordage as it hissed around its block and grinned do the same for me the grin widened sir the sky beyond the shrouds and hard canvas seemed clearer the motion still lively but easier men were pausing at their work to look for a friend relief pride something of each on their faces across the quarter the headland had fallen away and lost its menace this time bolitho gripped a backstay and took a deep breath beyond the straining jib and staysails was open water the channel he felt dancer lurch against him his hand on his shoulder yesterday seemed a long way away they were free envy bolitho clambered through the main hatch and seized a stanchion as he steadied himself against the angle of the deck and waited for his vision to clear the night was pitch black the air and spray stinging his cheeks driving away all thoughts of sleep and that was the odd thing that he was still wide awake it was eight oclock and a full eight hours since hotspur had weighed anchor and struck south into the channel the thrill and confusion groping for unfamiliar cordage and becoming more accustomed to the schooners demands in a brisk northwesterly wind had settled into a pattern of order and purpose they were divided into two watches four hours on four off with the dogwatches giving a brief respite in which to devour a hot meal and fortify themselves with a tot of rum it all helped verling was handing over the watch now his tall shape just visible against the sliver of foam beyond the lee bulwark sou eastbysouth mr egmont she should be steady a while now that the topsails are snug the merest pause and bolitho imagined him staring down at the junior lieutenant making sure that there was no misunderstanding call me immediately if the sea gets up or anything else happens that i ought to know bolitho moved closer to the wheel and the two helmsmen he could see the bare feet of one pale against the wet planking during the first dogwatch he had seen the same seaman blowing onto his fingers to warm them against the bitter air but he was standing barefoot now with no show of discomfort he must have soles like leather another shadow moved past the wheel and he saw a face catch the glow from the compass box andrew sewell the new midshipman they had scarcely spoken since they had come aboard egmont had seen to that fifteen years old captain conway had said he looked younger nervous shy or possibly both he was a pleasantfaced youth with fair skin and hazel eyes and a quick smile that seemed only too rare he had helped bolitho lay out some charts in the precise way that verling always seemed to expect it had been then in the poor light of the main cabin that bolitho had seen sewells hands scarred torn and deeply bruised never given the chance to become accustomed to the demands of seamanship deliberately driven seemed the most likely explanation it was common enough even in todays navy he remembered the captains obvious concern for him perhaps not merely because of his dead father bolitho reached out impulsively and touched his elbow over here andrew a bit more sheltered he felt him start to pull away and added easy now sewell let his arm go limp ive just been sick again mister dick will do very well he waited sensing the caution the doubt sewell did not belong here suppose i had felt like that when i was packed off to sea in manxman he looked up and watched the fine curve of the great sail above them not shapeless now and pale blue in a shaft of light as the moon showed itself between banks of scudding cloud and the sea rising and falling like black glass reaching out on either beam endless with no horizon bolitho tugged the rough tarpaulin coat away from his neck it had rubbed his skin raw but he had not noticed he said this could be the middle of the atlantic or some other great ocean and just us sailing across it think of that sewell said you mean that and hesitated dick how you truly see it i suppose i do i cant really explain something made him stop like a warning as he felt sewell move slightly away nothing to do then it was egmont almost invisible in a boat cloak against the black water and heavy cloud i want a good watch kept at all times have you checked the deck log and the set course bolitho replied sou eastbysouth sir helm is steady egmont turned toward sewell did i hear you spewing up again god help us all i want you to check the glass yourself let every grain of sand run free before you turn it see i dont want you warming the glass every time just so you can run below and dream of home so do it he glanced at the wheel as the spokes creaked again watch your helm man and stand up smartly stay alert he swung away the boat cloak floating around him whats your name ill be watching you the seaman shifted his bare feet on the grating archer egmont looked at bolitho im going below to check the chart watch the helm and call me if you need advice he may have looked at the helmsman and archer say sir when you speak to an officer in the future he strode to the hatch bolitho clenched his fist then try to act like one he heard sewell gasp with surprise or disbelief and realised that he had spoken aloud but he smiled glad he was still able something else youve learned in hotspur mister sewell dont lose your temper so easily andrew sewell aged fifteen and the only son of a hero said nothing it was like a hand reaching out and he was no longer afraid to take it the helmsman named archer called winds gettin up sir he jerked his head as the wet canvas rattled and cracked loudly above them bolitho nodded my respects to mr egmont the mood was still on him no ill tell him myself tired elated angry sailors often blamed it on the wind he reached the hatch and called back remember no passengers the wheel jerked sharply as both helmsmen gripped the spokes and put their weight against it but the one named archer managed to laugh easy does it tom our dicks blood is on the boil hell see us right vague figures were moving to each mast the watch on deck and ready for the storm andrew sewell had heard the quick exchange between the two men at the wheel and felt something quite unknown to him it was envy the next few hours were ones even the old jacks were unlikely to forget a blustery succession of squalls became a strong wind that had all hands fighting each onslaught bruised and blinded by icy spray and the waves that burst across the bulwarks and swept down the scuppers like a tiderace all through the middle watch the storm continued its assault until even the most vociferous curses were beaten into silence but when the clouds eventually broke and a first hint of dawn showed itself against straining canvas and the crisscross of shining rigging hotspur was holding her own with not a spar or shroud broken bolitho had remembered tinker thornes admiration for her builder old john barstow the finest in the west country he had clung to those words more than once in the night when the sea had smashed against the hull or sent men sprawling like rag dolls in its wake tinkers voice had rarely been silent and his sturdy form was everywhere dragging a man from one task and shoving him into another putting an extra pair of hands on halliard or brace or bullying another too dazed to think clearly to add his weight to the pumps and verling was always there down aft holding himself upright while he watched the relentless battle of sea against rudder wind against canvas a few men were injured but none seriously with cuts and bruises or rope burns when human hands could no longer control wet cordage squealing through block or cleat and as suddenly as it had begun the wind eased and it was safe to move about the deck without pain or apprehension bolitho heard verling say another hour mr egmont and well get the topsis on her the winds backed a piece i want a landfall on guernsey not the coast of france calmly said but he was not joking check and report any damage injuries too ill need it for my report he patted the compass box not bad for a youngster eh egmont hurried forward his boat cloak plastered to his body like a mould in the poor light it was hard to gauge his reaction to the storm ere sir bolitho felt a mug pushed into his frozen fingers get yer blood movin again rum cognac it could have been anything but it began to work instantly thank you drury just in time the seaman laughed like bolitho he was probably surprised that he had remembered his name dancer joined him by the foremast and clapped his shoulder well thats all over dick his smile was very white against windseared features til the next time they both looked up the masthead pendant was just visible against the banks of low cloud flicking out like a coachmans whip but not bartaut as it must have been for the past few hours dancer said ill not be sorry to see the sun again here in january they both laughed and a sailor who was squatting by the forward hatch while his leg was being bandaged stared up at them and grinned tinker had heard verlings words to egmont and bolitho saw that he was already mustering some of his topmen getting ready to loose the topsails hotspur would fly when that was done like the great seabird of his imagination go below one of you and fetch my glass bolitho called aye sir and nudged his friends arm you stay and watch for the sun dancers coat sleeve was heavy with spray dancer saw the question in his eyes and shrugged i put my tarpaulin over one of the injured bolitho said you would it was deserted below deck although he could hear men shouting to one another as they put new lashings on some of the stores hotspur was carrying as additional ballast he paused to listen to the sea sluicing and thudding against the hull quieter now but still menacing showing its power he found verlings telescope just inside the tiny cabin which would be the new masters domain and when necessary his retreat verlings coat was hanging on a hook swaying with the motion like a restless spectre when hotspur anchored again he would go ashore as a well turnedout sea officer not as a survivor it was impossible to see him in any other light he stiffened surprised that he had not heard it before sewells voice husky even cowed i didnt sir i was only trying to he got no further cut short by egmont angry malicious sarcastic what d you mean you couldnt help it you make me sick and you still believe that anybody will ever accept you for a commission he was laughing now bolitho could see him in his mind barely out of the midshipmens berth himself and he was behaving like a tyrant ive been watching you and do you think ive not guessed what youre trying to do there was another sound a slap and if i see you again bolitho did not know he had moved it was like the actors in the square at falmouth they had all watched them as children had cheered or hissed to match the mimes and poses egmont swinging round to stare at him mouth half open cut short by the interruption one hand still in the air after the blow or preparing another sewell leaning against the curved timbers covering his cheek or mouth but his eye fixed on bolitho what th hell are you doing here almost as if he had imagined it egmont quite calm now arms at his sides swaying to the motion but in control and the young midshipman saying nothing his face guarded expressionless only the red welt by his mouth as evidence bolitho said i came for the first lieutenants glass it was like hearing someone else clipped cold like hugh well dont just stand there take it and go bolitho looked past him are you all right andrew sewell swallowed and seemed unable to speak then he nodded and exclaimed yes of course it was nothing you see egmont snapped hold your tongue and turned to bolitho again go about your duties ill overlook your insolence this time but he did not finish it but swung round and left the cabin they stood facing each other without speaking or moving the sounds of rigging and sea distant unintrusive tell me andrew bolitho reached out to take his arm and saw him flinch as if he expected another blow he struck you and just before that he got no further no it would only make things worse dyou think i dont know what its like really like bolitho felt the anger rising like fire egmonts shock when he had burst into this cabin and then as quickly his recovery and arrogance he could still feel sewells arm it was shaking fear it went deeper than that he said ill come aft with you right now mr verling will listen he has to and in any case but sewell was shaking his head no he looked at him directly for the first time it wouldnt help then quite firmly he pried bolithos fingers from his arm he would deny it and so would i someone was shouting feet thudded across the deck overhead he still held verlings telescope in his other hand nothing was making sense sewell was fumbling with his coat trying to fasten his buttons not looking at him now you will be a good officer dick a fine one i see the way they respect you and like you i always hoped he moved abruptly to the door and to the ladder beyond bolitho stood very still his anger giving way to a sense of utter defeat because of what he had just seen and heard and because it mattered there were more shouts and he found himself on the ladder as if it were an escape but he kept seeing sewells face and his fear he needed help and i failed him on deck it seemed nothing had happened routine taking over as seamen jostled at their stations for making more sail hotspur had altered course again the canvas shivering and cracking the main and gaff topsails taut across the bulwark throwing broken reflections across the water alongside loose topsls lively there verling called give it to me he seized the telescope and trained it across the weather bow thought youd fallen outboard where the hell were you he did not wait for an answer or seem to expect one and was already calling to men by the foremast egmont was near the wheel shading his eyes to peer up at the topsail yards he glanced only briefly at bolitho before returning his attention to the newly released sails as they filled and hardened to the wind disinterested bolitho heard sewells voice again he would deny it and so would i all secure sir that was tinker eyes like slits as he stared at the small figures on the yards groping their way back to safety most of the sea was still hidden in darkness but the sky was lighter and in so short a time the vessel had taken shape and regained her personality around and above them faces and voices emerging from groups and shadows bolitho felt the deck plunge beneath him exuberant like the wild creature she was hotspur would make a fine and graceful sight even in this poor light with all sails set and filled the yards bending like bows under the strain now that was something dick it was dancer hatless his fair hair plastered across a forehead gleaming with spray verling said send half of the hands below mr egmont get some food into them and dont be too long about it his mind was already moving on two good masthead lookouts he must have sensed a question and added one man sees only what he expects to see if hes left alone too long his arm shot out mr bolitho you stand by i need some keen eyes this morning he might even have smiled this is no twodecker bolitho felt his stomach muscles tighten even the mention of climbing aloft could still make his skin crawl verling was saying take my glass with you ill tell you what to watch out for dancer said softly i hope im as confident as he is when im told to take a ship from one cross on the chart to another nothing ever troubles him they went below and suddenly he grasped bolithos arm and pulled him against the galley bulkhead ive been thinking you remember what captain conway said about young sewells experiences in previous ships one of them was the ramillies wasnt it in the downs squadron where everything started to go against him bolitho said nothing waiting it was as if dancer had just been with him then he said cautiously what about ramillies something i heard a minute ago made me stop and think surprised conway didnt know he turned as if to listen as someone hurried past our mister egmont was a middy on board at the same time as sewell a bully even then to all accounts more figures were slipping and clattering down the ladder jostling one another and laughing fatigue and injuries forgotten until the next call bolitho said then ive just made an enemy and told him what had happened someone ducked his head through the hatch bolitho could see his face clearly despite the lingering gloom between decks what is it mr verling wants you on deck sir a quick grin fast as you like e says in the silence that followed dancer said lightly then im sorry to say egmonts made another enemy he seems to have a talent for it they reached the upper deck together there was more cloud than earlier rain too dancer exclaimed thunder not another storm i hope bolitho looked at him the bond between them was even stronger not on your oath martyn that was cannon fire no quarter the deck seemed unusually crowded all thought of rest and food forgotten some men were in the bows peering or gesturing ahead calling to one another voices distorted by the wind others had climbed into the shrouds but the sea was still dark and empty and there was no more gunfire verling said due south of us his eye lit up as he gazed into the compass dead ahead if im not mistaken at least we can outsail em sir that was tinker egmont snapped were not at war man verling glanced at him we take no chances mr egmont todays handshake can easily become tomorrows broadside dancer murmured what do you think dick heavy guns bolitho shook his head big enough there was no return fire ships meeting by accident a case of mistaken identity in the darkness and foul weather these were busy trade routes where almost any flag might be sighted and the possibility of war was never forgotten shoot first was often the first rule smugglers privateers or local pirates every deepwater sailor had to take his chance bolitho looked over toward verling and tried to see it as he would facing an unknown threat considering his own responsibility the officer in charge he had heard it said all too frequently do wrong and you carried the blame do right and if you were too junior others reaped the praise deliver hotspur to her new command and return to plymouth without unnecessary delay the orders were plain enough maybe verling was weighing the choices that might lie ahead fight or run as tinker had suggested hotspur carried two small bowchasers sixpounders quite enough to deal with trouble in home waters but no shot had yet been brought aboard and her four swivel guns would be useless in any serious engagement verling had made up his mind stand by to shorten sail reef topsls and take in the gaff topsl another glance at the compass bolitho could see his face now without the aid of the lamp the sky was clearing the clouds purple toward the horizon when it was visible he heard egmont ask shall we fight sir verling was gesturing to dancer fetch my logbook then stand by me he seemed to recall the question weve no marines to support us this time break open the arms chest he did not even raise his voice he looked at bolitho up you go sweep to the sou east take your time remember what you saw on the chart afterwards bolitho recalled how each point was allowed to settle in his mind take shape so calmly said when verlings entire being must have wanted to ram his meaning home or even to snatch up the glass and claw his way aloft himself in case he was mistaken when bolitho and the other midshipmen had gathered around gorgons sailing master old turnbull for their regular instruction in navigation and pilotage or when they were struggling with the mysteries of the sextant they had often been warned about the first sight of land turnbull had reminded his youthful audience an error in judgment is no excuse at the courtmartial table he reached the foremast shrouds as verling shouted shorten sail men were already at their stations handling lines and tackles as if they had been serving hotspur for months not days bolitho climbed steadily but slowly making sure each ratline was underfoot before he took his weight with his arms verlings heavy telescope thumping across his spine he heard tinker call after him dont drop that me son or the skyll fall on you how he could find time to joke about it was a marvel tinker was everywhere and at once ready to help or threaten without hesitation he should have been promoted to warrant rank there was not a strand of rope or strip of sail he could not control but in twentyfive years at sea he had never learned to read or write bolitho reached the upper yard and could feel his heart banging against his ribs too long in harbour getting soft the lookout already curled in position his arm around a stay turned and peered at him mornin sir he jerked his thumb land larboard bow bolitho swallowed and forced himself to look sea and haze an endless expanse of choppy white crests but no land the lookout was one of gorgons foretopmen more to the point he had been chosen by tinker for the passage crew he gasped tell them keveth no breath he swung the telescope carefully around and beneath his arm even as the lookout yelled to the small figures below with a name like that he must be a fellow cornishman two wreckers up here together he opened the telescope with great care waiting for each roll and shudder running through his perch causing hotspur to vibrate from truck to keel land sure enough another careful breath gauging the moment the sea breaking he could feel the power and height of the waves but when he lowered the glass to clear his vision there was nothing there but it was there the blunt outline of land sloping to a point which defied the waves like the little sketch in verlings log jerbourg point who or what was jerbourg he wondered he made his way down to the deck and hurried aft slipped and almost fell lightheaded as if drunk or in fever verling listened as he blurted out everything he had seen he was conscious of his eyes his patience as he described the landfall all he said was well done egmont said loudly ill note it in the log sir bolitho said the lookout keveth he sighted it first sir without a glass verling glanced at both of them as usual missing nothing a good hand that one a fair shot too when given the chance the hint of a smile and should be he was a poacher before he signed up with a recruiting party one jump ahead of the hangman i shouldnt wonder deck there it was the masthead again the poacher wreckage ahead larboard bow verling did not hesitate as if he had been expecting it as if he knew stand by to lower a boat two leadsmen in the chains his hand shot out good ones tinker this is no coastline for chances egmont asked you know guernsey sir ive sailed close by before he was looking toward the land which was still invisible it was enough he walked to the hatch wreckage wind and tide make their own landfalls for us eh dancer commented softly my god he keeps a cool head he clasped bolithos arm like another ancient mariner not a cables length away it seemed to take an age for the drifting fragments of wreckage to become clearly visible more scattered and reaching out on either bow there was absolute silence now the seamen very aware of their kinship with these pathetic remnants which had once been a living vessel verling was on deck again and stood with his arms folded watching the sea and the strengthening blur of land which had almost been forgotten hotspur had shortened sail once more so that her shipboard sounds in the silence added to the atmosphere of uneasiness with the creak and clatter of loose rigging and the groan of the rudder and yokelines as the helmsmen fought to maintain steerage way verling said i think both boats will be necessary it will save time not that there is much to see he was thinking aloud as if questioning each thought as it came to him even tinkers voice seemed subdued as he watched the first boat being hoisted and swung above and over the gunwale verling said you leave now mr egmont see what you can discover small craft id say egmont leaned over the side as some larger fragments of timber bumped against hotspurs side bolitho felt a chill run through him it was or had been a cutter as far as he could tell like avenger there was part of a mast now and torn sail dragging halfsubmerged like a shroud the first boat was pulling away with egmont in the bows leaning over to signal his intentions to his coxswain verling called now you bolitho he had his glass up to his eye again but trained on the spur of land not the splintered remains drifting below him take sewell with you stay up to windrd if you can he felt as if he were being cut off abandoned once the boat was in the water and the headrope cast off easy lads keep it steady he had taken the tiller himself and waited for the oars to pick up the stroke each man feeling the mood of the sea trying not to watch the schooner as she fell further and further astern at least the wind had eased bolitho felt the salt spray on his mouth and soaking into his shoulders sewell was crouched down beside him his back half turned impossible to see or know what he was thinking hard to believe that the confrontation in the cabin had ever happened only this was real he winced as the boat dipped steeply and more spray burst from the oars this was no cutter or gig built for the open sea there sewells arm shot out oh god its one of them bolitho stood up holding fast to the tillerbar to keep his balance bowman use your hook the seaman had boated his oar and was poised in the blunt bows like a harpoonist as more wreckage surged above a trough oars fend off lads it was as if a complete section of the wreck had risen suddenly and violently from the depths like some act of retribution or spite an oar blade splintered and the seaman pitched across his thwart the broken loom still grasped in his fists surprisingly nobody shouted or showed any sign of fear it was too swift too stark not just one corpse but five or six tangled together in a mesh of torn canvas and broken planking it lasted only a few seconds before the corpses and their tangled prison rolled over and dipped beneath the sea only seconds but as they fought to bring the boat under command again the grim picture remained staring eyes bared teeth gaping wounds black in the hard light and the stench of gunpowder like the splinters and the burns they had been fired upon at pointblank range bolitho tugged at the tillerbar back water starboard he felt the sea sluicing around his legs as if the boat had been swamped and was going down he heard sewell yell more wreckage he was clambering over the struggling oarsmen thrusting his legs over the side to fend off another piece of broken timber then he must have lost his footing and slithered bodily over the gunwale his face contorted with pain the seaman who had been in the bows flung himself over the thwart and seized his arm just as bolitho managed to bring the boat under control nobody spoke nothing mattered but the slow steady splash of oars as they regained the stroke and gave all their strength to the fight only then did they turn and peer at each other more gasps than grins but with the recognition that this time they had won bolitho eased the tiller very slowly feeling the effort of each stroke knowing they were in control sewell lay in the sternsheets the trapped water surging across his legs his lip bleeding where he had bitten through it bolitho reached down and wrenched open his coat his breeches were torn it must have happened when he had used both legs to kick off that last piece of wreckage but for his prompt action the boat might have foundered there was blood too a lot of it he could feel the torn skin the muscle under his fingers clenched against the pain he exclaimed you mad little bugger pain shock and the bitter cold sewell was barely able to form the words i was drowning i couldnt hhold on my fault he cried out as bolitho knotted a piece of wet rag around his leg the blood strangely vivid in the grey light bolitho pulled some canvas across his body and shouted you saved the boat did you think wed just leave you he was gripping his shoulder now as if to force him to understand i just wanted to he fainted bolitho swung the tillerbar against his ribs until the impact steadied him enough lads give way together the boat lifted and swayed as the blades brought her under command again bolitho clung to sewells sodden coat to ease the shock of each sudden plunge he heard himself gasp i know what you wanted ill remind you when we get back on board someone yelled eres otspur sir larboard beam bolitho wiped his streaming face with his wrist his eyes raw with salt a blurred shape like a sketch on a slate unreal he tugged at sewells coat and gasped see we found her the rest was a confused daze the schooners shining side rising over them like a breakwater muffled shouts and figures leaping down to take the strain and fasten the tackles for hoisting the boat into what suddenly seemed a stable and secure haven he felt a fist thumping his shoulder heard tinkers familiar harsh voice well done me boy another thump bloody well done then almost choking over a swallow of raw spirit rum cognac it could have been anything but it was working he could feel every scrape and bruise but his mind was clearing like a mist lifting from the sea and verling calm level a little less patient now what did you find it was all suddenly very sharp brutal like the end of a nightmare even the sounds of sea and wind seemed muffled the ship holding her breath they were all dead sir killed pointblank range like listening to somebody else the voice flat and contained no chance taken by surprise you see he could see their faces the savage wounds and staring eyes not a drawn blade or weapon in sight cut down grape and canister he broke off coughing and a hand held a cloth to his mouth only a piece of rag but it seemed strangely warm safe he knew it was dancer verling again anything more bolitho licked his raw lips he said there were two officers i saw their clothes the image was fading their buttons officers verling said take him below his hand touched bolithos arm briefly you behaved well anything else that comes back to you he was already turning away his mind grappling with other questions bolitho struggled to sit up sewell saved the boat sir he might have been killed verling had stopped and was staring down at him his face in shadow against the fastmoving clouds you did nothing of course somebody even laughed bolitho was on his feet now he could feel the deck alive again he should be shivering holding on he was neither dancer was saying when i saw the boat i thought he did not continue could not bolitho held on to a backstay and looked at the sea a deep swell unbroken now but for a few white horses no wreckage not even a splinter to betray what had happened and the dark wedge of land no nearer or so it seemed and yet it reached out on either bow lifting and falling against hotspurs standing and running rigging as if it and not the schooner was moving dancer said young sewell seems to be holding out well i heard the lads say you saved his skin or most of it hell never forget this day ill wager he added bitterly of course egmonts boat found nothing they were standing in the cabin space although bolitho could not recall descending the ladder here the ship noises were louder closer creaks and rattles the sigh of the sea against the hull bolitho turned and stared at his friend seeing him as if for the first time since he had been hauled aboard we might never have known but for the gunfire it was the merest chance he held up his arm and saw that the sleeve was torn from wrist to elbow he had felt nothing we cant simply sail past and forget it as if nothing has happened dancer shook his head its up to the first lieutenant dick i was watching him just now hell not turn his back on it he regarded him grimly he cant even if he wanted to someone called his name and he said well soon know im just thankful youre still in one piece he was trying to smile but it eluded him instead he lightly punched the torn sleeve young andy sewell has you to look up to now he swung away to find out who had called him that makes two of us bolitho stood by the cabin door and tried to calm his thoughts put them in order fear anger relief and something else it was pride ah here you are sir it was tinker almost filling the space he had a cutlass under one arm and was holding out a slimbladed hanger with his other hand more to your fancy i thought he was grinning although watching him keenly mister verlings orders seems were goin after the bastards who where with what it had never been in doubt feet thumped overhead and bolitho heard the impatient squeal of blocks the flap and bang of canvas free in the wind hotspur was under way once more verlings decision right or wrong for him there was no choice tinker nodded slowly as if reading his thoughts are ye ready bolitho could hear verlings voice egmonts too but he was thinking of the staring dead faces in the water he fastened the belt at the waist and allowed the hanger to fall against his thigh tomorrows enemy he said aye so be it command decision lieutenant montagu verling stood by the cabin table his head slightly bent between the deck beams his face in shadow the fingers of his left hand rested only lightly on the table while his body swayed to the schooners motion even that seemed easier you could almost feel the nearness of land something physical outside the sky like the sea was grey and the wind although steady had dropped the sails were heavy with rain and spray here in the cabin the light was no better despite a couple of lamps verlings chart was spread almost directly beneath the small cabin skylight strangely clear as it appeared to move slowly from side to side with each steady roll bolitho saw the brass dividers in verlings right hand move again the points tapping the chart perhaps he was reconsidering ensuring he had forgotten nothing sifting fact and speculation bolitho glanced at dancer the quill in his hand had hesitated poised over his log and the record of events he was keeping for verling achievement or a legal defense all would depend on the next few hours verling had turned slightly and the angle freed his features of shadow he looked calm and alert as if he were quite alone here and this was just another day bolitho wanted to turn and look once more around the cabin record the images in his mind and the others who were sharing this moment dancer opposite with the open log the ink on the page already dry the writing the sloping cultured hand he had come to know so well he could imagine it that of a captain perhaps even a flag officer making some comment for posterity on the occasion of some great battle at sea beside dancer staring at the chart although his eyes were scarcely moving lieutenant egmont the corners of his mouth turned down what was he thinking feeling impatience doubt or fear and midshipman andrew sewell lying propped on a bench seat his bandaged legs thrust out his eyes tightly shut when he awoke from the oblivion of pain and rum he would be different feel different another chance awaited him he might even come to accept the life he had not chosen lived though it must be in his fathers farreaching shadow the door creaked and without looking bolitho knew it was tinker thorne blocking the passageway sharing the meeting but as always with an ear tuned to the ship the sounds of sea wind and rigging clearer to him than any chart or conference of war bolitho touched the hanger that lay against his leg and they were not at war that must be uppermost in verlings mind at this very moment he looked up and realised that verling was staring directly at him but when he spoke it was to all of them and to the ship which should have been delivered to st peter port on guernseys east coast today as stated in his orders it is obvious that whatever vessel was responsible for so ruthless and unprovoked an attack on the cutter was already engaged in some unlawful mission smuggling is too commonplace between these islands and the mainland to provoke such an attack or the murder of unprepared sailors and their officers egmont said i didnt see them sir but if mr bolitho says otherwise verling interjected you will what in the silence that followed he tapped the chart with his dividers you dont have to be told that these are dangerous waters among these reefs and shallows pilotage is often a dire necessity even for visitors familiar with this coastline his eyes returned to bolitho those men who were killed had not been preparing to fight or to withstand an attack correct dancers pen was moving again the scratching quite audible above the sounds of the hull and the sea correct sir verling nodded which is why they were killed because they recognised the other vessel local smugglers sir he shook his head then why the force of arms the pointblank range egmont cleared his throat and said stiffly mistaken identity perhaps sir when verling did not answer he hurried on we can proceed to st peter port and hand over hotspur as planned warn the garrison they can send troopers overland or maybe there will be some local patrol vessel armed and ready to deal with this intruder his eyes flicked over bolitho smuggler or the like dancer laid down his pen and said quietly i learned a good deal about local trade sir my father used to instruct me on the subject gin from rotterdam brandy from france and spain rum from the west indies some five to six million gallons of it were imported each year he looked up at verling the blue eyes very clear and tobacco from virginia all for sale to our own traders he paused and smugglers it made st peter port rich adventurous egmont said scornfully i dont see that your boyhood lessons in local trade can be of any interest here dancer did not look at him he was speaking only to verling my father also dealt with a number of ships which traded in tea egmont looked as if he were about to burst out laughing but stifled it abruptly as verling said you have a good brain mr dancer i can see why your father had a rather different course charted for you he banged the table with his knuckles ships familiar with these waters but suitable for the ocean as well and big enough to carry powerful guns for selfdefense he looked around the cabin or murder he swung away from the table call all hands we will change tack directly then have the people lay aft they shall hear what we are about and what i intend he strode to the adjoining cabin and closed the door dangerous reckless many would say irresponsible bolitho looked over at dancer now closing the log certainly the bravest bolitho tightened his neckcloth and winced at the water running on his skin soaking his shoulder rain or spray it made no difference now he stared along the glistening deck beyond the foremast and flapping canvas to the land the rugged outline of which seemed to stretch from bow to bow it too was blurred by a heavier belt of rain sweeping out to meet them verling was taking no unnecessary chances with topsails reefed and a minimum of canvas and a leadsman in the chains on either bow even now he heard one of them call out no bottom sir plenty of room for any shift of tack so far but he knew from the chart how swiftly that could change there were sandbars and a scattered necklace of reef less than a mile distant he glanced over his sodden shoulder at the helmsmen eyes slitted against the downpour as they peered up at the shaking canvas and the vague shadow of the masthead pendant barely lifting in the wind verling was close by hands behind his back hat pulled low over his forehead what was he thinking now the seamen at their stations wet and shivering were probably hating him although an hour ago even less he had seen some of them nod with approval a couple had even raised a cheer the grim remains of the cutter and its crew had been stark in each mans mind this was different sailors took risks every day although few would admit it they obeyed orders it was their life but suppose verling was wrong and he was taking an unnecessary risk with hotspur and the life of every man aboard he watched verling walk unhurriedly to the weather bulwark and back to the compass box one day that might be me could i do it he felt rather than saw dancer move across the slippery planking to join him d you think were too late dancer was closer now his voice just loud enough to be heard over the downpour and the shudder of rigging not unless they turned and ran immediately after the attack but they must know these waters well he stared toward the land as a tall column of surf rose against a darker backdrop before falling slowly soundless like a giant spectre theyd not last a dog watch otherwise bolitho shivered but found a strange comfort in his friends words dancer looked round as egmonts voice cut through the other noises men were already running to obey his orders hell probably be proved right in the end he bit his lip as the call came aft again from the chains by th mark ten sir bolitho imagined the leadsman feverishly coiling in the wet line and preparing for another heave he tried to picture hotspurs keel dipping and lifting through the depths of grey sea ten fathoms sixty feet safe enough so far no bottom sir he let out a sigh of relief no wonder experienced sailors treated the channel islands with such respect and caution verling strode past them one hand covering the lens of his telescope perhaps he had changed his mind remembered tomorrow in st peter port this might seem an act of reckless folly mr egmont we will come about directly muster your anchor party he had not changed his mind by th mark seven verling had trained his glass on the spur of headland legs braced as he gauged the distance and bearing bolitho saw his face as he turned to watch the seamen crouching on the forecastle above the cathead hotspur was already coming about and into the wind sails in confusion and suddenly all aback let go bolitho tried to see the chart in his mind he and dancer had pored over it and gone through verlings notes until they almost knew them by heart the cable was still running out the anchor plunging down and down a sandy bottom here sheltered in its way by the same reef which had thrown up an occasional giant wave more men were scampering to secure sheets and braces the deck swaying heavily as the anchors fluke gripped and the cable took the full strain dancer had his hand to his mouth he had cut it at some time but he was already running to add his strength to the others tinker cupped his hands all secure sir hotspur had come to her anchor her masts tall against sullen cloud even the wind had dropped or so it seemed bolitho looked at the land once only a pencilled cross on verlings chart now a blurred reality through the lens of a telescope he wiped the stinging spray from his eyes so hard to believe it was no time at all since he had first seen hotspur and had heard dancer say ill not want to leave this beauty when the time comes and that would not be long now no matter what diversion delayed them the way ahead was clear he heard egmont shouting names saw tinker standing at his elbow nodding or making some encouraging comment as a man responded and snatched up cutlass or musket he had seen all this before and should be hardened to it eyes seeking out a friendly face those you fought for when battle was joined but he was still not used to it and was moved by it perhaps he was not alone and others felt it also and concealed it someone muttered ill lay a bet them bastards is watchin us right now as we breathe another laughed not if i sees the scumbags first was that all it took and suddenly there was no more time left one boat was hard alongside swaying and lurching in the swell men clambering down surefooted as if it were part of a drill verling stood with his back to the sea as if unwilling to let them go he said find out what you can he was looking at egmont as if they had the deck to themselves i must know the strength and position of the enemy but remember no heroics if you cannot find or identify the other vessel stand fast until i send help or recall you his glance moved only briefly to bolitho it is important so take care egmont half turned and swung back it might take hours to make our way across to the anchorage sir i know there is no alternative he reached out as if to touch the lieutenants arm but decided against it i shall be here conceal the boat as soon as you get ashore he saw a seaman signalling from the bulwark and said curtly off with you bolitho scrambled into position but hesitated as dancer leaned toward him his face only inches away easy does it dick glory can wait he was trying to grin until im with you and then bolitho was in the boat wedged against the tillerbar with egmont beside him the boat was full two men to an oar the bottom boards strewn with weapons and some hastily packed rations he heard tinker shout cast off easy lads he would be remaining aboard hating it but verling was shorthanded and if another squall found them or hotspur was forced to upanchor for some reason tinker would be the key to survival the oars rose and dipped slowly but steadily it was going to be a hard pull egmont shouted watch the stroke damn you together now bolitho looked over his shoulder hotspur was already beyond reach egmont said take over will you steer for the ridge he swore under his breath as spray dashed over the stem and drifted aft it was like ice of all the damn stupid ideas he did not finish it bolitho tried to guess what lay ahead and to hold the image of the coastline fixed in his mind he called be ready with the boats leadandline and paused fixing a name to the face price isnt it indeed it is sir and im ready he sounded as if it were a joke and the welsh accent was very pronounced he heard egmont mutter something anger or anxiety he could not tell he was a stranger and would always remain so and verling was he having second thoughts now that he had set his plan in motion suppose there was no other vessel no enemy he would be reprimanded for hazarding hotspur to no purpose and if he had sent a landing party into real danger the blame would be immediate he recalled verlings face when he had turned to watch gorgon as they had weighed anchor at plymouth as if something had been warning him too late the small boats lead splashed over the side three fathoms sir a pause sandy bottom egmont said nothing and bolitho called oars the blades halted like stilled wings and the boat idled ahead the men staring aft at the two uniforms by the tiller it was even darker here more like sunset than afternoon just shadow cloud land and sea like a wasteland a heaving desert bolitho tensed and leaned forward one hand to his ear egmont snapped what is it how many times how many shores he felt the stroke oarsman watching him both hands gripping his loom the gentle regular surge of water on the sand he said give way together easy all then to egmont the beach sir and now the land was real a fine crescent of hard wet sand and a tangled mass of trees almost black in this dull light like verlings chart and the scribbled notes he had gathered from somewhere one fathom sir bolitho felt his mouth go dry oars stand by to beach the sound of the water was louder and he could see bright phosphorescence streaming from the blades as they glided silently into the shallows then men were leaping over the sides to control the hull as it ground onto the hard packed sand others were running up the beach toward the trees one of them dropping onto his knee a musket to his shoulder no shouted challenge or sudden crash of gunfire the sounds of failure and of death only the lap of water against the boats stranded hull and the hiss of a breeze through the leafless trees to himself bolitho murmured we did it martyn to egmont he said shall we cover the boat sir not yet we dont know if he appeared to be staring down the beach beyond the grounded boat as if he expected to see hotspur but there was only darkness then he seemed to come out of his trance and said almost brusquely we must get into position on the ridge if there proves to be one we will be able to see across the bay he stared at bolitho well we could send scouts on ahead sir tinker picked out some good ones fair marksmen too egmont said it wont come to that for gods sake weve got twelve seamen not a troop of marines he eased his pistol against his hip marshalling his thoughts well move off now those scouts fetch them and i want the boat shifted nearer the trees and properly hidden he called after him and check those supplies he kicked irritably at the sand i cant do everything the trees seemed to move out and around them the seamen keeping abreast of bolitho as he trod on firmer ground the sounds of water on the beach already fading the thrust and tramp of bodies and the occasional clink of weapons seemed deafening but he knew it was only imagination maybe they were keeping too close together the habit of sailors thrown ashore away from their crowded element it was their way he thought of the brief confrontation aboard the flagship a lifetime ago and the sudden reality of that word trust he quickened his pace and sensed the others following suit on either side of him right or wrong they were with him lifeline this is far enough well stop while we get our bearings the lieutenant stood by a fallen tree the pattern of his buttons oddly bright in the gloom bolitho remembered the corpses he had seen trapped in the submerged wreckage a chilling reminder egmont added tartly and keep them quiet theyre like a herd of damned cattle bolitho looked at the sky the clouds moving steadily but more slowly now and closer at this height above the sea on the crest of the ridge or nearly so he wanted to stamp his feet which were like ice despite the long tramp over rough ground uphill for most of the way since they had hidden the boat and so quiet not even the murmur of surf any more only wind and the rustle of dead leaves the clink of metal or a muttered curse from one of the stooping shadows he realised that egmont was close beside him could see the oval of his face hear his breathing calm enough giving nothing away he said it will be steeper on the far side it leads right down to the bay he was brushing the front of his coat with one hand as he spoke a few dead dry twigs clung to it it was like seeing him for the first time he had always been so smart not a thread or clip out of place because he was so new to the rank or because he still needed to prove something so different from the unexpected outbursts of anger or the hostility he had displayed in the cabin when he had struck sewell in the face you told me youve detailed two hands as scouts can you vouch for them keveth and hooker sir when the names were selected egmont snapped never mind what tinker thorne said what do you think bolitho pressed his knuckles against his side to control his irritation id trust them sir hooker was brought up in the country and keveth too before he volunteered egmont might have been smiling and he is a fellow cornishman i believe say no more he moved to the edge of the rough track looking back toward the sea we shall make our way down to the bay shortly those two men will scout ahead dont ask them bolitho tell them this may be a waste of time but it may not and ill not have any slackness is that clear bolitho swung round as several voices let out a collective gasp of surprise or dismay just one light had appeared moving against the black curtain of sea and sky tiny a mere pinprick but after the stealth and scent of danger it seemed like a beacon egmont said hold your noise he was feeling his pocket as if for his watch hotspurs riding light to show others that we are here upon our lawful occasions if anyone else is fool enough to be abroad at this time someone muttered the ole bloody worldll know by now egmont moved away from the edge and take that mans name any more insolence and ill see the culprits backbones at the gangway when we rejoin gorgon bolitho followed him along the track they were on the downward slope and he thought he could feel the seas nearness the protection of the little bay he had seen on the chart when he glanced back the tiny light had vanished masked by the fold of the ridge like having a line severed the last link with the small personal existence they had come to know and depend on a sailors faith in his ship egmont was saying watch your weapons keep them covered keveth the keeneyed foretopman who had begun life as a poacher murmured ready when you are sir the second man hooker one of gorgons gun captains raised his fist we wont move too fast for you sir bolitho could see his teeth in the darkness as if he was sharing some private joke reassuring him of something they walked a few yards and they were completely alone keveth turned and said softly just us see he drew a finger across his throat anyone else gets this how long how far bolitho lost count he heard the sea a slow and heavy rhythm like breathing and the faint ripple of water running over rocks keveth said bill hookers gone off to smell un out good lad bolitho forced each muscle to relax two cornishmen on this godforsaken piece of coast which even now was so hauntingly reminiscent of home if keveth took it into his head to leave him he could simply melt away i bin thinkin sir when you gets your new ship keveth was still beside him bolitho smiled i havent got one yet ah but when ee do he broke off his hand sliding through some wet gorse like a snake still but it was hooker bent double grinning when he knew he had found them keveth said thought eed swum back to the ship my son bolitho had seen the glint of the dagger before he slipped it back under his coat hooker took a deep breath and slumped down on the ground i seen er sir he nodded as if to convince himself as well i got down to the beach there was a rift in the clouds an there she was keveth exclaimed bloody saphead some un might have seen ee thought they ad two of em almost trod on me he laughed shakily near thing bolitho reached over and gripped his arm he could feel him shivering tell it as it happened what you saw maybe heard then well go back and tell the others he waited allowing his breathing to slow and said you did well ill see that its not forgotten keveth murmured he will too bill i kept close to them rocks just like you said he was looking at his friend but speaking to bolitho it was as black as a well an then there was a break in the clouds to the nor west even saw a few early stars then it was gone bolitho was aware of keveths irritation what sort of vessel is she squarerigged fore and aft take your time it was hard to remain calm contained but any sign of impatience or doubt and hookers recollections would be scattered he thought of egmont back there in the darkness doubtless fuming with frustration and cursing verling for sending him out on this pointless quest a waste of time what hooker had to say now would change everything hooker said deliberately tis a brig id swear to that sir all canvas furled an snugged down for the night id say but shes anchored so far out it was ard to be sure keveth nudged him keep goin bill youre doin handsome hooker did not seem to hear him he continued in the same unemotional tone reliving it feeling the menace alone on the beach there were two boats on the sand another one moored farther out in the shallows biggern the others one mast sailrigged he banged the ground with his hand leeboards im almost sure another nod to himself small coaster i reckon just the kind of vessel for a dangerous rendezvous and there would be hundreds of such craft around the islands or used for trade along the french coast hooker continued they was arguin do you see sir shoutin some o the time i thought they was near comin to fists or worse keveth prompted almost gently english hooker stared at him as if it had not occurred to him some was others could ave bin french i aint sure but the ones with the coaster was cursin the crew from the brig anchored too far out one was yellin bolitho got to his feet that had to be the key too far out whatever was being unlawfully traded or moved to another rendezvous and was worth coldblooded murder had to be shifted now he said hazardous or not they have no choice he thought of hotspurs isolated riding light neither did verling he looked at keveth who was also standing now his carefully wrapped musket over one shoulder ill have you relieved as soon as i can well go and find the others keveth hesitated as if some sharp comment was hanging on his tongue but he said ill be here sir the lieutenant will be wantin a boats crew im thinkin he added firmly id like to keep with you and wiped his grubby chin with the back of his hand sir it was only a short time before they found the others but long enough for the truth to become clear to him a boats crew was needed without delay verling must have known it even as he was grappling with each doubt if he had waited until dawn the mystery ship would have sailed despite the risks in these shoalridden waters the alternative was the end of a rope and the smuggled cargo which had reached this far he recalled dancers quiet speculation it was certainly neither rum nor tea egmont waited for bolitho to stride up to him well impatient anxious even excited for once he was hiding his emotions hooker has had a quick sighting sir a brig anchored well out egmont glanced at the seaman in question anything else got a tongue has he hooker swallowed hard there was men on the beach boats as well when egmont failed to interrupt he continued in his round country accent but there was nothing slowwitted about his observations bolitho had watched him at numerous drills aboard gorgon as gun captain of one of her long eighteenpounders his brain was fast enough egmont waited in that enigmatic silence and then said some were french you think hooker shrugged i thought they was sir egmont looked at the sky probably locals they speak a normanfrench patois here no better breeding ground for smuggling on the grand scale he broke off as if surprised at himself for sharing his opinions he regarded bolitho coldly if the vessel is anchored far out and it seems wise in these waters that will mean they must begin loading their contraband straight away no time to lose two boats you say hooker spread his hands an the coaster egmont folded and unfolded his arms the brig would have one maybe two more all the same bolitho said a long haul even so egmont stared past him watching or listening to the trees winds livelier they might not have noticed that aboard hotspur more sheltered beyond the point bolitho said mr verling will have given strict orders he got no further i know that damn it but he wont have any idea of the timing needed i shall deal with that immediately he swung round and looked at the huddle of dark shapes crouching on the cold ground or in the shelter of a few saltbitten trees i want a boats crew now hooker you lead the way you can tell mr verling what you told me he checked him with his hand and make sure you get it right man it will be upon your head bolitho felt the anger churning at his guts no word of praise or thanks only a threat of recrimination he recalled keveths words id like to keep with you he had already guessed known that egmont would be returning to hotspur with a boats crew in the shortest possible time it made sense and yet egmont was looking at the sky again take charge until you receive further orders observe their movements but remain out of sight he turned away select five hands to stay with you i shall manage with the other half of the party someone muttered done sir ive picked our lads bolitho forced himself to concentrate to blot out the glaring truth he was being left behind with only five of the original landing party keveth had known so probably had hooker the voice at his elbow was that of price the big welshman who had been the boats leadsman on their passage to the beach he was known for a rough and irrepressible sense of humour not always appreciated by tinker the boatswains mate thats long enough egmont was watching the small group of figures breaking up separating into two sections a few grins and remarks here a quick pat on a friends shoulder there hooker paused for the merest second by bolitho ill pass the word to mr dancer sir that was all it was enough egmonts people were already moving back beneath the trees at the foot of the ridge in two hours he would be in the boat in three or thereabouts in hotspurs cabin he left without a backward look was that how it had to be will i be expected to behave like that when if my chance comes price was still beside him well there you are see the cream always comes out on top one of the others even laughed bolitho said lets find a scrap of cover i think i felt more rain this is what well do for an instant he believed he had imagined it but he had not he was in charge and he was ready in the kings name richard bolitho pressed down on both hands to take the weight of his body and ease the pain in his legs he was wedged between two great shoulders of rock worn smooth by the sea he could hear the slap and sluice of trapped water somewhere below his precarious perch like a warning sharpening his mind the tide was on the make or soon would be that would mean climbing higher losing contact or worse any protection he and his small party had gained he leaned forward once more he had lost count of how many times he had repeated the movement staring at the faint curve of the beach and the ungainly outline of the lugger hooker had described more at an angle now pulling restlessly at the anchor which prevented her from grinding onto this treacherous shore he closed his eyes and tried to focus his thoughts at first when keveth had guided him to this point he had feared immediate discovery every loose pebble or the splash of feet across wet sand had sounded like a landslide a herd of cattle as egmont had so contemptuously called them but the dark scrambling figures the occasional shouts of instruction or anger across the water had continued uninterrupted the two longboats had been loaded and had pulled strongly away from the beach it would take several journeys to complete the transfer of the luggers cargo it had probably been their original intention to moor directly alongside too far out it was that important even now important enough to kill for he tensed as sand splashed into the water below him and realised that the curved hanger was already partly drawn the hilt cold in his fist but it was keveth and he had not even seen him until he was here only an arms length away keveth had turned and was looking down toward the beach then he said one of the boats is comin back now he was breathing evenly apparently at ease next loadll be ready to move directly heavy work no doubt o that bolitho heard the creak of oars men jumping from the boat to guide it into the shallows somebody barking an order it could have been any language did you see what theyre carrying keveth was watching him he could almost feel his eyes guns he was peering at the beach again i knew twas summat heavy i seen muskets stowed like that afore he let his words sink in new ones anyway bolitho stared into the darkness the blood seemed to be pounding in his ears like the sea beyond these rocks no wonder the prize was worth the risk worth human life and yet there must be houses perhaps farms quite close by keveth must have read his thoughts well ee d know what tis like at home nobody sees nowt when th brotherhood is out but all bolitho could think of was the shipment of guns where bound and destined for whose hands there had been rumours the more radical newssheets had openly used the word rebellion in the american colonies ever since the boston massacre and only days ago one of the lieutenants in gorgon had claimed it was the subject of the admirals conference even captain conway had mentioned it it had seemed so distant so vague another quarterdeck whisper but if true just across the water the old enemy would be quick to encourage any such insurrection keveth was on his knees peering once more at the beach nother boat comin in must be a load o muskets th luggers leeboards is well above th line bolitho glanced up at the sky hooker had seen the first stars there were more now and the torn clouds seemed to have gathered speed he thought of hotspurs riding light unreachable beyond the ridge and of egmont brushing dead leaves from his coat he had once heard someone remark that egmonts father was or had been a tailor at one of the naval ports that might explain he pushed it away and said its up to us he tried to shut out the other voice its up to you the tides on the make theyll be weighing anchor before we know it keveth said i dunno much about such things but us jacks aint supposed to rebellion or freedom we obey orders an thats all there is to it its which end of the gun youre standin at that counts in th end bolitho stood up suddenly to prevent himself from changing his mind one hand against the rock to take his weight he could feel his heart thudding against his ribs i must get nearer he thought keveth would protest now while there was still time he was outspoken enough he had proved that sharp and clear like a lookouts view from the topsail yard five seamen who could just as easily turn their backs as obey a direct command that might end in death and who would know or care keveth looked at him in silence and bolitho thought he had not heard then he moved swiftly reaching out toward his face as if to strike him but he was touching one of the white patches on bolithos lapel better hide them middys patches stand out like a priest in a brothel he folded the collar deftly best be goin then bolitho felt him grasp his elbow as they descended from the rocks unreal and strangely moving and not once had he called him sir which made it even stronger because it mattered perhaps this was madness and it was already too late but through it all he could hear martyns voice just before he had climbed down into the boat and cast off from hotspurs side a thousand years ago glory can wait until im with you he said you are then he joined the seaman who had once been a poacher and together they stared at the pale coffinlike shapes which had been hauled onto the sand even in the shelter of the rocks he could feel the increasing thrust of the wind a long hard pull for the men in the boats even with extra hands keveth pointed nother box bolitho saw the shape being lowered over the side of the lugger heard the squeak of block and tackle and the louder splashes of men wading through icy water with the next load of muskets no shouts or curses this time they were probably breathless he asked how many hands still aboard dyou think three or four enough for th winch watchin th anchor cable as well if that parted he ducked as someone shouted but nothing else happened the box had been manhandled further along the beach and onto firmer sand the would have the wind against them all the way back when they came for the next load bolitho pushed the hair from his eyes the last one perhaps he said might be the time to act he recalled egmonts words when they had landed dont ask them tell them he tried to gauge the distance from the rocks to the moored lugger they would have to wade through the water farther than they thought he knew he was deluding himself the tide was already coming in noisier now with the wind in its face when the other boat shoves off he touched keveths arm it did not flinch well board her he saw another pale shape jerking slowly down the side close to the leeboard hooker would have described all this to verling what would the first lieutenant be thinking if he had listened to egmont hotspur would be snugged down in st peter port by now and somebody else would be responsible reaping the praise or the blame bolitho considered the others in this small party price was a steady reliable hand in spite of the humour so often aimed at his superiors the other three he knew only by sight and in the daily routine and in the past few weeks he had not seen much of that he thought of his brother hugh in temporary command of the revenue cutter avenger a stranger and yet dancer had spent a lot of time with him getting on well together it had seemed dont ask them tell them even that sounded like hugh he said are you with me keveth did not answer directly but turned to listen as the second boat was pushed and manhandled into the water then he unslung the carefully wrapped musket from his shoulder and said work for old tom ere after all he faced the midshipman again all the way sir it was time bolitho was aware of the others pressing around him could feel their breathing and perhaps their doubts well board her now before the boats come back this wind will carry us out after that we can stand clear and wait for hotspur suppose the tide gets other ideas sir bolitho put a face to the voice perry an experienced seaman who had been with him when they had found the dead boats crew tough withdrawn but observant if the wind dropped the lugger would run hard aground as soon as the cable was cut price said ive seen boats like this one before sir no keel to speak of they use the leeboards if they need steerage way used to watch the dutchmen when i was over on the medway and they came across the channel another voice his name was stiles younger and aggressive said to have been a bareknuckle prizefighter around the markets until he had decided to sign on in a hurry it was suggested will there be a reward bolitho felt the winter wind in his face wet sand stinging the skin at any moment the chance might desert them at best they might be able to drift clear of the shore until hotspur upanchored and made an appearance the lugger would provide enough evidence for any future action he said bluntly its our duty and almost expected the man to laugh instead stiles replied thatll ave to do then the remaining seaman was named drury a surefooted topman like keveth he had been flogged for insolence and bolitho had seen the old scars on his back once when he had been working in the shrouds aboard gorgon curiously he had been among the first hands selected by tinker for the passage crew as boatswains mate tinker himself had probably dealt out the punishment drury said thoughtfully might get a tot o somethin to warm our guts if we make a move right now bolitho felt someone nudge him it was keveth see sir theym good as gold when you puts it like that bolitho faced the sea and tried not to hear the hiss of spray along the beach then it was surging around his legs dragging at him like some human force as he strode toward the lugger they would fall back leave him to die because of his own stupid determination and for what it was like a wild dream the icy sea dragging at his body and surging past the lugger which seemed to be shining despite the darkness mocking him he slipped and would have been dragged down by the current out of his depth but for a hand gripping his shoulder the fingers were like iron forcing him forward and suddenly the blunt hull was leaning directly over him the pale outline of the leeboard just as hooker had described it and the loose hoisting tackle dragging against him caught on the incoming crests like those other times in training or in deadly earnest he was scrambling up the side using the hard wet tackle and kicking every foot of the way he felt metal scrape his thigh like a knife edge and almost cried out with shock and disbelief as he lurched to his feet he was on the luggers deck cut the cable but the cry of the wind and the surge of water alongside seemed to muffle his voice then he heard a thud and another someone yelling curses and knew it was prices boarding axe taking a second swing he felt the deck shudder and for an instant thought they had run ashore but the hull was steady and somehow he knew it was moving free from the ground a figure seemed to rise from the very deck arms waving mouth a black hole in his face yelling screaming unreal and then a familiar voice harsh but steady oh no you dont matey and the sickening crack of a heavy blade into bone bolitho gasped foresl but he should have recognised the confusion of wet canvas already breaking into life he staggered across the deck toward a solitary figure grappling with the long tillerbar it was drury with a cutlass thrust through his belt steady she is sir he laughed into the wind almost there was a small hatch and bolitho saw that he had nearly fallen into it two more figures were crouched on a ladder shouting perhaps they were pleading only then did he realise that the hanger was in his hand and the blade was only a foot away from the nearest man he yelled you two bear a hand now damn you his words might have been lost in the noise of wind and flapping canvas but the naked blade was clear in any language price was calling shes answering sir well tackle the mainsl now bolitho stared at the sky and saw the big foresail swaying above him like a shadow are we all here he wanted to laugh or weep like madness keveth shouted large as life sir there was a muffled splash and he added that un wont bother us no more bolitho tried to sheathe the hanger in its scabbard but felt keveth take it gently from his hand dont need this for a bit sir he was grinning weve taken th old girl bolitho moved to the side and stared at the choppy wavelets below him he was shaking badly and not because of the cold or the danger and it was hard to think and make sense of it they would winch up the mainsail and steer a course clear of this rocky coastline at first light but nothing would form clearly in his mind except we did it below deck they might find more muskets evidence which would justify hotspurs actions and ours tomorrow he looked at the stars he was no longer shivering and it was tomorrow now he heard someone else too bloody late you bastards and the immediate crack of a musket but even that was distorted by the wind and rigging then keveth sharp angry get under cover an reload now you mad bugger youll ave a dead charge on your ands with the next shot there were shouts and another shot and bolitho remembered that the boats were out there lost in the swell as they pulled toward the beach another few minutes and they would have foiled any attempt to board the lugger and there would be corpses rolling in the tide to mark their folly he ran to the side and peered past the tiller it was not imagination he could see the vague outline of the ridge edged against the sky where before there had been solid blackness clouds too but the stars had gone keveth called thatll show the bastards but he was staring after the one who had fired his musket theyll be comin for us theyve nowhere else to turn to he waved his fist to drive the point home listen the rattle and creak of loose gear seemed to fade and in a lull in the wind bolitho could hear the slow regular clink clink clink like that last time when they had left plymouth the pawls of a capstan men straining every muscle against wind and tide to break out the anchor the brig was making a run for it those in the boats even their own hands were being abandoned there were no rules for the smuggling fraternity but save your own neck first he banged his fist on the bulwark the pain steadying him the brutal truth was that hotspur might still be at anchor unwilling to risk any dangerous manoeuvre on the mere chance of an encounter he recalled verlings parting words no heroics he joined drury by the tillerbar and leaned his weight against it he could feel the heavy shudder the power of the sea and tried to guess at their progress without more sail and time to work clear of the bay he shut his mind to the ifs and the maybes they had done better than anyone could have expected hoped the brigs weighed sir another voice said cut er cable more like either way the smuggler was making sail if she worked around hotspur or avoided her altogether her master would have the open sea ahead and every point of the compass from which to choose his escape and even if there was further evidence below deck what would that prove the two cowering wretches who had pleaded for mercy when keveth and his mates had swarmed aboard would certainly go to the gallows or hang in chains on the outskirts of some seaport or along a coastal road as a grisly warning to others but the trade would never stop while men had gold to offer personal greed or to sustain a rebellion the cause mattered little to those who were prepared to take the risk for profit he heard a cry from forward stiles the prizefighter poised high in the bows one arm flung out bolitho wiped his face it was not a trick of light or imagination he could see the young seaman outlined against the heaving water and occasional feather of spray and then reaching out on either side an endless pale backdrop of sea and sky then he heard stiles voice clear and sharp breakers ahead helm alee he saw the tiller going over one of the captured smugglers running to throw his weight with drurys to bring it round bolitho saw keveth staring at him as if telling him something but all he could think was that he could see each feature and that he still had his musket old tom across one shoulder as if all time had stopped and only here and this moment counted for anything stiles was stepping down from his perch in the bows still watching the sea and the lazy turmoil of breakers not a reef and at high water it would be little more than shallows a sandbar but enough and here too was the brig her courses and foretopsail already set and filling to the wind even a small curling wave at her stem moving through the grey water her hull still in darkness like an onlooker uninvolved pass the word stand by to ram it could have been someone elses voice more of a sensation than a shock the most noise coming from the flapping canvas as the handful of seamen ran to slacken off all lines and free the winch they had ground ashore with hardly a shudder when the tide turned again she would be high and dry bolitho walked aft and watched the brig heeling slightly as she altered course her sails hardening a masthead pendant whipping out like a spear the seaman named perry shook his fist we did our best damn their eyes not enough bolitho flinched as someone gripped his arm what and saw keveths expression not shock or surprise but the face of a man who could no longer be caught aback by anything he said quietly an theres a sight sir one youll long remember it was hotspur lying over to the wind casting her own shadow like a reflection across the whitecaps she had skirted the headland so closely that she appeared to be balanced across it keveth swung round wait sir whatre you about he was staring up at him as bolitho ran to the side and climbed into the shrouds so that hell know he was unfolding the collar of his coat until the white midshipmans patches were clearly visible give me my hat he reached down and took it without losing sight of the brig verling would see him and know what they had done that this fight had not been so onesided after all that his trust had not been misplaced but who did he really mean so that hell know boat larboard quarter price turned away easy ted its our lads he looked up at the midshipman in the shrouds one hand holding his hat steady against the wind to others it might look like a salute they would not see his torn and stained uniform across the water but they would see him and they would not forget bolitho heard none of it watching the two sets of sails on a converging tack the land rolling back like a screen there was light on the water now a faint margin between sea and sky but hardly visible or real hotspur made a fine sight the bird unfolding her wings ready to attack too far away to see any movement but he could hold the image clearly in his mind swivel guns manned puny but deadly at close quarters hotspurs two bowchasers would be empty useless someone would answer for that later perhaps when they read verlings log written in martyns familiar hand and bright patches of scarlet as if painted on a canvas verling had hoisted two ensigns so that there could be no mistake or excuse hotspur had become a manofwar he heard the boat come alongside voices excited greetings then silence as they all turned to watch the two vessels almost overlapping hotspur graceful even fragile against her adversary there was anger now alarm too at the faroff sounds of shots like someone tapping casually on a tabletop with his fingers hotspur must have misjudged her change of tack as if out of control she would drive her jib boom through the brigs foremast shrouds but she had luffed and must surely be almost abeam then there was a brief vivid flash and seconds later the sharp resonant bang of a swivel gun the seamen around him were suddenly quiet each man in his mind across the grey water with his friend or companion and at his proper station this was like being rendered helpless cut off from the only world they knew keveth said what the hell if only the two vessels were still drifting together sails in disarray as if no human hands were at the helm of either there was a great gasp mounting to a combined growl like something torn from each mans heart just a small sliver of scarlet but it was moving slowly up the brigs overlapping mainyard and then it broke out to the wind to match the two flags flying from hotspurs masts bolitho could not tear his eyes away despite the wild burst of cheering and the hard slaps across his shoulders that showed em and that made the murderin buggers jump one seaman the boats coxswain was trying to make himself heard im to take you aboard sir mr verlings orders bolitho seized keveths arm and said youre in charge until they send someone to relieve you he shook him gently ill not forget what you did believe me he walked after the boats coxswain but paused and looked back at his own small party of sailors price the big welshman even he was at a loss for a joke now perry stiles and drury who was still standing by the stiff and motionless tillerbar his face split by one huge grin then he was in the boat faster and lighter now without the weight of extra hands sent by verling rising and plunging across each rank of incoming waves and all the time the tall pyramids of sails seemed to draw no closer only once did he turn to gaze back at the beached lugger and the small cluster of figures by the stern stand by bowman he hardly remembered going alongside only hands reaching out and down to assist him aboard familiar faces but all like strangers he wanted to shake himself be carried by this moment and its triumph and thrust the strain or uncertainty or was it fear into the retreating shadows he could still feel their hands pounding his shoulders see their grins and keveths pride and satisfaction the victors he stared around and across to the other vessels poop the wheel was in fragments the bulwark pitted and broken by the single blast of canister from hotspurs swivel there was blood too and he could hear someone groaning in agony and another quietly sobbing he saw egmont back turned his drawn sword across his shoulder quite still as if on parade this way sir a seaman touched his arm he saw some of them pause to glance at him and young sewell his rough bandage still dangling from one leg staring raising his hand to acknowledge him his face changed in some way older verling was by the compass box hatless and without a sword you did damned well he said but bolitho could not speak or move as if everything had stopped like the moment when the scarlet ensign had appeared above the brigs deck he saw that verling had a bandage around his wrist and here also there was blood beyond him splinters had been torn from the deck like feathers where those few shots had left their mark verling said if there was any way he broke off and gestured abruptly at the hatch hes in the cabin we did all bolitho did not hear the rest he was down the ladder and in the cabin where they had sat and waited talked about the board and the future dancer was on one of the bench seats his head and shoulders propped on some cushions he had been watching the door perhaps listening now he tried to reach out but his arm fell to his side there was one lamp burning in the cabin near the same skylight beneath which verling had been standing during that final discussion the light was moving unsteadily as the hull nudged against the captive vessel alongside and gave colour to dancers fair hair but revealed the pallor of his skin and the effort of his breathing there was a small red stain on his shirt bolitho took his hand and held it between his own and watched his eyes trying to keep the pain at bay or to experience it himself like all those other times i came as soon as i could martyn i didnt know he felt the hand move in his attempting to return his grip he said youre here now dick all that matters bolitho leaned over him shielding his face his eyes from the light he could barely hear the words the hand moved again then just one word together someone spoke bolitho had not known there was anybody else in the cabin it was tinker best leave him sir hes gone im afraid bolitho touched his friends face gently to wipe away some tears the skin was quite still and he realised the tears were his own somewhere in another world he heard the trill of a boatswains call the response of running feet tinker was by the door blocking it in his years at sea he had seen and done almost everything in ships as different as the oceans they served and with captains just as varied you became hardened to most things or you went under he had heard the new activity on deck he was needed now more than ever the prisoners to be put to work both vessels to be got under way again maybe a juryrig to be fitted aboard the brigs steering as the helm had been shot away the first lieutenant had no doubt been yelling for him already but it was the here and now that required him most listen me son soon maybe very soon youll be standin into a new life you have their respect ive seen you win it but thats only the beginning youll make friends an youll lose some of em sure thats the way of it its a sailors lot the calls were silent the feet on deck were still the hard leathery hand touched his torn sleeve very briefly just think of the next watch an the next horizon see bolitho turned by the door and glanced back he could be asleep waiting for the next watch he felt his lips move and heard himself speak and the words were dry and controlled and the voice unfamiliar im ready when you are he looked at the door again youll never know the way ahead together epilogue captain beves conway swung away from the stern windows of his day cabin and called have him come aft directly man he had been watching the thirtytwo gun frigate condor enter harbour and drop anchor with a minimum of fuss and delay it was what he would expect from a captain like maude always busy always in demand he cocked his head to listen to his own ships routine and almost sighed with relief the disruption of overhaul was finished until their lordships insisted on another the constant comings and goings of working parties and dockyard experts and the noise smells and personal discomfort were being inflicted on some other vessel and his britannic majestys ship gorgon could now show even a frigate a thing or two if required freshly blackened standing rigging and gleaming paintwork were shining brightly despite a morning so cold and misty that even the usually restless gulls seemed content to float upon the anchorage like discarded wreaths the screen door opened a few inches and the lieutenant said mr bolitho sir he has apologised for the state of his uniform he said it without a smile unlike verling it felt strange to have another officer standing in for him until his return from guernsey verling would be fretting over the delay he would have heard all the latest news from the colonies when condor had called at st peter port with the admirals despatches it would be good to have him back as first lieutenant although he might feel quite differently about it after his brief but exciting flirtation with the schooner hotspur conway glanced at the letters lying open on his desk they had been sent across from condor within minutes of her anchor hitting the bottom one letter had been from his old friends son midshipman andrew sewell he was still with verling and the passage crew in guernsey but the short simple note had seemed like a reward something which had warmed him more than he would have believed or hoped the door opened and richard bolitho walked into the cabin this was only just february and much had happened since their last meeting the board held in the flagship which was still moored in exactly the same position as the day when several young gentlemen had been required to face their tormentors they all had to endure it and laughed about it afterwards the fortunate ones anyway he strode to meet him and clasped his hands so good to see you again my boy i want to hear all about the capture of the smugglers and the contraband you helped to seize it will carry some weight i can tell you with their lordships and above he guided him to a chair and the table where a servant had laid out some wine and his best goblets i arranged for you to take passage in condor i hope it was a pleasant if uneventful one he did not wait for a reply he rarely did i know you will have a good deal to do and i shall not delay you unnecessarily my clerk will take care of the other matters bolitho leaned his back against the chair the same ship even the weather cold and grey had not changed the houses of plymouth like the ranks of anchored ships were still halfshrouded in mist it had seemed to take an eternity for the frigate to make her entrance and anchor and yet only days had passed since it had begun when they had climbed aboard hotspur a lifetime ago he glanced down at the breeches someone had loaned him and at the makeshift patches on his coat reminders like the cuts and bruises on his body the captain had poured the wine himself and was smiling down at him i am very proud of you richard one of my midshipmen he raised his glass no need for you to be delayed when it could be avoided i had a word with the flag captain he was refilling his glass although bolitho did not recall tasting the wine and i wanted to do it myself he pulled open a drawer and took out an unsealed envelope you are free to leave the ship and complete your arrangements he watched him take the envelope the scrap of parchment they all joked about afterwards your commission richard none better deserved bolitho saw his goblet being refilled and still he could taste nothing it was here the moment the impossible step he had seen some of the frigates midshipmen glancing over at him during their brief time together all so young like sewell although sewell had seemed suddenly mature and his first appointment you are herewith directed and commanded upon receipt of these orders the rest was blurred but it was a frigate named destiny conway was saying i shall delay you no longer he looked over at the desk young andrew sewell has told me what you did for him it helped him more than you can know his father would have been obliged to you had he been here himself to thank you bolitho stood up there were voices in the outer cabin he was grateful for the interruption and so possibly was the captain he said martyn dancer was a great help to him sir they got on well together conway walked with him to the screen door and impetuously put his arm around bolithos shoulder afterwards the cabin servant remarked that he had never seen conway do anything like it and it was never repeated conway said then my thanks are to you both he looked again at the stern windows god be with you when you join destiny and he paused as a kings officer out on the broad quarterdeck the air was still misty but there was a gleam on the water as if the sun were about to break through he would go to falmouth and tell his mother and sister it would have to be a brief visit and he was glad of that also he looked around the familiar decks and at the groups of seamen and marines this was the past ahead lay the new horizon
