elizabeth george payment in blood the second book in the inspector lynley series gowan kilbride aged sixteen had never been much for early rising while still living on his parents farm he had grumbled his way out of bed each morning letting everyone within hearing distance know through a variety of groans and creative complaints how little to his liking the life of husbandry was so when francesca gerrard the recently widowed owner of the largest estate in the area decided to convert her scottish great house into a country hotel in order to recoup upon the death duties gowan presented himself to her the very man she would need to wait on tables officiate behind the bar and oversee a score of nubile young ladies who no doubt would eventually apply to work as serving girls or maids so much for fantasy as gowan soon discovered for he had not been employed at westerbrae a week before he realised that the workings of that immense granite house were to be orchestrated solely by a contingent of four mrs gerrard herself a middleaged cook with too much growth of hair on her upper lip gowan and a seventeenyearold girl newly arrived from inverness mary agnes campbell gowans work possessed all the glamour commensurate with his position in the hotel hierarchy which is to say that there was virtually none he was a factotum a man for all seasons of travail be it working the grounds of the rambling estate sweeping the floors painting the walls repairing the ancient boiler on a biweekly basis or hanging fresh wallpaper to prepare the bedrooms for their future guests a humbling experience for a boy who had always seen himself as the next james bond the irritations of life at westerbrae were mitigated solely by the delicious presence of mary agnes campbell who had come to the estate to help put the house in order prior to its receiving its first paying customers after less than a month of working at mary agnes side even getting up in the morning was no longer a chore since the sooner gowan bounded out of his room the sooner he would have his first opportunity of seeing mary agnes talking to her catching her intoxicating scent on the air as she passed by indeed in a mere three months all his former dreams of drinking vodka martinis shaken not stirred and showing a marked preference for italian handguns with skeleton grips had been quite forgotten in their place was the hope of being favoured with one of mary agnes sunny smiles with the sight of her pretty legs with the agonising tantalising adolescent hope of brushing up against the swell of her lovely breasts in one corridor or another all that had seemed quite possible quite reasonable in fact until the arrival yesterday of westerbraes very first bona fi de guests a group of actors from london who had come with their producer their director and several other hangerson to work the wrinkles out of a new production combined with what gowan had found in the library this morning the presence of these london luminaries was making his dream of bliss with mary agnes look more remote every moment so when he pulled the crumpled piece of westerbrae stationery out of the rubbish in the library he went in search of mary agnes and found her alone in the cavernous kitchen assembling trays of early morning tea to be carried up to the rooms the kitchen had long been a favourite haunt of gowans mostly because unlike the rest of the house it had not been invaded altered or spoiled there was no need to suit it to the tastes and predilections of future guests they would hardly come wandering through to sample a sauce or talk about the turn of the meat so the kitchen had been left alone just as gowan remembered it from his childhood the old tile floor of dull red and muted cream still made a pattern like an enormous draughtboard lines of coruscating brass pans hung from oak stringers against one wall where iron fixtures were like smudgy shadows on the cracked ceramic surface a fourtiered pine rack atop one of the counters held the everyday dishes of the household and beneath it a tricornered drying stand wobbled under its burden of tea towels and cloths pottery urns stood on the windowsills holding oddly tropical plants with large palmate leavesplants that by rights should have withered under the icy adversities of a scottish winter but nonetheless thrived in the rooms warmth it was however far from warm now when gowan entered it was nearly seven and the frigid morning air had not yet been cut by the huge stove heating against one wall a large kettle steamed on one of the burners through the transomed windows gowan could see that the previous nights heavy snowfall had smoothly sculpted the lawns rolling down to loch achiemore at another time he might have admired the sight but right now righteous indignation prevented him from seeing anything but the fairskinned sylph who stood at the worktable in the centre of the kitchen covering trays with linen explain this tae me mary agnes campbell gowans face flushed nearly to the colour of his hair and his freckles darkened perceptibly he held out a discarded piece of stationery his broad callused thumb covering the westerbrae estate crest upon it mary agnes directed guileless blue eyes towards the paper and gave it a cursory glance unembarrassed she went into the china room and began pulling teapots cups and saucers from the shelves it was every bit as if someone other than herself had written mrs jeremy irons mary agnes irons mary irons mary and jeremy irons mary and jeremy irons and family in an unpractised script up and down the page wha aboot she replied tossing back her mass of ebony hair the movement designed to be coy caused the white cap perched rakishly over her curls to fall askew over one eye she looked like a charming pirate which was part of the problem gowans blood had never burned for a single female in his entire life as it burned for mary agnes campbell he had grown up on hillview farm one of the westerbrae tenant holdings and nothing in his wholesome life of fresh air sheep five brothers and sisters and boating on the loch had prepared him for the effect mary agnes had upon him every time he was with her only the dream of someday making her his own had allowed him to keep hold of his reason that dream had never seemed entirely out of the range of possibility in spite of the existence of jeremy irons whose handsome face and soulful eyes torn from the pages of countless movie magazines graced the walls of mary agnes room in the lower northwest corridor of the great house after all girlish adulation of the unreachable was typical wasnt it or so mrs gerrard tried to tell gowan when he daily unburdened his heavy heart to her as she supervised his advancing skill at pouring wine without sloshing most of it onto the tablecloth that was all fine and good so long as the unreachable remained unreachable but now with a houseful of london actors to mingle among gowan knew very well that mary agnes was beginning to see jeremy irons within her grasp surely one of these people was acquainted with him would introduce her to him would let nature take its course from there this belief was attested to by the paper gowan held in his hand a clear indication of what mary agnes felt the future had in store for her wha aboot he repeated incredulously ye left this lyin in the libry thas wha aboot mary agnes plucked it from his hand and shoved it into her apron pocket yere kind tae retairn it laddie she replied her placidity was infuriating ye gie me no explanation tis practice gowan practice the fire inside him was heating his blood to a boil wha kind of practice dye need tha jeremy ironsll help you with all over the blessit paper and him a marrit man mary agnes face paled marrit she set one saucer down upon another china jarred together unpleasantly gowan at once regretted his impulsive words he had no idea whether jeremy irons was married but he felt driven to despair by the thought of mary agnes dreaming of the actor nightly as she lay in her bed while right next door gowan sweated for the right to touch his lips to hers it was ungodly it was unfair she ought well to suffer for it but when he saw her lips tremble he berated himself for being such a fool shed hate him not jeremy irons if he wasnt careful and that couldnt be borne ah mary i canna say faer sairtin if hes marrit gowan admitted mary agnes sniffed gathered up her china and returned to the kitchen puppylike gowan followed she lined up the teapots on the trays and began spooning tea into them straightening linen arranging silver as she went studiously ignoring him thoroughly chastened gowan searched for something to say that would get him back into her good graces he watched her lean forward for the milk and sugar her full breasts strained against her soft wool dress gowans mouth went dry hae i tol ye aboot my row to tombs isle it was not the most inspired conversational gambit tombs isle was a treestudded mound of land a quarter of a mile into loch achiemore capped by a curious structure that looked from a distance like a victorian folly it was the final resting place of phillip gerrard the recently departed husband of westerbraes present owner rowing out to it was certainly no feat of athletic prowess for a boy like gowan well used to labour certainly it was nothing that was going to impress mary agnes who probably could have done the same herself so he sought a way to make the story more interesting for her ye dinna know aboot the isle mary mary agnes shrugged setting teacups upon saucers but her bright eyes danced to him briefly and that was suffi cient encouragement for gowan to wax eloquent upon his tale ye havena haird why mary all the villagers know tha when the mune is full missus francesca gerrard stands buck nakit a the windae of her bedroom and beckons mister phillip to coom back to her from tombs isle whair hes buried that certainly got mary agnes attention she stopped working on the trays leaned against the table and folded her arms prepared to hear more i dinna believe a word of this she warned as preamble to his tale but her tone suggested otherwise and she didnt bother to hide a mischievous smile nar did i lass so las full mune i rowed out myself gowan anxiously awaited her reaction the smile broadened the eyes sparkled encouraged he went on ach what a sicht missus gerrard was mary nakit at the windae her arms outstretched an glory those dugs hanging claer tae her waist wha an awful sicht he shuddered dramatically tis na wunner to me tha auld mister phillip be lying so still gowan cast a longing glance at mary agnes fine endowments coorse tis true tha the sicht of a luvely breast cuid make a man do anything mary agnes ignored the lessthansubtle implication and went back to the tea trays dismissing his narrative effort with gae on wi yere work gowan werent ye supposed tae see tae the biler this mornin it wus fozling like my grannam last nicht at the girls cool response gowans heart sank surely the story about mrs gerrard should have engaged mary agnes imagination more than this perhaps even encouraging her to request a row on the loch herself next full moon with drooping shoulders he shuffled towards the scullery and the creaking boiler within as if taking pity on him however mary agnes spoke again but aiven if missus gerrard wants mister phillip winna coom back to her laddie gowan stopped in his tracks why that my body shinna lie on this cursit ground of westerbrae mary agnes quoted smartly thats what mister phillip gerrards will said mrs gerrard told me that herself so if yere story is true shell be at the windae forever if she hopes tae hae him back that way he isna aboot to walk across th water like jesus dugs or no dugs gowan kilbride finishing her remarks with a restrained giggle she went for the kettle to begin making the morning tea and when she came back to the table to pour the water she brushed so near him that his blood began to heat all over again counting mrs gerrards there were ten trays of morning tea to be delivered mary agnes was determined to do them all without stumbling spilling a drop or embarrassing herself by walking in on one of the gentlemen while he was dressing or worse she had rehearsed her entry often enough for her debut as hotel maid guid mornin luvely day and a quick walk to the table to set down the tea tray careful to keep her eyes averted from the bed juist in case gowan would laugh she went through the china room through the curtainshrouded dining room and out into the massive entry hall of westerbrae like the stairway at its far side the hall was uncarpeted and its walls were panelled in smokestained oak an eighteenthcentury chandelier hung from its ceiling its prisms catching and diffracting a soft beam of light from the lamp gowan always switched on early every morning on the reception desk oil a bit of sawdust and a residual trace of turpentine scented the air speaking of the efforts mrs gerrard was making to redecorate and turn her old home into an hotel overpowering these odours however was a more peculiar smell the product of last nights sudden inexplicable flare of passion gowan had just come into the great hall with a tray of glasses and five bottles of liqueurs to serve to their guests when mrs gerrard tore wildly out of her little sitting room sobbing like a baby the resulting blind collision between them had thrown gowan to the fl oor creating a mess of shattered waterford crystal and a pool of alcohol a good quarterinch deep from the sittingroom door stretching all the way to the reception desk beneath the stairs it had taken nearly an hour for gowan to clean the mess upcursing dramatically whenever mary agnes walked byand all that time people had been coming and going shouting and crying pounding up the stairs and down every corridor what all the excitement had been about was something that mary agnes had never quite determined she knew only that the company of actors had gone into the sitting room with mrs gerrard to read through a script but within fifteen minutes their meeting had dissolved into little better than a furious brawl with a broken curio cabinet not to mention the disaster with the liqueurs and crystal as evidence of it mary agnes crossed the hall to the stairs mounting them carefully trying to keep her feet from thundering against the bare wood a set of house keys bouncing importantly against her right hip buoyed her confi dence knock quietly first mrs gerrard had instructed if theres no answer open the dooruse the master key if you mustand leave the tray on the table open the curtains and say what a lovely day it is and if tisna a luvely day mary agnes had asked impishly then pretend that it is mary agnes reached the top of the stairs took a deep breath to steady herself and eyed the row of closed doors the first belonged to lady helen clyde and although mary agnes had seen lady helen help gowan last night in the friendliest fashion with the spilled mess of liqueurs in the great hall she wasnt confi dent enough to have her firstever tray of early morning tea go to the daughter of an earl there was too much chance of making a mistake so she moved on choosing the second room whose occupant was far less likely to notice if a few drops of tea spilled onto her linen napkin there was no answer to her knock the door was locked frowning mary agnes balanced her tray on her left hip and fumbled about with the keys until she found the master to the bedroom doors this done she unlocked the door pushed it open and entered trying to keep all her rehearsed comments in mind the room she discovered was terribly cold very dark and completely soundless where one would have expected at least the gentle hiss of the radiator at work but perhaps the rooms sole occupant had decided to pop into bed without turning it on or perhaps mary agnes smiled to herself she wasnt in the bed alone but was snuggling up to one of the gentlemen under the eiderdown or more than snuggling mary agnes stifl ed a giggle she walked to the table beneath the window set down the tray and pulled open the curtains as mrs gerrard had instructed it was not much after dawn the sun only an incandescent sliver above the misty hills beyond loch achiemore the loch itself shone silver its surface a silky sheen upon which hills sky and the nearby forest were duplicated exactly there were few clouds just shredded bits like wisps of smoke it promised to be a beautiful day quite unlike yesterday with its bluster and storm luvely mary agnes commented airily guid mornin tae ye she swung around from the curtains straightened her shoulders to head back towards the door and paused something was wrong perhaps it was the air too hushed as if the room itself had drawn in a quick breath or the odour it carried rich and cloying vaguely reminiscent of the scent that flew up when her mother pounded meat or the mounding of the bedcovers as if pulled up in a hurry and left undisturbed or the absolute lack of movement beneath them as if no one stirred as if no one breathed mary agnes felt the bristling of hairs on the back of her neck she felt rooted to the spot miss she whispered faintly and then a second time a bit louder for indeed the woman might be sleeping very soundly miss there was no response mary agnes took a hesitant step her hands were cold her fingers stiff but she forced her arm forward she jiggled the edge of the bed miss this third invocation brought no more reply than the previous two seemingly on their own her fi ngers curled round the eiderdown and began pulling it away from the figure beneath it the blanket feeling damp with that kind of bonechilling cold that comes with a heavy winter storm snagged then slid away and then mary agnes saw that horror had a life all its own the woman lay on her right side as if frozen her mouth a rictus in the blood that pooled crimson about her head and shoulders one arm was extended palm up as if in supplication the other was tucked between her legs as if for warmth her long black hair was everywhere like the wings of ravens it spread across the pillow it curled against her arm it soaked itself to a pulpy mass in her blood this had begun to coagulate so the crimson globules edged in black looked like petrifi ed bubbles in a hellbroth and in the centre of this the woman was held immobilised like an insect on a display board impaled by the hornhandled dirk that plunged through the left side of her neck right into the mattress beneath her detective inspector thomas lynley received the message shortly before ten that morning he had gone out to castle sennen farm for a look at their new livestock and was on his way back in the estate land rover when his brother intercepted him hailing him from horseback as he reined in a heaving bay whose breath steamed from fl aring nostrils it was bitterly cold far more so than was normal in cornwall even at this time of year and lynleys eyes narrowed against it defensively as he lowered the rovers window youve a message from london peter lynley shouted wrapping the reins expertly round his hand the mare tossed her head sidestepping deliberately close to the drystone wall that served as border between field and road superintendent webberly something about strathclyde cid he wants you to phone him as soon as you can thats all the bay danced in a circle as if trying to rid herself of the burden on her back and peter laughed at the challenge to his authority they battled for a moment each determined to dominate the other but peter controlled the reins with a hand that knew instinctively when to let the horse feel the bit and when it would be an infringement on the animals spirit to do so he whipped her round in the fallow field as if to circle had been an agreedupon idea between them and brought her chest forward to the frostrimed wall hodge took the call peter grinned you know the sort of thing scotland yard for his lordship shall i go or you oozing disapproval from every pore as he spoke nothings changed there was lynleys response having been in his familys employ for over thirty years the old butler had for the last twelve refused to come to terms with what he stubbornly referred to as his lordships whimsy as if at any moment lynley might come to his senses see the light and begin to live in its radiance in a manner to which hodge fervently hoped he would become accustomedin cornwall at howenstow as far as possible from new scotland yard what did hodge tell him probably that you were engaged in receiving obsequious servilities from your tenants you know his lordship is out on the land at the moment peter did a fair imitation of the butlers funereal tones both brothers laughed do you want to ride back its faster than the rover thanks no im afraid ive grown far too attached to my neck lynley put the car noisily in gear startled the horse reared and plunged to one side ignoring bit rein and heels in her desire to be off hooves clashed against rocks whinny changed to a rollingeyed call of fear lynley said nothing as he watched his brother struggle with the animal knowing it was useless to ask him to be careful the immediacy of danger and the fact that a wrong move could mean a broken bone were what attracted peter to the horse in the fi rst place as it was peter flung back his head in exhilaration hed come without a hat and his hair shone in the winter sunlight closecropped to his skull like a golden cap his hands were workhardened and even in winter his skin retained its tan coloured by the months that he spent toiling in the southwestern sun he was vibrantly alive inordinately youthful watching him lynley felt decades more than ten years his senior hey saffron peter shouted wheeled the horse away from the wall and with a wave shot off across the field he would indeed reach howenstow long before his brother when horse and rider had disappeared through a windbreak of sycamores at the far side of the field lynley pressed down on the accelerator muttered in exasperation as the old car slipped momentarily out of gear and hobbled his way back down the narrow lane lynley placed his call to london from the small alcove off the drawing room it was his personal sanctuary built directly over the entrance porch of his familys home and furnished at the turn of the century by his grandfather a man with an acute understanding of what made life bearable an undersized mahogany desk sat beneath two narrow mullioned windows bookshelves held a variety of entertaining volumes and several bound decades of punch an ormolu clock ticked on the overmantel of the fireplace near which a comfortable reading chair was drawn it had always been an altogether welcoming site at the end of a tiring day waiting for webberlys secretary to track down the superintendent and wondering what both of them were doing at new scotland yard on a winter weekend lynley gazed out the window at the expansive garden below his mother was there a tall slim fi gure buttoned into a heavy pea jacket with an american baseball cap covering her sandy hair she was involved in a discussion with one of the gardeners a fact which prevented her from noticing that her retriever had fallen upon a glove she had dropped and was treating it as a midmorning snack lynley smiled as his mother caught sight of the dog she shrieked and wrestled the glove away when webberlys voice crackled over the line it sounded as if he had come to the phone on a run weve a dicey situation the superintendent announced with no prefatory remarks some drury laners a corpse and the local police acting as if its an outbreak of the bubonic plague they put in a call to their local cid strathclyde strathclyde wont touch it its ours strathclyde lynley repeated blankly but thats in scotland he was stating the obvious to his commanding officer scotland had its own police force rarely did they call for assistance from the yard even when they did so the complexities of scottish law made it difficult for the london police to work there effectively and impossible for them to take part in any subsequent court prosecutions something wasnt right lynley felt suspicion nag but he temporised with isnt there someone else on call this weekend he knew that webberly would supply the rest of the details attendant to that remark it was the fourth time in five months that he had called lynley back to duty in the middle of his time off i know i know webberly responded brusquely but this cant be helped well sort it all out when its over when whats over its one hell of a mess webberlys voice faded as someone else in his london offi ce began to speak tersely and at considerable length lynley recognised that rumbling baritone it belonged to sir david hillier chief superintendent something was in the wind indeed as he listened straining to catch hilliers words the two men apparently reached some sort of decision for webberly went on in a more confi dential tone as if he were speaking on an unsafe line and were wary of listeners as i said its dicey stuart rintoul lord stinhurst is involved do you know him stinhurst the producer the same midas of the stage lynley smiled at the epithet it was very apt lord stinhurst had made his reputation in london theatre by financing one successful show after another a man with a keen sense of what the public would love and a willingness to take enormous risks with his money he had a singular ability to recognise new talent to cull prizewinning scripts from the chaff of mundanity that passed across his desk every day his latest challenge as anyone who read the times could report had been the acquisition and renovation of london s derelict agincourt theatre a project into which lord stinhurst had invested well over a million pounds the new agincourt was scheduled to open in purported triumph in just two months with that hovering so near in the future it seemed inconceivable to lynley that stinhurst would leave london for even a short holiday he was a singleminded perfectionist a man in his seventies who had not taken any time off in years it was part of his legend so what was he doing in scotland webberly went on as if answering lynleys unasked question apparently stinhurst took a group up there to do some work on a script that was supposed to take the city by storm when the agincourt opens and theyve a newspaperman with themsome chap from the times drama critic i think apparently hes been reporting on the agincourt story from day one but from what i was told this morning right now hes frothing at the mouth to get to a telephone before we can get up there and muzzle him why lynley asked and in a moment knew that webberly had been saving the juiciest item for last because joanna ellacourt and robert gabriel are to be the stars of lord stinhursts new production and theyre in scotland as well lynley could not suppress a low whistle of surprise joanna ellacourt and robert gabriel these were nobility of the theatre indeed the two most soughtafter actors in the country at the moment in their years of partnership ellacourt and gabriel had electrifi ed the stage in everything from shakespeare to stoppard to oneill although they worked apart as often as they appeared together it was when they took the stage as a couple that the magic occurred and then the newspaper notices were always the same chemistry wit hotwired sexual tension that an audience can feel most recently lynley recalled in othello a haymarket production that had run to sellout crowds for months before fi nally closing just three weeks ago whos been killed lynley asked the author of the new play some upandcomer evidently a woman name of there was a rustle of paper joy sinclair webberly harrumphed always prelude to an unpleasant piece of news it came with his next statement theyve moved the body im afraid damn and blast lynley muttered it would contaminate the murder scene making his job more diffi cult i know i know but it cant be helped now can it at any rate sergeant havers will meet you at heathrow ive put you both on the one oclock to edinburgh havers wont work for this sir ill need st james if theyve moved the body st james isnt yard any longer inspector i cant push that through on such short notice if you want to take a forensic specialist use one of our own men not st james lynley was quite ready to parry the fi nality of that decision intuitively comprehending why he had been called in on the case rather than any other di who would be on duty this weekend stuart rintoul the earl of stinhurst was obviously under suspicion for this murder but they wanted the kind of kidglove handling that would be guaranteed by the presence of the eighth earl of asherton lynley himself peer speaking to peer in justoneofusboys fashion probing delicately for the truth that was all well and good but as far as lynley was concerned if webberly was going to play fast and loose with the duty roster in order to orchestrate a meeting between lords stinhurst and asherton he was not about to make his own job more difficult by having detective sergeant barbara havers along chomping at the bit to be the first from her grammar school to slap handcuffs on an earl to sergeant havers lifes central problemsfrom the crisis in the economy to the rise in sexual diseasesall sprang from the class system fully blown and developed a bit like athena from the head of zeus the entire subject of class in fact was the sorest of tender spots between them and it had proved to be the foundation the structure and the fi nial of every verbal battle lynley had engaged in with her during the fifteen months that havers had been assigned as his partner this case doesnt speak to havers particular strengths lynley said reasonably any objectivity she has will be shot to hell the minute she learns that lord stinhurst might be involved shes grown past that and if she hasnt its time she did if she wants to get anywhere with you lynley shuddered at the thought that the superintendent might be implying that he and sergeant havers were about to become a permanent team joined in a wedlock of careers he would never be able to escape he looked for a way to use his superiors decision about havers as part of a compromise that would meet his own needs he found it by playing to a previous comment if thats your decision sir he said equably but as to the complications attached to the removal of the body st james has more crimescene experience than anyone currently on staff you know better than i that he was our best crimescene man then and our best crimescene man now i know the standard line inspector but weve a time problem here st james cant possibly be given a short bark of conversation from chief superintendent hillier interrupted in the background it was immediately muffl ed no doubt by webberlys hand over the mouthpiece after a moment the superintendent said all right st james has approval just get going get up there and see to the mess he coughed cleared his throat and fi nished with im not any happier than you are about this tommy webberly rang off at once allowing no time for either further discussion or questions it was only when he was holding the dead telephone in his hand that lynley had a moment to consider two curious details inherent to the conversation he had been told virtually nothing about the crime and for the fi rst time in their twelve years of association the superintendent had called lynley by his christian name an odd cause for unease to be sure yet he found himself wondering for the briefest of moments what was really at the root of this murder in scotland when he left both alcove and drawing room on his way to his own suite of rooms in howenstows east wingthe name fi nally struck lynley joy sinclair he had seen it somewhere and not all that long ago he paused in the corridor next to a fruitwood mule chest and gazed unfocussed at the porcelain bowl on its top sinclair sinclair it seemed so familiar so within his graspthe bowls delicate pattern of blue against white blurred in his vision the figures overlapping crossing inverting inverting back to front playing with words it hadnt been joy sinclair he had seen but sinclairs joy a headline in the newspapers sunday magazine it had been an obvious arentweclever inversion that was followed by the teasing phrase a score with darkness and on to bigger things he remembered thinking that the headline made her sound like a blind athlete on her way to the olympics and aside from the fact that hed read far enough into the article to discover that she was no athlete but rather an author whose first play had been well received by critics and audiences seeking respite from londons usual glitzy fare and whose second play would open the agincourt theatre he had learned nothing else for a call from scotland yard had sent him to hyde park and a fi veyearold girls naked body shoved in among the bushes beneath the serpentine bridge little wonder hed not remembered sinclairs name until this moment the devastating sight of megan walsham the knowledge of what shed suffered before she died had driven every other thought from his mind for weeks hed moved through time in a fury sleeping eating and drinking his need to fi nd megans killerand then arresting the childs maternal uncleand then having to tell her distraught mother who was responsible for the rape and mutilation and murder of her youngest child he had just come off that case in fact boneweary from long days and longer nights yearning for rest for a spiritual ablution to wash the filth of murder and inhumanity from his soul it was not to be at least neither here nor now he sighed rapped his fingers sharply against the chest and went to pack detective constable kevin lonan loathed drinking his tea from a flask it always developed a repulsive film that reminded him of bath scum for that reason when circumstances required him to pour his longedfor afternoon cuppa from a dented thermos resurrected from a cobwebbed corner of the strathclyde cid office he gagged down only a mouthful before dumping the rest out onto the meagre strip of tarmac that comprised the local airfield grimacing wiping his mouth on the back of his gloved hand he beat his arms to improve his circulation unlike yesterday the sun was out glittering like a false promise of spring against the plump drifts of snow but still the temperature was well below freezing and the thick bank of clouds riding down from the north promised another storm if the party from scotland yard was to put in an appearance they had better be fl aming quick about it lonan thought morosely as if in response the steady throb of rotor blades cut through the air from the east a moment later a royal scottish police helicopter came into view it circled ardmucknish bay in a tentative survey of what the ground afforded as a landing site then slowly touched down on a square in the tarmac that a wheezing snowplough had cleared for it thirty minutes earlier its rotor blades kept spinning sending up minor snow flurries from the drifts that bordered the airfield the noise was teethjarring the helicopters passenger door was shoved open by a short plump fi gure muffl ed like a mummy from head to toe in what looked like someones old brown carpeting detective sergeant barbara havers lonan decided she threw down the steps the way one would fl ing a rope ladder over the side of a tree house pitched out three pieces of luggage which hit the ground with a thud and plopped herself after them a man followed her he was very tall very blond his head bare to the cold a wellcut cashmere overcoat a muffl er and gloves his only capitulation to the subfreezing temperature he would be inspector lynley lonan thought the object of strathclyde cids particular interest at the moment considering how his arrival had been manipulated by london from beginning to end lonan watched him exchanging a few words with the other officer she gestured towards the van and lonan expected them at that point to join him instead however they both turned to the helicopters steps where a third person was slowly negotiating his descent one made awkward and diffi cult by the heavy brace he wore upon his left leg like the blond he also had no hat and his black haircurly far too long and wildly ungovernableblew about his pale face his features were sharp excessively angular he had the look of a man who never missed a detail at this unexpected arrival constable lonan mouthed unspoken words of awe and wondered if detective inspector macaskin had been given the news london was sending in the heavy artillery forensic scientist simon allcourtst james the constable pushed himself off the side of the van and marched eagerly to the helicopter where the arrivals were folding the steps back inside and gathering their belongings have you ever given thought to the fact that there might be something breakable in my suitcase havers lynley was asking packing onthejob drinks was her tart reply if youve brought your own whisky more the fool you thats a bit like taking coals to newcastle wouldnt you say that has the sound of a line youve been waiting to use for months lynley gave a wave and a nod of thanks to the helicopters pilot as lonan joined them when the introductions were made lonan blurted out i heard you speak once in glasgow as he shook st james hand even inside the glove lonan could sense how thin it was yet it gripped his own with surprising strength it was the lecture on the cradley murders ah yes putting a man behind bars on the strength of his pubic hair sergeant havers murmured which is if nothing else metaphorically unsound lynley added it was obvious that st james was accustomed to the verbal sparring of his two companions for he merely smiled and said we were lucky to have it god knows we had nothing else but a set of teeth prints gone bad on the corpse lonan itched to discuss all the quixotic convolutions of that case with the man who four years ago had unravelled them before an astounded jury however as he was winding himself up to hurl a daggerlike insight he remembered detective inspector macaskin who was awaiting their arrival at the police station no doubt with his usual brand of tense hallpacing impatience vans over here replaced his scintillating observation about the distortion of teeth marks kept preserved on fl esh in formaldehyde he jerked his head towards the police vehicle and as they gave their attention to it his features settled into a nonverbal apology he hadnt thought there would be three of them nor had he thought they would bring st james had he known he would have insisted upon driving something more suitable in which to fetch them perhaps inspector macaskins new volvo which if nothing else had a front and rear seat and a heater that worked the vehicle he was leading them towards had only two front seatsboth belching forth stuffing and springsand a single folding chair that was wedged in the back among two crimescene kits three lengths of rope several folded tarpaulins a ladder a toolbox and a pile of greasy rags it was an embarrassment yet if the trio from london noticed they didnt comment they merely arranged themselves logically with st james in the front and the two others riding in the rear lynley taking the chair at sergeant havers insistence wouldnt want you to get your pretty topcoat dirty she said before fl opping down on the tarpaulins where she unwound a good thirty inches of muffler from her face lonan took the opportunity of getting a better look at sergeant havers when she did so homely sort he thought surveying her snubby features heavy brows and round cheeks she certainly hadnt got herself into this kind of exalted company on her looks he decided that she had to be some sort of criminological wunderkind and he gave serious consideration to watching her every move thank you havers lynley was responding placidly god knows a spot of grease would reduce me to uselessness in less than a minute havers snorted lets have a fag on it then lynley obliged by producing a gold cigarette case which he handed to her following it with a silver lighter lonans heart sank smokers he thought and resigned himself to a bout of stinging eyes and clogged sinuses havers did not light up however because hearing their conversation st james opened his window and let in a sharp waft of freezing air which struck her right in the face enough i get the picture havers groused she pocketed six cigarettes unashamedly and gave the case back to lynley has st james always been this subtle since the day he was born lynley replied lonan started the van with a lurch and they headed towards the cid office in oban detective inspector ian macaskin of strathclyde cid was driven in life by a single fuel pride it took a number of distinct and unrelated forms the first being familial he liked people to know that he had beaten the odds married at twenty to a seventeenyearold girl he had stayed married to her for the next twentyseven years had raised two sons had seen them through university and on to careers one a veterinarian and the other a marine biologistthen there was physical prideat fi ve feet nine inches tall he weighed no more than he had as a twentyoneyearold constable his body was trim and fit from rowing back and forth across the sound of kerrera every night in the summer and doing much the same on a rowing machine he kept in his sitting room all winter long although his hair was completely grey and had been for the last ten years it was still thick shining like silver in the fl uorescent lights of the police station and that same police station was his last source of pride in his career he had never once closed a case without making an arrest and he expended considerable energy making certain that his men could say the same about themselves he operated a tight investigations unit in which his officers ran every detail to ground like hounds after a fox he saw to that as a result he was omnipresent in the office nervous energy personifi ed he bit his fi ngernails down to the quick sucking on breath mints or chewing gum or eating sacks of potato crisps in an effort to break himself of this single bad habit inspector macaskin met the london party not in his office but in a conference room a tenbyfifteenfoot cubicle with uncomfortable furniture inadequate lighting and poor ventilation he had chosen it deliberately he was not at all happy with the way this case was beginning macaskin liked to pigeonhole liked to have everything put in its proper place with no muss and no fuss each person involved was supposed to act out his appropriate role victims die police question suspects answer and crimescene men collect but right from the beginning aside from the victim who was cooperatively inanimate the suspects had been doing the questioning and the police had been answering as for the evidence that was something else entirely explain that to me again inspector lynleys voice was even but it carried a deadly tone that told macaskin that lynley had not been made party to the peculiar circumstances that surrounded his assignment to this case that was good it made macaskin decide to like the scotland yard detective right on the spot they had shed their outer garments and were sitting round the pine conference table all save lynley who was on his feet his hands in his pockets and something dangerous simmering behind his eyes macaskin was only too happy to go over the story again hadnt been at westerbrae thirty minutes this morning before there was a message to phone my people at cid chief constable informed me that scotland yard would be handling the case thats all couldnt get another word out of him just instructions to leave men at the house come back here and wait for you way i see it is that some highbrow at your end made the decision that this would be a yard operation he gave our chief constable the word and to keep things on the up and up we cooperatively put in a call for help youre it lynley and st james exchanged unreadable glances the latter spoke but why did you move the body part of the order macaskin answered blasted strange if you ask me seal the rooms pick up the package and bring her in for autopsy after our medical examiner did us his usual honour of proclaiming her dead on the scene a bit of divide and conquer sergeant havers remarked it looks that way doesnt it lynley replied strathclyde deals with the physical evidence london deals with the suspects and if someone somewhere gets lucky and we fail to communicate properly everything gets swept under the nearest rug but whose rug yes that is the question isnt it lynley stared down at the conference table at the stains created by myriad coffee rings that looped across its surface what exactly happened he asked macaskin the girl mary agnes campbell found the body at sixfifty this morning we were called at seventen we got out there at nine nearly two hours lonan answered storm last night closed the roads down inspector westerbraes fi ve miles from the nearest village and none of the roads were ploughed yet why in gods name did a group from london come to such a remote location francesca gerrardwidowed lady the owner of westerbraeis lord stinhursts sister macaskin explained evidently shes had some big plans of turning her estate into a posh country hotel it sits right on loch achiemore and i suppose she envisaged it as quite the romantic holiday destination place for newlyweds you know the sort of thing macaskin grimaced decided that he sounded more like an advertising agent than a policeman and finished hastily with shes done a bit of redecorating and from what i could gather this morning stinhurst brought his people up here to give her a chance to work out the kinks in her operation before she actually opened to the public what about the victim joy sinclair do you have anything much on her macaskin folded his arms scowled and wished he had been able to wrest more information from the group at westerbrae before he had been ordered to leave little enough author of the play theyd come to work on this weekend a lady of some letters from what i could gather from vinney vinney newspaperman jeremy vinney drama critic for the times seems to have been fairly thick with sinclair and more broken up about her death than anyone else from what i could tell odd too when you think about it why because her sisters there as well but while vinney was demanding an arrest that very minute irene sinclair had absolutely nothing to say didnt even ask how her sister had been done in didnt care if you ask me odd indeed lynley remarked st james stirred did you say theres more than one room involved macaskin nodded he went over to a second table which abutted the wall and picked up several folders and a roll of paper the latter he smoothed out on the tabletop revealing a more than adequate floor plan of the house it was extraordinarily detailed considering the time constraints that had been put upon him at westerbrae this morning and macaskin smiled at his finished work with real pleasure weighing it down at either end with the folders he gestured to the right victims room is on the east side of the house he opened one of the folders and glanced at his notes before continuing one side of her was the room belonging to joanna ellacourt and her husbanddavid sydeham other side was a young womanhere it is lady helen clyde its this second room thats been sealed off he looked up in time to see the surprise on all three of the london faces you know these people just lady helen clyde she works with me st james replied he looked at lynley did you know helen was coming to scotland tommy i thought shed planned to go to cornwall with you she begged off the trip last monday night so i went alone lynley looked at the fl oor plan touching his fingers meditatively to it why has helens room been sealed it adjoins the victims room macaskin answered now theres a piece of luck st james said with a smile leave it to our helen to get herself booked right next door to a murder well want to talk to her at once macaskin frowned at this and leaned forward placing himself squarely between the two men to get their attention with a physical intrusion before he went on with a verbal one inspector he said about lady helen clyde something in his voice arrested the other two mens conversation warily they looked at each other as macaskin added grimly about her room what about it it appears to be the means of access lynley was still trying to understand what helen was doing with a group of actors in scotland when inspector macaskin imparted this new piece of information what makes you think that he asked at last although his mind was taken up mostly with his last conversation with helen less than a week ago in his library in london shed been wearing the loveliest jadecoloured wool had tasted his new spanish sherry laughing and chatting in that lighthearted way of hersand had rushed off promptly to meet someone for dinner who he wondered now she hadnt said he hadnt asked macaskin he noted was watching him like a man who had things on his mind and was merely waiting for the right opportunity to trot them all out because the victims hall door was locked macaskin replied when mary agnes tried to rouse her without success this morning she had to use the master keys where are they kept in the office macaskin pointed to the map lower floor northwest wing he continued she unlocked the door and found the body who has access to these master keys is there another set of them only one set just francesca gerrard and the girl mary agnes use them they were kept locked in the bottom drawer of mrs gerrards desk only she and the campbell girl have keys to get into it no one else lynley asked macaskin looked thoughtfully down at the plan moving his eyes along the lower northwest corridor of the house it was part of a quadrangle possibly an addition to the original building and it grew out of the great hall not far from the stairway he pointed to the first room in the corridor theres gowan kilbride he said pensively a kind of jackofalltrades he could have got to the keys had he known they were there did he know its possible i gather that gowans duties dont generally range to the upper floors of the house so hed have no need of the master keys but he might have known about them had mary agnes told him where they were and might she have done so macaskin shrugged perhaps theyre teenagers arent they teenagers sometimes try to impress each other all sorts of silly ways especially if theres an attraction between them did mary agnes say if the master keys were in their normal place this morning had they been disturbed apparently not since the desk was locked as usual but its not the kind of thing the girl is likely to have noticed she unlocked the desk reached into the drawer for the keys whether they were in the exact spot she had last left them she doesnt know since the last time she put them in the desk she merely dropped them inside without a second thought lynley marvelled at the amount of information macaskin had been able to gather in his restricted time at the house he eyed the man with growing respect these people all knew each other didnt they so why was joy sinclairs door locked argiebargie last nicht lonan put in from his chair in the corner an argument what sort macaskin shot the constable an aggrieved look apparently for lapsing into colloquialism something that his men were obviously not supposed to do he said apologetically thats all we managed to get from gowan kilbride this morning before mrs gerrard strongarmed him away with the order to wait for scotland yard just that there was some sort of row involving the lot of them seems some china was broken in the midst of it and there was an accident in the great hall with liquor one of my men found bits and pieces of broken porcelain and glass thrown into the rubbish some waterford also it looks like quite a setto involving helen as well st james didnt wait for an answer how well does she know these people tommy lynley shook his head slowly i didnt know she knew them at all she didnt tell you she begged off cornwall with other plans st james she didnt tell me what they were and i didnt ask lynley looked up to see the change in macaskins expression a sudden movement of his eyes and lips nearly imperceptible what is it macaskin seemed to give pause to think before he reached for a folder flipped it open and drew out a slip of paper it was not a report but a message the kind that gives information in eyes only fashion from one professional to another fingerprints he explained on the key that locked the door adjoining helen clydes and the victims rooms as if in the knowledge that he was dancing his way down a very fine line between disobeying his own chief constables orders to leave everything to the yard and giving a brother officer what assistance he could macaskin added appreciate it if youd make no mention of hearing this from me when you write your report but once we saw that the door between those two rooms was our access route we brought its key back here for testing on the sly and compared the prints on it with some we lifted from water glasses in the other rooms the other rooms lynley asked so theyre not helens prints on the key macaskin shook his head when he spoke his voice was tellingly noncommittal no they belong to the director of the play a welshman bloke called rhys daviesjones lynley did not respond immediately rather after a moment he said then helen and daviesjones must have exchanged rooms last night across from him he saw sergeant havers wince but she didnt look at him instead she ran one stubby finger along the edge of the table and kept her eyes on st james inspector she began in a careful voice but macaskin interrupted her no according to mary agnes campbell no one at all spent the night in daviesjones room then where on earth did helen lynley stopped feeling the grip of something awful take him like the onslaught of an illness that swept right through his skin oh he said and then sorry dont know what i was thinking about he fixed his eyes on the fl oor plan intently as he did so he heard sergeant havers mutter a brooding oath she reached into her pocket and pulled out the six cigarettes she had taken from him in the van one was broken so she tossed it in the rubbish and picked another have a smoke sir she sighed one cigarette lynley found did not do much to ameliorate the situation you have no hold on helen he told himself roughly just friendship just history just years of shared laughterand nothing else she was his amusing companion his confidante his friend but never his lover they had both been too careful too wary for that too much on guard ever to become entangled with each other have you started the autopsy he asked macaskin clearly this was the question the scot had been awaiting ever since their arrival with the kind of undisguised flourish typical of magicians on the stage he removed several copies of a perfectly assembled report from one of his folders and passed them out indicating the most pertinent piece of information the victim had been stabbed with an eighteeninchlong highland dagger that had pierced her neck and severed her carotid artery she had bled to death weve not done the complete postmortem however macaskin added regretfully lynley turned to st james would she have been able to make any noise not from this kind of wound burbles at best i should guess nothing that anyone could have heard in another room his eyes went down the page have you managed a drug screen he asked macaskin the inspector was ready page three negative she was clean no barbiturates no amphetamines no toxins youve set the time of death between two and six thats the preliminary weve not analysed the intestines yet but our mans given us fibres in the wound leather and rabbit fur the killer was wearing gloves thats our guess but theyve not been found and we had no time to search for much of anything before we got the message to come back here all we can say is that the fur and leather didnt come from the weapon nothing came from the weapon in fact save the victims blood the handle was wiped clean sergeant havers flipped through her copy of the report and tossed it on to the table eighteeninch dagger she said slowly where does one find something like that in scotland macaskin seemed surprised by her ignorance in every house i should say there was a time when no scotsman ever went out without a dirk strapped to his hip in this particular house he pointed to the dining room on the floor plan theres a display of them on the wall handcarved hilts tips like rapiers real museum pieces murder weapon appears to have been taken from there according to your plan where does mary agnes sleep a room in the northwest corridor between gowans room and mrs gerrards offi ce st james was making notes in the margin of his report as the inspector talked what about movement on the victims part he asked the wound isnt immediately fatal was there any evidence that she tried to seek help macaskin pursed his lips and shook his head couldnt have happened impossible why macaskin opened his last folder and took out a stack of photographs the knife impaled her to the mattress he said bluntly she couldnt go anywhere im afraid he dropped the pictures on to the table they were large eight by ten and in glossy colour lynley picked them up he was used to looking at death he had seen it manifested in every way imaginable throughout his years with the yard but never had he seen it brought about with such studied brutality the killer had driven the dirk in right up to its hilt as if propelled by an atavistic rage that had wanted more than the mere obliteration of joy sinclair she lay with her eyes open but their colour was changed and obscured by the settled stare of death as he looked at the woman lynley wondered how long she had lived once the knife was driven into her throat he wondered if she had known at all what had happened to her in the instant it took the killer to plunge the knife home had shock overcome her at once with its blessing of oblivion or had she lain helpless waiting for both unconsciousness and death it was a horrible crime a crime whose enormity delineated itself in the saturated mattress that drank the womans blood in her outstretched hand that reached for assistance that would never come in her parted lips and soundless cry there is lynley thought no crime so execrable as murder it contaminates and pollutes and no life it touches no matter how tangentially can ever be the same he passed the photographs to st james and looked at macaskin now he said shall we consider the intriguing question of what happened at westerbrae between sixfi fty when mary agnes campbell found the body and seventen when someone finally managed to get round to phoning the police the road to westerbrae was poorly maintained in the summer negotiating its switchbacks its potholes its steep climbs to moors and quick descents to dales would be diffi cult enough in the winter it was hell even with constable lonan at the wheel of strathclyde cids land rover well equipped to handle the perilous conditions they did not arrive at the house until nearly dusk emerging from the woods and swinging through the final curve on a sheet of ice that caused lonan and macaskin to curse fervently in unison as a result the constable took the final forty yards at a respectable crawl and switched off the ignition at last with undisguised relief in front of them the building loomed like a gothic nightmare on the landscape completely unilluminated and deadly quiet constructed entirely of grey granite in the fashion of a previctorian hunting lodge it shot out wings sprouted chimneys and managed to look menacing in spite of the snow that mounded like fresh clotted cream on its roof it had peculiar crowstepped gables shaped from smaller granite blocks stacked in a staggered fashion behind one of these the curious architectural appendage of a slateroofed tower was tucked into the abutment of two wings of the house its deeply recessed windows bare of covering and without light a white doriccolumned portico sheltered the front door and over it trailing wisps of a now leafless vine made an heroic effort to climb to the roof the entire structure combined the fancies of three periods of architecture and at least as many cultures and as lynley evaluated it he thought that it hardly had the potential to be macaskins romantic spot for newlyweds the drive they parked on was well channelled and gouged evidence of the number of vehicles that had come and gone during the day but at this hour westerbrae may well have been deserted even the snow surrounding it was pristine and untouched across the lawn and down the slope to the loch for a moment no one stirred then macaskin casting a glance over his shoulder at the london group shoved open the door and fresh air assaulted them it was glacial they climbed out reluctantly a nasty wind was gusting off the water a short distance away an unforgiving reminder of how far north loch achiemore and westerbrae really were it blew numbingly from the arctic stinging cheeks and piercing lungs and carrying with it the flavour of nearby pines and the faint musk of peat fires burning in the surrounding countryside huddling into themselves for protection against it they crossed the drive quickly macaskin pounded on the door two of his men had been left behind that morning and one admitted them into the house he was a freckled constable with monstrously large hands and a bulky muscled body that strained against the buttons of his uniform carrying a tray covered by the sort of insubstantial sandwiches that usually decorate plates at tea he was chewing ravenously like an overlarge waif who has not seen food in many days and may very well not see it again for days more he beckoned them into the great hall and thudded the door closed behind them swallowing cuik arrived thirty minutes back he explained hurriedly to macaskin who was eying him with a disapproval that thinned his lips i was juist takin this in tae them dinna seem they should gae much longer wiout fude macaskins expression withered the man to silence dismay stained his cheeks and he shifted from one foot to the other as if unsure about what he should do to explain himself further to his superior where are they lynleys glance took in the hall noting its handmoulded panelling and its immense unlit chandelier the fl oor was bare recently refinished and even more recently marred by a wide stain that pooled across it and dripped like treacle down one of the walls all the doors leading off the hall were closed and the only light came from the reception desk tucked under the stairs apparently the constable had made this his duty post that day for it was littered with teacups and magazines library macaskin answered his eyes darted suspiciously to his man as if the courtesy of supplying the suspects with food may well have led to other courtesies which he would live to regret theyve been in there since we left this morning euan at this the young constable grinned aye wi brief visits tae the tollet down the northest corridor two minutes unlocked door maiself or willam richt awside he went on as macaskin led the others across the hall th one is still in a fair rage inspector not used tae spendin the day n her nichtgawn i should guess it was lynley quickly discovered a more than accurate description of lady helen clydes state of mind when inspector macaskin unlocked and pushed open the library door she was the fi rst one on her feet and whatever had been simmering on the back burner of her selfcontrol was clearly about to boil over she took three steps forward her slippers moving soundlessly on what looked likebut could not possibly have beenan aubusson carpet now you listen to me i absolutely insist her words were hot with fury but they iced over into mute astonishment when she saw the new arrivals whatever lynley might have thought he would feel at this first sight of lady helen he was not prepared for tenderness yet it overcame him in an unexpected rush she looked so pathetic she was wearing a mans greatcoat over her dressing gown and slippers the cuffs had been folded back but there was nothing at all to be done about the garments length or about its wide shoulders so it hung on her baggily dangling to her ankles her usually smooth chestnut hair was dishevelled she wore absolutely no makeup and in the halflight of the room she looked like one of fagins boys all of twelve years old and badly in need of rescue it passed through lynleys mind that this was probably the first time he had ever seen helen at a loss for words and he said to her drily you always did know how to dress for an occasion tommy lady helen replied a hand went to her hair in a gesture that was born more of confusion than selfconsciousness she added inanely youre not in cornwall indeed im not in cornwall that brief exchange charged those assembled in the library into furious action they had been fairly spread out across the room seated near the fire standing by the bar gathered in a collection of chairs under the glassfronted bookshelves but now nearly everyone began to moveand to shoutat once voices came from all directions with no desire for answer merely a need to give vent to wrath it was instantaneous pandemonium my solicitor shall hear bloody police kept us locked the most outrageous behaviour ive ever seen were supposed to be living in a civilised no wonder to me that the countrys gone to hell unmoved by their anger lynley passed his eyes over them and made a quick survey of the room the heavy rose curtains were drawn and only two lamps had been lit but there was quite enough light for him to study the company as they continued to make vociferous demands which he continued to ignore he recognised the principal players in the drama mostly by their relative proximity to what was clearly the main attraction and dominant force in the room britain s foremost actress joanna ellacourt she was standing by the bar a wintry blonde beauty whose white angora sweater and matching wool trousers seemed to emphasise the temperature of disdain with which she greeted the arrival of the police as if in the expectation of meeting some need of hers at joannas elbow stood a brawny older man with heavylidded eyes and coarse greying hairno doubt her husband david sydeham only two steps away on joannas other side her leading man turned abruptly back to a drink that he was nursing at the bar robert gabriel was either not interested in the newcomers or eager not to be seen until properly fortified for the encounter and in front of gabriel having risen quickly from the couch on which he had been sitting stuart rintoul lord stinhurst studied lynley intently as if with the purpose of casting him in some future production there were others in the room whose identities lynley could only guess at for the moment two older women near the fi re most likely lord stinhursts wife and his sister francesca gerrard an angryfaced pudgy man somewhere in his thirties who smoked a pipe wore newish tweeds and seemed to be the journalist jeremy vinney sharing a settee with him an exceedingly illdressed unattractive middleaged spinster type whose extreme lankiness if not her resemblance to lord stinhurst indicated that she had to be his daughter the two teenagers employed at the hotel together at the furthest corner of the room and in a low chair nearly obscured by shadows a blackhaired woman who raised a haunted face to lynley hollowcheeked darkeyed with an undercurrent of passion held in savagely tight rein irene sinclair lynley guessed the victims sister but none of these was the one person lynley was looking for and he passed his eyes over the group once again until he found the director of the play recognising him from the olive skin black hair and sombre eyes of the welsh rhys daviesjones was standing by the chair that lady helen had just vacated he had moved when she did as if to prevent her from confronting the police alone he stopped however when it became apparent to everyone that this particular policeman was no stranger to lady helen clyde across the width of the room and through the gulf created by the conflict of their cultures lynley looked at daviesjones feeling an aversion take hold of him one so strong that it seemed a physical illness helens lover he thought and then more fiercely to convince himself of the facts grim immutability this is helens lover no man could have looked less likely for the role the welshman was at least ten years helens senior quite possibly more with curly hair going to grey at the temples and a thin weathered face he was wiry and fit like his celtic ancestors also like them he was neither tall nor handsome his features were sharp and stony but lynley could not deny that the look of the man spoke of both intelligence and inner strength qualities that helen would recogniseand valuebeyond any others sergeant havers lynleys voice cut through the continued protestations eliminating them abruptly take lady helen to her room and allow her to get dressed where are the keys wideeyed and whitefaced a young girl came forward mary agnes campbell fi nder of the body she held out a silver tray on which someone had deposited all of the hotel keys but her hands were shaking so the tray and its contents jangled discordantly lynleys eyes took it in then moved to the assembled company i locked all the rooms and collected the keys immediately after shethe body was discovered this morning lord stinhurst resumed his seat by the fire a couch which he was sharing with one of the two older women her hand groped for his and their fingers intertwined im not certain what the procedure is in a case like this stinhurst concluded in explanation but that seemed the best when lynley looked less than willing to receive this bit of news with appreciation macaskin interjected everyone was in the drawing room when we arrived this morning his lordship had done us the service of locking them in how helpful of lord stinhurst it was sergeant havers speaking in a voice so polite that it sounded like steel find your key helen lynley said her eyes had never left his face since hed fi rst spoken to her he could feel them on him now her gaze warm like a touch the rest of you may be expected to be inconvenienced awhile longer into the storm of fresh protests that greeted this remark lady helen started to respond but joanna ellacourt expertly wrested the stage from her by crossing the room to lynley the lighting became her and joanna walked like a woman who knew how to use the moment her long unpinned hair moved like sunshot silk upon her shoulders inspector she murmured motioning gracefully towards the door i feel i may ask youif its not too much i should be only too grateful to be given just a few moments to myself somewhere out of here in my own room perhaps but if thats not possible just in any room anywhere with a single chair on which i could sit and ponder and gather my wits once again five minutes only if you would be so good as to see to it for me i should feel in your debt after this dreadful day her performance was lovely blanche dubois in scotland but lynley had no intention of acting the part of her gentleman from dallas im sorry he replied im afraid you shall have to rely on the kindness of strangers other than myself and then he repeated find your key helen lady helen made a gesture lynley recognised a prelude to speaking he turned away well be in the sinclair room he said to havers let me know when shes dressed constable lonan see that the rest of them stay here for now angry voices swelled again lynley ignored them and left the room st james and macaskin followed left with this group of ladeda suspects so atypical of what one usually came across in a murder investigation barbara havers was only too delighted to make her own assessments of their potential guilt she had the time to do so as lady helen returned to rhys daviesjones and exchanged a few quiet words with him beneath the general din of expostulations and imprecations that followed lynleys departure they were quite the lot barbara decided chic and well tailored and divinely turned out with the exception of lady helen they were a veritable advertisement for how to dress for a murder and how to act once the police arrive righteous indignation calls for solicitors nasty remarks so far they were living up to her every expectation at any moment no doubt one of them would mention a close connection with his mp an intimacy with mrs thatcher or a notable figure on his family tree they were all the same such swells such toffs all but that one pinchfaced woman who had managed to shrink her considerable frame into an illshaped heap on the settee as far away as possible from the man with whom she shared it elizabeth rintoul barbara thought lady elizabeth rintoul to be exact lord stinhursts only daughter she was acting as if the man seated next to her carried a particularly virulent strain of disease cringed into a corner of the couch she held a navy cardigan closed at her throat and pressed both arms tightly painfully to her sides her feet were planted on the fl oor in front of her shod in the kind of fl atsoled plain black shoes that are generally labelled sensible they stuck out like angular blobs of oil from beneath an unappealing black fl annel skirt lint dotted it liberally she added nothing whatsoever to the conversation going on about her but something in her posture suggested bones that were brittle and about to break elizabeth dear murmured the woman opposite her she wore the kind of meaningful ingratiating smile one directs to a recalcitrant child misbehaving before company obviously this was mum barbara decided lady stinhurst herself dressed in a fawncoloured twinset and amber beads ankles neatly crossed and hands folded in her lap perhaps mr vinneys drink could be replenished elizabeth rintouls dull eyes moved to her mother perhaps she responded she made the word sound foul casting a pleading glance at her husband as if for support lady stinhurst persisted she had a gentle uncertain voice the sort one expects from maiden ladies not accustomed to speaking to children she lifted a hand nervously to hair that was expertly coloured and styled to fight off the reality of fastencroaching old age you see darling weve been sitting so long now and i really dont believe mr vinneys had anything at all since half past two it was far more than a hint it was a blatant suggestion the bar was just across the room and elizabeth was to wait upon mr vinney like a debutante with her very first beau the directions were clear enough but elizabeth wasnt about to follow them instead contempt flashed across her features and she dropped her eyes to a magazine in her lap she mouthed a singularly unladylike response one word only her mother could not possibly misread or misunderstand it barbara watched the exchange between them with some fascination the lady elizabeth looked well over thirty years oldprobably skating closer to forty she was hardly of an age to need a prod from mum in the man department but prod was certainly what mum had in mind in fact in spite of elizabeth s unveiled hostility lady stinhurst made a movement that looked very much as if she intended to shove elizabeth in the direction of mr vinneys arms not that jeremy vinney himself appeared willing next to elizabeth the times journalist was doing his best to ignore the conversation entirely he probed at his pipe with a stainless steel tool and eavesdropped unashamedly on what joanna ellacourt was saying at her end of the room she was angry and making no secret about the fact shes made wonderful fools of us all hasnt she what a lark for her what a bloody good laugh the actress cast a scathing look at irene sinclair who still sat in her low chair far away from the rest of them as if her sisters death somehow had served to make her own presence unwelcome and who do you imagine benefits from last nights little change in the script me not on your life well i wont stand for it david i damn well wont stand for it david sydeham sounded conciliatory as he answered his wife nothings settled yet jo far from it now once she changed the script your contract may well have become void you think the contract is void but you dont have it here do you we cant look at it can we you dont know if its void at all yet you expect me to believeto take your word after all thats happenedthat merely a change in characterisation makes a contract void pardon my disbelief will you pardon my incredulous shriek of laughter and give me another gin now sydeham wordlessly jerked his head at robert gabriel who pushed a bottle of beefeaters in his direction it was twothirds empty sydeham poured his wife a drink and returned the bottle to gabriel who grasped it and murmured with laughter catching at his voice i have thee not and yet i see thee still come let me clutch thee gabriel leered at joanna and poured himself another drink sweet shades of the regionals jo mlove wasnt that our first hmm no perhaps not he managed to make it sound more like a sexual encounter than a production of macbeth scores of her school chums had swooned over gabriels peter pan good looks fi fteen years ago but barbara had never been able to see his appeal nor apparently did joanna ellacourt she favoured him with a smile that hurled daggers of an entirely different sort darling she responded how could i ever forget you dropped ten lines in the middle of act two and i carried you all the way to the end frankly ive been waiting for those multitudinous seas to become incarnadine for the last seventeen years gabriel gave a snort of laughter west end bitch he announced ever true to form youre drunk which was certainly more than halfway true as if in response to this francesca gerrard stood up uneasily pushing herself away from the couch she was sharing with her brother lord stinhurst she seemed to want to take control of the situation perhaps to act out the role of hotel proprietress in even so inconsequential a manner as she chose when she turned to barbara if we could have some coffee her hand fluttered up to a collection of coloured beads which she wore across her chest like mail contact with them seemed to give her courage she spoke again with more authority wed like some coffee will you arrange it when barbara didnt reply she turned to lord stinhurst stuart he spoke id appreciate your arranging for a pot of coffee he said to barbara some of the party want sobering up barbara gave fleeting and delighted thought to how many opportunities she would ever have again to put an earl in his place sorry she replied tartly and then she said to lady helen if youll come with me now i should guess the inspector will want to see you fi rst lady helen clyde felt more than a little numb as she fumbled her way across the library she told herself that it was the lack of food the endless and appalling day the ghastly discomfort of sitting hour after hour in her nightclothes in a room that had continually alternated between subfreezing and claustrophobic reaching the doorway she gathered the greatcoat about her with as much dignity as she could muster and stepped out into the hall sergeant havers was an unacknowledged companion behind her are you quite all right helen gratefully lady helen turned to see that st james had waited for her he stood in the shadows just outside the door lynley and macaskin had already disappeared up the stairs she smoothed her hand against her hair in an attempt to arrange it but gave up the effort with a small chagrined smile can you possibly imagine what its been like to spend an entire day with a roomful of individuals who communicate directly with thespis she asked st james weve run the gamut since half past seven this morning from rage to hysteria to grief to paranoia frankly by noon i would have sold my soul for just one of hedda gablers pistols she drew the greatcoat up to her throat and held it closed at her neck stifling a shiver but im fine at least i think so her eyes took in the stairs and then moved back to st james whatevers wrong with tommy behind her sergeant havers moved with inexplicable sharpness but it was a gesture lady helen couldnt clearly see st james she noted took his time about replying using a moment to brush at the leg of his trousers there was nothing on them for his attention however and when he chose to speak it was to ask a question of his own what on earth are you doing here helen she glanced back at the closed library door rhys invited me he was to direct lord stinhursts new production for the opening of the agincourt theatre and this weekend was to be a runthrougha sort of preliminary reading of the new script rhys st james repeated rhys daviesjones you dont remember him my sister used to see him years ago before he lady helen twisted a button at the throat of the greatcoat hesitating wondering how much to say she settled on hes been working in regional theatre over the past two years this was to be his fi rst london production sincethe tempest four years ago we were there surely you remember she saw that he did lord st james said with some reverence was that daviesjones id completely forgotten lady helen wondered how that was even possible for it was something she knew she could never forget that awful night at the theatre when rhys daviesjones the director had taken the stage himself and everyone had seen he was inches short of delirious shoving actors and actresses alike to one side chasing demons only he could see he had publicly ended his career with a vengeance she could see it all stillthe stage the pandemonium the devastation he had wrought upon himself and others for it had been during the act speech when his drunken frenzy broke into the lovely words blotting out both his past and future in an instant leaving indeed not a single rack behind he spent four months in hospital after that hes quiterecovered now i ran into him early last month in the brompton road we had dinner andwell ever since weve seen a good deal of each other his recovery must be complete indeed if hes working with stinhurst ellacourt and gabriel lofty company for a man of his reputation lady helen frowned down at the floor touching her slippered foot delicately to one of the pegs that held the wood in place yes i suppose but joy sinclair was his cousin they were very close and i think she saw the opportunity to give him a second chance in london theatre she was instrumental in talking lord stinhurst into giving rhys the contract she had infl uence with stinhurst ive got the impression joy had infl uence with everyone meaning lady helen hesitated she was not a woman given to saying anything that might denigrate others even in a murder investigation doing so now went against the grain even with st james always a man she could trust implicitly waiting for her answer she gave it reluctantly prefacing it with a quick look at sergeant havers to read her face for its degree of discretion apparently she had an affair with robert gabriel last year simon they had a tremendous row about it only yesterday afternoon gabriel wanted joy to tell his former wife that he slept with her just once joy refused it well the row was heading towards violence when rhys burst into joys room and broke it up st james looked perplexed i dont understand did joy sinclair know robert gabriels wife did she even know he was married oh yes lady helen answered robert gabriel was married for nineteen years to irene sinclair joys sister inspector macaskin unlocked the door and admitted lynley and st james into joy sinclairs room he felt for the wall switch and two serpentine bronze ceiling fi xtures spilled light down on the wealth of contradictions below it was lynley saw a beautiful room the sort one expects the plays star performer to be given not its author expensively papered in green and yellow it was furnished with a fourposter victorian bed and nineteenthcentury chest of drawers wardrobe and chairs a comfortably faded axminster carpet covered the oak floor and the boards creaked with age when they walked across it yet the room was still very much the scene of a brutal crime and the frigid air was a rich effluvium of blood and destruction the bed acted as centrepiece with its writhing confusion of bloodsoaked linens and its single deadly gash that spoke eloquently of the manner in which the woman had died donning latex gloves the three men approached it with a fair degree of respect lynley taking in the room with a sweeping glance macaskin pocketing francesca gerrards master keys and st james scrutinising those scant feet and inches of horrifying catafalque as if they could reveal to him the identity of their maker as the other two watched st james removed a small folding ruler from his pocket and leaning over the bed delicately probed the ugly puncture at the centre top the mattress was unusual woolfilled in the manner of a tick packing of this sort would make it soothingly comfortable moulded to shoulders hips and the small of ones back and it had the additional benefit of having shaped itself cooperatively round the intrusive murder weapon faultlessly reproducing the direction of entry one thrust st james said to the others over his shoulder righthanded delivered from the left side of the bed inspector macaskin spoke curtly possible for a woman if the dirk was sharp enough st james responded it would take no great force to drive it through a womans neck another woman could have done it he looked pensive but why is it that one cant really imagine a woman committing a crime such as this macaskins eyes were on the immense stain that was not yet dry upon the mattress sharp yes damned sharp he said moodily a killer covered with blood not necessarily i should guess that he would have blood on his right hand and arm but if he managed it quickly and shielded himself with the bed linen he might well have got away with just a spot or two and that if he didnt panic could easily be wiped off on one of the sheets and that spot on the sheet then mingled in with the blood that the wound produced what about his clothing st james examined the two pillows set them on a chair and peeled back the bottom sheet from the mattress a careful inch at a time the killer might well have worn no clothes at all he noted it would be far easier to see to it in the nude then he could return to his room or to her room this with a nod at macaskin and wash the blood off with soap and water if there was any on him in the fi rst place that would be a risk wouldnt it macaskin asked not to mention cold as the dickens st james paused to compare the hole in the sheet with that in the mattress the entire crime was a risk joy sinclair might well have awakened and screamed like a banshee if she was asleep in the first place lynley noted he had gone to the dressing table near the window a jumble of articles took up its surface makeup hair brushes hair dryer tissues a mass of jewellery among which were three rings five silver bangles and two strings of coloured beads a gold hoop earring lay on the floor st james lynley said his eyes on the table when you and deborah go to an hotel do you lock the door as soon as possible he replied with a smile but i suppose that comes from living in the same house with ones fatherinlaw a few days out of his presence and we become hopeless reprobates im ashamed to say why where do you leave the key st james looked from lynley to the door in the keyhole generally yes from the dressing table lynley picked up the door key by the metal ring that attached the key to its plastic identifi cation tab most people do so why do you suppose joy sinclair locked the door and put the key on the dressing table there was an argument last night wasnt there she was part of it she may well have been distracted or upset when she came in she may have locked the door and tossed the key there in a fit of temper possibly or perhaps she wasnt the one who locked the door at all perhaps she didnt come in by herself but with someone else who did the locking up while she waited in the bed lynley noticed that inspector macaskin was pulling at his lip he said to him you dont agree macaskin chewed on the side of his thumb for a moment before he dropped his hand with a look of distaste as if it had climbed to his mouth of its own volition as to someone being with her he said no i dont think so lynley dropped the key back on to the dressing table and went to the wardrobe opening the doors inside clothes hung in a haphazard arrangement shoes were tossed to the back a pair of blue jeans was in a heap on the floor a suitcase yawned displaying stockings and brassieres lynley looked through these items and turned back to macaskin why not he asked him as st james crossed the room to the chest of drawers and began going through it because of what she was wearing macaskin explained you couldnt have recognised much from the cid photographs but she had on a mans pyjama top doesnt that make it even more likely that someone was with her youre thinking that she had on the pyjama top of whoever came to see her i cant agree why not lynley closed the wardrobe door and leaned against it his eyes on macaskin realistically then macaskin began with the assurance of an exponent who has given his subject a great deal of prior thought does a man bent on seduction go to a womans room in his oldest pyjamas top she had on was thin washed many times and worn through at the elbows in two separate spots at least six or seven years old i should guess possibly older not exactly what one would expect a man to have on or for that matter to leave as a memento for a woman to wear after a night of lovemaking how you describe it lynley said thoughtfully it sounds more like a talisman doesnt it indeed lynleys agreement seemed to encourage macaskin to warm to his topic he paced the distance from bed to dressing table and from there to the wardrobe using his hands for emphasis and supposing it had always belonged to her and came from no man at all would she wait for a lover in her oldest bedclothes i hardly think so i agree st james said from the chest of drawers and considering that weve not one reasonable sign of a struggle we have to conclude that even if she wasnt asleep when the murderer enteredif it was someone she let in the room for a friendly chatshe certainly was asleep when he plunged the dirk through her throat or perhaps not asleep lynley said slowly but taken completely by surprise by someone she had reason to trust but in that case wouldnt she have locked the door herself not necessarily macaskin said the murderer could have locked it killed her and returned to helens room lynley finished coldly his head snapped towards st james by god not yet st james replied they gathered at a small magazinecovered table by the window and sat surveying the room companionably lynley fl ipped through the assortment of periodicals st james lifted the lid of the teapot on the abandoned morning tray and gave consideration to the transparent film that had formed on the liquid and macaskin tapped a pen in staccato against the bottom of his shoe weve two lapses of time st james said twenty minutes or more between the discovery of the body and the call to the police then nearly two hours between the call to the police and their arrival here he gave his attention to macaskin and your crimescene men werent able to go over the room thoroughly before you had the call from your cc ordering you back to the station thats right then you may as well have them go over the room now if you want to phone for them i dont expect well gain much from the effort though any amount of apocryphal evidence could have been planted in here during that time or removed macaskin noted blackly with only lord stinhursts word that he locked all the doors and waited for us and did nothing else that remark struck a chord in lynley he got to his feet and went without speaking from the chest of drawers to the wardrobe to the dressing table the other two watched as he opened doors and drawers and looked behind furniture the script he said they were here to work on a script werent they joy sinclair was the author so where is it why are there no notes where are all the scripts macaskin jumped to his feet ill see to that he said and vanished in an instant as the one door closed behind him the second door opened were ready in here sergeant havers said from lady helens room lynley looked at st james he peeled off his gloves im not the least looking forward to this he admitted lady helen had never really thought about how much her selfconfidence was tied up in a daily bath having been forbidden that simple luxury she had become ridiculously consumed by a need to bathe that was thwarted by sergeant havers simple sorry i have to stay with you and i should guess youd rather not have me scrubbing your back as a result she felt at odds with herself like a woman forced to wear skin that was not her own at least they had compromised on makeup although seeing to her face under the watchful eye of the detective sergeant made lady helen distinctly uncomfortable as if she were a mannequin on display this feeling increased while she dressed pulling on clothing that first came to hand without the least regard for what it was or how it looked upon her she knew only the cool movement of silk the scratchy pull of wool as to what the garments were as to whether they matched one another or were a battle of colours taking her appearance down to perdition she could not have said and all the time she could hear st james lynley and inspector macaskin in the next room they were not talking at any particular volume yet she heard them with ease so she wondered what on earth she would tell them when they asked heras they no doubt wouldwhy she had never managed to hear a single sound in the night from joy sinclair she was still pondering this question when sergeant havers opened the second door to let st james and lynley into the room she turned to face them what a mess i am tommy she said with a cheerful smile you must swear by every sartorial god there is that youll never tell anyone i was wearing a dressing gown and slippers at four in the afternoon without answering lynley stopped by an armchair it was highbacked upholstered in a pattern that matched the rooms wallpaperroses on creamand set on an angle three feet from the door he appeared to be examining it for no particular reason and at some considerable length then he bent and from behind it he picked up a mans black tie which he laid across the back of the chair with steady deliberation with a final look round the room he nodded at sergeant havers who opened her notebook at all this lady helens additional score of lighthearted preliminary remarks designed to break through the professional reticence that she had encountered from lynley in the library died a sudden death he had the upper hand lady helen saw in an instant how he meant to use it sit down helen when she would have chosen another place he said at the table please like the arrangement of furniture in joy sinclairs room the table was placed beneath a bay window the curtains undrawn darkness had fallen quickly outside and the pane reflected both ghostly reflections and gold streaks of lamplight from the bedside table against the far wall a cobwebbing of frost patterned itself against the window outside and lady helen knew that if she put her hand to the glass it would feel burning cold like a clear sheet of ice she walked to one of the chairs they were eighteenthcentury pieces upholstered in yet unfaded tapestry bearing a mythological scene lady helen knew she should recognise the young man and nymphlike woman who reached out to each other in the pastoral settingindeed she knew that lynley himself probably did but whether it was paris eager for the promised reward after rendering judgement or echo pining for narcissus she could not have said and more at the moment she didnt particularly care lynley joined her at the table his eyes rested on the telling items that covered it a bottle of cognac an overfull ashtray and a delft plate of oranges one partially peeled but then discarded yet still exuding a faint citrus scent he took these in as sergeant havers pulled the dressing tables stool over to join them and st james made a slow circuit of the room lady helen had seen st james work a hundred times before she knew how unlikely it was that any detail would escape him yet watching his familiar routine directed at her this time she felt a tightening of muscles as she witnessed him engage in a cursory examination of the tops of chest of drawers and dressing table of wardrobe and floor it was like a violation and when he threw back the covers of her unmade bed and ran his eyes speculatively over the sheets her selfcontrol snapped my god simon is that absolutely necessary none of them answered but their silence was enough and the combination of having been locked up for nearly nine hours like a common criminal and sitting here now while they proposed to question her dispassionatelyas if they were not all three tied together by years of pain and friendshipcaused anger to swell like a tumour within her she fought against it with limited success her eyes moved back to lynley and she made herself ignore the sounds of st james movement in the room behind her tell us about the row that occurred last night from their behaviour lady helen had expected lynleys first question to concern itself with the bedroom this unexpected start took her by surprise disarming her momentarily as he no doubt intended i wish i could all i know for certain is that it involved the play joy sinclair was writing lord stinhurst and she had a terrible quarrel about it joanna ellacourt was furious as well why from what i could gather the play joy brought with her for this weekend runthrough was considerably different from the play that everyone signed on to do in london she did announce at dinner that shed made a few changes here and there but evidently the changes were far more extensive than anyone was prepared for it was still a murder mystery but little else was the same so the argument grew from there when did all this occur wed gone into the sitting room to do a readthrough of the script the quarrel broke out not five minutes into it it was so odd tommy theyd hardly begun when francescalord stinhursts sisterabsolutely leaped to her feet as if shed had the most dreadful shock of her life she began shouting at lord stinhurst saying something like no stuart stop her and then she tried to get out of the room only she became confused or lost her way because she backed directly into a large curio cabinet and smashed it to pieces i cant think how she managed not to cut herself to shreds in the process but she didnt what was everyone else doing lady helen sketched out each persons behaviour as best she remembered it robert gabriel staring at stuart rintoul lord stinhurst obviously waiting for him either to deal with joy or to go to his sisters aid irene sinclair growing pale to the very lips as the situation escalated joanna ellacourt fl inging her script down and stalking out of the room in a rage followed a moment later by her husband david sydeham joy sinclair smiling across the walnut reading table at lord stinhurst and that smile apparently fi ring him into action so that he jumped to his feet grabbed her arm and dragged her into the morning room next door slamming the door behind them lady helen concluded with and then elizabeth rintoul went after her aunt francesca she appearedit was hard to tell but she may have been crying which seems a bit out of character for her why i dont know elizabeth seems to have given up crying some time ago lady helen replied shes given up on lots of things i think joy sinclair among them they used to be close friends from what rhys told me you havent mentioned what he did after the readthrough lynley pointed out but he gave her no time to answer saying instead stinhurst and joy sinclair had the quarrel by themselves then the others werent involved only stinhurst and joy i could hear their voices from the morning room shouting a bit from joy but actually i didnt hear much from stinhurst he doesnt seem to be the kind of man who has to raise his voice to get ones attention does he so the only thing i really heard clearly was joy shouting hysterically about someone called alec she said alec knew and lord stinhurst killed him because of it next to her lady helen heard sergeant havers indrawn breath which was followed by a speculative look in lynleys direction immediately comprehending lady helen hurried on to say but surely that was a metaphorical statement tommy a bit like if you do that youll kill your mother you know what i mean and at any rate lord stinhurst didnt even respond to it he just left saying something like as far as he was concerned she was through or words to that effect and after that joy and stinhurst went upstairs separately but they both looked dreadful as if neither had won the argument and both wished it had never come about jeremy vinney tried to say something to joy when she came out into the hall but she wouldnt talk she may have been crying as well i couldnt tell where did you go from there helen lynley was studying the ashtray the cigarette butts that littered it and the ashes that dusted the tabletop in mourning grey mixed with black i heard someone in the drawing room and went in to see who it was why lady helen considered lying manufacturing an amusing description of herself governed by curiosity prowling about the house like a youthful miss marple she chose the truth instead actually tommy id been looking for rhys ah disappeared had he she bristled at lynleys tone everyone had disappeared she saw that st james had finished his perusal of the room he took a seat in the armchair near the door and leaned back against it listening lady helen knew he would take no notes but he would remember every word was daviesjones in the drawing room no lady stinhurstmarguerite rintoulwas there and jeremy vinney perhaps hed caught the scent of a story that he wanted to write for his newspaper because he seemed to be trying to question her about what had happened with no success i spoke to her as well becausefrankly she seemed to be in some sort of stupor she did talk to me briefly and strangely enough she said something very similar to what francesca had said earlier to lord stinhurst in the sitting room stop her or something like that her joy or perhaps elizabeth her daughter id just mentioned elizabeth i think id said shall i fetch elizabeth for you as she spoke feeling very much a potential suspect being interrogated by the police lady helen became aware of other sounds in the house the steady scratching of sergeant havers pencil upon her notebook paper doors being unlocked at the other end of the corridor the voice of macaskin directing a search and below in the library upon the opening and closing of the door angry shouting two men she couldnt identify them what time did you come to your room last night helen it must have been half past twelve i didnt notice what did you do when you got here i got undressed got ready for bed read for a time and then lady helen made no immediate reply she was watching lynleys face completely free to do so since he would not meet her eyes his features in repose had always combined every classical beauty possible in a man but as he continued to ask his questions lady helen saw those features begin to take on a grim impenetrability that she had never seen before and could not have guessed that he even possessed confronted with it she felt entirely cut off from him for the very first time in their long and close friendship and in a desire to put an end to this division she reached a hand forward not with the intention of touching him but in a miming of contact where contact apparently would not be allowed when he did not respond with anything that could have been taken for acknowledgement she felt compelled to speak honestly you seem terribly angry tommy please tell me what is it lynleys right fist clenched and unclenched in a movement so quick that it looked like a reflex when did you start smoking at that lady helen heard the abrupt cessation of sergeant havers writing she saw past lynley st james movement in his chair and she knew that for some reason her question had allowed lynley to reach a decision one that advanced him from police work into a new arena altogether an arena not at all governed by the manuals codes and procedures that formed the rigid boundaries of his job you know i dont smoke she withdrew her hand what did you hear last night lynley asked joy sinclair was murdered between two and six in the morning nothing im afraid it was terribly windy enough to rattle the windows that must have drowned out any noise from her room if there was any noise and of course even if it hadnt been windy you werent alone were you you weredistracted i should guess youre right i wasnt alone she saw the muscles tighten at lynleys mouth otherwise he was motionless what time did daviesjones come to your room at one and he left shortly after fi ve you saw a watch he woke me he was dressed i asked the time he told me and between one and fi ve helen lady helen felt a quick surge of disbelief what is it exactly that you want to know i want to know what happened in this room between one and five to use your own word exactly his voice was ice past the wretchedness she felt at the question itself at the brutal intrusion into her life and the implied assumption that she would be only too willing to answer it lady helen saw sergeant havers mouth drop open she closed it quickly enough however when lynleys frosty glance swept over her why are you asking me this lady helen asked lynley would you like a solicitor to explain exactly what i can and cannot ask in a murder investigation we can telephone for one if you think its necessary this wasnt her friend lady helen thought bleakly this wasnt her laughing companion of more than a decade this was a tommy she didnt know a man to whom she could give no rational response in his presence a tumult of emotions argued for precedence within her anger anguish desolation lady helen felt them attack like an onslaught not one after another but all at once they gripped her with punishing unforgiving force and when she was able to speak her words struggled desperately for indifference rhys brought me cognac she indicated the bottle on the table we talked did you drink no id had some earlier i wanted none did he have any no heisnt able to drink lynley looked towards havers tell macaskins men to check the bottle lady helen read the thought behind the order its sealed no im afraid it isnt lynley took havers pencil and applied it to the foil at the top of the cognac it came off effortlessly as if it had once been removed and then reapplied to wear the guise of a closure lady helen felt ill what are you saying that rhys brought something with him this weekend to drug me so that he could safely get away with murdering joy sinclairmy god his own cousinand have me as an alibi for his innocence is that what you think you said you talked helen am i to understand that having refused his offer of a drink of whatever is in this bottle you spent the remainder of the night in scintillating conversation together his refusal to answer her question his rigid adherence to the formality of police interrogation when it served his needs his casual decision to fix blame upon a man and then bend the facts to fit it outraged her carefully deliberately giving each separate syllable its own private position in the balance on which she measured the gravity of what he was doing to their friendship she replied no of course theres more tommy he made love to me we slept and then much later i made love to him whatever she had hoped for lynley showed absolutely no reaction to her words suddenly the smell of burnt tobacco from the ashtray was overwhelming she wanted to fling it from sight she wanted to fling it at him thats all he asked he didnt leave you during the night he didnt get out of bed he was too damnably quick for her when she couldnt keep the answer off her face he said ah yes he did get out of bed what time please helen she looked down at her hands i dont know had you been asleep yes what awakened you a noise i think it was a match he was smoking standing by the table dressed no just smoking she hesitated momentarily yes smoking yes but you noticed something more didnt you no its just that he was dragging words from her he was compelling her to say things that belonged unspoken that what you noticed something about him something not quite right no no and then lynleys eyesshrewd brown insistentheld her own i went to him and his skin was damp damp hed bathed no salty he washis shouldersperspiring and it was so cold in here lynley looked automatically to joy sinclairs room lady helen continued dont you see tommy it was the cognac he wanted it he was desperate its like an illness it had nothing at all to do with joy she might not have spoken for lynley was clearly following his own line of thought how many cigarettes did he have helen five six what you see here he was designing a pattern lady helen could see it if rhys daviesjones had taken the time to smoke the six cigarettes that lay crushed in the ashtray if she had not awakened until he was smoking the very last one what else might he have done never mind the fact that she knew perfectly well how he had spent the time while she slept fighting off legions of demons and ghouls that had drawn him to the bottle of cognac like a man with an unquenchable thirst in lynleys mind he had used the time to unlock the door murder his cousin and return his body broken out with the sweat of apprehension lady helen read all of that in the stillnesslike a voidthat followed her sentence he wanted a drink she said simply but he cant drink so he smoked thats all i see may i assume hes an alcoholic her throat felt numb its only a word rhys would have said with his gentle smile a word alone has no power helen yes so he got out of bed and you never awakened he smoked five or six cigarettes and you never awakened and you want to add that he unlocked the door to murder joy sinclair and i never awakened dont you his prints are on the key helen yes they are ive no doubt of it he locked the door before he took me to bed or are you going to say that was part of his plan to make certain i saw him lock the door so i could explain away his fingerprints later is that how you have it worked out its what youre doing isnt it she drew in a broken breath what a rotten thing to say you slept through his getting out of bed you slept through his smoking one cigarette after another are you going to try to argue now that in reality youre a light sleeper that you would have known had daviesjones left your room i would have known lynley looked over his shoulder st james he asked evenly and those two words took the entire affair out of the realm of control lady helen sprang to her feet her chair toppled over her hand came down brutally against lynleys face it was a blow of lightning swiftness driven by the power of her rage you filthy bastard she cried and headed for the door stay where you are lynley ordered she whirled and faced him arrest me inspector she left the room slamming the door behind her st james followed her at once barbara havers closed her notebook it was a studied movement one that bought her time while she thought across from her lynley felt in the breast pocket of his jacket although colour still splodged his face where lady helen had struck him his hands were quite steady he brought out his cigarette case and lighter used them both and handed them over barbara did likewise although after inhaling once she grimaced and crushed out the cigarette not a woman who ever spent a great deal of time analysing her emotions barbara did so now realising with some confusion that she had wanted to intervene in what had just occurred all lynleys questions had of course been fairly standard police procedure but the manner in which he had asked them and the nasty insinuations carried in his tone had made barbara want to throw herself into the fray as lady helens champion she couldnt understand why so she thought about it in the aftermath of lady helens departure and she found her answer in the myriad ways that the young woman had shown kindness to her in the months since barbara had been assigned to work with lynley i think inspector barbara ran her thumb back and forth on a crease in the cover of her notebook that you were more than a bit out of line just now this isnt the time for a row about procedure lynley replied his voice was dispassionate enough but barbara could hear its taut control it has nothing to do with procedure does it it has to do with decency you treated helen like a scrubber inspector and if youre about to answer that she acted like a scrubber i might suggest you take a good look at one or two items in your own chequered past and ask yourself how well theyd appear in a scrutiny the likes of which you just forced her to endure lynley drew on his cigarette but as if he found the taste unpleasant he stubbed it out in the ashtray as he did so a jerk of his hand spilled ashes across the cuff of his shirt both of them stared at the resulting contrast of black grime against white helen had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time lynley replied there was no way to get round it havers i cant give her special treatment because shes my friend is that right barbara asked well ill be fascinated to see how that line plays out when we have the two old boys together for a confi dential little chat what are you talking about lords asherton and stinhurst sitting down for a chew i can hardly wait for the chance to see you treat stuart rintoul with the same iron glove that you used on helen clyde peer to peer chap to chap etonian to etonian isnt that how it plays but as youve said none of that will get in the way of lord stinhursts unfortunate placement of himself at the wrong place at the wrong time she knew him well enough to see his quick rise to anger and what is it exactly that you would have me do sergeant ignore the facts coolly lynley began to tick them off joy sinclairs hall door is locked the master keys are for all intents and purposes unavailable daviesjones prints are on the key to the only other door that gives access to the room we have a period of time that is unaccounted for because helen was asleep all that and we havent even begun to consider where daviesjones was until one in the morning when he showed up at helens door or why helen of all people was put into this room in the fi rst place convenient isnt it when you consider that we have a man coincidentally coming here in the middle of the night to seduce helen while his cousin is being murdered in the very next room and thats the rub isnt it barbara pointed out seduction not murder lynley picked up the cigarette case and lighter slipped them back in his pocket and got to his feet he didnt respond but barbara did not require him to do so a response was pointless when she knew very well that his stiffupperlip breeding had a propensity towards deserting him in moments of personal crisis and the truth of the matter was that the instant she had seen lady helen in the library had seen lynleys face when lady helen crossed the room to him with that ridiculous greatcoat hanging forlornly to her heels barbara had known that for lynley the situation had the potential of developing into a personal crisis of some considerable proportions inspector macaskin appeared at the bedroom door fury played on his features his face was flushed his eyes snapped his skin looked tight not one script in the house inspector he announced it appears our good lord stinhurst has burnt every last one well ladedada barbara murmured to the ceiling in the lower north corridor which was onefourth of a quadrangle surrounding a courtyard where untouched snow reached nearly to the height of the leaded windows a door gave out onto the estate groundsto one side of this door francesca gerrard had established a storage areaa jumble of discarded wellingtons fishing gear rusty gardening tools mackintoshes hats coats and scarves lady helen knelt on the floor in front of this clutter throwing aside one boot after another furiously seeking a mate to the one she had already pulled on she heard the distinctive sound of st james awkward footsteps coming down the stairs and she rooted frantically among gumboots and fishing baskets determined to get out of the house before st james found her but the perverse acuity that had always allowed him to know most of her thoughts before she was even aware of thinking them led him directly to her now she heard his strained breathing from his rapid descent of the stairs and did not need to look up to know that his face would be pinched with irritation at his bodys weakness she felt his tentative touch on her shoulder she jerked away im going out she said you cant its far too cold beyond that id have too hard a time following you in the dark and i want to talk to you helen i dont think we have anything to say to each other do we you had your place at the peep show or did you want to tip the tart she looked up at that saw his reaction to her words in the sudden darkening of his smoky blue eyes but rather than rejoice in her ability to wound him she was defeated at once she ceased her search and stood with one boot on and another uselessly in her hand st james reached out and lady helen felt his cool dry fingers close over her own i felt just like a whore she whispered her eyes were dry and hot she was far beyond tears ill never forgive him ill not ask that of you ive not come to excuse tommy merely to say that he was hit squarely in the face today with several monumental truths unfortunately he wasnt prepared to deal with any of them but hell have to be the one to explain that to you when he can lady helen plucked miserably at the top of the boot she held it was black and smudged along its upper ridge with a stickiness that made it look even blacker would you have answered his question she asked abruptly st james smiled a warm transformation of his otherwise unattractive angular face you know i always envied your ability to sleep through anything helen fire flood or thunder i would lie next to you for hours wide awake and steadily curse you for having a conscience so unclouded that nothing ever got in the way of your sleep i used to think that i could have marched the queens household cavalry right through the bedroom and you wouldnt even have noticed but i wouldnt have answered him there are some things in spite of everything thats happened that are just between the two of us frankly thats one of them lady helen felt the tears then a hot fl urry behind her eyelids which she blinked back looking away trying to find her voice st james didnt wait for her to do so rather he drew her gently towards a narrow bench that rested on splintered legs along one of the walls several coats hung on pegs above it and he removed two of them draping one round her shoulders and using the other himself to ward off the chill that invaded the storage area aside from the changes joy had made to the script did anything else strike you that might have led up to the row last night he asked lady helen considered the hours she had spent with the group from london prior to the turmoil in the sitting room i couldnt say for certain but i do think everyones nerves were strung whose in particular joanna ellacourts for one from what i could gather at cocktails last night she was already a bit overwrought by the thought that joy might be writing a play that was going to be a vehicle to resurrect her sisters career that would certainly have bothered her wouldnt it lady helen nodded besides the opening of the new agincourt theatre the production was to celebrate joannas twentieth year on the stage simon so its focus was supposed to be on her not on irene sinclair but i got the impression that she didnt think it would be lady helen explained the brief scene she had witnessed in the drawing room last night when the company had gathered before dinner lord stinhurst had been standing near the piano with rhys daviesjones fl ipping through a set of designs for costumes when joanna ellacourt joined them slinking across the room in a semibodiceless coruscating gown that gave new definition to dressing for dinner she had taken up the drawings for her own perusal but her face revealed in an instant how she felt about what she saw joanna didnt like irene sinclairs costumes st james guessed she claimed that every one of them showed irene offlike a vamp i think she said she crumpled the drawings up told lord stinhurst that his costume people would have to redesign if he wanted her in the play and threw them all on the fire she was absolutely livid and i think that once she began reading the play in the sitting room she saw in joys changes that her worst fears were confi rmed and thats why she threw down the script and left and joywell i couldnt help feeling that she enjoyed the sensation and the disruption she was causing what was she like helen it wasnt an easy question to answer physically joy sinclair had been striking not beautiful lady helen explained she looked like a gypsy with olive skin and black eyes possessing the sort of features that belong on a roman coin finely boned chiselled and stamped with both intelligence and strength she was a woman who radiated sensuality and life even a quick impatient gesture to her earlobe to remove an earring somehow could become a movement fraught with promise promise for whom st james asked thats hard to say but i should guess that jeremy vinney was the most interested man here he jumped up to join her the moment she came into the drawing room last eveningshe was the last to arriveand he stuck right to her side at dinner as well were they lovers she didnt act as if there was anything between them other than friendship he mentioned having tried to reach her on the telephone and leaving a dozen or so messages on her answering machine over the past week and she just laughed and said that she was terribly sorry hed gone ignored but she wasnt even listening to her answering machine because she was six months overdue on a book she had contracted with her publisher so she didnt want to feel guilty by listening to the messages asking her where it was a book st james asked she was writing both a book and a play lady helen laughed regretfully incredible wasnt she and to think that i feel industrious if i manage to answer a letter within fi ve months of receiving it she sounds like a woman who might well inspire jealousy perhaps but i think it was more that she alienated people unconsciously lady helen told him of joys lighthearted comments during cocktails about a reingale painting that hung over the fireplace in the drawing room it was a depiction of a whitegowned regency woman surrounded by her two children and a frisky terrier who nosed at a ball she said shed never forgotten that painting that as a child visiting westerbrae shed liked to imagine herself as that reingale woman safe and secure and admired with two perfect children to adore her she said something like what more could one ask for than that and isnt it strange how life turns out her sister was sitting right below the painting as she spoke and i remember noticing how irene began to fl ush horribly like a rash was spreading up her neck and across her face why well of course irene had once been all those things hadnt she safe and secure with a husband and two children and then joy had come along and destroyed it all st james looked sceptical how can you be sure that irene sinclair was reacting to what her sister had said i cant of course i know that except at dinner when joy and jeremy vinney were talking together and joy was making all sorts of amusing comments about her new book entertaining the whole table with stories about some man shed been trying to interview in the fens irene lady helen hesitated it was difficult to put into words the chilling effect irene sinclairs behaviour had had upon her irene was sitting quite still staring at the candles on the table and sheit was rather dreadful simon she drove the tines of her fork right into her thumb but i dont think she felt a thing st james reflected upon the tops of his shoes they were smudged with dried mud from the drive and he bent to wipe them off then joanna ellacourt must have been wrong about irenes role in this changed version of the play why would joy sinclair be writing for her sister if she continued to alienate her at every juncture as i said i think the alienation was unconscious and as for the play perhaps joy felt guilty after all she had destroyed her sisters marriage she couldnt give that back to her but she could give her back her career but in a play with robert gabriel after a messy divorce that joy herself had likely helped cause doesnt that smack of sadism to you not if no one else in london was willing to give irene a chance simon evidently shes been out of circulation for a good many years this may well have been her only opportunity for a second go on stage tell me about the play as lady helen recalled joy sinclairs description of the new version of the play prior to the actors actually seeing ithad been deliberately provocative when asked about it by francesca gerrard she had smiled up and down the length of the dining table and said it takes place in a house much like this in the dead of winter with ice sheeting the road and not a soul in miles and no way to escape its about a family and a man who dies and the people who had to kill him and why especially why lady helen had expected to hear wolves howling next it sounds as if she intended that as a message for someone it does doesnt it and then when we were all gathered in the sitting room and she began going over the changes in the plot she said much the same thing the plot concerned itself with a family and their thwarted new years eve celebration according to joy the oldest brother was a man possessed of a terrible secret a secret that was about to rip apart the fabric of everyones life and then they began to read lady helen said i wish i had paid more attention to what they were reading but it was so stuffy in the sitting roomno it was more like a pan of water about to come to a boilthat i didnt really follow much of what they had to say all i remember for a certainty is that just before francesca gerrard went a bit mad the older brother in the storylord stinhurst was reading the part since it hadnt been cast yet had just received a telephone call he decided that he had to leave at once saying that after twentyseven years he wasnt about to become another vassal im fairly certain those were the words and thats when francesca leaped to her feet and the evening collapsed vassal st james repeated blankly she nodded odd isnt it of course since the play had nothing to do with feudalism i thought it was something wildly avantgarde with me just too dim to understand what it meant but they understood lord stinhurst his wife francesca gerrard and elizabeth decidedly but i do think aside from their irritation at the late changes in the script everyone else was as confused as i was lady helen ran her fingers unconsciously round the top of the boot she still held altogether i had the impression that the play was supposed to serve a noble purpose that didnt quite come off a noble purpose for everyone it was to honour stinhursts achievement visàvis the renovated agincourt it was to celebrate joanna ellacourts career on the stage it was to bring irene sinclair back into the theatre it was to get rhys back into directing a major production in london perhaps joy even intended a part for jeremy vinney as well someone mentioned that hed started out as an actor before turning to dramatic criticism and frankly other than to continue following the agincourt story there doesnt seem to be any other real reason for him to have come to the readthrough so you see she concluded with an urgency in her voice that she could not hide from him it doesnt seem reasonable that any of those people would have murdered joy does it st james smiled at her fondly especially rhys his words were exceptionally gentle lady helen met his eyes saw the kindness and compassion behind them felt she couldnt bear it and looked away yet she knew that above all people he was the single person who would understand so she spoke last night with rhys it wasthe fi rst time in years that i felt so loved simon for what i am for my faults and my virtues for my past and my future i havent had that with a man since she hesitated then finished what needed to be said since i had it with you and i never expected to have it again that was to be my punishment you see for what happened between us all those years ago i deserved it st james shook his head sharply without reply after a moment he said if you concentrate helen are you certain you heard nothing last night lady helen answered his question with one of her own the first time you made love to deborah what else did you notice besides her youre right of course the house could have burned to the ground for all i would have known or cared for that matter he got to his feet hung his coat back on the peg and held out his hand for hers when she gave it to him his brow furrowed my god what have you done to yourself he asked done your hand helen her eyes dropped and she saw that her fi ngers had somehow become laced with blood black with it underneath her fi ngernails she started at the sight wherei dont more blood she saw smeared along the side of her skirt drying to brown on the wool she looked for the source spied the boot she had been holding and picked it up examining the sticky substance round its top black upon black in the dull light of the storage area wordlessly she handed it to st james he upended the boot on the bench thumped it soundly against the wood and dislodged a large glove at one time leather and fur but now nothing more than a pulpy mass of joy sinclairs blood not yet dried not yet done for half the size of the library the westerbrae sitting room to the left of the wide baronial stairway seemed to lynley an odd choice of locations for any large group to meet inyet it was still set up for the reading of joy sinclairs play with a concentric arrangement of tables and chairs at the rooms centre for the actors and peripheral observation points along its walls for everyone else even the scent in the room bore witness to last nights illfated gathering tobacco burnt matches coffee dregs and brandy when lord stinhurst entered under the watchful eye of sergeant havers lynley directed him to sit in an unwelcoming ladderback chair near the fireplace a coal fire burned in the small grate there cutting the chill in the room outside the closed door the sceneofcrime men from strathclyde cid were making an unusually noisy arrival stinhurst took his designated seat cooperatively crossing one welltailored leg over the other refusing a cigarette he was impeccably dressed the personification of weekendinthecountry yet in spite of his movements which carried the assurance of a man used to the stage used to being under the eyes of hundreds of people at once he looked physically drained whether from exhaustion or from the effort of holding together the women in his family during this time of crisis lynley could not have said but he took the opportunity of observing the man while sergeant havers leafed through the pages of her notebook cary grant lynley thought in summation of stinhursts general appearance and liked the comparison although stinhurst was in his seventies his face had lost none of the extraordinarily handsome strongjawed force of its youth and his hair shafted obliquely by the amiable low light of the room was variations on silver roughly textured and full as it had always been with a body on which there was no spare flesh stinhurst belied the term old age living proof that relentless industry was the key to youth yet underneath this pleasant surface perfection lynley sensed strong undercurrents being mastered and he decided that control was the key to understanding the man he appeared to excel at maintaining it over his body over his emotions over his mind this last was acutely alive and as far as lynley could tell perfectly capable of deciding how best to tamper with a mountain of evidence at the moment lord stinhurst manifested only one sign of agitation in the face of this interview pressing together the thumb and forefinger of his right hand in repeated forceful spasms the flesh under the nails alternately whitened and blushed as circulation was interrupted and then restored lynley found the gesture interesting and wondered if stinhursts body would continue to reveal his increasing tension you look a great deal like your father stinhurst said but i suppose you hear that frequently lynley saw havers head come up with a snap generally not in my line of work he replied id like you to explain why youve burnt joy sinclairs scripts if stinhurst was disconcerted by lynleys unwillingness to recognise any bond between them he did not show it rather he said without the sergeant please gripping her pencil more firmly havers regarded the older man with eyes narrowed in contempt at his lordofthemanor dismissal of her she waited for lynleys response and flashed a brief satisfied smile when he said firmly thats not possible hearing that she settled back into her chair stinhurst didnt move he had not in fact even glanced at sergeant havers before he requested her removal he merely said i have to insist thomas the use of his given name was a stimulus that brought back to lynley not only havers angry challenge to treat lord stinhurst with an iron glove but also the trepidation he had earlier felt about his assignment to this case it set off every alarm thats not one of your rights im afraid myrights stinhurst offered the smile of a cardplayer with a winning hand this entire fantasy that says i have to speak with you is just that thomas a fantasy we dont have that kind of legal system you and i both know it the sergeant goes or we wait for my solicitor from london stinhurst might have been mildly disciplining a fractious child but there was absolute reality behind his words and in the space of time that it had taken to hear them lynley saw the alternatives a legal minuet with the mans attorney or a momentary compromise that could well be used to purchase some truth it had to be done step outside sergeant he told havers his eyes unwavering from the other man inspector her voice was unbearably restrained see to gowan kilbride and mary agnes campbell lynley went on it will save us some time havers drew a tense breath may i speak to you outside please lynley allowed her that much following her into the great hall and closing the door behind them havers gave rapid scrutiny to the left and right wary of listeners when she spoke her voice was a whisper fierce and angry what the hell are you doing inspector you cant question him alone lets chat about the procedure youve been so bloody fond of throwing in my face these last fifteen months lynley felt unmoved by her quick fl are of passion as far as im concerned sergeant webberly threw procedure out the window the moment he got us involved in this case without a formal request from strathclyde cid im not about to spend time agonising over it now but youve got to have a witness youve got to have the notes whats the point of questioning him if youve nothing written down to use against sudden comprehension dawned on her face unless of course you know right now that you intend to believe every blessed word his sweet lordship has to say lynley had worked with the sergeant long enough to know when a conversational skirmish was about to escalate into verbal warfare he cut her off at some point barbara youre going to have to decide whether an uncontrollable factor such as a persons birth is reason enough to distrust him whats that supposed to mean im supposed to trust stinhurst hes destroyed a stack of evidence hes sitting smack in the middle of a murder hes refusing to cooperate and im supposed to trust him i wasnt talking about stinhurst i was talking about myself she gaped at him speechless he turned back to the door pausing with his hand on the knob i want you to see to gowan and mary agnes i want notes i want them precise use constable lonan to assist is that clear havers shot him a look that would have withered fl owers perfectlysir slamming her notebook shut she stalked off when lynley returned to the sitting room he saw that stinhurst had adjusted to the new conditions his shoulders and spine releasing their wiretight grip on his posture he seemed suddenly less unyielding and far more vulnerable his eyes the colour of fog focussed on lynley they were unreadable thank you thomas this easy shift in personaa chameleon passage from hauteur to gratitudewas a glaring reminder to lynley that stinhursts lifeblood flowed not through his veins but through the aisles of the theatre as to the scripts lynley said this murder has nothing to do with joy sinclairs play lord stinhurst gave his attention not to lynley but to the shattered front of the curio cabinet next to the door he left his chair and went to it retrieving the disembodied head of a dresden shepherdess from the remaining crumble of broken porcelain that still lay inside heaped upon the bottom shelf he carried it back to his seat i dont imagine francie yet realises that she broke this piece last night he remarked itll be a blow our older brother gave it to her they were very close lynley wasnt about to play hunt the thimble through the mans family history if mary agnes campbell found the body at sixfi fty this morning why did the police not log your call until seventen why did it take twenty minutes for you to phone for help i wasnt even aware until this moment that twenty minutes had elapsed stinhurst replied lynley wondered how long he had rehearsed that response it was clever enough the type of nonanswer to which no further comment or accusation could be attached then why dont you tell me exactly what happened this morning he said with deliberate courtesy perhaps we can account for the twenty minutes that way mary agnes found thejoy she went immediately for my sister francesca francesca came for me lord stinhurst seemed to be ready for lynleys next thought for he went on to say my sister was panicked she was terrified i dont imagine she thought to phone the police herself shed always depended upon her husband phillip to be the master of any unpleasant situation as a widow she merely turned that dependence on me thats not abnormal thomas and thats all stinhursts eyes were on the porcelain head he held gingerly in his palm i told mary agnes to gather everyone into the drawing room they cooperated he looked up they were in shock one doesnt really expect a member of ones party to be stabbed through the neck during the night lynley raised an eyebrow stinhurst explained i had a look at the body when i locked her room this morning you were fairly clearheaded for a man whos just encountered his fi rst corpse i think one ought to be clearheaded when theres a murderer in ones midst youre sure of that lynley asked you never considered that the murderer might have come from outside the house the nearest village is five miles away it took the police nearly two hours to get here this morning do you really see someone coming in on snowshoes or skis to do away with joy during the night where did you place the call to the police from my sisters offi ce how long were you in there five minutes perhaps less is that the only call you made the question clearly took stinhurst off guard his face looked shuttered no i telephoned my secretary in london at her fl at why i wanted her to know about thesituation i wanted her to cancel my engagements on sunday evening and monday how farsighted of you but all things considered wouldnt you agree that its a bit odd to be thinking about your personal engagements directly after discovering that a member of your party has been murdered i cant help what it looks like i just did it and what were the engagements that you had to cancel ive no idea my secretary keeps my engagement book with her i merely work off the daily schedule she gives me he concluded impatiently as if in the need of a defence im out of the office frequently its easier this way yet lynley thought stinhurst did not have the look of a man who required that his life be arranged round elements that made it easier and more liveable so the last two statements wore the guise of both fencing and prevaricating lynley wondered why stinhurst had even made them how does jeremy vinney fit into your weekend plans it was a second question for which stinhurst seemed unprepared but this time his hesitation bore the quality of thoughtful consideration rather than evasion joy wanted him here he answered after a moment she told him about the readthrough we were going to have hed been covering the renovation of the agincourt with a series of articles in the times i suppose this weekend seemed like a natural extension of those stories he phoned me and asked if he could come along it seemed harmless enough the possibility of good press prior to the opening and at any rate he and joy appeared to know each other quite well she was insistent that he come but why would she want him here hes the arts critic isnt he why would she want him to have access to her play so soon in the process of production or was he her lover he could have been men always found joy immensely attractive jeremy vinney wouldnt have been the fi rst or perhaps his interest was solely in the script why did you burn it lynley made sure that the question had the ring of inevitability stinhursts face refl ected a patient recognition of this fact burning the scripts had nothing to do with joys death thomas the play as it stood wasnt going to be produced once i withdrew my supportand i did that last nightit would have died on its own died interesting choice of words then why burn the scripts stinhurst did not reply his eyes were on the fire that he was struggling with a decision was more than obvious the fact played across his features like a battle but who the opposing forces were and what was at stake in the victory were fine points of the confl ict that were not yet clarifi ed the scripts lynley said again implacably stinhursts body gave a convulsive movement akin to a shudder i burned them because of the subject matter joy had chosen to explore he said the play was about my wife marguerite and her love affair with my older brother and the child they had thirtysix years ago elizabeth gowan kilbride was in a new kind of agony it began the moment constable lonan opened the library door and called out that the london police wanted to speak with mary agnes it increased in intensity when mary agnes jumped to her feet displaying an undisguised eagerness for the encounter and it reached its zenith with the knowledge that for the past fi fteen minutes she had been gone from his sight and his determinedif hardly adequateprotection worse still she was now under the sure the entirely adequate the decidedly masculine protection of new scotland yard which was the source of the problem once the police group from londonbut most particularly the tall blond detective who appeared to be in chargehad left the library after their brief encounter with lady helen clyde mary agnes had turned to gowan her eyes ablaze hes haiven she had breathed that remark boded ill but like a fool for love gowan had been willing to take the conversation further haiven hed asked irritably tha policeman and then mary agnes had gone on rhapsodically to catalogue inspector lynleys virtues gowan felt them tattooed into his brain hair like anthony andrews a nose like charles dance eyes like ben cross and a smile like sting no matter that the man had not bothered to smile once mary agnes was perfectly capable of filling in details when necessary it had been bad enough to be in fruitless competition with jeremy irons but now gowan saw that he had the entire front line of britain s theatrical performers to contend with all embodied in a single man he ground his teeth bitterly and writhed in discomfort he was sitting in a cretonnecovered chair whose material felt like a stiff second skin after so many hours next to himmoved carefully out of everyones way only a quarter hour into their group incarcerationmrs gerrards treasured cary globe rested on an impossibly ornate gilded stand gowan stared at it morosely he felt like kicking it over better yet he felt like heaving it through the window he was desperate for escape he tried to quell the need by forcing himself to consider the librarys charms but he found there were none the white plaster octagons on the ceiling needed paint as did the garlands that ornamented their centres years of coal fires and cigarette smoke had taken their toll and what looked like deep shadows in the nooks and crannies of the raised decoration was really soot the kind of grime that promised a miserable two weeks or more of work in the coming months the bookshelves too spoke of added misery they held hundreds of volumesperhaps even thousandsbound in leather and behind the glass all smelling equally of dust and disuse another job of cleaning and drying and repairing andwhere was mary agnes he had to find her he had to get out near him a womans voice rose in a tearfilled plea my god please i cant stand this another moment within the last weeks gowan had developed a mild dislike of actors in general but in the past nine hours he had found hed developed a hardy loathing of one group in the very particular david ive reached my breaking point cant you do something to get us out of here joanna ellacourt was wringing her hands as she spoke to her husband pacing the fl oor and smoking which gowan thought shed been doing all day the room smelled like a smouldering rubbish heap largely because of her and it was interesting to note that she had only reached this newest level of nervous agitation when lady helen clyde reentered the room and promised the possibility of attention being directed somewhere other than upon the great star herself from his wing chair david sydehams hooded eyes followed his wifes slim fi gure what would you have me do jo batter down the door and club that constable over the head were at their mercy ma belle sit jo darling robert gabriel extended a welltended hand to her beckoning her to join him on the couch by the fire the coals there had burned down to small grey lumps speckled with glowing rose youre doing nothing more than unstringing your nerves which is exactly what the police would like you to do would like all of us to do in fact it makes their job easier and youre hellbent on not doing that i dare say jeremy vinney put in just a pitch above sotto voce gabriels temper flared what the hell is that supposed to mean vinney ignored him struck a match and applied it to his pipe i asked you a question and im choosing not to answer it why you miserable we all know gabriel had a row with joy yesterday rhys daviesjones said reasonably he was sitting furthest from the bar in a chair next to the window whose curtains he had recently pulled back black night yawned through the glass i dont think any of us need make veiled references to it in the hope that the police will get the point get the point robert gabriels voice held the cutting edge of his ire nice of you to have me fingered for the murder rhys but im afraid it wont wash not a bit of it why have you an alibi david sydeham asked the way it looks to me youre one of the very few people at significant risk gabriel unless of course you can produce a second party with whom you spent the night he smiled sardonically what about the little girl is that what mary agnes is up to right now trotting out stories about your technique that must be keeping the coppers on the edge of their seats all right an intimate description of what its like for a woman to have you between her legs or was joys play heading us towards that kind of revelation last night gabriel surged to his feet knocking against a brass floor lamp its arc of light fl ashed wildly round the room i bloody well ought to stop it joanna ellacourt put her hands over her ears i cant stand it stop but it was too late the quick exchange of words had struck gowan like fists he leaped out of his chair in four steps he made it across the room to gabriel and furiously whipped the actor around to face him damn ye tae hell he shouted did ye titch mary agnes but the answer didnt interest him seeing gabriels face gowan needed no response they were a match for size but the boys fury made him stronger it crested within him fi ring him to fight his single punch put gabriel flat on the floor and he fell upon him one hand at the mans throat the other solidly delivering nasty and wellplaced blows to his face wha did ye dae tae mary agnes gowan roared as he struck jesus god stop him fragile composurethat thin shell of civilitydisintegrated into uproar limbs fl ailed viciously hoarse cries charged the air glassware smashed onto the hearth feet kicked and jolted abandoned furniture to one side gowans arm encircled gabriels neck and he dragged the man panting and sobbing to the fi re tell me gowan forced gabriels handsome face now twisted with pain over the fender within an inch of the coals tell me ye bystart rhys irene sinclair backed stiffl y into her chair her face ashen stop him stop him daviesjones and sydeham climbed past the overturned furniture and the frozen fi gures of lady stinhurst and francesca gerrard who cowered together like two versions of lot s wife they reached gowan and gabriel struggled uselessly to haul them apart but gowan held the actor in a grip made unbreakable by the force of his passion dont believe him gowan daviesjones said urgently into the boys ear he gripped his shoulder hard jerking him to sensibility dont lose yourself like this let him be lad enough somehow the wordsand the implication of complete understanding behind them reached past gowans red tide of anger releasing robert gabriel he tore himself away from daviesjones and fell to his side on the floor gasping convulsively he realised of course the gravity of what he had done the fact that he would lose his joband mary agnesbecause of it but beyond the enormity of his behaviour it was the torment of loving and being unloved in return that drove the threat from him entirely blind to the impact it might have on others in the room seeking only to wound as he had been wounded i know bluidy all an ill tell the police an yell pay gowan francesca gerrard cried out in horror better speak now lad daviesjones said dont be a fool to talk like that when theres a killer in the room elizabeth rintoul had not moved once during the altercation now she stirred as if from a deep sleep no not here fathers gone to the sitting room hasnt he i should guess you see marguerite as she is now a sixtynineyearold woman very much near the end of her resources but at thirtyfour when all this occurred she was lovely lively and eagerso eager to live restlessly lord stinhurst had gone to a different chair not one of those in the centre of the room but one on its perimeter well out of the light he sat forward in it leaning his arms on his knees and he studied the fl oral carpet as he talked as if its muted arabesque pattern held answers for him his voice was toneless it was the voice of a man giving a recitation that had to be got through with no expenditure of emotion she and my brother geoffrey fell in love shortly after the war lynley said nothing but he wondered how even at a distance of thirtysix years any man could speak of such a monumental act of disloyalty with so little affect stinhursts lack of emotion spoke of a man who was dead inside who could no longer afford to let himself be touched who singlemindedly pursued excellence in his career so that he never had to face the agony rife in his personal life geoff had been decorated numerous times he came back from the war a hero i suppose it was natural that marguerite was attracted to him everyone was he had a way about himan air stinhurst paused refl ectively his hands sought each other and pressed hard together you served in the war as well lynley asked yes but not like geoffrey not with his flair not with his devotion my brother was like a fire he blazed through life and like a fire he attracted lesser creatures to him weaker creatures moths marguerite was one of them elizabeth was conceived on a trip that marguerite made alone to my familys home in somerset it was during the summer and id been gone two months travelling from spot to spot in order to direct regional theatre marguerite had wanted to come with me but frankly i felt i would be burdened with her with having tokeep her entertained i thought he didnt bother to disguise his selfcontempt that she would be in the way my wife was no fool thomas she still isnt for that matter she could read my reluctance to have her about so she stopped badgering me to take her i ought to have realised what that meant but i was too much caught up in the theatre to understand that marguerite was making arrangements of her own i didnt know at the time that she went to geoffrey i only knew at the end of the summer that she was pregnant she would never tell me whose child it was that lady stinhurst had refused her husband this knowledge made perfect sense to lynley but that stinhurst in the face of it had carried on with the marriage made no sense at all why did you not divorce her messy as it would have been surely you would have gleaned some peace of mind because of alec stinhurst replied our son as you said yourself a divorce like that would have been messy more than messy at that time it would have produced an attendant scandal that god knows would have spread across the front page of every newspaper for months i couldnt let alec be tormented like that i wouldnt he meant too much to me more i suppose than my marriage itself last night joy accused you of killing alec a weary smile touched stinhursts lips comprising equal parts sorrow and resignation alecmy son was in the raf his plane went down in a test flight over the orkney islands in into stinhurst blinked quickly and made a change in his position into the north sea joy knew that of course but she was in love with alec they wanted to marry she was devastated by his death you opposed the marriage i wasnt delighted by it but i didnt actively oppose it i merely suggested that they wait until alec had done his time in the military it was a decidedly odd choice of words done his time every man in my family has gone into the military when that pattern has been in motion for three hundred years one doesnt want ones son to be the first rintoul to break it for the first time stinhursts voice was clouded by a wisp of emotion but alec didnt want to do it thomas he wanted to study history to marry joy to write and perhaps teach at university and iblind fool of a patriot with more love for my family tree than for my own soni gave him no peace until id persuaded him to do his duty he chose the royal air force i think he believed it would take him farthest from conflict stinhurst looked up quickly and commented as if in defence of his son it wasnt danger he was afraid of he merely couldnt stomach war not an unnatural reaction from a decent historian did alec know about the affair his mother and uncle had stinhurst lowered his head again the conversation appeared to be ageing him diminishing the very last of his resources it was a remarkable change in such an otherwise youthful man i thought not i hoped not but now i know according to what joy said last night he did so the wasted years the entire charade performed to protect alechad been for nothing stinhursts next words echoed lynleys thought ive always been so blasted civilised i wasnt about to become chillingsworth to marguerites hester prynne so we lived the charade of elizabeth s being my daughter until new years eve of what happened i discovered the truth it was a chance remark a slip of the tongue that effectively put my brother geoffrey in somerset instead of london where he was supposed to be that particular summer then i knew but i suppose i had always suspected as much stinhurst stood abruptly he walked to the fireplace threw several lumps of coal onto the blaze and watched the flames take them lynley waited wondering if the activity was part of the mans need to quell emotion or to conceal his past there wasim afraid we had a terrible fight not an argument a physical fi ght it was here at westerbrae phillip gerrard my sisters husband put an end to it but geoffrey got the worst of it he left shortly after midnight was he fit to leave i suppose he thought he was god knows i didnt try to stop him marguerite tried but he wouldnt have her near him he tore out of here in a passionate frenzy and less than fi ve minutes later he was killed on the switchback just below hillview farm he hit ice missed the turn the car flipped over he broke his neck he wasburned they were silent a piece of coal tumbled to the hearth and singed the edge of the carpet the air became scented with the acrid odour of burnt wool stinhurst swept the ember back to the grate and finished his story joy sinclair was here at westerbrae that night shed come up for the holidays she was one of elizabeth s school friends she must have heard bits and pieces of the argument and put them all together god knows she always had a passion for setting the record straight and what better way to get her vengeance upon me for inadvertently causing alecs death but that was ten years ago why would she wait so long for her revenge who was joy sinclair ten years ago how could she have taken revenge thena twentyfiveyearold woman merely at the start of her career who would have listened to her she was no one but nowan awardwinning author with a reputation for accuracynow she could command an audience that would listen and how cleverly she did it after all writing one play in london but bringing a different play here to westerbrae with no one the wiser until we actually began the reading last night with a journalist present to pick out the most lubricious of the facts of course it didnt get quite as far as joy had hoped it would francescas reaction put an end to the reading long before the worst of the details in our sordid little family saga came to light and now an end has been put to the play as well lynley marvelled at the mans words at the bald indication of culpability they contained surely stinhurst understood to what degree they blackened him you must see how bad it looks that you burned those scripts lynley said stinhursts gaze dropped to the fi re momentarily a shadow moved against his brow etched darkness on his cheek it cant be helped thomas i had to protect marguerite and elizabeth god knows i owe them that much especially elizabeth theyre my family his eyes met lynleys flat and opaque with a full generation of pain i should think that you of all people would understand how much a mans family means to him and the hell of it was that he did understand completely for the first time lynley noticed the briar rose paper on the walls of the sitting room it was he realised the very same paper that hung in his mothers day room at howenstow the very same paper that no doubt hung on the walls of day rooms and morning rooms and sitting rooms of countless great houses throughout the country late victorian it had a distracting pattern of dull yellow roses battling with leaves that with age and smoke had become more grey than green without preliminary observation lynley could have closed his eyes and described the rest of the room so similar was it to his mothers in cornwall a fireplace of iron and marble and oak two pieces of porcelain on each end of the mantel a walnut longcase clock in one corner one small case of favourite books and always the photographs on a satinwood table within the windows embrasure even here he could see the similarities how generic their pictorial family histories really were so he understood good god how he understood the concerns of family the duty and devotion to having been born with a particular blend of blood in his veins had been effectively haunting lynley for most of his thirtyfour years the ties of blood constrained him they thwarted his desires they bound him to tradition and demanded his adherence to a life that was claustrophobic yet there was no escape for even if one gave up titles and land one did not give up roots one did not give up blood the westerbrae dining room offered the kind of lighting guaranteed to take ten years off anyones age brass sconces on the panelled walls managed this aided by candelabra spaced evenly along the gleaming surface of the lengthy mahogany table barbara havers stood at one end of this inspector macaskins floor plan of the house spread out in front of her she was comparing it to her notes her eyes screwed up against the smoke from a cigarette which she held between her lips its ash amazingly long as if she were attempting a worldrecord length nearby whistling memories with the sort of passionate conviction that would have done betty buckley proud one of macaskins crimescene men was dusting for prints on an ornamental circle of scottish dirks that hung on the wall above the sideboard they were part of a larger display of halberds and muskets and lochaber axes all equally eager to be lethal squinting down at the floor plan barbara tried to reconcile what gowan kilbride had told her with what she wanted to believe about the facts in the case it wasnt easy going it strained credibility she was relieved when the sound of footsteps in the hall gave her an excuse to devote her attention to something else she looked up dislodging the tobacco soot down the front of her crewneck sweater irritably she brushed at it leaving a smudge of grey like a thumb print on the wool lynley came in avoiding the print man he nodded towards a far door barbara picked up her notebook and followed him through the warming room the china room and into the kitchen it was fragrant with the odours of meat seasoned with rosemary with tomatoes simmering in some kind of sauce on the stove at a centralised worktable a harried woman bent over a cutting board chopping potatoes into mincelike pieces with a particularly deadly looking knife she was costumed entirely in white from head to toe an effect that gave her more the look of a scientist than of a cook folks do hae t eat their dinner she explained tersely when she saw barbara and lynley although the way she wielded the implement looked more like selfdefence than preparing a meal barbara heard lynley murmur an appropriate culinary response before he walked on leading her through another door at the far corner of the kitchen and down three steps into the scullery this room was cramped and poorly lit but it had the combined virtues of privacy and heat the latter emanating from an enormous old boiler that wheezed noisily in one corner of the room and dripped rusty water onto the cracked tile fl oor the atmosphere was not unlike a steam bath overhung with an almost imperceptible miasma of mildew and wet wood just behind the boiler the back stairs led to the upper floor of the house what did gowan and mary agnes have to say lynley asked when he had shut the door behind them barbara went to the sink extinguished her cigarette under the tap and tossed it into the rubbish she shoved her short brown hair behind her ears and stopped to pick a piece of tobacco off her tongue before giving her attention to her notebook she was displeased with lynley and troubled by the fact that she couldnt quite decide why whether it was for dismissing her from the sitting room earlier or for the way she anticipated he would react to her notes she didnt know but whatever the source of her aggravation she felt it like a splinter until it worked its way out into the open the skin that housed it would fester gowan she said briefl y leaning against the warped wooden counter it was wet from a recent washing and she felt a ridge of damp seep through her clothes she moved away it seems he had a rather nasty clash with robert gabriel in the library just before he and i met that may well have gone far in lubricating his tongue what sort of clash a quick brawl in which our silken mr gabriel apparently got himself hammered gowan made sure i knew about that as well as about the row he overheard between gabriel and joy sinclair yesterday afternoon theyd had an affair it seems and gabriel was hot to have joy tell his former wifeirene sinclair as a matter of fact joys sisterthat he only bedded joy once why ive the impression robert gabriel very much wants irene sinclair back and that he thought joy could help him in his reconciliation if shed only tell irene that their fl ing was strictly a onetime encounter but joy refused to do so she said she wouldnt deal in lies lies yes evidently theirs wasnt a onetime encounter at all because according to gowan when joy refused to cooperate gabriel said something to her like barbara consulted her notes you little hypocrite for one entire year you screw me in every buginfested rat hole in london and now you stand there and tell me you dont deal in lies and they continued to argue until gabriel finally went after her he had her down on the fl oor in fact when rhys daviesjones managed to get in and separate them gowan was bringing someones luggage up the stairs when all this was going on he got quite an eyeful of everything because daviesjones left the door open when he burst into joys room what set gowan and gabriel off in the library a remark someone madesydeham i thinkabout mary agnes campbell alluding to her being gabriels alibi for last night how much truth is there to that barbara considered the question for a moment before answering its hard to tell mary agnes seems rather smitten with the theatre shes attractive has a nice body barbara shook her head inspector that man must be a good twentyfive years her senior i can see why he might want to dandle her but i cant see for a moment why shed go along with the idea unless of course she thought about the possibilities intrigued to find that there was one that actually worked havers hmm well robert gabriel might have looked like her ticket to a new life you know the sort of thing the starstruck girl meets the established actor sees the kind of life he can offer her and gives herself to him in the hope hell take her with him when he leaves did you ask her about it i wasnt able to i didnt hear about the row between gowan and gabriel until after id spoken to mary agnes ive not got back to her yet and that was because of what gowan had said because of what she knew lynley would make of the boys information he seemed to read her mind what was gowan able to tell you about last night he saw a lot after the readthrough broke up because he had to clean up a mess of liqueurs that hed dropped in the great hall when francesca gerrard banged into him as she left the sitting room it took him nearly an hour even with helens help by the way lynley ignored the final reference saying only and barbara knew what lynley wanted but she delayed a bit by focussing on the minor players in the drama whose comings and goings gowan had remembered in astonishing detail lady stinhurst clad in black wandering aimlessly between drawing room dining room sitting room and great hall until after midnight when her husband came from above stairs to fetch her jeremy vinney finding excuses to follow lady stinhurst murmuring questions which she steadfastly ignored joanna ellacourt storming down an upstairs corridor in a violent fit of temper after a loud argument with her husband irene sinclair and robert gabriel closeting themselves in the library the house had eventually fallen into relative calm at about half past twelve barbara heard lynley say with his usual perspicacity but thats not all gowan saw i imagine her teeth pulled at the inside of her lower lip no thats not all later after hed gone to bed he heard footsteps in the corridor outside his door hes right on the corner where the lower northwest wing meets the great hall hes not certain of the time except that it was well after half past twelve close to one he thinks he was curious because of all the excitement in the evening so he got out of bed cracked his door and listened and more footsteps and then a door opened and closed barbara wasnt particularly eager to relate the rest of gowans tale and she knew her face reflected that reluctance nonetheless she plodded forward and completed the story relating how gowan had left his room gone to the end of the corridor and peered out into the great hall it was darkhed shut off the lights himself just minutes beforebut the exterior estate lights managed to provide a faint illumination barbara saw from the swift change of lynleys expression that he read what was coming he saw daviesjones he said yes but he was coming out of the library not the dining room where the dirks are inspector he had a bottle it must have been the cognac he took up to helen she waited for lynley to offer the inevitable the conclusion she had already worked out for herself a trip to pick up a dirk in the dining room was every bit as convenient as one to pick up cognac thirty feet away in the library and always there remained the fact that joy sinclairs hall door had been locked however lynley merely said what else nothing daviesjones went upstairs lynley nodded grimly lets do so ourselves he led barbara towards the back stairway narrow uncarpeted lit only by two unshaded bulbs and entirely devoid of decoration it would take them to the west wing of the house what about mary agnes lynley asked as they climbed she didnt hear a sound during the night according to the statement i had from her prior to this new gabrieltwist just the wind she said but of course she may well have heard that from gabriels room not her own however there was one curious item and i think you need to hear it she waited until lynley paused and turned on the stair above her near his left hand a largish stain marred the wall much the shape of australia it looked like a patch of damp immediately after she found the body this morning mary agnes went for francesca gerrard they fetched lord stinhurst together he went into joys room came out a moment later and ordered mary agnes to go back to her own room and wait for mrs gerrard to come for her im not certain i see your point sergeant my point is that francesca gerrard didnt come back to fetch mary agnes from her room for the next twenty minutes and only then did lord stinhurst tell mary agnes to begin waking the household and telling them to come to the drawing room in the meantime he placed some phone calls from francescas officeits next to mary agnes bedroom so she could hear his voice and inspector he received two calls as well when lynley didnt react to this piece of information barbara felt her earlier irritation begin to bite sir youve not forgotten lord stinhurst have you you know who he is the man who ought to be on his way to the police station right now for destruction of evidence interfering with the police and murder thats a bit premature lynley remarked his calm rubbed the sore of barbaras irritation is it she demanded and at what point did you make that fi ne decision ive heard nothing so far to convince me that lord stinhurst murdered joy sinclair lynleys voice was a model of patience but even if i thought that he might have done so im not about to arrest a man on the strength of his having burned a stack of scripts what barbaras own voice rasped youve made your decision about stinhurst already havent you based on one conversation with a man who spent the fi rst ten years of his career on the bloody stage and no doubt turned in his finest performance right here tonight explaining himself away to you thats rich inspector police work you can be proud of havers lynley said quietly step back in line he was pulling rank barbara heard the warning she knew she ought to back down but she wasnt about to at a moment when she was so completely in the right what did he tell you that has you so convinced of his innocence inspector that he and daddy were school chums at eton that hed like to see more of you round the london club or better yet that his destroying evidence had nothing at all to do with the murder and you can trust him to tell you the truth about it since hes a real gent just like you theres more involved than that lynley said and im not about to discuss it with the likes of me oh rot she finished get that blasted chip off your shoulder and you might find yourself a person that other people want to confide in lynley snapped but he spun from barbara quickly and didnt move on she could tell that he regretted his loss of control at once she had pushed him to it wanting his anger to bubble and boil over just as her own had done earlier when he had locked her out of the sitting room but she saw quite clearly how little ground she would gain in his estimation with this sort of manipulative behaviour she berated herself for her temperamental stupidity after a moment she spoke sorry she said wretchedly i was off inspector out of line again lynley didnt immediately respond they stood on the stairs caught by a tension that seemed painfully immutable each involved in a separate misery lynley appeared to rouse himself only with an effort we make an arrest on the strength of evidence barbara she nodded calmly her brief passion spent i know that sir but i think he wouldnt want to hear it he would hate her she plunged on i think youre ignoring the obvious so that you can head directly towards daviesjones not on the strength of evidence at all but on the strength of something else that perhaps youre afraid to admit that isnt the case lynley replied he continued up the stairs at the top barbara identified each room for him as they passed it gabriels the closest to the rear stairway then vinneys elizabeth rintouls and irene sinclairs across the hall from this last was rhys daviesjones room where the west corridor turned right widened and led into the main body of the house all the doors here were locked and as they walked along the hallway where portraits displayed several generations of sombrefaced gerrard ancestors and delicately worked sconces intermittently cast halfcircles of light on the pale walls st james met them handing lynley a plastic bag helen and i found this stuffed into one of the boots downstairs he said according to david sydeham its his david sydeham did not look like the kind of man to whom a woman of joanna ellacourts fame and reputation would have stayed married for nearly two decades lynley knew the fairytale version of their relationship the sort of romantic drivel that tabloids feed up for their customers to read on the underground during rushhour commutes it was fairly standard stuff how a twentynineyearold midland booking agentthe son of a country clericwith little more than good looks and unshakeable selfconfidence to recommend him had discovered a nineteenyearold nottingham girl doing a touslehaired celia in a backalley theatre how he persuaded her to throw her lot in with his rescuing her from the grim workingclass environment into which she had been born how he provided her with drama coaches and voice lessons how he nurtured her career every step of the way until she emerged as he had long known she would the most soughtafter actress in the country twenty years later sydeham was still handsome enough in a sensual way but it was a handsomeness gone to seed a sensuality given sway too often with unfortunate consequences his skin showed the inchoate signs of dissipation there was rather too much flesh under his chin and a decided puffiness to his hands and face like the other men at westerbrae sydeham had not been given the opportunity to shave that morning and he looked even the worse for wear because of this a substantial growth of beard shadowed his face accenting the deep circles under his heavily lidded eyes still he dressed with a remarkable instinct for making the best of what he had although his was the body of a bull he encased it in jacket shirt and trousers that were obviously cut specifically to fit him they had the look of money as did his wristwatch and signet ring which fl ashed gold in the fi relight as he took a seat in the sitting room not a hardbacked chair lynley noted but a comfortable armchair in the semidarkness of the rooms periphery im not entirely certain that i understand your function here this weekend lynley said as sergeant havers closed the door and took her seat at the table or my function at all sydehams face was bland it was an interesting point if you wish i manage my wifes career i see to her contracts book her engagements run interference for her when the pressure mounts i read her scripts coach her with her lines manage her money sydeham appeared to perceive a change in lynleys expression yes he repeated i manage her money all of it and theres quite a bit she makes it i invest it so im a kept man inspector upon this last remark he smiled without the slightest trace of humour his skin seemed thin enough when it came to the superficial inequities in his relationship with his wife how well did you know joy sinclair lynley asked do you mean did i kill her id only met the woman at half past seven and while joanna wasnt altogether happy with the manner in which joy had taken to revising her play i generally negotiate improvements with playwrights i dont kill them if i dont like what theyve written why wasnt your wife happy with the script all along joanna had been suspicious that joy was attempting to create a vehicle to bring her sister back to the stage at joannas expense joannas would be the name that would bring in the audience and the critics but irene sinclairs performance would be spotlighted for them to see at least that was jos fear and when she saw the revised script she jumped to conclusions and felt the worst had actually come true sydeham slowly lifted both arms and shoulders it was a curious gallic shrug iwe had quite a row about it after the readthrough in fact what sort of row the sort of row married couples always have a lookatwhatyougotmeinto row joanna was determined not to go on with the play and thats been taken care of rather nicely for her hasnt it lynley remarked sydehams nostrils flared my wife didnt kill joy sinclair inspector nor for that matter did i killing joy would hardly have put an end to our real problem he moved his head abruptly from lynley and havers focussing on the table that stood under the sittingroom window and on the silverframed photographs arrayed on it lynley saw the other mans remark for the fishing line it was and decided to take the bait your real problem sydehams head swivelled back to them robert gabriel he said broodingly robert bleeding gabriel lynley had learned years before that silence was as useful a tool of interrogation as any question he might ask the attendant tension it nearly always caused was a form of appanage one of the few benefits to carrying a warrant card from the police so he said nothing letting sydeham simmer himself into further disclosure which he did almost immediately gabriels been after joanna for years he fancies himself some kind of cross between casanova and lothario only it never worked with jo in spite of all his efforts she cant stand the bloke never has lynley was amazed to hear this revelation considering the reputation ellacourt and gabriel had for sizzling across the stage evidently sydeham recognised this reaction for he smiled as if in acknowledgement and went on my wife is one hell of an actress inspector she always was but the truth of the matter is that gabriel put his hands up her skirt one time too many during othello last season and she was through with him unfortunately she didnt tell me how determined she was never to perform with him again until it was too late id already negotiated the deal with stinhurst for this new production and i saw to it personally that gabriel had a part in it as well why simple business gabriel and ellacourt have chemistry people pay to see chemistry and i thought joanna could take care of herself well enough if she had to appear with gabriel again she did it in othello bit him like a shark when he went for tongue during a stage kiss and laughed like hell about it afterwards so i didnt think that one more play with gabriel would set her off the way it did then like a fool when i found out how absolutely dead set against him she was i lied to her told her that stinhurst had insisted that gabriel be in the new production but unfortunately last night gabriel let it out of the bag that i was the one who had wanted him in the play and that was part of what set joanna off and now that its certain theres to be no play sydeham spoke with illconcealed impatience joys death does nothing to change the fact that joannas still under contract to do a play for stinhurst so is gabriel and irene sinclair for that matter so jos working with both of them whether she likes it or not my guess is that stinhurst will take them back to london and start putting together another production as soon as he can so if i wanted to help joannaor at least put an end to the anger between usid be orchestrating a quick end to either stinhurst or gabriel joys death put a stop to joys play believe me it didnt really do a thing to benefi t joanna to benefit yourself perhaps sydeham gave lynley a long look of evaluation i dont see how anything that hurts jo might benefit me inspector there was certainly truth to that lynley admitted to himself when did you last have your gloves with you sydeham appeared to want to continue their previous discussion nonetheless he answered cooperatively enough yesterday afternoon when we arrived i think francesca asked me to sign the register and i would have taken my gloves off to do so frankly i dont know what i did with them after that i dont remember putting them back on but i might have shoved them in the pocket of my coat that was the last time you saw them you didnt miss them i didnt need them joanna and i didnt go out again and id no need to put them on in the house i didnt even know they were missing until your man brought the one into the library a few minutes ago the other may be in my coat pocket or even on the reception desk if i left them there i simply dont remember sergeant lynley nodded towards havers who got up left the room and returned in a moment with the second glove it was on the floor between the wall and the reception desk she said and laid it on the table all of them gave a moment over to examining the glove the leather was rich comfortably worn and initialled on the inner wrist with the letters ds in intricate scrollwork the faint scent of saddle soap spoke of a recent cleaning but no remnants of that preservative clung to seams or to lining who was in the reception area when you arrived lynley asked sydehams face wore the meditative expression of looking back upon an activity that one thinks at the time is unimportant in order in retrospect to place persons and events in their correct positions francesca gerrard he said slowly jeremy vinney came briefl y to the door of the drawing room and said hello he paused he was using his hands as he talked illustrating each persons position in the air in front of him in a process of visualisation the boy gowan was there perhaps not immediately but hed have had to be eventually since he came for our luggage and showed us up to our room andim not entirely certain but i think i may have seen elizabeth rintoul stinhursts daughter darting into one of the rooms along that corridor off the entrance hall someone was down there at any rate lynley and havers exchanged speculative glances lynley directed sydehams attention towards the plan of the house which havers had brought with her into the sitting room it was spread out on the central table next to sydehams glove which room sydeham pushed out of his chair came to the table and ran his eyes over the plan he scrutinised it conscientiously before he replied its hard to say i only caught a glimpse as if she were trying to avoid us i just assumed it was elizabeth because shes peculiar that way but i should guess this last room he pointed to the offi ce lynley considered the implications the master keys were kept in the offi ce they were locked in the desk macaskin had said but then he had gone on to say that gowan kilbride may have had access to them if that were the case the locking of the desk may well have been a casual matter at best sometimes done and sometimes ignored and on the day of the arrival of so large a party surely the desk would have been unlocked the keys easily accessible to anyone involved in preparing the rooms or to anyone at all who knew about the existence of the offi ce elizabeth rintoul her mother her father even joy sinclair herself when was the last time you saw joy lynley asked sydeham shifted restlessly on his feet he looked as if he wanted to go back to his chair lynley decided he wanted him standing a while after the readthrough perhaps half past eleven perhaps later i wasnt paying much attention to the time where in the upstairs corridor she was heading towards her room sydeham looked momentarily uncomfortable but continued as i said before id had a row with joanna over the play shed stormed out of the readthrough and i found her in the gallery we had some fairly nasty words i dont much care for rowing with my wife i was feeling low afterwards so i was going to the library to fetch myself a bottle of whisky thats when i saw joy did you speak to her at all she didnt look very much like she wanted to speak to anyone i just brought the whisky back to my room had a few drinks well maybe four or five then i simply slept it off where was your wife all this time sydehams eyes drifted to the fi replace his hands automatically sought the pockets of his grey tweed jacket perhaps in a fruitless search for cigarettes to still his nerves obviously this was the question he had hoped to avoid answering i dont know shed left the gallery i dont know where she went you dont know lynley repeated carefully thats right look i learned a good number of years ago to leave joanna to herself when shes in a temper and she was in a fair one last night so thats what i did i had the drinks i fell asleep passed out call it whatever you want to i dont know where she was all i can say is that when i woke up this morningwhen the girl knocked on the door and babbled at us to get dressed and meet in the drawing roomjoanna was in bed beside me sydeham noticed that havers was writing steadily joanna was upset he asserted but it was at me no one else things have beena bit off between us for a while she wanted to be away from me she was angry but she did return to your room last night of course she did what time in an hour in two in three i dont know but surely her movement in the room would have awakened you sydehams voice grew impatient have you ever slept off a binge inspector pardon the expression but it would have been like waking the dead lynley persisted you heard nothing no wind no voices nothing at all i told you that nothing from joy sinclairs room she was on the other side of yours its hard to believe that a woman could meet her death without making a sound or that your own wife could be in and out of the room without your awareness what other things might have gone on without your knowledge sydeham looked sharply from lynley to havers if youre pinning this on jo why not on me as well i was alone for part of the night wasnt i but thats a problem for you isnt it because saving stinhurst so was everyone else lynley ignored the anger that rode just beneath sydehams words tell me about the library there was no alteration in expression at this sudden new direction in the questioning what about it was anyone there when you went for the whisky just gabriel what was he doing the same as i was about to drinking gin by the smell of it and no doubt hoping for something in a skirt to wander by anything in a skirt lynley picked up on sydehams black tone you dont much like robert gabriel is it merely because of the advances hes made towards your wife or are there other reasons no one here much likes gabriel inspector no one anywhere much likes him he gets by on sufferance because hes such a bloody good actor but frankly its a mystery to me why he wasnt murdered instead of joy sinclair he was certainly asking for it from any number of quarters it was an interesting observation lynley thought but more interesting was the fact that sydeham had not answered the question apparently inspector macaskin and the westerbrae cook had decided to carry a burgeoning conflict to the sitting room and they arrived at the door simultaneously bearing two disparate messages macaskin insisted upon being the first heard with the whitegarbed cook lurking in the background wringing her hands together as if every wasted moment brought a souffl e closer to perdition in her oven macaskin gave david sydeham a headtotoe scrutiny as the man moved past him into the hall weve done all thats to be done he said to lynley fingerprinted the whole lot clyde and sinclair rooms are sealed off crimescene men are done drains appear clean by the way no blood anywhere a clean kill save for the glove my man will test that macaskin jerked his head towards the library and went on curtly shall i let them out cook says shes got dinner and theyve asked for a bit of a wash the request lynley saw was out of character for macaskin giving the reins of an investigation over to another officer was not an accustomed routine for the scot and even as he spoke the tips of his ears grew red against his fi ne grey hair as if she recognised a concealed message within macaskins words the cook belligerently continued ye canna keep them from fude tisna richt clearly it was her expectation that the police modus operandi was to put the entire group on bread and water until the killer was found i do hae a bit prepared theyve ha nowt but one wee sanwich a day inspector unlike the police she nodded meaningfully who hae been feeding themsel since this mornin from what i can tell by lookin a my kitchen lynley flipped open his pocket watch surprised to see that it was half past eight he couldnt have been less hungry himself but since the crimescene men were finished there was no further purpose to keeping the group from adequate food and from the relatively restricted supervised freedom of the house he nodded his approval then well be off macaskin said ill leave constable lonan with you and get back myself in the morning ive a man ready to take stinhurst to the station leave him here macaskin opened his mouth closed it opened it again throwing protocol to the wind long enough to say as to those scripts inspector ill see to it lynley said fi rmly burning evidence isnt murder he can be dealt with when the time arrives he saw sergeant havers move in a recoiling motion as if she wished to distance herself from what she saw as a poor decision for his part macaskin seemed to consider arguing the point and decided to let it go his official goodnight comprised the brusque words weve put your things in the northwest wing youre in with st james next to helen clydes new room neither the political manoeuvring nor the sleeping arrangements of the police were of interest to the cook who had remained in the doorway eager to resolve the culinary dispute that had brought her to the sitting room in the first place twinty minutes inspector she turned on her heel bey on time it was a fine point of conclusion and that is how macaskin used it released at last from their days confi nement in the library most of the group were still in the entrance hall when lynley asked joanna ellacourt to step into the sitting room his request made so soon after his interview with her husband reduced the small cluster of people to breathholding suspense as if they were waiting to see how the actress would respond it was after all couched as a request but none of them were foolish enough to believe that it was an invitation that might be politely rebuffed should joanna choose to do so it looked as if she was considering that as a possibility however walking a quick line between outright refusal and hostile cooperation the latter seemed ascendant and as she approached the sittingroom door joanna gave vent to the umbrage she felt after a day of incarceration by favouring neither lynley nor havers with so much as a word before she passed in front of them and took a seat of her own choosing the ladderback chair by the fire that sydeham had avoided and stinhurst had only reluctantly occupied her choice of it was intriguing revealing either a determination to see the interview through in the most forthright manner possible or a desire to choose a location where the benefits of fi relight playing upon her skin and hair might distract an idle watcher at a crucial moment joanna ellacourt knew how to play to an audience looking at her lynley found it hard to believe that she was nearly forty years old she looked ten years younger possibly more and in the forgiving light of the fire that warmed her skin to a translucent gold lynley found himself recalling his first sight of françois bouchers diana resting for the splendid glow of joannas skin was the same as were the delicate shades of colour across her cheeks and the fragile curve of her ear when she shook her hair back she was absolutely beautiful and had her eyes been brown instead of cornfl ower blue she might herself have posed for bouchers painting no wonder gabriels been after her lynley thought he offered her a cigarette which she accepted her hand closed over his to steady the lighters flame with fingers that were long very cool flashing several diamond rings it was a stagey sort of movement intentionally seductive why did you argue with your husband last night he asked joanna raised a wellshaped eyebrow and spent a moment taking in sergeant havers from head to toe as if in an evaluation of the policewomans grubby skirt and sootstained sweater because id grown tired of being on the receiving end of robert gabriels lust for the last six months she replied frankly and paused as if in the expectation of a response a nod of sympathy perhaps or a cluck of disapproval when it became evident that none was forthcoming she was forced to continue her story which she did her voice a bit tight he had a nice hardon every night in my last scene in othello inspector just about the time he was supposed to smother me hed begin squirming about on the bed like a pubescent twelveyearold whos just discovered how much fun he can have with that sweet little sausage between his legs id had it with him i thought david understood as much but apparently he didnt so he arranged a new contract forcing me to work with gabriel again you argued about the new play we argued about everything the new play was just part of it and you objected to irene sinclairs role as well joanna flicked cigarette ash onto the hearth as far as i was concerned my husband couldnt have manipulated this affair with more resounding idiocy he put me in the position of having to fight off robert gabriel for the next twelve months at the same time as trying to keep gabriels exwife from climbing up my back on the way to her new superlunary career i wont lie to you inspector im not at all sorry that this play of joys is fi nished you may say thats an open admission of guilt if you like but im not about to sit here and play the mourner over the death of a woman i scarcely knew i suppose that gives me a motive to kill her as well but i cant help that your husband says that you were out of your room for part of last night so i had the opportunity to do joy in yes i suppose it looks that way where did you go after your row in the gallery to our room at fi rst what time was this shortly after eleven i imagine but i didnt stay there i knew david would be coming back sorry about it all and eager to make it up in his usual fashion and i wanted none of it or of him so i went to the music room next to the gallery theres an ancient gramophone there and some even more ancient records i played show tunes francesca gerrard appears to be quite an ethel merman fan by the way would someone have heard you as corroboration you mean she shook her head apparently unconcerned by the fact that her alibi thus had absolutely no grounds for credibility the music rooms off by itself in the northeast corridor i doubt anyone would have heard unless elizabeth was doing her usual routine snooping at doors she seems to excel at it lynley let that one go by who was in the reception area when you arrived yesterday joanna fingered a few strands of her fi relit hair aside from francesca i dont recall anyone in particular her brow furrowed thoughtfully except jeremy vinney he came to the drawing room door and said a few words i do remember that curious that vinneys presence sticks in your mind not at all years ago he had a small part in a production i did in norwich and i remember thinking when i saw him yesterday that he has about as much stage presence now as he did then which is to say he has none hes always looked like someone whos just dropped fifteen lines and cant think how to adlib his way out of the mess he couldnt even manage to rhubarb successfully poor man the stage was not his gift im afraid but then hes awfully dumpy to play any signifi cant role what time did you return to your room last night im really not certain as i didnt check the time its not the sort of thing one does as a matter of course i just played records until i was sufficiently cooled off she gazed at the fi re her unruffled composure altered a degree as she ran a hand along the fine crease in her trousers no thats not quite true is it i wanted to make certain david had time to fall asleep facesaving i suppose although when i think about it now why i wanted to give him a chance to save face is beyond me to save face lynley queried joanna smiled quickly without apparent cause it appeared to be a distraction a way of automatically concentrating an audiences attention on her beauty rather than the quality of her performance david is in the wrong about this entire contract situation with robert gabriel inspector and had i come back sooner he would have wanted to put the anger between us at rest but she looked away again touching the tip of her tongue to her lips as if in the need to buy time im sorry i just dont think i can tell you after all silly of me isnt it i suppose you might even want to arrest me but there are some thingsi know david wouldnt have told you himself but i couldnt go back to our room until he was asleep i just couldnt please understand lynley knew she was asking for permission to cease talking but he said nothing merely waiting for her to continue when she did so she kept her face averted and she drew on her cigarette several times before crushing it out altogether david would have wanted to make it up but he hasnt been able tofor nearly two months now oh he would have tried anyway hed have felt he owed me that and if he failed everything would have been that much worse between us so i stayed out of the room until i thought hed be asleep which he was and i was glad of it this was a fascinating piece of information to be sure it made the longevity of the ellacourtsydeham marriage even more diffi cult to understand as if in recognition of this fact joanna ellacourt spoke again her voice became sharp unclouded by either sentiment or regret davids my history inspector im not ashamed to admit that he made me what i am for twenty years hes been my biggest supporter my biggest critic my best friend one doesnt throw that over simply because life gets a little inconvenient now and again her final statement declared marital loyalty more eloquently than anything lynley had ever heard nonetheless it was diffi cult for him to put aside david sydehams evaluation of his wife she was indeed one hell of an actress francesca gerrards bedroom was tucked far away into the corner of the upper northeast corridor where the hallway narrowed and an old disused harp covered haphazardly cast a quasimodo shadow against the wall no portraits hung here no tapestries served as buffers against the cold here were no overt illustrations of comfort and security only monochromatic plaster showing the tracery of age like fine webbing and a paperthin carpet running along the fl oor casting a hasty look behind her elizabeth rintoul slipped down this hallway and paused at her aunts door listening intently from the upper west corridor she could hear the rumble of voices but from inside the room there was nothing she tapped her fingernails against the wood a nervous movement that resembled the pecking of small birds no one called entrance she knocked again aunt francie a whisper was all she was willing to risk again there was no response she knew her aunt was inside for shed seen her walk down this corridor not fi ve minutes past when the police had finally unlocked all their rooms so she tried the doorknob it turned feeling slippery under her sweaty hand inside the air held a smell of musty pomanders sweetly suffocating face powder pungent analgesic and inexpensive cologne the rooms furnishings acted as companion pieces to the bleak paucity of decoration in the corridor outside a narrow bed a single wardrobe and chest of drawers a cheval glass that cast strange green reflections distorted so that foreheads were bulbous and chins were too small her aunt had not always used this as her bedroom it was only after her husbands death that she had moved to this part of the house as if its inconvenience and inelegance were part of the process of mourning him she appeared to be engaged in that process now for she was sitting upright on the very edge of the bed her attention given to a studio photograph of her husband that was hanging on the wall the rooms sole decoration it was a solemn picture not at all the uncle phillip that elizabeth remembered from her childhood but undeniably the melancholy man he had become after new years eve after uncle geoffrey elizabeth shut the door quietly behind her but as the wood scraped against the strike plate her aunt gave a choked mewling gasp she rose swiftly from the bed and spun both hands raised in front of her like claws as if in defence elizabeth stiffened how a gesture so simple could bring everything back a memory suppressed and believed forgotten a sixyearold girl wandering happily out to the stable in somerset seeing the kitchen maids squatting to look through a fissure in the buildings stone wall where the mortar had worn away hearing them whisper to her come and see some nancy boys luv not knowing what it meant but eageralways so pathetically eagerto be friends bending to the peephole and seeing two stableboys their clothes strewn carelessly round a stall one of them on all fours and the other rearing and plunging and snorting behind him and both of their bodies sheened with a sweat that glistened like oil frightened and recoiling from the sight only to hear the girls stifled laughter laughter at her at her innocence and her blind naïveté and wanting to strike out at them to hurt them to claw at their eyes with hands just like aunt francies were now elizabeth francesca dropped her arms her body sagged you startled me my dear elizabeth watched her aunt warily afraid to contend with any other memories that might be stirred by another inadvertent gesture francesca she saw had begun to make herself ready for dinner when her husbands picture had drawn her into the reverie that elizabeth had interrupted now she was peering at her reflection in the mirror as she ran a brush through her thinning grey hair she smiled at elizabeth but her lips quivered to belie whatever air of tranquillity she was straining to project as a girl you know i got used to looking in the mirror without seeing my own face people say it cant be done but i mastered it i can do my hair my makeup my earrings anything and i never have to see how homely i am elizabeth didnt bother to offer a soothing denial denial was insult for her aunt spoke the truth she was homely and had always been so burdened by a long horsey face a preponderance of teeth and very little chin possessing a gangling body she was all arms legs and elbows the recipient of every genetic curse of the rintoul family elizabeth had often thought that homeliness was the reason her aunt wore so much costume jewellery as if it might somehow distract ones attention from the gross misfortunes of her face and body you mustnt mind elizabeth francesca was saying gently she means well she does mean well you mustnt mind so awfully much elizabeth felt her throat close how well her aunt knew her how completely she had always understood get mr vinney a drink darling his glass is almost empty bitterly she mimicked her mothers retiring voice i wanted to die even with the police even with joy she cant stop she wont stop it wont ever end she wants your happiness my dear she sees it in marriage like her own you mean the words tasted like acid her aunt frowned she put her brush on the chest of drawers placing her comb neatly across its bristles have i shown you the photographs gowan gave to me she asked brightly pulling open the top drawer it squeaked and stuck silly dear boy he saw a magazine with those beforeandafter pictures and decided wed do a set of the house of each room as we renovate it and then perhaps well display them all in the drawing room when everythings done or perhaps an historian might find them of interest or we could always use them to she struggled with the drawer but the wood was swollen with the winter damp elizabeth watched her wordlessly it was always the way within the circle of the family unanswered questions secrets and withdrawal they were all conspirators whose collusion insisted upon ignoring the past so that it would go away her father her mother uncle geoffrey and granda and now aunt francie her loyalties too were to the ties of blood there was no point in staying in the room any longer only one thing needed to be said between them elizabeth steadied herself to say it aunt francie please francesca looked up she still held on to the drawer still pulled at it fruitlessly without realising that she was only making its inutility even more pronounced i wanted you to know elizabeth said you need to know iim afraid i didnt manage things properly at all last night francesca at last dropped her grip on the drawer in what way my dear its just thatshe wasnt alone she wasnt even in her room so i didnt have a chance to talk to her at all to give her your message it doesnt matter darling you did your best didnt you and at any rate i no please her aunts voiceas alwayswas warm with compassion with understanding how it felt to be barren of ability or talent or hope in the face of this unconditional acceptance elizabeth felt the dry choking of fruitless tears she couldnt bear to weepin either sorrow or painso she turned and left the room bluidy thing gowan kilbride had just about reached his point of no return in his ability to survive nonstop aggravation the situation in the library had been bad enough but afterwards it had grown worse with the knowledge neither admitted to nor denied by the girl herself that mary agnes had allowed robert gabriel the very liberties that were forbidden to gowans own pleasure and now after all that to be sent to the scullery by mrs gerrard with directions to do something about the bloody boiler that hadnt worked properly in fifty yearsit was beyond a persons ability to endure with a curse he threw his spanner down onto the floor where it promptly chipped an old tile bounced once and slid under the fi ery coils of the infernal water heater damn damn damn gowan fumed with rising anger he squatted on the floor poked about with his arm and immediately burned himself on the metal underside of the boiler jesus flippin christ he howled throwing himself to one side and staring at the old mechanism as if it were a malevolent living being he kicked it viciously kicked it again he thought about robert gabriel with mary agnes and kicked it a third time which dislodged one of the rusting pipes steaming water began to spray out in a hissing arc oh hell gowan snapped burn an rot an worms eat yer insides he grabbed a piece of towelling from the scullery sink and wrapped it round the pipe to grasp it without further damage to himself wrestling the piece into inadequate submission sputtering against the fi ne hot spray that shot against his face and his hair he lay on his chest with one hand he forced the pipe back into place and with the other he sought the spanner that he had dropped fi nally locating it back against the far wall he scrabbled against the floor to inch his way closer to the tool his fingers were mere centimetres from it when suddenly the entire scullery went black and gowan realised that on top of everything else the single light bulb in the room had just burnt out the only light left came from the boiler itself a thin useless glow of red that was shining directly into his eyes it was the fi nal blow ye shittin piece of crile he cried ye damn pieeyed sheemach ye veecious piece o sussy ye and then with no warning he knew that he wasnt alone whos there cum here an help me there was no answer here richt on the fl uir and still no response he turned his head tried and failed to pierce the gloom he was about to call out againand louder this time for the hair on the back of his neck had begun to rise with consternationwhen there was a rush of movement in his direction it sounded as if half a dozen people were storming him at once hey a blow cut off his voice a hand gripped his neck and smashed his head to the fl oor pain roared through his temples his fi ngers loosened their hold on the pipe and water shot out directly into his face blinding him searing him scalding his flesh he struggled wildly to free himself but was shoved savagely onto the burning pipe so that the gush of water entered his clothes blistering his chest his stomach and his legs his clothing was wool and it clung to him like a sealant holding the liquid like acid upon his skin gaaaa he tried to cry out as agony terror and confusion ripped through him but a knee dropped onto the small of his back and the hand twined in his hair forced his head to turn and ground his forehead nose and chin into the pool of steaming water forming on the tile he felt the bridge of his nose crack felt the skin scrape from his face and just as he began to understand that his unseen assailant meant to drown him in less than one inch of water he heard the unmistakable snick of metal on tile the knife entered his back a second later the light switched on again quick footsteps climbed the stairs i suppose the more important question is whether you believe stinhursts story st james pointed out to lynley they were in their corner bedroom where the northwest wing of the house met the main body it was a small room adequately furnished in beechwood and pine inoffensively papered with stripes of creeping jenny on a field of pale blue the air held that vaguely medicinal smell of cleanser and disinfectant disagreeable but not overwhelming from the window lynley could see across a recess to the west wing where irene sinclair was moving listlessly in her room a dress draped over her arm as if she couldnt decide whether to put it on or to forget the business entirely her face looked etiolated an elongated white oval framed by black hair like an artists study of the power of contrast lynley dropped the curtain and turned to fi nd that his friend had begun changing his clothes for dinner it was an awkward ritual made worse because st james fatherinlaw was not there to assist him made worse because the entire need for assistance in what for anyone else would have been a simple procedure had its genesis on a single night of lynleys own drunken carelessness he watched st james caught between wanting to offer him help and knowing that the offer would be politely rebuffed the leg brace was uncovered the crutches were used the shoes were untied and always st james face remained entirely indifferent as if he had not been lithe and athletic a mere decade before stinhursts story had the ring of truth st james its not exactly the kind of tale one spins to get out of a murder charge is it what could he possibly hope to gain from disparaging his own wife if anything the case against him looks blacker now hes given himself a solid motive for murder one that cant be verified st james argued mildly unless you check with lady stinhurst herself and something tells me that stinhurst is betting youre too much the gentleman to do so ill do it of course if it becomes necessary st james dropped one of his shoes onto the floor and began attaching his leg brace to another but lets go beyond what hes assuming your reaction will be tommy lets consider for a moment that his story is true it would be clever of him wouldnt it to outline his motive for murder so obviously that way you neednt dig for it neednt be additionally suspicious when you uncover it taken to the extreme you neednt even suspect him of the murder in the first place since hes been perfectly honest with you about everything from the start its clever isnt it too clever by half and what better way to develop a crucial need to destroy the evidence than by acquiescing to jeremy vinneys presence here as well a man likely to pursue any embarrassing story once joy was killed youre arguing that stinhurst knew in advance that joys revisions of the play would turn it into an exposé of his wife and brothers affair but that really doesnt hold with helen being given the room adjoining joys does it or with the locked hall door or with daviesjones fingerprints all over that key st james didnt disagree he merely remarked if it comes to that tommy i suppose one could say that it also doesnt hold with the fact that sydeham was alone for a part of the night as was his wife as it turns out so either one of them had the opportunity to kill her opportunity perhaps everyone appears to have had the opportunity but motive is a problem not to mention the fact that joys door was locked so whoever did it either had access to those master keys or got in through helens room well always go back to that you see stinhurst could have had access to the keys couldnt he he told you himself that hes been here before as have his wife his daughter and joy all of them with access to the keys st james even david sydeham may have had access to them if he went down the corridor later on in the afternoon to see which room elizabeth rintoul had disappeared into when she saw him and joanna ellacourt arrive but thats stretching things isnt it why would he be curious about elizabeth rintouls hiding place more why would sydeham kill joy sinclair to spare his wife a production with robert gabriel it doesnt wash apparently shes tightly under contract to appear with gabriel anyway killing joy accomplished nothing we go back to that point dont we joys death seems to benefit one person only stuart rintoul lord stinhurst now that shes dead the play that promised to be so embarrassing for him is never to be produced by anyone it looks bad tommy i dont see how you can ignore such a motive as to that a knock sounded on the door lynley answered it to find constable lonan standing in the corridor carrying a ladys shoulder bag that was encased in plastic he held it stiffl y before him in both hands like a butler presenting a tray of questionable hors doeuvres its sinclairs the constable explained the inspector thought you might want to have a look at the contents before the lab goes over the bag for prints lynley took it from him laid it on the bed and pulled on the latex gloves that st james wordlessly passed him from the open valise at his feet where was it found in the drawing room lonan replied on the window seat behind the curtains lynley looked at him sharply hidden looks like she just tossed it there the same way she tossed about everything in her room lynley unzipped the plastic slipping the shoulder bag out onto the bed the other two men watched curiously as he opened it and spilled out its contents they comprised an interesting array of articles which lynley sorted through slowly dividing them into two piles into one pile he placed those objects common to a hundred thousand handbags hanging from the arms of a hundred thousand women a set of keys attached to a large brass ring two inexpensive ballpoint pens an opened pack of wrigleys a single matchbook and a pair of dark glasses in a new leather case the rest of the contents went into the second pile where they attested to the fact that like many women joy sinclair had imbued even so mundane an object as a black shoulder bag with the singular stamp of her personality lynley thumbed through her chequebook first scanning the entries for anything unusual and finding nothing apparently the woman had not been overly concerned with the state of her finances since she had not balanced the book in at least six weeks this fi nancial nonchalance had its explanation in her wallet which held nearly one hundred pounds in notes of varying denominations but neither chequebook nor wallet retained lynleys interest once his eyes fell upon the fi nal two objects joy sinclair had carried with heran engagement calendar and a small handsized tape recorder the calendar was new its pages scarcely having seen use at all the weekend at westerbrae was blocked out as was a luncheon with jeremy vinney two weeks past there were references to a theatre party a dental appointment some sort of anniversary and three engagements marked upper grosvenor streeteach one crossed out as if none had been kept lynley turned the page to the successive month found nothing turned again here the single word p green was written across one entire week chapters across the week after that there was nothing else save a reference to s birthday jotted down on the twentyfi fth constable lynley said thoughtfully id like to keep this for now the contents not the bag itself will you check that with macaskin before he pushes off the constable nodded and left the room lynley waited until the door closed behind him before he turned back to the bed picked up the tape recorder and with a glance at st james switched it on she had a perfectly lovely voice throaty and musical it was husky a comehither sort of voice with the kind of inadvertent sensuality that some women consider a blessing and others a curse the sound switched on and off in varying tempos with differing backgrounds traffic the underground a quick blare of musicas if she grabbed the recorder out of her shoulder bag to save a sudden thought wherever it happened to strike her try to put edna off at least two more days theres nothing to report perhaps shell believe ive had fluthat penguin she used to love penguins itll be perfectfor gods sake dont let mum forget sally again this year john darrow believed the best about hannah until circumstances forced him to believe the worstsee about tickets and a decent place to stay take a heavier coat this timejeremy jeremy oh lord why be in such a lather about him its hardly a lifetime propositionit was dark and although the winter stormwonderful joy why not simply go with a dark and stormy night and have done with creativity once and for all remember that peculiar smell decaying vegetables and flotsam washed down the river by the last stormthe sound of frogs and pumps and the unremittingly flat landwhy not ask rhys how best to approach him hes good with people hell be able to helprhys wants to lynley switched off the recorder at this he looked up to find st james watching him in a play for time before the inevitable came into the open between them lynley gathered up the articles and placed them all into a plastic bag which st james had produced from his valise he folded it closed took it to the chest of drawers why havent you questioned daviesjones st james asked lynley returned to the foot of the bed to his suitcase which lay on a luggage stand there flipping this open he pulled out his dinner clothes giving himself time to consider his friends question it would be easy enough to say that the initial circumstances had not allowed him to question the welshman that there was a logic to the manner in which the case had developed so far and he had intuitively followed the logic to see where it would lead there was truth in that explanation as well but beyond that truth lynley recognised an additional unpleasant reality he was struggling with a need to avoid confrontation a need with which he had not yet come to terms so foreign was it to him in the next room he could hear helen her movements light and brisk and effi cient he had heard her thus a thousand and one times over the years heard her without noticing the sounds were amplified now as if with the intention of imprinting themselves permanently onto his consciousness i dont want to hurt her he said at last st james was attaching his leg brace to a black shoe and he paused in the effort shoe in one hand brace in the other his face usually so noncommittal reflected surprise youve certainly an odd way of showing it tommy you sound just like havers but what would you have me do helens determined to be absolutely blind to the obvious shall i point out the facts to her now or hold my tongue and let her become even more involved with the man so that shes thoroughly devastated when she discovers how hes used her if hes used her st james said lynley pulled on a clean shirt buttoned it in a poorly hidden agitated fashion and knotted his tie if just what do you conjecture his visit to her room last night was all about st james his question was met with no reply lynley could feel his friends eyes on his face his fi ngers fumbled with the mess he had made of his tie oh damn and blast he muttered savagely at the knock lady helen opened her door expecting to find sergeant havers or lynley or st james in the corridor ready to escort her to dinner as if she were either the prime suspect or a key witness in need of police protection instead it was rhys he said nothing his expression hesitant as if he was wondering what his reception might be but when lady helen smiled he entered the room and pushed the door shut behind him they looked at each other like guilty lovers hungry for a surreptitious meeting the need for quiet for stealth for a declaration of unity heightened sensitivity heightened desire heightened and strengthened the newly forged bond between them when he held out his arms lady helen more than willingly sought their refuge with a wordless longing he kissed her forehead her eyelids her cheeks and at last her mouth her lips parted in response and her arms tightened round him holding him closer to her as if his presence might obliterate the worst of the day she felt the length of his body create its sweet agony of pressure against her own and she began to tremble shot through with a dizzying unexpected bolt of desire it came upon her from nowhere running through her blood like a liquid fi re she buried her face against his shoulder and his hands moved upon her with possessive knowledge love love rhys whispered he said nothing more for at his words she turned her head and sought his mouth again after some moments he murmured aw bey browden on ye lassie and then added with a torn chuckle but i suppose youve noticed that lady helen lifted her hand to smooth his hair back from his temples where it was peppered with grey she smiled feeling somehow comforted and not entirely certain why this should be so where on earth did a blackhearted welshman ever learn to speak scots at that his mouth twisted his arms stiffened momentarily and lady helen knew before he answered that she had innocently asked the wrong question in hospital he said oh lord im so sorry i didnt think rhys shook his head pulled her closer to him resting his cheek against her hair ive not told you about any of it have i helen i think its something i didnt want you to know then dont no the hospital was just outside of portree on skye in the dead of winter grey sea grey sky grey land boats leaving for the mainland with me wishing to be on any one of them i used to think that skye would drive me to drink on a permanent basis that kind of place tests ones mettle as nothing else ever does to survive it all came down to clandestine pulls at a whisky bottle or profi ciency in scots i chose scots that at least was guaranteed by my roommate who refused to speak anything else his fingers touched her hair a mere ghost of a caress it seemed tentative unsure helen for gods sake please i dont want your pity it was his way she thought it was always his way he would cut through like that moving past the potential of any meaningless expression of compassion that stood between him and the rest of the world for pity kept him at a disadvantage prisoner of an illness that could not be cured she took his pain as her own how could you ever believe i feel pity is that what you think was between us last night she heard his ragged sigh im fortytwo years old do you know that helen is that fifteen years your senior good god is it more twelve years i was married once when i was twentytwo toria was nineteen both of us fresh from the regionals and thinking wed become the next west end wonders i didnt know that she left me id been doing a winters season round norfolk and suffolk two months here a month there living in grimy bedsits and foulsmelling hotels thinking none of it was really half bad since it put food on the table and kept the children in clothes but when i got back to london she was gone home to australia mum and dad and security more than mere bread on the table shoes on her feet his eyes were bleak how long had you been married only five years but quite long enough im afraid for toria to come to terms with the worst about me dont say yes ive only seen my children once in the past fifteen years theyre teenagers now a boy and a girl who dont even know me and the worst of it is that its my own fault toria didnt leave because i was a failure in the theatre although god knows my chances of success were fairly dim she left because i was a drunkard i still am a drunkard helen you must never forget that i mustnt let you forget it she repeated what he had said himself one night as they walked together against the wind along the edge of hyde park well its only a word isnt it it only has the power were willing to give it he shook his head she could feel the heavy beating of his heart have they questioned you yet she asked no his cool fingers rested on the nape of her neck and he spoke over her head carefully as if each word was chosen with deliberation they do think i killed her dont they helen her arms tightened of their own volition speaking the answer for her he went on ive been considering how they might think i did it i came to your room brought you cognac to make you drunk made love to you as a distraction then stabbed my cousin why of course remains to be seen but no doubt theyll think of something soon enough the cognac was unsealed lady helen whispered do they think i put something in it good god and what about you do you think that as well do you think i came to you intent upon drugging you and then murdering my cousin of course not looking up lady helen saw a mixture of fatigue and sadness melt together on his face tempered by relief when i got out of your bed i unsealed it he said god knows i wanted the stuff i felt desperate to have it but then you woke up you came to me and frankly i discovered that i wanted you more you dont need to tell me i was inches from a drink centimetres i havent felt like that in months if you hadnt been there it doesnt matter i was there im here now voices came to them from the room next door lynleys raised hotly for a moment followed by st james placid murmur they listened rhys spoke your loyalties are going to be tested brutally through this helen you know that dont you and even if youre presented with irrefutable truths youre going to have to decide for yourself why i came to your room last night why i wanted to be with you why i made love to you and most of all what i was doing all that time while you slept i dont need to decide lady helen declared there arent two sides to this story as far as im concerned rhys eyes darkened to black there are his and mine and you know it when st james and lynley entered the drawing room they saw it was destined to be a most unpleasant dinnerthe assembled group could not have placed themselves across the oriental carpet with any more effective staging to depict their displeasure with the fact that they would be sitting down to dine with new scotland yard joanna ellacourt had selected a centrestage location having established herself somewhere between sitting and draping on a rosewood chaise near the fi replace she favoured the two newcomers with a glacial look before she turned away sipped on what looked like whitecapped pink syrup and cast her eyes upon the george ii chimneypiece as if its pale green pilasters needed memorising the others were gathered round her on couches and chairs their desultory conversation ceased entirely at the entrance of the two men lynleys eyes swept over the group making a quick note of the fact that some of them were missing making especial note of the fact that among the missing were lady helen and rhys daviesjones at a drinks trolley at the far end of the room constable lonan sat like a guardian angel keeping sharp eyes on the company as if in the expectation that one or more of them might commit some new act of violence lynley and st james went to join him where are the others lynley asked not down yet lonan replied the one lady just got in here herself lynley saw that the lady in question was lord stinhursts daughter elizabeth rintoul and she was approaching the drinks trolley like a woman going to her execution unlike joanna ellacourt who had dressed for the dinner in clinging satin as if it were a social occasion of the highest order elizabeth wore a tan tweed skirt and bulky green sweater both decidedly old and illfi tting the latter decorated with three moth holes that made an isosceles triangle high on her left shoulder she was lynley knew thirtyfive years old but she looked far older like a woman approaching spinsterly middle age in the worst possible way her hair perhaps in an unsuccessful attempt to achieve strawberry blonde had been coloured an artificial shade of brown that had since gone brassy it was heavily permed so that it formed a screen from behind which she could observe the world both the colour and the style suggested a choice made from a magazine photograph and not one that took into consideration the demands of her complexion or the shape of her face she was very gaunt with features that were pinched and pointed her upper lip was beginning to develop the creasing lines of age uneasiness limned itself on her bloodless face as she crossed the room one hand caught at her skirt and squeezed the material she didnt bother to introduce herself didnt bother with any introductory formality at all it was clear that she had waited more than twelve hours to ask her question and was not about to be put off another moment nonetheless she didnt actually look at lynley as she spoke her eyesshadowed inexpertly with a peculiar shade of aquamarinemerely touched his face to establish contact and from that moment forward remained riveted on the wall just beyond him as if she were addressing the painting that hung there do you have the necklace she asked stiffly i beg your pardon elizabeth s hands splayed out against her skirt my aunts pearl necklace i gave it to joy last night is it in her room there was a murmur from the group at the fireplace and francesca gerrard got to her feet coming to elizabeth s side she put her hand on her elbow attempting to draw her back to the others she kept her eyes off the police its all right elizabeth she murmured really quite all right elizabeth jerked away its not all right aunt francie i didnt want to give it to joy in the first place i knew it wouldnt work now that shes dead i want you to have it back still she looked at no one her eyes were bloodshot a condition that her eyeshadow only heightened lynley looked at st james were there pearls in the room the other man shook his head but i took the necklace to her she wasnt in her room yet shed gone toso i asked him to elizabeth stopped her face working her eyes sought and then fastened on jeremy vinney you didnt give it to her did you you said you would but you didnt what have you done with that necklace vinneys gin and tonic stopped midway to his lips his fingers too plump and overly hairy tightened on the glass clearly the accusation came as a surprise i of course i gave it to her dont be absurd youre lying elizabeth shrilled you said she didnt want to talk to anyone and you put it in your pocket i heard the two of you in your room you know i know what you were after but when she wouldnt let you do it you followed her back to her room didnt you you were angry you killed her and then you took the pearls as well vinney was on his feet at that a quick man in spite of the weight he carried he tried to push aside david sydeham who grabbed his arm you driedup little shrew he fl ared you were so goddamned jealous of her you probably killed her yourself snooping about listening at doors thats about as close as youve come to having any isnt it jesus god vinney and what were you doing with her angry colour shot across elizabeth s cheeks in patches her lips contorted into a sneer hoping to get your own creative juices up by bleeding off hers or smelling her up like every other man here elizabeth francesca gerrard pleaded weakly because i know why you came i know what you were after shes mad joanna ellacourt muttered in disgust lady stinhurst broke at that she spat a response at the actress dont you say that dont you dare you sit there like an ageing cleopatra who needs men to marguerite her husbands voice boomed it shattered everyone to silence nervestrung and brittle the tension was broken by footsteps on the stairs and in the hall a moment later the remaining members of the party entered the room sergeant havers lady helen rhys daviesjones robert gabriel appeared less than a minute behind them his eyes darted from the tense group by the fireplace to the others near the drinks trolley to elizabeth and vinney squaring off in anger it was an actors moment and he knew how to use it ah he smiled gaily we are indeed all in the gutter arent we but i wonder which of us are looking at the stars certainly not elizabeth joanna ellacourt replied curtly and turned back to her drink from the corner of his eye lynley saw daviesjones draw lady helen towards the drinks trolley and pour her a dry sherry he even knows her habits lynley thought dismally and decided that he had had his fill of the entire group tell me about the pearls he said francesca gerrard felt for the single string of cheap beads she wore they were pucecoloured they argued dramatically with the green of her blouse ducking her head raising a nervous hand to her mouth as if to hide her prominent teeth from scrutiny she spoke with a wellbred hesitation as if better manners told her it was unwise to intrude iits my fault inspector im afraid that last night i did ask elizabeth to offer the pearls to joy they arent priceless of course but i thought if she needed money ah i see a bribe francescas eyes went to lord stinhurst stuart wont you the words wavered uneasily her brother didnt reply yes i thought she might be willing to withdraw the play tell him how much the pearls are worth elizabeth insisted hotly tell him francesca made a delicate moue of distaste clearly unused to discussing such matters in public they were a wedding present from phillip my husband they wereperfectly matched so they were worth more than eight thousand pounds elizabeth snapped i had of course always intended to pass them on to my own daughter but since i have no children they were going to go to our little elizabeth vinney finished triumphantly so who better to have nicked them from joys room you nasty little bitch clever to point the fi nger at me elizabeth made a precipitate move towards him her father rose and intercepted her the entire scene was about to be lived through once again but mary agnes campbell arrived in their midst coming to stand hesitantly in the doorway her eyes large and round her fingers playing at the tips of her hair francesca spoke to her in an effort to divert the tide of passion dinner mary agnes she asked inanely mary agnes scanned the room gowan she responded he isna wi ye nae wi the police cuik wants him her voice fell off ye havena seen lynley looked from st james to havers all of them shared a moment of the unthinkable all of them moved see that no one leaves the room lynley directed constable lonan they went in separate directions havers up the stairs st james down the lower northeast corridor and lynley into the dining room through the china and warming rooms he burst into the kitchenthe cook started in surprise a steaming kettle in her hand broth spilled over the side in an aromatic stream above them lynley heard havers pounding down the west corridor doors crashed open she called the boys name seven steps and lynley was at the scullery door the knob turned in his hand but the door wouldnt open something blocked the passage havers he shouted and in rising anxiety at the absence of reply havers damn and blast then he heard her flying down the back staircase heard her pause heard her cry of incredulity heard the unbelievable sound of water the sound of sloshing like a child in a wading pond precious seconds passed and then her voice like a bitter draught of medicine one expects but hopes not to swallow gowan christ havers for gods sake there was movement something dragging the door eased open a precious twelve inches giving lynley access to the heat and the steam and the heart of malevolence his back muddied and gummed by crimson gowan had been lying on his stomach across the top step of the scullery apparently in an effort to escape the room and the scalding water that poured from the boiler and mixed with the cooling water on the fl oor it was inches deep and havers waded back across it seeking the emergency valve that would shut it off when she found it the room was plunged into an eerie stillness that was broken by the cooks voice on the other side of the door is it gowan is it the lad and she began a keening that reverberated like a musical instrument against the kitchen walls but when she paused a second sound racked the hot air gowan was breathing he was alive lynley turned the boy to him his face and neck were a puckered red mass of boiled fl esh his shirt and trousers were cooked onto his body gowan lynley cried and then havers phone for an ambulance get st james she did not move blast it havers do as i say but her vision was transfixed on the boys face lynley spun back saw the initial glazing of gowans eyes knew what it meant gowan no for an instant gowan seemed to try desperately to respond to the shout to accept the call back from the darkness he took a stertorous breath wracked with bloody phlegm didntsee what lynley urged didnt see what havers leaned forward who gowan who with an enormous effort the boys eyes sought her but he said nothing more his body shuddered once and was still lynley found that he had grasped hold of gowans shirt in a frantic attempt to infuse his tortured body with life now he released him letting the corpse rest back upon the step and a monumental sense of outrage filled him it began as a howling curling deep within muscles tissues and organs screaming to get out he thought of the wasted lifethe generations of life callously destroyedin the single young boy who had done what who had paid for what crime what chance remark what piece of knowledge his eyes burned his heart pounded and for a moment he chose to ignore the fact that sergeant havers was speaking to him her voice broke wretchedly he pulled the ruddy thing out oh my god inspector he must have pulled it out lynley saw that she had gone back to the boiler in the corner of the room she was kneeling on the fl oor mindless of the water a torn piece of towel in her hand using it she lifted something from the pool and lynley saw it was a kitchen knife the very same knife he had seen in the hands of the westerbrae cook a few short hours before there wasnt enough space in the scullery so inspector macaskin did his pacing in the kitchen his left hand ran along the worktable in the centre of the room he gnawed at the fingers of his right with vicious concentration his eyes fl icked from the windows that presented him blankly with his own reflection to the closed door leading towards the dining room from there he could hear the raised wail of a womans voice and the voice of a man raw with anger gowan kilbrides parents from hillview farm meeting with lynley fl ailing him mercilessly with the first fury of their grief on the floor above them behind closed and guarded doors the suspects waited for their summons from the police again macaskin thought he cursed himself soundly his conscience shredded by the belief that had he not suggested letting everyone out of the library for dinner gowan kilbride might well be alive macaskin swung around as the scullery door opened and st james stepped out with strathclydes medical examiner he hurried to join them over their shoulders he could see two other crimescene men still at work in the small room doing what they could to collect what evidence had not been obliterated by water and steam right branch of the pulmonary artery is my guess without a full postmortem the examiner murmured to macaskin he was stripping off a pair of gloves which he stuffed into his jacket pocket macaskin directed a querying look at st james it could be the same killer st james nodded righthanded one blow man or woman st james blew out a refl ective breath my guess is a man but i wouldnt rule out the possibility of a woman but surely were talking about considerable strength or a rush of adrenaline a woman could do it if she were driven driven blind rage panic fear macaskin bit down too hard on his fi nger he tasted blood but who who he demanded of no one when lynley unlocked the door to robert gabriels room he found the man sitting much like a solitary prisoner in a cell he had chosen the least comfortable chair in the room and he leaned forward in it his arms on his legs his manicured hands dangling uselessly in front of him lynley had seen gabriel on the stage most memorably as hamlet four seasons past but the man closeup was very different from the actor who swept the audience along with him through the tortured psyche of a danish prince in spite of the fact that he was not much past forty gabriel was starting to look worn out there were pouches under his eyes and a fatty layer had begun to take up permanent residence round his waist his hair was well cut and perfectly combed but in spite of a gel that attempted to encourage it into a modern style it was thin upon his skull artifi ciallooking as if he had enhanced its colour in some way at the crown of his head its thickness barely sufficed to cover a bald spot that made a small but growing tonsure youthfully dressed gabriel appeared to favour trousers and shirt of a colour and weight that seemed more appropriate to a summer in miami beach than a winter in scotland they were contradictions notes of instability in a man one would expect to be selfassured and at ease lynley nodded havers towards a second chair and remained standing himself he chose a spot near a handsome hardwood chest of drawers where he had an unobstructed view of gabriels face tell me about gowan he said the sergeant crackled through the pages of her notebook i always thought my mother sounded just like the police was gabriels weary response i see i was right he rubbed at the back of his neck as if to rid it of stiffness then sat up in his chair and reached for the travel alarm clock on the bedside table my son gave this to me look at the silly thing it doesnt even keep proper time any longer but ive not been able to bring myself to toss it in the rubbish id call that paternal devotion mum would call it guilt you had a row in the library late this afternoon gabriel gave a derisive snort we did it seems gowan believed that id been savouring one or two of mary agnes finer qualities he didnt much like it and had you christ now you sound like my exwife indeed that doesnt go far to answering my question however id spoken to the girl gabriel snapped thats all when was this i dont know sometime yesterday shortly after i arrived i was unpacking and she knocked on the door ostensibly to deliver fresh towels which i didnt need she stayed to chat long enough to find out if i had any acquaintance with a list of actors who appear to be running neck and neck at the top of her maritalprospect list gabriel waited belligerently and when no additional question came forth he said all right all right i may have touched her here and there i probably kissed her i dont know you may have touched her you dont know if you kissed her i wasnt paying attention inspector i didnt know i would have to account for every second of my time with the london police you talk as if touching and kissing are kneejerk reactions lynley pointed out with impassive courtesy what does it take for you to remember your behaviour complete seduction attempted rape all right she was willing enough and i didnt kill that boy over it over what gabriel had at least enough conscience to look uncomfortable good god just a bit of nuzzle perhaps a feel beneath her skirt i didnt take the girl to bed not then at least not at all ask her shell tell you the same he pressed his fingers to his temples as if to quell pain his face bruised from his runin with gowan looked riven by exhaustion look i didnt know gowan had his eye on the girl i hadnt even seen him then i didnt know he existed as far as i was concerned she was free for the taking and by god she didnt protest she could hardly do that could she when she was doing her best to manage a feel of her own the actors last statement rang with a certain pride the kind evidenced by men who feel compelled to talk about their sexual conquests no matter how puerile the reported seduction appears to others in the speaker it always meets some undefined need lynley wondered what it was in gabriels case tell me about last night he said theres nothing to tell i had a drink in the library spoke to irene after that i went to bed alone yes as hard as that may be for you to believe alone not with mary agnes not with anyone else that takes away an alibi though doesnt it why in gods name would i need an alibi inspector why would i want to kill joy all right i had an affair with her i admit my marriage fell apart because of it but if i wanted to kill her i would have done so last year when irene found out and divorced me why wait until now joy wouldnt cooperate in the plan you had would she the plan to win your wife back perhaps you knew that irene would come back to you if joy would tell her that shed been to bed with you only once not again and again over a year but once except that joy had no intention of lying to benefi t you so i killed her because of that when how theres not a person in the house who doesnt know her door was locked so what did i do hide in the wardrobe and wait for her to fall asleep or better yet tiptoe back and forth through helen clydes room and hope she wouldnt notice lynley refused to let himself become involved in a shouting match with the man when you left the library this evening where did you go i came here immediately of course i wanted a wash i felt like hell which stairs did you use gabriel blinked what do you mean what other stairs are there i used the stairs in the hall not those right next door to this very room the back stairs the stairs in the scullery i had no idea they were even there its not my habit to prowl about houses looking for secondary access routes to my room inspector his answer was clever enough impossible to verify if no one had seen him in the scullery or the kitchen within the last twentyfour hours yet certainly mary agnes had used the stairs when she worked on this fl oor and the man wasnt deaf nor were the walls so thick that he would hear no footsteps it appeared to lynley that robert gabriel had just made his fi rst mistake he wondered about it he wondered what else the man was lying about inspector macaskin poked his head in the door his expression was calm but the four words he said held a note of triumph weve found the pearls the gerrard woman had them all along macaskin said she handed them over readily enough when my man got to her room for the search ive put her in the sitting room sometime since their earlier meeting that night francesca gerrard had decided to deck herself out in a grating array of costume jewellery seven strands of beads in varying colours from ivory to onyx had joined those of puce and she was sporting a line of metallic bracelets that made her movements sound as if she were in shackles discoidal plastic earrings striped violently in purple and black were clipped to her ears yet the tawdry display seemed the product of neither eccentricity nor selfabsorption rather it appeared however questionably to be a substitute for the ashes which women of other cultures pour upon their heads at the time of a death nothing was quite so clear as the fact that francesca gerrard was grieving she sat at the table in the centre of the room one arm pressed tightly into her waist one fi st clenched between her eyebrows swaying slowly from side to side she wept the tears were not spurious lynley had seen enough mourning to know when he was faced with the real thing get something for her he said to havers whisky or brandy sherry anything from the library havers went to do so returning a moment later with a bottle and several glasses she poured a few tablespoons of whisky into one of the tumblers its smoky scent struck at the air like a sound with a gentleness unusual in her havers pressed the glass into francescas hand drink a bit she said please just to steady yourself i cant i cant nonetheless francesca allowed sergeant havers to lift the glass to her lips she took a grimacing swallow coughed took another then she said brokenly he wasi liked to pretend he was my son ive no children gowanits my fault that hes dead i asked him to work for me he didnt really want to he wanted to go to london he wanted to be like james bond he had dreams and hes dead and im to blame like people afraid of making any sudden movements the others in the room took seats surreptitiously havers at the table with lynley st james and macaskin out of francescas line of vision blame is part of death lynley said quietly i bear equal responsibility for whats happened to gowan im not likely to forget it francesca looked up surprised clearly she had not expected such an admission from the police part of myself feels lost its as ifno i cant explain her voice quavered then held any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind exposed for years to death in a thousand and one horrible varieties lynley understood far better than francesca gerrard could ever have realised but he said only youll find that in a case like this a burial of grief comes handinhand with justice not at once of course but eventually and you need me for that yes i do understand she drew herself up blew her nose shakily on a wadded tissue from her pocket took another hesitant sip of whisky her eyes brimmed with tears again several escaped in a wet trail from cheeks to lips how did you come to have the necklace in your room lynley asked sergeant havers took out her pencil francesca hesitated her lips parted twice to speak before she was able to go on i took it back last night i would have told you earlier in the drawing room i wanted to but when elizabeth and mr vinney begani didnt know what to do everything happened so quickly and then gowan she faltered on the name like a runner stumbling and not righting himself properly yes i see did you go to joys room for the necklace or did she bring it to you i went to her room it was on the chest of drawers by the door i suppose i had changed my mind about her having it you took it back as easily as that there was no discussion francesca shook her head there couldnt have been she was asleep you saw her you got into her room was the door unlocked no id gone without my keys because i thought at first it might be unlocked everyone knew each other after all there was no reason to lock doors but hers was locked so i went to the office for the master keys the key wasnt in her lock from the inside francesca frowned noit couldnt have been could it or i wouldnt have been able to unlock it with my own take us through exactly what you did mrs gerrard willingly francesca retraced her route from her bedroom to joys where she turned the door handle only to find the room locked from joys room to her own where she picked up her desk key from her chest of drawers from her room to her office where she took the master keys from the bottom drawer of her desk from her office to joys room where she unlocked the door quietly saw the necklace in the light from the corridor took it and relocked the door from joys room to her office where she returned the keys from her office back to her own room where she replaced the necklace in her jewellery box what time was this lynley asked threefi fteen exactly she nodded and went on to explain i dont know whether youve ever done anything impulsive that you regret inspector but i regretted parting with the pearls directly after elizabeth took them to joy i lay in bed trying to decide what to do i didnt want a confrontation with joy i didnt want to burden my brother stuart with anything else so iwell i suppose i stole them didnt i and i know it was threefifteen because i had been lying awake watching the clock and thats what time it was when i fi nally decided to do something about getting my necklace back you said joy was asleep did you see her hear her breathing the room was so dark ii suppose i assumed she was asleep she didnt stir didnt speak she her eyes widened do you mean she might have been dead did you actually see her in the room at all you mean in the bed no i couldnt see the bed the door was in the way and i hadnt opened it more than a few inches i just thought of course what about your desk in your offi ce was it locked oh yes she replied its always locked who has keys to it i have one key mary agnes has the other and could anyone have seen you going from your room to joys or going to the office on either of the two trips i didnt notice anyone but i suppose she shook her head i just dont know but you would have passed any number of rooms to make the trips wouldnt you of course anyone on the main corridor could have seen me if they were up and about but surely i would have noticed that or heard a door opening lynley went to join macaskin who was already on his feet examining the fl oor plan that was still spread out upon the table from their earlier interview with david sydeham four rooms had immediate access to the main corridor besides the rooms belonging to lady helen and joy sinclair joanna ellacourt and david sydehams room lord stinhurst and his wifes the unused room of rhys daviesjones and irene sinclairs at the junction of the main corridor and the west wing of the house surely theres truth to what the woman is saying macaskin muttered to lynley as they looked the floor plan over surely she would have heard something seen something been alerted to the fact that she was being watched mrs gerrard lynley said to her over his shoulder are you absolutely certain that joys door was locked last night of course she replied i thought of sending a note with her tea this morning to tell her id taken the necklace back perhaps i really should have but then and you did take the keys back to your desk yes why do you keep asking me about the door and you locked the desk again yes i know i did that its something i always do lynley turned from the table but remained next to it his eyes on francesca can you tell me he asked her how helen clyde came to be given a room adjoining joy sinclairs was that coincidental francescas hand rose to her beads an automatic movement companion to thought helen clyde she repeated was it stuart who suggestedno thats not right is it mary agnes took the call from london i remember because marys spelling is a bit phonetic and the name shed written was unfamiliar i had to get her to say it for me the name yes shed written down joyce encare which of course made no sense until she said it joy sinclair joy had telephoned you yes so i returned the call this wasit must have been last monday evening she asked if helen clyde might have the room next to hers joy asked for helen lynley queried sharply asked for her by name francesca hesitated her eyes dropped to the plan of the house then rose back to meet lynleys no not exactly by name she merely said that her cousin was bringing a guest and could that guest be given the room next to hers i suppose i assumed she must have known her voice faltered as lynley pushed himself away from the table he looked from macaskin to havers to st james there was no point in further procrastination ill see daviesjones now he said rhys daviesjones did not appear to be cowed in the presence of the police in spite of the escort of constable lonan who had followed him like an unfortunate reputation from his room down the stairs and right to the door of the sitting room the welshman evaluated st james macaskin lynley and havers with a look entirely straightforward the deliberate look of a man intent upon showing that he had nothing to hide a dark horse which had never been thought of lynley nodded him to a seat at the table tell me about last night he said daviesjones gave no perceptible reaction to the question other than to move the liquor bottle out of his line of vision he played the tips of his fingers round the edge of a packet of players that he took from his jacket pocket but he did not light one what about last night about your fingerprints on the key to the door that adjoined helens and joys rooms about the cognac you brought to helen about where you were until one in the morning when you showed up at her door again daviesjones did not react either to the words themselves or to the current of hostility that ran beneath them he answered frankly enough i took cognac up to her because i wanted to see her inspector it was stupid of me a rather adolescent way of getting into her room for a few minutes it seems to have worked well enough daviesjones didnt respond lynley saw that he was determined to say as little as possible he found himself instantly equally determined to wring every last fact from the man and your fingerprints on the key i locked the door both doors in fact we wanted privacy you entered her room with a bottle of cognac and locked both the doors rather a blatant admission of your intentions wouldnt you say daviesjones body tensed fractionally thats not how it happened then do tell me how it happened we talked for a bit about the readthrough joys play was supposed to have brought me back into london theatre after mytrouble so i was rather upset about the way everything turned out it was more than a little bit obvious to me that whatever my cousin had in mind in getting us all up here to look at the revisions in her script putting on a play had little enough to do with it i was angry at having been used as a pawn in what was clearly some sort of vengeance game joy was playing against stinhurst so helen and i talked about the readthrough about what in gods name i would do from here then when i was going to leave helen asked me to stay the night with her so i locked the doors daviesjones met lynleys eyes squarely a faint smile touched his lips you werent expecting it to have happened quite that way were you inspector lynley didnt reply rather he pulled the whisky bottle towards him twisted off its cap poured himself a drink the liquor fl ashed through his body satisfactorily deliberately he set the glass down on the table between them a full inch still in it at that daviesjones looked away but lynley didnt miss the tight movements of the mans head the tension in his neck traitors to his need he lit a cigarette with unsteady hands i understand you disappeared right after the readthrough that you didnt show up again until one in the morning how do you account for the time what was it ninety minutes nearly two hours i went for a walk daviesjones replied had he claimed that he had gone swimming in the loch lynley could not have been more surprised in a snowstorm with a windchill factor of god only knows how far below freezing you went for a walk daviesjones merely said i fi nd walking a good substitute for the bottle inspector i would have preferred the bottle last night frankly but a walk seemed like the smarter alternative where did you go along the road to hillview farm did you see anyone speak to anyone no he replied so no one can verify what im telling you i understand that perfectly nonetheless its what i did then you also understand that as far as im concerned you could have spent that time in any number of ways daviesjones took the bait such as such as collecting what youd need to murder your cousin the welshmans answering smile was contemptuous yes i suppose i could have down the back stairs through the scullery and kitchen into the dining room and id have the dirk without anyone seeing me sydehams glove is a problem but no doubt you can tell me how i managed to get it without him being the wiser you seem to know a great deal about the layout of the house lynley pointed out i do i spent the early part of the afternoon looking it over ive an interest in architecture hardly a criminal one however lynley fingered the tumbler of whisky swirling it meditatively how long were you in hospital he asked isnt that a bit out of your purview inspector lynley nothing that touches this case is out of my purview how long were you in hospital for your drinking problem daviesjones answered stonily four months a private hospital yes costly venture whats that supposed to mean that i stabbed my cousin for her money to pay my bills did joy have money of course she had money she had plenty of money and you can rest assured she didnt leave any of it to me you know the terms of her will then daviesjones reacted to the pressure to being in the close presence of alcohol to having been led so expertly into a trap he stubbed out his cigarette angrily in the ashtray yes blast you and shes left every last pound to irene and her children but thats not what you wanted to hear is it inspector lynley seized the opportunity he had gained through the other mans anger last monday joy asked francesca gerrard that helen clyde be given a room next to hers do you know anything about that that helen daviesjones reached for his cigarettes then pushed them away no i cant explain it can you explain how she knew helen would be with you this weekend i must have told her i probably did and suggested that she might want to get to know helen and what better way than by asking to be given adjoining rooms like schoolgirls daviesjones demanded rather transparent for a ruse leading to murder wouldnt you say im certainly open to your explanation i dont bloody have one inspector but my guess is that joy wanted helen next to her to act as a buffer someone without a vested interest in the production someone who wouldnt be likely to come tapping at her door hoping for a chat about line and scene changes actors are like that you know they generally dont give a playwright much peace so you mentioned helen to her you planted the idea i did nothing of the kind you asked for an explanation thats the best i can do yes of course except that it doesnt hold with the fact that joanna ellacourt had the room on the other side of joys does it no buffer there how do you explain it i dont i have absolutely no idea what joy was thinking perhaps she had no idea herself perhaps it means nothing and youre looking for meaning wherever you can fi nd it lynley nodded unaffected by the anger in the implication where did you go once everyone was let out of the library this evening to my room what did you do there i showered and changed and then daviesjones eyes made their way to the whisky there was no noise at all save for a rustle from one of the others in the room macaskin fishing a roll of mints from his pocket i went to helen again lynley asked blandly his head snapped up what the hell are you suggesting i should guess that would be obvious enough shes provided several rather good alibis for you hasnt she first last night and now this evening daviesjones stared at him incredulously before he laughed my god thats absolutely unbelievable do you think helens stupid do you think shes so naïve that shed allow a man to do that to her and not once but twice in twentyfour hours what kind of a woman do you think she is i know exactly the kind of woman helen is lynley responded one absolutely vulnerable to a man who claims to be in possession of a weakness that only she can cure and thats how you played it isnt it right into her bed if i bring her down here now no doubt ill discover that this evening in her room was just another variation on last nights tender theme and by god you cant bear the thought of that can you youre so sick with jealousy that you stopped seeing straight the moment you knew id slept with her face the facts inspector dont twist them about to pin something on me because youre too goddamned afraid to take me on in any other way lynley moved sharply in his chair but macaskin and havers were on their feet at once that brought him to his senses get him out of here he said barbara havers waited until macaskin himself had ushered daviesjones from the room she watched to ensure they were left in complete privacy before she cast a long supplicating look in st james direction he joined her at the table with lynley who had put on his reading spectacles and was looking through barbaras notes the room was taking on a more than livedin look with glasses plates of halfeaten food overfull ashtrays and notebooks scattered about the air smelled as if a contagion were alive in it sir lynley raised his head and barbara saw with a wrench that he looked awful fagged out drawn through a wringer of his own devising lets look at what we have she suggested over the top of his spectacles lynleys eyes went from barbara to st james we have a locked door he replied reasonably we have francesca gerrard locking it with the only key available besides the one across the room on the dressing table we have a man in the next room with a clear means of access now were looking for a motive no barbara thought weakly she kept her voice even and impartial you must admit that its purely coincidental that helens room and joys room adjoined each other he couldnt have known in advance about that couldnt he a man with a selfprofessed interest in architecture there are homes with adjoining rooms all over the country it hardly takes a university degree to guess there would be two here or that joy after specifically requesting a room by helens would be given one of them i imagine no one else was phoning francesca gerrard with special requests of that nature barbara refused to submit francesca herself could have killed joy as matters stand now sir she was in the room she admits it or she could have given the key to her brother and let him do the job it always comes back to lord stinhurst for you doesnt it no thats not it and if you want to go with stinhurst what about gowans death why did stinhurst kill him im not arguing that its stinhurst sir barbara said trying to hold on to her patience her temper and her need to shout out stinhursts motive until lynley was forced to accept it for that matter irene sinclair could have done it or sydeham or ellacourt since they were both on their own or jeremy vinney joy was in his room earlier elizabeth told us as much for all we know he wanted joy got himself squarely rejected went to her room and killed her in a fi t of anger and how did he lock the door when he left i dont know perhaps he went out the window in a storm havers youre stretching it more than i am lynley dropped her notes onto the table removed his spectacles rubbed his eyes i see that daviesjones had access inspector i see that he had opportunity as well but joy sinclairs play was to resurrect his career wasnt it and he had no way of knowing for certain whether the play was finished just because stinhurst withdrew his support someone else well might have fi nanced it so it seems to me that hes the only person in the house with a solid motive for keeping the woman alive st james spoke no theres another isnt there if it comes to regenerating dying careers her sister irene i did wonder when you would get to me irene sinclair stepped back from the door she walked to her bed and sat down her shoulders slumped in deference to the lateness of the hour she had changed into her nightclothes and like the woman itself her garments were restrained flatheeled slippers a navy flannel dressing gown under which the high neck of a white nightdress rose and fell with her steady breathing there was something however oddly impersonal about her clothing it was serviceable indeed yet adhering strictly to a norm of perceived propriety it was exceedingly chilling as if designed and worn to hold life itself at bay lynley wondered if the woman ever slopped round the house in old blue jeans and a tattered jersey somehow he doubted it her resemblance to her sister was remarkable in spite of the fact that he had observed joy only through the photographs of her death lynley could easily recognise in irene those features she had shared with her sister features unaffected by the five or six years that separated them in age prominent cheekbones broad brow the slight squaring of jawline she was he guessed somewhere in her early forties a statuesque woman with the sort of body other women long for and most men dream of taking into their beds she had a face that might have belonged to medea and black hair in which the grey was beginning to streak back dramatically from the left peak of her forehead any other woman remotely insecure would have coloured it long ago lynley wondered if the thought had even crossed irenes mind he studied her wordlessly why on earth had robert gabriel ever found the need to stray someone has probably told you already that my sister and my husband had an affair last year inspector she began keeping her voice low its no particular secret so i dont mourn her death as i ought to as i probably shall eventually its just that when your lifes been torn apart by two people you love its difficult to forgive and forget joy didnt need robert you see i did but she took him anyway and that still hurts when i think of it even now was their affair over lynley asked irenes attention drifted from havers pencil to the floor yes the single word had the distinct flavour of a lie and she continued at once as if to hide this fact i even knew when it started between them one of those dinner parties where people have too much to drink and say things they wouldnt otherwise say that night joy announced that shed never had a man whod been able to satisfy her in only one go that of course was the sort of thing robert would take as a personal challenge that had to be attended to without delay sometimes what hurts me the most is the fact that joy didnt love robert she never loved anyone at all after alec rintoul died rintouls been a recurring theme this evening were they ever engaged informally alecs death changed joy in what way how can i explain it she replied it was like a fire a rampage it was as if joy decided that she would start living with a vengeance once alec was gone but not to enjoy herself rather to destroy herself and to take as many of us down with her as she could it was a sickness with her she went through men one after another inspector she devoured them rapaciously hatefully as if no one could ever begin to make her forget alec and she was daring each and every one of them to try lynley walked to the bed placed the contents from joys shoulder bag onto the counterpane irene considered the objects listlessly are these hers she asked he handed her joys engagement calendar first irene seemed reluctant to take it as if she would come across knowledge within it that she would rather not possess however she identified what notations she could appointments with a publisher in upper grosvenor street the birthday of irenes daughter sally joys selfimposed deadline for having three chapters of a book done lynley pointed out the name scrawled across one entire week p green someone new in her life peter paul philip i dont know inspector she might have been going off on holiday with someone but i couldnt say we didnt speak to one another very often and then when we did it was mostly business she probably wouldnt have told me about a new man in her life but it wouldnt surprise me at all to know that she had one that would have been more than typical of her really disconsolately irene fingered one or two other items the wallet the matchbook the chewing gum the keys she said nothing else watching her lynley pressed the button on the small tape recorder irene shrank infi nitesimally at the sound of her sisters voice he let the machine play through the cheerful comments through the vibrant excitement through the future plans he couldnt help thinking as he listened to joy sinclair once again that she didnt sound at all like a woman bent upon destroying anyone halfway through it irene raised a hand to her eyes she bent her head does any of that mean anything to you lynley asked irene shook her head blindly a passionate movement a second patent lie lynley waited she seemed to be attempting to withdraw from him moving further into herself both physically and emotionally shrivelling up through a concerted act of will you cant bury her this way irene he said quietly i know that you want to i understand why but you know if you try it shell haunt you forever he saw her fi ngers tighten against her skull the nails caught at her fl esh you dont have to forgive her for what shes done to you but dont put yourself into a position of doing something for which you cannot forgive yourself i cant help you irenes voice sounded distraught im not sorry my sisters dead so how can i help you i cant help myself you can help by telling me anything about this tape and ruthlessly mercilessly lynley played it again hating himself for doing so at the same time as he acknowledged it was part of the job it had to be done still at the end there was no response from her he rewound the tape played it again and then again joys voice was like a fourth person in the room she coaxed she laughed she tormented she pleaded and she broke her sister the fifth time through the tape on the words for gods sake dont let mum forget sally again this year irene snatched the recorder shut it off with hands which fumbled on the buttons and flung it back onto the bed as if touching it contaminated her the only reason my mother ever remembered my daughters birthday is because joy reminded her she cried her face bore the signs of anguish but her eyes were dry and still i hated her i hated my sister every minute and i wanted her to die but not like this oh god not like this have you any idea what its like to want a person dead more than anything in the world and then to have it happen as if a mocking deity listened to your wishes and only granted the foulest ones you possess good god the power of simple words he knew of course he knew in the timely death of his own mothers lover in cornwall in ways that irene sinclair could never hope to understand it sounds as if some of what she said was to be part of a new work do you recognise the place shes describing the decaying vegetables the sound of frogs and pumps the fl at land no the circumstance of a winter storm no the man she mentions john darrow irenes hair swung out in an arc as she turned her head away at the sudden movement lynley said john darrow you recognise the name last night at dinner joy talked about him she said something about wining and dining a dreary man called john darrow a new man shes involved with no no i dont think so someonei think it was lady stinhursthad asked her about her new book and john darrow came up joy was laughing the way she always did making light of the difficulties shes been having with the writing saying something about information she needed and was trying to get it involved this john darrow so i think hes connected with the book somehow book another play you mean irenes face clouded play no youve misunderstood inspector aside from an early play six years ago and the new piece for lord stinhurst my sister didnt write for the theatre she wrote books she used to be a journalist but then she took up documentary nonfiction her books are all about crimes real crimes murders mostly didnt you know that murders mostly real crimes of course lynley stared at the little tape recorder hardly daring to believe that the missing piece to the triangular puzzle of motivemeansopportunity would be given to him so easily but there it was what he had been seeking what he had known instinctively he would find a motive for murder still obscure but merely waiting for the details to flesh it out into a coherent explanation and the connection was there on the tape as well in joy sinclairs very last words ask rhys how best to approach him hes good with people lynley began replacing joys belongings in the bag feeling uplifted yet at the same time filled with a hard edge of anger at what had happened here last night and at the price he was going to have to pay personally to see that justice was done at the door with havers already out in the corridor he was stopped by irene sinclairs last words she stood near the bed backed by inoffensive wallpaper and surrounded by a suitable bedroom suite a comfortable room a room that took no risks threw out no challenges made no demands she looked trapped within it those matches inspector she said joy didnt smoke marguerite rintoul countess of stinhurst switched out the bedroom light the gesture was not born of a desire to sleep since she knew very well that sleep would be an impossibility for her rather it was a last vestige of feminine vanity darkness hid the tracery of lines that had begun to network and crumple her skin in it she felt protected no longer the plump matron whose once beautiful breasts now hung pendulous inches short of her waist whose shiny brown hair was the product of weavings and dyes expertly orchestrated by the finest hairdresser in knightsbridge whose manicured hands with their softly buffed nails bore the spotting of age and caressed absolutely nothing any longer on the bedside table she placed her novel laying it down so that its lurid cover lined up precisely with the delicate brass inlay etched against the rosewood even in the darkness the books title leered up at her savage summer passion so pathetically obvious she told herself so useless as well she looked across the room to where her husband sat in an armchair by the window given over to the night to the weak starlight that filtered through the clouds to the amorphous shapes and shadows upon the snow lord stinhurst was fully clothed as was she sitting upon the bed her back against the headboard a wool blanket thrown across her legs she was less than ten feet away from him yet they were separated by a chasm of twentyfive years of secrecy and suppression it was time to bring it to an end the thought of doing so was paralysing lady stinhurst every time she felt that the breath she was taking was the breath that would allow her to speak at last her entire upbringing her past her social milieu rose in concert to strangle her nothing in her life had ever prepared her for a simple act of confrontation she knew that to speak to her husband now was to risk everything to step into the unknown to hazard coming up against the insurmountable wall of his decades of silence having tested these waters of communication periodically before she knew how little might be gained from ner efforts and how horribly her failure would sit upon her shoulders still it was time she swung her legs over the side of the bed a momentary dizziness took her by surprise when she stood but it passed quickly enough she padded across to the window acutely aware of the deep cold in the room and the nasty tightness in her stomach her mouth tasted sour stuart lord stinhurst did not move his wife chose her words carefully you must talk to elizabeth you must tell her everything you must according to joy she already knows as did alec as always those last three words fell heavily between them like blows against lady stinhursts heart she could still see him so clearlyalive and sensitive and achingly young meeting the terrifying end that was destined for icarus but burning not melting out of the sky we are not meant to outlive our children she thought not alec not now she had loved her son loved him instinctively and devotedly but invoking his memorylike a raw wound in both of them that time had only caused to festerhad always been one of her husbands ways of putting an end to unpleasant conversations and it had always worked but not tonight she knows about geoffrey yes but she doesnt know it all you see she heard the argument that night stuart elizabeth heard the fighting lady stinhurst stopped seeking a response from him seeking some kind of sign that would tell her it was safe to continue he gave her nothing she plunged on you spoke to francesca this morning didnt you did she tell you about her talk with elizabeth last night after the readthrough no then i shall elizabeth saw you leave that night stuart alec and joy saw you as well they were all watching from a window upstairs lady stinhurst felt her voice wavering but she forced herself to continue you know how children are they see part hear part and assume the rest darling francesca said that elizabeth believes you killed geoffrey apparently shes thought thatsince the night it happened stinhurst made no reply nothing changed about him not the even fl ow of his breathing not his upright posture not his steady gaze on the frozen grounds of westerbrae his wife tentatively put her fingers on his shoulder he flinched she dropped her hand please stuart lady stinhurst hated herself for the tremor behind her words but she couldnt stop them now you must tell her the truth shes had twentyfive years of believing youre a murderer you cant let it continue my god you cant do that stinhurst didnt look at her his voice was low no she couldnt believe him you didnt kill your brother you werent even responsible you did everything in your power how can i destroy the only warm memories elizabeth has she has so little after all for gods sake at least let her keep that at the expense of her love for you no i wont have it you will his voice was implacable bearing the sort of unquestionable authority that lady stinhurst had never once disobeyed for to disobey was to step out of the role she had been playing her entire life daughter wife mother and nothing else as far as she knew there was only a void beyond the narrow boundaries set up by those who governed her life her husband spoke again go to bed youre tired you need to sleep as always lady stinhurst did as she was told it was past two in the morning when inspector macaskin finally left with a promise to telephone with the postmortems and the forensic reports as soon as he could barbara havers saw him out and returned to lynley and st james in the sitting roomthey were at the table with the items from joy sinclairs shoulder bag spread out before themthe tape recorder was playing yet another time joys voice rising and falling with the broken messages that barbara had long ago memorised hearing it now she realised that the recording had begun to take on the quality of a recurring nightmare and lynley the quality of a man obsessed his were not quantum leaps of intuition in which the misty image of crimemotiveperpetrator took recognisable shape rather they bore the appearance of contrivance of an attempt to find and assess guilt where only by the wildest stretching of the imagination could it possibly exist for the first time in that endless harrowing day barbara began to feel uneasy in the long months of their partnership she had come to realise that for all his exterior gloss and sophistication for all his trappings of upperclass splendour that she so mightily despised lynley was still the fi nest di she had ever worked withyet barbara knew intuitively that the case he was building now was wrong founded on sand she sat down and reached restlessly for the book of matches from joy sinclairs bag brooding upon it it bore a curious imprint merely three words wines the plough with the apostrophe an inverted pint glass spilling lager clever barbara thought the sort of amusing memento one picks up stuffs into a handbag and forgets about but she knew that it was only a matter of time before lynley would grasp at the matchbook as another piece of evidence affirming daviesjones guilt for irene sinclair had said that her sister did not smoke and all of them had seen that daviesjones did we need physical evidence tommy st james was saying you know as well as i that all this is purest conjecture even daviesjones prints on the key can be explained away by the statement helen gave us im aware of that lynley replied but well have the forensic report from strathclyde cid not for several days at least lynley went on as if the other man had not spoken ive no doubt that some piece of evidence will turn up a hair a fibre you know as well as i how impossible it is to carry off a perfect crime but even then if daviesjones was in joys room earlier in the dayand from gowans report he waswhat have you gained by the presence of one of his hairs or a fibre from his coat besides you know as well as i that the crime scene was contaminated by the removal of the body and theres not a barrister in the country who wont know it as well as far as im concerned it comes back to motive again and again the evidence is going to be too weak only a motive can give it strength thats why im going to hampstead tomorrow ive a feeling that the pieces are lying there ready to be put together in joy sinclairs fl at barbara heard this statement with disbelief it was beyond consideration that they should leave so soon what about gowan sir youve forgotten what he tried to tell us he said he didnt see someone and the only person he told me he saw last night was rhys daviesjones dont you think that means he was trying to change his statement he didnt finish the sentence havers lynley replied he said two words didnt see didnt see whom didnt see what daviesjones the cognac he was supposed to be carrying he expected to see him with something in his hand because he came out of the library he expected liquor a book but what if he only thought thats what he saw what if he realised later that what he saw was something quite different a murder weapon or what if he didnt see daviesjones at all and thats what he was trying to tell us what if he only saw someone else attempting to look like daviesjones perhaps wearing his overcoat it could have been anyone lynley stood abruptly why are you so determined to prove the man is innocent from his sharp tone barbara knew what direction his thoughts were taking but he wasnt the only one with a gauntlet to throw down why are you so determined to prove that hes guilty lynley gathered joys belongings im looking for guilt havers its my job and i believe the guilt lies in hampstead be ready by half past eight he started for the door barbaras eyes begged st james to intercede in an area where she knew she could not go where friendship had stronger ties than the logic and rules that govern a police investigation are you certain its wise to go back to london tomorrow st james asked slowly when you think of the inquest lynley turned in the doorway his face caught by the cavern of shadows in the hall havers and i cant give professional evidence here in scotland macaskin will handle it as for the rest of them well collect their addresses theyre not about to leave the country when their livelihoods tied up on the london stage with that he was gone barbara struggled to find her voice i think webberlys going to have his head over this cant you stop him i can only try to reason with him barbara but tommys no fool his instincts are sound if he feels hes onto something we can only wait to see what he fi nds in spite of st james assurance barbaras mouth was dry can webberly sack him for this i suppose it depends on how it all turns out something in his guarded statement told her everything she wanted to know you think hes wrong dont you you think its lord stinhurst too god in heaven whats wrong with him whats happened to him simon st james picked up the bottle of whisky helen he said simply the key in his hand lynley hesitated at lady helens door it was half past two no doubt she would be asleep by now his intrusion both disruptive and unwelcome but he needed to see her and he didnt lie to himself about the purpose of this visit it had nothing to do with police work he knocked once unlocked the door and went in lady helen was on her feet coming across the room but she halted when she saw him he closed the door he said nothing at fi rst merely noting the details and striving to understand what they might imply her bed was undisturbed its yellow and white counterpane pulled up round the pillows her shoes slim black pumps were on the floor next to it they were the only article of clothing that she had removed other than her jewellery gold earrings a thin chain a delicate bracelet on the nightstand this last object caught his eyes and for a painful moment he considered how small her wrists were that such a piece could encircle them so easily there was nothing else to see in the room save a wardrobe two chairs and a dressing table in whose mirror they both were reflected warily confronting one another like two mortal enemies come upon each other unexpectedly and without suffi cient energy or will to do battle again lynley walked past her to the window the west wing of the house stretched into the darkness scattered lights making bright slits against black where curtains were not fully drawn where others waited like helen for the morning he closed the curtains what are you doing her voice was chary its far too cold in here helen he touched the radiator felt its ineffective tingle of warmth and went to the door to speak to the young constable stationed at the top of the stairs would you see if theres an electric fi re somewhere lynley asked him when the man nodded he shut the door again and faced her the distance between them seemed enormous hostility thickened the air why have you locked me in here tommy do you expect me to hurt someone of course not everyones locked in itll be over in the morning there was a book on the floor next to one of the chairs lynley picked it up it was a murder mystery he saw well thumbed through with typical whimsical helennotations in the margins arrows and exclamation points underlinings and comments she was always determined that no author would ever pull the wool over her eyes convinced that she could solve any literary conundrum far sooner in its pages than could he because of this hed been the recipient of her discarded dogeared books for the better part of a decade read this tommy darling you shall never sort it out at the memorys sudden force he felt stricken with sorrow desolate utterly alone and what he had come to say would only serve to make the situation worse between them but he knew he had to speak to her whatever the cost helen i cant bear to see you do this to yourself youre trying to replay st james to a different ending i dont want you to do it i dont know what youre talking about none of this has anything to do with simon lady helen remained where she was across the room from him as if to step in his direction were to surrender in some way and she would never do that lynley thought he saw a small bruise low on her neck where the collar of her teal blouse dipped towards the swell of her breasts but when she moved her head the bruise disappeared a trick of light a product of unhappy imagination it does he said or havent you noticed yet how very much like st james he is even his alcoholism is st james all over again with a simple difference in disability except that this time you wont walk out on him will you you wont go gratefully when he tries to send you away lady helens head turned from him her lips parted then closed he saw that she would allow him these moments of castigation but she would offer no defence his punishment would be never to know never to understand completely what had drawn her to the welshman to be forced into guesswork that she would never affirm he accepted this knowledge with rising anguish still he wanted to touch her feeling desperate for contact for a moment of her warmth i know you helen and i understand how guilt feeds on itself who on earth could possibly understand that better than i i crippled st james but youve always believed that your sin was worse havent you because inside where you would never have to admit it you were relieved all those years ago when he broke your engagement because then you would never have to face life with a man who could no longer do all those things that at the time seemed so absurdly important skiing bathing at resorts dancing hiking having a wonderful time damn you her voice was no more than a whisper when she met his eyes her face was white it was a warning he ignored it compelled to go on for ten years youve had yourself on the rack over leaving st james and now you see an opportunity to put it all right to make up for everything for letting him go off to switzerland to convalesce alone for letting yourself be driven off when he needed you for shirking a marriage that appeared to have responsibilities far outweighing its pleasures daviesjones is going to be your redemption isnt he you plan to make him whole again just as you could have doneand didnt do for st james and then youll be able to forgive yourself at last thats it isnt it thats how its to be played i think youve said enough she said stiffly i havent lynley sought the words to break through to her it was imperative that she understand because he isnt like st james at all beneath the surface please listen to me helen daviesjones isnt a man youve known intimately inside and out since your eighteenth birthday hes a relative stranger to you someone you cant really know a murderer in other words yes if you will she flinched from the easiness of his admission but her slender body drew strength from the passion of her reply muscles became tense across her face and neck evento his imaginationbeneath the soft sleeves of her blouse with me too blinded by love or remorse or guilt or whatever it is that prevents me from seeing whats so patently obvious to you she flung her hand sharply towards the doorway to the house beyond it to the room she had occupied and what had happened within it exactly when did he set this murder in motion he left the house after the readthrough he didnt get back till one on his own report yes youre saying he lied to me tommy but i know he didnt i know he walks when he needs to drink he told me that in london i even walked with him out by the loch after he broke up the row between joy sinclair and gabriel yesterday afternoon and dont you see how clever that was how all of that was to set you up to believe him when he said hed been out walking again last night he needed your compassion helen if you were to allow him to stay in your room and what better way to get it than to say hed been out walking off his need to drink he could hardly have gained your sympathy so effectively by hanging about after the readthrough could he do you actually want me to believe that rhys murdered his cousin while i was asleep that he then came back into my room and made love to me for a second time its completely absurd why because i know him youve been to bed with him helen i think youll agree that knowing a man is more complicated than falling into bed with him for a few steamy hours no matter how pleasant they may have been her dark eyes alone bore the wound made by his words when she spoke again it was with heavy irony you choose your words well congratulations they do hurt lynley felt his heart twist i dont want you to be hurt god in heaven cant you see that cant you see that im trying to keep you from harm im sorry about whats happened im sorry for the foul way i treated you earlier but none of that goes any distance to change the facts of last night daviesjones used you to gain access to her helen he used you again after he saw to gowan this evening he plans to go on using you unless i can stop him and i intend to stop him whether you help me or not she lifted her hand to her throat clutched at the collar of her blouse help you my god i think id rather die her words and the bitterness of her tone struck lynley like a blow he might have answered but was spared the necessity by the police constable who had managed to fi nd a singlebar electric fire to keep her warm through what remained of the night barbara havers paused on the wide drive before going back into the house snow had fallen again during the night but it was a light fall insufficient to close roads but enough to make walking on the estate grounds wet cold and unpleasant nonetheless after a foully sleepless night she had risen shortly after dawn and had set out through the snow determined to rid herself of the turmoil of mixed loyalties that were plaguing her logic told barbara that her primary responsibility was to new scotland yard adherence right now to procedures to judges rules to force regulations would add to the likelihood of her receiving a promotion the next time an inspectors position came open after all she had taken the examination only last month she could swear for certain that shed passed it this timeand the last four courses at the training centre had earned her the highest possible marks so the time was right for advancement or as nearly right as it was ever going to be if she only played this entire affair wisely thomas lynley was what made everything so difficult barbara had spent practically every working hour over the last fi fteen months in lynleys presence so she was not at all oblivious of the qualities that had made him a superb member of the force a man who had risen from constable to sergeant to detective inspector in his fi rst five years he was quickwitted and intuitive gifted with both compassion and humour a man liked by his colleagues and well trusted by superintendent webberly barbara knew how lucky she was to be working with lynley knew how deserving he was of her absolute faith he put up with her moods stoically listened to her ravings even when her most virulent attacks were directed against him still encouraged her to think freely to offer her own opinions to disagree openly he was unlike any other officer she had ever known and she owed him personal debts that went far beyond her having been returned to cid from her demotion to uniformed patrol fifteen months back so now she had to decide where her true loyalties lay to lynley or to advancement in her career for in her forced hike through the woods this morning she had inadvertently come upon a piece of information that bore the unmistakable stamp of being part of the puzzle and she had to decide what to do with it more no matter what she decided she had to understand exactly what it meant the air was stinging in its icy purity barbara felt its sharp stab in her nose and throat in her ears and against her eyes yet she breathed it in deeply five or six times squinting against the brilliant purity of sunlit snow before she trudged across the drive stamped her feet roughly against the stone steps and walked into the great hall of westerbrae it was nearly eight there was movement in the house footsteps in the upper corridor and the sound of keys turning in locks upstairs a smell of bacon and the rich perfume of coffee gave normality to the morningas if the events of the past thirtytwo hours had only been part of an extended nightmareand the low murmur of pleasant voices came from the drawing room barbara walked in to fi nd lady helen and st james sitting in a soft pool of sunlight at the east end of the room sharing coffee and conversation they were alone as barbara watched them together st james shook his head reached out and rested his hand for a moment upon lady helens shoulder it was a gesture of infinite gentleness of understanding the wordless binding of a friendship that made the two of them together stronger and more viable than either one could ever be alone seeing them barbara was struck by the thought of how easy it was to make a decision when she considered it in the light of friendship indeed between lynley and her career there was no choice at all she had no real career without him she crossed the room to join them both looked as if they too had experienced a restless night the lines on st james face were more sharply defined than usual and lady helens fine skin had a fragile look about it like a gardenia that would bruise at the slightest touch when st james automatically began to rise in greeting barbara waved the social nicety to one side can you come outside with me she asked them ive found something in the woods that i think you ought to see st james face registered the impossibility of his being able to navigate the snow drifts and barbara hastily sought to reassure him theres a brick walk for part of the way and ive fl attened enough of a path in the forest itself i think its only about sixty yards into the trees what is it lady helen asked a grave barbara replied the forest had been planted to the south of a pathway that circled the great house it was not the sort of woodland that would have sprung up naturally in this moorfilled area of scotlandthere were english and sessile oaks beeches walnuts and sycamores mixed in with pines a narrow path led through them marked out by small circles of yellow paint that had been dotted onto the trunks of the trees the forest was a place of that unearthly kind of silence that comes from the heavy insulation of snow upon tree branches and ground no wind moved and although the raw burst of an automobile engine pierced the stillness momentarily it died off quickly leaving in its wake only the restless lapping of water in the loch some twenty yards down the slope to their left the going was not easy for even though sergeant havers had indeed fl attened a primitive path through the woods the snow was deep and the ground irregular no place for a man who had difficulty enough on a surface that was fl at and dry it took fi fteen minutes to make a fourminute walk and in spite of lady helens supportive arm st james was dampfaced from exertion when havers finally led them off the main path onto a smaller branch that rose gently through a copse towards a knoll during the summer heavy foliage would probably have hidden both the knoll and the little track from the view of anyone on the main path from the house but in the winter hydrangeas that otherwise would have been vibrant with clusters of pink and blue fl owers and walnuts that would have created a verdant screen of protection were bare giving anyone free access to the plot of ground at the knolls top it was an area about twentyfi ve feet square bounded by an iron fence white powder dusted this hiding the fact that long ago the fence had surrendered to rust lady helen was the first to speak what on earth is a graveyard doing here is there a church nearby havers indicated the direction the main path took towards the south theres a locked chapel and a family vault not too much further along and an old pier on the loch just below it it looks like theyve boated their way to burials like the vikings st james said absently what have we here barbara he pushed open the gate wincing at the shriek of its unoiled metal there was one set of footsteps in the snow already i had a look havers explained id already gone along to the family chapel and had a look there so when i saw this on my way back i was curious see for yourself tell me what you think while havers waited at the gate st james and lady helen crunched through the snow to the single gravestone that rose from it like a solitary grey augury scratched by a bare elm branch that drooped heavily onto its top it was not a terribly old stone certainly not as old as those found in tumbling graveyards throughout the country yet it was very much abandoned for the black residue of lichen ate at the meagre carving and st james guessed that in midsummer the yard itself would be wildly overgrown with cow parsley and weeds nonetheless the words upon the stone were legible only partially effaced by weather and neglect geoffrey rintoul viscount corleagh quietly they studied the lonely grave a dense chunk of snow fell from a branch above it and disintegrated on the stone is that lord stinhursts older brother lady helen asked it looks that way havers replied curious wouldnt you say why st james eyes swept across the plot looking for other graves there were none because the family homes in somerset isnt it havers replied it is st james knew that havers was watching him knew that she was attempting to gauge how much lynley had told him of his private conversation with lord stinhurst he tried to sound completely detached so whats geoffrey doing buried here why isnt he in somerset i believe he died here st james replied you know as well as i that nobs like these bury their own in family plots simon why wasnt this particular body taken home or she queried before he could answer if youre going to say that it wasnt possible for them to take the body home then why wasnt he buried in the gerrard family plot just a few hundred yards further down the path st james chose his words with care perhaps this was a favourite spot of his barbara its peaceful no doubt quite beautiful in the summer with the loch just below it i cant think that it means all that much not even when you consider that this man geoffrey rintoul was stinhursts older brother and the rightful lord stinhurst in the fi rst place st james eyebrows raised quizzically youre not suggesting that lord stinhurst murdered his brother in order to gain the title because if thats the case wouldnt it make a lot more sense if he wished to cover up a murder to take his brother home and bury him with attendant pomp and circumstance in somerset lady helen had been listening to their exchange quietly but she spoke at the mention of burials theres something not quite right here simon francesca gerrards husbandphillip gerrardisnt buried in the family plot either hes on a small island in the loch just a bit off shore i saw the island from my window right after my arrival and when i commented upon it to mary agnesit has a curious tomb on it that looks like a follyshe told me all about it according to mary agnes thats where francescas husband phillip insisted upon being buried insisted simon it was in the terms of his will i should guess its a bit of local colour because gowan told me the exact same thing when he brought up my luggage not fifteen minutes later there you have it havers put in something awfully strange is going on with these two families and you certainly cant argue that this is a rintoul family graveyard here not without any other graves besides the rintouls arent even scots why would they bury one of their family here unless they had to lady helen murmured or wanted to havers finished triumphantly she crossed the little yard and stood in front of st james inspector lynleys told you about his interrogation of lord stinhurst hasnt he hes told you everything stinhurst said whats going on for a moment st james considered lying to havers he also considered telling her the brutal truth that what lynley had told him had been said in confidence and was none of her business but he had a sense that she had not brought them out on this trek as an exercise in attempting to affix blame for the last two days deaths upon stuart rintoul lord stinhurst she could have done that easily enough by insisting that lynley himself be the one to look at this solitary grave by arguing its peculiarity with him the fact that havers had not done so suggested one of two things to st james either she was collecting her own evidence in an attempt to aggrandise herself and denigrate lynley in front of their superiors at scotland yard or she was seeking his own help to prevent lynley from making a colossal mistake havers turned her back on him walking away its all right i ought not to have asked that youre his friend simon of course hed talk to you she pulled her woollen cap down roughly so that it covered her forehead and ears looking cheerlessly down at the loch watching her st james decided that she deserved the truth she deserved the tribute of someones trust and the opportunity to prove herself worthy of it he told her lord stinhursts story as lynley had related it to him havers listened doing nothing more than tugging at one or two dead weeds along the fence while st james spun out the twisted tale of love and betrayal that had ended with geoffrey rintouls death her eyes narrowed against the gleam of sunlight on the snow rested on the tombstone nearby when st james was done she asked only one question do you believe it i cant think why a man in lord stinhursts position would defame his own wife to anyone even this as havers was about to speak to save his own skin too noble for that her tone was cutting not at all too proud then if as you say its a matter of pride a matter of appearances wouldnt he have kept up appearances one hundred percent what do you mean lady helen spoke if lord stinhurst wanted to pretend that everything was status quo simon wouldnt he have taken geoffrey home for burial in somerset in addition to keeping his marriage alive all these years as a matter of fact it seems that taking his brother home would have beenin the long runfar less painful than staying married for the next thirtysix years to a woman who had made a fool of him with his own brother there was cleareyed sense in that typical of helen st james had to admit it to himself even if he didnt say it aloud but evidently he would not have to for sergeant havers appeared to read it in his face please help me get to the bottom of the rintoul family she said desperately simon i swear that stinhurst has something to bury and i think inspector lynleys been given the shovel to see to it himself perhaps by the yard i dont know st james hesitated thinking about the difficulties he would be creating for himself poised precariously between lynleys trust and havers unwavering belief in stinhursts guiltif he agreed to help her it wont be easy if tommy finds out youve gone your own way on this barbara therell be hell to pay insubordination youll be finished in cid lady helen added quietly youll be back on the street dont you think i know that havers face though pale was resolute and unfl inching and whos going to be finished if there is a coverup being generated and if it comes to light through the efforts of some reporter someone like jeremy vinney by godsniffing it out on his own at least this way if im involved in looking into stinhurst the inspectors protected for all anyone will know hes ordered me to do it you care for tommy dont you havers looked away at once from lady helens sudden query most of the time i hate the miserable fop she replied but if hes given the sack its not going to be over some berk like stinhurst st james smiled at the ferocity of her reply ill help you he said for what its worth although the broad walnut sideboard bore a heavy burden of chafing dishes all exuding a variety of breakfast odours from kippers to eggs the dining room held only one occupant when lynley entered elizabeth rintouls back was to the door and apparently indifferent to the sound of his footsteps she did not turn her head to see who was joining her for the meal rather she toyed a fork against the single sausage on her plate rolling it back and forth her eyes making a study of the shiny trail of grease it left snaillike in its wake lynley joined her carrying a cup of black coffee and a single slice of cold toast she was he presumed dressed for the journey back to london with her parents but like her garments of last evening her black skirt and grey jumper were overlarge and although she wore black tights to match them a small ladder in the ankle promised to lengthen as the day drew on over the back of her chair was draped a curious fulllength cape midnight blue in colour a sort of sarah woodruff garment that one might wear for striking dramatic poses on the cobb it certainly didnt seem to fit in with the general scheme of elizabeths personality that she wasnt eager to spend any time with lynley became evident the moment he sat down across from her stoneyfaced she pushed back her chair and began to rise ive been given to understand that joy sinclair was engaged to your brother alec at one time lynley observed as if shed made no movement her eyes didnt shift from her plate she settled back down and began cutting the sausage into waferthin slices eating none of them her hands were extraordinarily large even for a woman of her height and their knuckles were knobby and unattractive deep scratches covered them lynley noted several days old cats elizabeths voice was a shade less than surly lynley chose not to reply to the evasive monosyllable so she went on by saying youre looking at my hands the scratches are from my cats they dont much like it when one breaks up their copulating but there are some activities that i frankly prefer not go on on my bed it was a doubleedged remark telling in its inadvertent admission lynley wondered what an analyst would make of it did you want joy to marry your brother it hardly matters now does it alecs been dead for years how did she come to meet him joy and i were at school together she came home with me for halfterms occasionally alec was there and they got on at this elizabeth raised her head lynley marvelled that a womans face could be so completely devoid of expression it looked like an inexpertly painted mask joy got on with all men inspector it was her special gift my brother was just one of a long line of her suitors yet ive the impression she took him far more seriously than the others of course why not alec professed his love often enough to sound like a perfect sap at the same time as he massaged her ego and how many of the others could offer her the promise of being countess of stinhurst once daddy popped off elizabeth began arranging the pieces of her sausage into a pattern on her plate did her relationship with your brother put a strain on your friendship a breath of laughter shot through her nose like a gust of angry wind our friendship was defined by alec in spector once he died i served no further purpose in joy sinclairs life i saw her only once after alecs memorial service in fact then she disappeared without a second thought until this weekend yes until this weekend thats the kind of friends we were is it your habit to travel with your parents on a theatrical outing such as this not at all but im fond of my aunt it was a chance to see her so i came an unpleasant smile played round elizabeths mouth quivered at her nostrils and disappeared of course there was also mummys plan for my lusty liaison with jeremy vinney and i couldnt disappoint her when she was depending so much upon this being the weekend that my rose was finally plucked if thats not too much of a metaphor for you lynley ignored the implication vinneys known your family long he concluded long hes known daddy forever on both sides of the footlights years ago in the regionals he fancied himself the next olivier but daddy set him straight so vinney moved on to drama criticism where hes been ever since happily getting his jollies by trashing as many productions in a year as he can but this new playwell it was something close to my fathers heart the agincourt reopening and all so i suppose my parents wanted me to be here to ensure good reviews you know what i mean just in case vinney decided to respond to ashall we say less than delectable bribe she swept a hand rudely down the length of her body myself in exchange for a favourable commentary in the times it would meet the needs of both my parents dont you see my mothers desire to have me properly serviced at last my fathers desire to take london in triumph she had deliberately returned to her prior theme in spite of lynleys offer to turn the tide of conversation cooperatively he took up her thought is that why you went to jeremy vinneys room the night joy died elizabeths head shot up at that of course not smarmy little man with fingers like hairy sausages she stabbed her fork at her plate as far as i was concerned joy could have the little beast i think hes pathetic rubbing up to theatre people in the hope that hanging about might give him the talent he lacked to make it on the stage years ago pathetic the sudden burst of passion seemed to disconcert her as if to negate it she shifted her eyes and said well perhaps thats why mummy considered him such a suitable candidate for me two little blobs of pathos drifting into the sunset together god what a romantic thought but you went to his room i was looking for joy because of aunt francie and her bloody pearls although now i think about it mummy and aunt francie probably had the entire scene planned out in advance joy would rush off to her room salivating over her new acquisition leaving me alone with vinney no doubt mummy had already been in his room with fl ower petals and holy water and all that was left was the act itself what a pity all that effort she went to only to have it wasted on joy you seem fairly certain about what was going on between them in vinneys room i do wonder about that did you see joy are you certain she was with him are you sure it wasnt somebody else i elizabeth stopped she toyed jerkily with knife and fork of course it was joy i heard them didnt i but you didnt see her i heard her voice whispering murmuring it was late shed have kept it low wouldnt she it was joy who else could it have been and what else would be going on between them after midnight inspector poetry readings believe me if joy went to a mans room it was with only one thing on her mind i know it she did that with alec when she visited at your home elizabeths mouth shut tightened she went back to her plate tell me what you did when you left the readthrough the other night lynley said she moved the sliced sausage into a neat little triangle then with the knife she began cutting the circular pieces in half each slice was sparely made and carried out with acute concentration it was a moment before she replied i went to my aunt she was upset i wanted to help youre fond of her you seem surprised inspector as if its a miracle of sorts that i could be fond of anything is that right in the face of his refusal to rise to her taunting she put down knife and fork pushed her chair fully back and regarded him straightforwardly i took aunt francie to her room i put a compress on her head we talked about elizabeth smiled one last time but it was inexplicably a reaction that seemed to mix both amusement and the knowledge of having bested an opponent the wind in the willows if you really must know she said youre familiar with the story arent you the toad the badger the rat and the mole she stood reached for her cape and swung it round her shoulders now if theres nothing more inspector ive things to see to this morning that said she left him lynley heard her bark of laughter echo in the hall irene sinclair had herself just heard the news when robert gabriel found her in what francesca gerrard optimistically labelled her games room behind the last door in the lower northeast corridor almost obscured behind a pile of disused outdoor garments the room was completely isolated and once inside irene welcomed its smell of mildew and wood rot and the pervasive congestion of dust and grime obviously the renovation of the house had not reached this far corner yet irene found herself glad of it an old billiard table sat in the centre of the room its baize covering loosely rippled the netting under most of the pockets either torn or missing altogether there were cue sticks on a rack on the wall and irene fi ngered these absently as she made her way to the window no curtains covered it a condition that contributed to the numbing want of heat since she wore no coat she held her body tightly and rubbed her hands along her arms pressing hard against the wool sleeves of her dress feeling the answering friction like a kind of pain from the window there was little to see just a grove of winterbare alders beyond which the slate top of a boathouse seemed to be sprouting from a hillock like a triangular excrescence it was an optical illusion fabricated from the angle of the window and the height of the hill irene considered this idea brooding over the continuing place that illusions seemed to be making in her life god in heaven renie ive been looking for you everywhere what are you doing in here robert gabriel crossed the room to her he had come in noiselessly managing to shut the warped door without a sound he was carrying his overcoat and said in explanation of it i was just about to go outside and start a search he dropped the coat on her shoulders it was a meaningless enough gesture yet irene still felt a distinct aversion to his touch he was so near that she could smell the cologne he wore and the last vestige of coffee fighting with toothpaste upon his breath it made her feel ill if gabriel noticed he gave no sign theyre letting us leave have they made an arrest do you know she couldnt bring herself to look at him no no arrest not yet of course were to be available for the inquest god what a dashed inconvenience it is to have to run back and forth from london but at least its better than having to stay in this ice pit the hot waters entirely gone you know and little hope of having repairs done on that old boiler for at least three days thats taking roughing it to the limit isnt it i heard you she said her voice was a whisper small and despairing she felt him looking at her heard i heard you robert i heard you with her the other night irene what are you oh you neednt worry that ive told the police i wouldnt do that would i but thats why youve come looking for me i dare say to make sure my pride ensures my silence no i dont even know what youre talking about im here because i want to take you back to london i dont want you to be going off on your own theres no telling heres the most amusing part irene interrupted acidly id actually come looking for you god help me robert i think i was ready to have you back id even to her shame her voice broke and she moved away from him as if by that she would regain her selfcontrol id even brought you a picture of our james did you know he was mercutio at school this year i had two photographs made one of james and one of you in a double frame remember that photo of you as mercutio all those years ago of course you dont look very much alike because james has my colouring but all the same i thought youd want to have the pictures mostly because of james no im lying to myself and i swore last night that id stop it i wanted to bring you the pictures because i hated you and i loved you and just for a moment the other night when you and i were together in the library i thought there was a chance renie for the love of god no i heard you it was hampstead all over again exactly and they say that life doesnt repeat itself dont they what a fi lthy laugh all i needed to do was open the door to fi nd you a second time having my sister just as i did last year with the only difference being that i was alone this time at least our children would have been spared a second go at the sight of their father sweating and panting and moaning over their lovely aunt joy it isnt what i think irene felt her face quiver with encroaching tears their presence angered herthat he should still be able to reduce her to this i dont want to hear it robert no more clever lies no more it only happened once no more anything he grabbed her arm do you think i killed your sister his face looked ill perhaps from lack of sleep perhaps from guilt she laughed hoarsely shaking him off killed her no thats not at all your style dead joy was absolutely no good to you was she after all you arent the least bit interested in screwing a corpse that didnt happen then what did i hear i dont know what you heard i dont know who you heard anyone could have been with her in your room she demanded his eyes widened in panic in myrenie good god its not what you think she flung his coat off her shoulders dust leaped from the floor when it dropped its worse than knowing youve always been a filthy liar robert because now i realise that ive become one god help me i used to think that if joy died id be free of the pain now i believe ill only be free of it when youre dead as well how can you say that is that what you really want she smiled bitterly with all my heart god god with all my heart he stepped away from her away from the coat on the floor between them his face was ashen so be it love he whispered lynley found jeremy vinney outside on the drive stowing his suitcase into the boot of a hired morris vinney was muffled against the cold in coat gloves and scarf his breath steamed the air his high domed forehead gleamed pink where the sun struck it and he looked surprisingly as if he were perspiring he was also lynley noted the first to leave a decidedly strange reaction in a newspaperman lynley crossed the drive to him his footsteps grating against the gravel and ice vinney looked up making an early start of it lynley remarked the journalist nodded towards the house where dark early morning shadows were painted like ink along the stone walls not really a spot for lingering is it he slammed the boot lid home and checked to see that it was securely locked fumbling a bit with his keys he dropped them and cleared his throat raspily as he bent to retrieve them in their worn leather case when he finally looked at lynley it was to reveal a face upon which grief played subtly the way it often does when an initial shock has been lived through and the immensity of a loss begins to be measured against the endlessness of time somehow lynley said i should think a journalist would be the last to leave at this vinney gave an abrupt little laugh it seemed selfdirected punitive and unkind hot after a story at the scene of the crime looking for a good ten inches of space on page one not to mention a byline and a knighthood for having solved the crime singlehandedly is that how you see it inspector lynley answered the question by asking one why were you actually here this weekend mr vinney every other presence can be accounted for in one way or another but you remain a bit of a mystery can you shed some light on it for me didnt you get a good enough picture from our attractive elizabeth last evening i was wild to get joy in bed or better yet i was picking her brains for material to bolster my career choose either one frankly id prefer the reality vinney swallowed he seemed discomfi ted as if he expected something other than equanimity from the police bellicose insistence upon the truth perhaps or a fi nger stabbed provocatively into his chest she was my friend inspector probably my best friend sometimes i think my only friend and now shes gone his eyes looked burnt out as he turned them towards the untroubled surface of the loch in the distance but people dont understand that kind of friendship between a man and a woman do they they want to make something of it they want to cheapen it up lynley was not untouched by the mans distress he noticed however that vinney had sidestepped his question was joy the one who actually arranged for you to be here i know you did the phoning to stinhurst but did she smooth the way was it her idea when vinney nodded he asked why she said she was worried about how stinhurst and the actors would receive the revisions shed made to the play she wanted a friend along she said for moral support should things not go her way id been following the agincourt renovation for months it seemed reasonable that i might ask to be included in the settingup of the play for its opening so i came to support her as she asked but i didnt support her at all in the end did i she may as well have been here alone i saw your name in her engagement book i shouldnt be surprised we met for lunch regularly weve done so for years at these meetings did she tell you anything about this weekend what it would be like what to expect just that it was a readthrough and that i might find it an interesting story the play itself vinney didnt answer at first his vision appeared fixed on nothing when he replied however his voice sounded thoughtful as if hed been struck by an idea unconsidered before joy said she wanted me to think about writing an early article on the play it would be a piece about the stars the plot perhaps the format she was using coming here would give me an idea about how the play would be staged but ii could easily have got that information in london couldnt i we see saweach other often enough so could she could she have been worried that something like this might happen to her inspector good god could she have hoped id see to it that the truth were told lynley commented upon neither the mans apparent belief in the inability of the police to ferret out the truth nor the egotistical likelihood of a single journalists being able to do it for them nonetheless he catalogued the fact that vinneys remark was astonishingly close to lord stinhursts own assessment of the columnists presence are you saying she was concerned about her safety she didnt say that vinney admitted honestly and she didnt act concerned why was she in your room the other night she said she was too keyed up to sleep shed had it out with stinhurst and went to her room but she felt restless so she came to mine to talk what time was this a bit after midnight perhaps a quarter past what did she talk about the play at first how she was bound and determined to see to it that it was produced with or without stinhurst and then about alec rintoul and robert gabriel and irene she felt rotten about everything that had happened to irene you know sheshe was desperate for her sister to get back with gabriel thats why she wanted irene in the play she thought if the two of them were thrown together enough nature would take its course she said she wanted irenes forgiveness and knew she couldnt have it but more than that i think she wanted to forgive herself and she couldnt do that as long as gabriel and her sister were apart it was a glib enough recital seemingly straightforward yet lynleys instincts told him there was more to be said about joys nocturnal visit to vinneys room you make her sound rather saintly vinney shook his head in denial she wasnt a saint but she was a decent friend what time did elizabeth rintoul come to your room with the necklace vinney brushed the snow from the morris roof before answering not long after joy came in ijoy didnt want to talk to her she expected it would be another row about the play so i kept elizabeth out i only opened the door a crack she couldnt see inside so when i wouldnt invite her in of course she assumed joy was in my bed thats fairly typical of her elizabeth cant conceive that members of the opposite sex might just be friends with her a conversation with a man is an access route to some sort of sexual encounter its rather sad i think when did joy leave your room shortly before one did anyone see her leave there was no one about i dont think anyone saw her unless elizabeth was peering out her door somehow or maybe gabriel my room was between both of theirs did you see joy to her room no why then she might not have gone there at once if as you said she thought she wouldnt be able to sleep where else would she go understanding swept across his face to meet someone no she wasnt interested in any of these people if as you say joy sinclair was merely your friend how can you be certain that she didnt share something more than friendship with someone else with one of the other men here this weekend or one of the women perhaps at the second suggestion vinneys face clouded he blinked and looked away there were no lies between us inspector she knew everything i knew everything surely she would have told me if he stopped sighing rubbing the back of his gloved hand wearily across his forehead may i be off what else is there to say joy was my friend and now shes dead vinney spoke as if there were a connection between the last two ideas lynley couldnt help wondering if there was curious about the man and his relationship with joy sinclair he chose another subject what can you tell me about a man called john darrow vinney dropped his hand darrow he repeated blankly nothing should i know who he is joy did evidently irene said she even mentioned him at dinner perhaps in reference to her new book what can you tell me about it lynley watched vinneys face waiting to see a flicker of recognition from the man with whom joy had ostensibly shared everything nothing he appeared embarrassed about this apparent contradiction in what he had previously said she didnt talk about her work there was nothing i see lynley nodded thoughtfully the other man shifted his weight back and forth on his feet he played his keys from one hand to the other joy carried a tape recorder in her shoulder bag did you know she used it whenever a thought struck her i knew that she made reference to you on it asking herself why she was in such a lather over you why might she have said that in a lather over me his voice rose incredulously jeremy jeremy oh lord why be in such a lather over him its hardly a lifetime proposition those were her words can you shed light on them vinneys face was tranquil enough but the unrest in his eyes betrayed him no i cant i cant think what she meant we didnt have that sort of friendship at least not on my side not at all six denials lynley knew his man well enough to discern the fact that his last remarks had deliberately misdirected the conversation vinney wasnt a good liar but he was skilled in seizing the moment and using it cleverly hed just done so but why i wont keep you any longer mr vinney lynley concluded no doubt youre anxious to get back to london vinney looked as if he wanted to say more but instead he got into the morris and switched on its ignition at fi rst the car made that rolling sound that comes from an engine unwilling to start but then it coughed and fi red into life releasing exhaust fumes dyspeptically vinney cranked down the window while the front wipers worked to free the windscreen of snow she was my friend inspector just that nothing more he reversed the car the tyres spun fiercely on a patch of ice before gaining hold on the gravel he shot down the drive towards the road lynley watched vinneys departure intrigued by the mans compulsion to repeat that last remark as if it contained an underlying meaning that a detectives close scrutiny would instantly reveal for some reasonperhaps because of the distant presence of invernessit took him back to eton and a fifth forms passionate debate over the obsessions and compulsions evidenced by macbeth that pricking of conscience spurring his tormented references to sleep once the deed was done what need is going unfulfilled in the man despite his successful completion of the act that he thought would bring him joy his pacing literature master would ask the question insistently pointing at this boy or that for assessments evaluations speculations defence needs drive compulsions what need what need it was a very good question lynley decided he felt for his cigarette case and started back across the drive just as sergeant havers and st james came round the corner of the house snow clung to their trouser legs as if theyd been thrashing in it lady helen was right behind them for an awkward moment the four of them stared at one another wordlessly then lynley said havers put a call in to the yard will you let webberly know were on our way back to london this morning havers nodded disappearing through the front door with a quick glance from lady helen to lynley st james did likewise will you come back with us helen lynley asked when they were alone he put his cigarette case back into his pocket unopened itll be a quicker trip for you weve a helicopter waiting near oban i cant tommy you know that her words were not unkind but they were unmercifully final there seemed to be nothing more for them to say to each other still lynley found himself struggling to break her reserve in some manner no matter how shadowy or inconsequential it was inconceivable that he should part from her this way and thats what he told her before common sense or pride or stiff propriety could prevent him from doing so i cant bear your going away from me like this helen she was caught before him in a streak of sunlight it slanted through her hair turning it the colour of a fine old brandy just for a moment her lovely dark eyes held an unreadable emotion then it vanished i must go she said quietly passed by him and entered the house its like a death lynley thought but without a proper burial without a period of mourning without an end to lamentation in his cluttered london offi ce superintendent malcolm webberly placed the telephone receiver back into its cradle that was havers he said in a characteristic gesture he raked his right hand through his thinning sandy hair and pulled on it roughly as if to encourage his incipient baldness sir david hillier chief superintendent did not move from the window where he had been standing for the last quarter hour his eyes placidly evaluating the serried collection of buildings that composed the city skyline as always he was impeccably dressed and his posture suggested a man at ease with success comfortable with navigating the treacherous straits of political power and he asked theyre on their way back thats all no according to havers theyre tracking a lead to hampstead apparently sinclair was working on a book there at her home hilliers head turned slowly but with the sun behind him his face was in shadow a book in addition to the play havers wasnt all too clear about it however i got the impression it was something that struck lynley something that he feels he must follow through hillier smiled coolly at this thank god for inspector lynleys remarkably creative intuition hes my best man david webberly said bitterly and hell follow orders of course as will you hillier turned back to his contemplation of the city it was half past two when lynley and havers finally reached joy sinclairs small corner house located in the fashionable hampstead area of london the white brick building was a testament to the authors success its front window hung with diaphanous ivory curtains bowed out over a patch of garden where pruned rose bushes dormant star jasmine and tightbudded camellias grew two window boxes spilled ivy down the front and up the walls of the house particularly near the doorway whose narrow shingled pediment was nearly lost beneath lush bronzeveined leaves although the house faced flask walk its garden entry was on back lane a narrow cobbled avenue that climbed towards heath street a block away where traffic moved smoothly almost without sound followed by havers lynley unhooked the wrought iron gate and crossed the fl agstone pathway the day was windless but the air was raw and a watery winter sunshine caught upon the brass lighting fixture to the left of the door and upon the polished post slot at its centre not bad digs havers commented with grudging admiration your basic brickedin garden your basic nineteenthcentury lamp post your basic treeshaded street lined with your very basic bmws she jerked a thumb at the house must have set her back a few quid from what daviesjones said about the terms of her will ive the impression she could afford it lynley replied he unlocked the door and motioned havers inside they found themselves in a small anteroom marbletiled and unfurnished a collection of several days letters lay scattered on the fl oor pushed through the slot in the door by the postman they were the kind of collection one might expect in the post of a successful author five circulars an electricity account eleven letters addressed to joy in care of her publisher and forwarded on a telephone account a number of small envelopes that looked like invitations several businesssize envelopes with a variety of return addresses lynley handed them to havers have a look through these sergeant she took them and they went on into the house through an opaque glass door that led into a long hall here two doors opened along the left wall and a staircase rose along the right at the far end of the corridor afternoon shadows filled what appeared to be the kitchen lynley and havers entered the sitting room first the room shone in a filtered gold light that fell in three oblique shafts through a large bay window across a carpet the colour of mushrooms which had the look and smell of having been newly laid but there was very little else to reveal the personality of the houses owner other than lowslung chairs grouped round calfhigh tables that spoke of a penchant for modern design this was affirmed by joy sinclairs choice of art three oils after the fashion of jackson pollock leaned against one wall waiting to be hung and on one of the tables an angular marble sculpture stood its subject indeterminate double doors on the eastern wall opened into the dining room it too was furnished sparingly with that same taste for the sleek paucity of modern design lynley walked to the set of four french doors behind the dining table frowning at the simplicity of their locks and the ease of entry they would afford the least skilled burglar not he admitted to himself that joy sinclair had much here worth stealing unless the market for scandinavian furniture was booming or the paintings in the sitting room were the real thing sergeant havers pulled out one of the dining chairs and sat down at the table spreading the mail in front of her pursing her lips thoughtfully she began slitting it open popular lady must be a dozen different invitations in here hmm lynley looked out at the brickwalled back garden a square not much larger than the area required to hold one thin ash tree a circlet of ground beneath it for planting flowers and a patch of lawn covered by a thin layer of snow he went on into the kitchen the pervasive feeling of anonymous ownership here was much the same as in the other two rooms blackfronted appliances broke into a long row of white cabinets a scrubbed pine breakfast table with two chairs stood against one wall and bright splashes of primary colour had strategic places throughout the room a red cushion here a blue tea kettle there a yellow apron on a hook behind the door lynley leaned against the counter and studied it all houses always had a way of revealing their owners to him but this house had a look of deliberate artifi ciality something created by an interior designer who had been given free rein by a woman absolutely uninterested in her personal environment the result was a tasteful showpiece of restrained success but it told him nothing horrendous telephone bill havers called from the dining room looks like she spent most of her time chatting it up with half a dozen chums round the world she seems to have asked for a print out of her calls such as seven calls to new york four to somerset six to wales andlet me seeten to suffolk all very brief save for two longer ones made at the same time of day made one after another no over five days last month interspersed with the calls to wales check on all the numbers lynley started down the hall towards the stairs as havers slit open another envelope heres something sir she read out to him joy youve answered none of my calls nor any of my letters i shall expect to hear from you by friday or the matter will have to be turned over to our legal department edna lynley paused his foot on the fi rst step her publisher her editor and its on publishing house stationery sounds like trouble doesnt it lynley reflected on earlier information the reference on the tape recording to putting edna off the crossedout appointments on upper grosvenor street in joys engagement calendar telephone the publishing house sergeant find out what you can then do the same for the rest of the longdistance calls on the print out im going up above while joy sinclairs personality had seemed absent on the lower floor of the house her presence asserted itself with chaotic abandon once lynley reached the top of the stairs here was the life centre of the building an eclectic jumble of personal possessions collected and treasured here joy sinclair was everywhere in the photographs covering the walls of the narrow hall in an overfull storage cabinet stuffed with everything from linens to crusty paintbrushes in the curtain of lingerie in the bathroom even in the air which held the faint fragrance of bath powder and perfume lynley went into the bedroom it was a riot of multicoloured pillows battered rattan furniture and clothes on the table next to her unmade bed stood a photograph that he examined briefly an arrowthin sensitivelooking young man stood by the fountain in the great court of trinity college cambridge lynley noted the way his hair grew back from his forehead recognised something familiar in the set of his shoulders and head alec rintoul he guessed and replaced it he went on to the front of the house here joys study was no different from the other rooms and upon his first look at it lynley wondered how anyone could manage to produce a book in an atmosphere so totally devoid of order he stepped over a pile of manuscripts near the door and walked to the wall where two maps were hung above a word processor the first map was large a regulation district map of the sort bookstores sell to tourists who want to make a thorough scrutiny of a particular area of the country this one was for suffolk although parts of cambridgeshire and norfolk were included on it evidently joy had been using it for some sort of research lynley saw for the name of a village was circled heavily in red ink and some two inches from it a large x had been drawn not far from mildenhall fen lynley put on his spectacles to get a better look porthill green he read beneath the red circle and then a moment later he made the connection p green in joys engagement diary not a person at all but a place further circles appeared here and there on the map cambridge norwich ipswich bury st edmunds routes were traced out from each of these to porthill green and from porthill green out to the x near mildenhall fen lynley considered the implications attached to the presence of the map as below him he heard sergeant havers making one telephone call after another muttering to herself occasionally when a response displeased her or when she was kept waiting or a line was engaged lynley dropped his eyes to the second map on the wall this was handdrawn and rough a pencilled depiction of a village with buildings common to any spot in england they were only identified in the most generic of terms as church greengrocers pub cottage petrol station the map told him nothing unless of course it was a rough delineation of porthill green and even then it only indicated joys interest in the spot not why she was interested or what she would have done had she gone there lynley gave his attention to her desk like everything else in the room it had the appearance of disordered confusion of the sort in which the originator of the mess knows exactly where everything is but of which no other human being could ever make sense books maps notebooks and papers covered its surface as well as an unwashed teacup several pens a stapler and a tube of heatproducing analgesic to be rubbed on tired muscles he considered it for several minutes as havers voice continued its rise and fall of conversation below him there had to be some strange system involved lynley thought looking through it and it wasnt too long before he understood what it was although the piles of material made no superficial sense as a whole taken individually they were perfectly rational one stack of books seemed to be reference materials there were three psychology texts dealing with depression and suicide two textbooks on the workings of the british police another stack was a collection of newspaper articles all detailing one sort of death or another a third stack contained a collection of booklets and pamphlets describing various sections of the country a last stack was correspondence thick and probably gone unanswered he looked through this ignoring the fan letters working on instinct hoping it would guide him to something signifi cant he found it thirteen letters into the stack it was a brief note from joy sinclairs editor fewer than ten sentences long when the editor asked might we expect to see the fi rst draft of hangings too good youre six months overdue on it and as your contract stipulates suddenly everything on joys desk began to take on a marked coherence the texts on suicide the workings of the police the articles about death the title of a new book lynley felt the tightening of excitement that always came with knowing he was on the right track he turned back to the word processor it had two disks in it he saw both a program disk and one that would contain joys work havers he shouted what do you know about computers a minute she returned ive got her voice lowered as she spoke into the phone impatiently lynley switched the machine on in a moment directions appeared on the screen it was far simpler than he would have ever imagined within a minute he was looking at joys working copy of hangings too good unfortunately the sum total of her manuscriptsix months overdue to her publishers and no doubt the cause of her dispute with themwas one simple sentence hannah decided to kill herself on the night of march that was it fruitlessly lynley searched for something else using every direction that the computer program had to offer him but nothing was there either her work had been erased or that single sentence was as far as joy sinclair had gone no wonder her editor is frothing at the mouth and talking about legal action lynley thought he switched the machine off and gave his attention back to her desk he spent the next ten minutes trying to fi nd something more in the material there failing that he went to her filing cabinet and began searching through its four drawers he was on his second one when havers came into the room anything she asked him a book called hangings too good someone named hannah who decided to commit suicide and a place called porthill green p green i should guess what about you ive begun to get the feeling that no one goes to work in new york much before noon but i was able to find out that the new york number was for a literary agent and the others the somerset call was to stinhursts home what about the letter from edna did you telephone the publishing house about it havers nodded joy sold a proposal to them early last year she wanted to do something different not a study of a criminal and victim which was her usual bent but a study of a suicide what led up to it and its aftereffects the publisher bought the proposal theyve not had to worry about her meeting deadlines before this but that was the end of it she never gave them a thing theyve been after her for months in fact the reaction to her death sounded as if one of them may have been praying for it on a nightly basis what about the other numbers the number in suffolk was an interesting one havers replied a boy answered sounded like a teenager but he didnt have the slightest idea who joy sinclair was or why she might have been phoning his number so whats so interesting about that his name inspector teddy darrow his fathers name is john and he was speaking to me from a pub called wines the plough and that pub is sitting right in the middle of porthill green lynley grinned felt that swift surge of power that comes from validation by god havers sometimes i think were one hell of a team were onto it now cant you feel it havers didnt respond she was browsing through the material on the desk so weve found the john darrow that joy talked about both at dinner and on her tape lynley mused weve the explanation for the reference on her calendar to p green weve the reason for the matchbook in her shoulder bagshe must have been in the pub and now were looking for a connection between joys book and john darrow between john darrow and westerbrae he looked at havers sharply but there was another set of phone calls wasnt there to wales lynley watched her leaf through the newspaper clippings on the desk in an apparent need to scrutinise each one of them she didnt appear to be reading however they were to llanbister to a woman called anghared mynach why did joy phone her again there was hesitation she was looking for someone sir lynleys eyes narrowed he closed the fi ling drawer whose contents he had been examining who havers frowned rhys daviesjones anghared mynach is his sister he was staying with her barbara saw in lynleys face the swift assimilation of a series of ideas she knew quite well the set of facts he was combining in his mind the name john darrow that was mentioned at dinner the night joy sinclair was murdered the reference to rhys daviesjones on joys tape recorder the ten telephone calls to porthill green and mixed in with those calls six to wales six calls made to rhys daviesjones to avoid a discussion of all of this barbara went to the pile of manuscripts lying near the study door she began riffling through them curiously noting the range of joy sinclairs interest in murder and death an outline for a study of the yorkshire ripper an unfi nished article on crippen at least sixty pages of material on lord mountbattens death a bound galley from a book called the knife plunges once three heavily edited versions of another book called death in darkness but there was something missing as lynley involved himself again with the filing cabinet barbara went to the desk she opened the top drawer in it joy had kept her computer disks two long rows of fl oppy black squares all labelled by subject on the upper righthand corner barbara fl ipped through them reading the titles and as she did so the knowledge began to fl ourish within her like a growth that was swelling not with malignancy but with tension the second and third drawers were much the same containing stationery envelopes ribbons for the printers staples ancient carbon paper tape scissors but not what she was looking for nothing like that at all when lynley moved to the bookshelves and began looking through the materials there barbara went to the fi ling cabinet ive been through that sergeant lynley said she sought an excuse just a hunch sir itll only take a moment the fact was that it took nearly an hour but by that time lynley had removed the jacket from a copy of joy sinclairs most recent book putting this into his pocket before going on into the bedroom and from there to the storage cabinet at the top of the stairs where barbara could hear him rooting systematically through the assortment of belongings it was after four oclock when she concluded her search of the files and rested back on her heels satisfied with the validity of her hypothesis her only decision now was whether to tell lynley or to hold her tongue until she had more facts facts that he would be incapable of brushing aside why she wondered had he not noticed it himself how could he possibly have missed it with the glaring absence of material right before his eyes he was seeing only what he wanted to see what he needed to see a trail of guilt leading directly to rhys daviesjones this guilt was so seductive a presence that it had become for lynley an effective smokescreen hiding the one crucial detail that he had failed to note joy sinclair had been in the midst of writing a play for stuart rintoul lord stinhurst and nowhere in the study was there a single reference to it not a draft not an outline not a list of characters not a scrap of paper someone had been through the house before them ill drop you in acton sergeant lynley said when they were back outside he headed down the street towards his car a silver bentley that had collected a small group of admiring schoolboys who were peering into its windows and running pious hands along its gleaming wings lets plan on an early start out to porthill green tomorrow half past seven fine sir but dont bother about acton ill catch the tube its just up on the corner of heath street and the high lynley paused turned back to her dont be ridiculous barbara thatll take an age a change of stations and god only knows how many stops get in the car barbara heard it as the order it was and looked for a way to deflect it without raising his ire she couldnt possibly waste the time of having him drive her all the way home her day was far from over in spite of what he thought without considering how unlikely it would sound to him she took a stab with the fi rst excuse that came into her mind actually ive a date sir she said and then knowing how ridiculous the idea was she smoothed over the absurdity with well its not a date exactly its someone ive met and we thoughtwell perhaps wed have dinner and see that new film at the odeon she winced inwardly at that last piece of creativity and took a moment to pray that there was a new film at the odeon or at least if there wasnt that he wouldnt be the wiser oh i see well anyone i know hell she thought no just a bloke i met last week at the supermarket actually we banged trolleys somewhere between tinned fruit and tea lynley smiled at that sounds exactly the way a meaningful relationship starts shall i drop you at the tube no i could do with the walk ill see you tomorrow sir he nodded and she watched him stride towards his car in an instant he was surrounded by the eager children who had been admiring it this your car mister how much it cost those seats leather cn i drive it barbara heard lynley laugh saw him lean against the car fold his arms and take a moment to engage the group in friendly conversation how like him she thought hes had all of three hours sleep in the last thirtythree hes facing the fact that half of his world may be as good as in ruins and still he takes the time to listen to childrens chatter watching him with themfancying from this distance that she could see the lines of laughter round his eyes and the quirky muscle that crooked his smileshe found herself wondering what she might actually be capable of doing to protect the career and integrity of a man like that anything she decided and began her walk to the tube snow was falling when barbara arrived at the st james home on cheyne row in chelsea that evening at eight in the tawny glow of the street lamps snowflakes looked like slivers of amber floating down to blanket pavement cars and the intricate wrought iron of balconies and fencesthe flurry was mild by way of winter storms but even so enough to snarl the traffic on the embankment a block away the usual roar of passing cars was considerably muted and the occasional horn honking in a burst of temper explained why joseph cotter who played the unusual dual role of manservant and fatherinlaw in st james life answered the door to barbaras knock he was she guessed no older than fifty a balding man of short solid physique so physically unlike his willowy daughter that for some time after she had first met deborah st james barbara had had no idea that she was even related to this man he was carrying a coffee service on a silver tray and doing his best to avoid trampling a small longhaired dachshund and a plump grey cat who were vying for attention at his feet all of them threw grotesquely shaped shadows against the dark panelling on the wall off wi you peach alaska he said before he turned his ruddy face to greet barbara the animals retreated a respectable six inches come in misssergeant mr st james is in the study he looked barbara over critically ave you eaten yet young lady those two ave only finished just now let me get you a bite in a tick shall i thank you mr cotter i could do with something i havent had a thing since this morning im afraid cotter shook his head police he said in brief and eloquent disapproval you just wait in ere miss ill fix you up something nice he knocked once on the door at the foot of the stairs and without waiting for a response swung it open barbara followed him into st james study a room of tall crowded bookshelves scores of photographs and intellectual jumble one of the most pleasant locations in the cheyne row house a fire had been lit and the rooms mixed odours of leather and brandy formed a comfortable redolence not unlike that one might find in a gentlemans club st james occupied a chair by the hearth his bad leg resting upon a worn ottoman while across from him lady helen clyde was curled into a corner of the couch they were sitting quietly in the manner of an old married couple or of friends too close to need the bridge of conversation eres the sergeant now mr st james cotter said bustling forward with the coffee which he set down on a low table in front of the fire flames there cast a glow against the porcelain flickered like moving gold in a refl ection on the tray an shes not ad a bite to eat so ill see to that at once if youll do the coffee on your own i think we can manage that without disgracing you more than two or three times cotter and if theres any chocolate cake left would you cut another piece for lady helen shes longing to have one but you know how she is far too well bred to ask for more hes lying as usual lady helen interjected its for himself but he knows how youll disapprove cotter looked from one to the other undeceived by their exchange two pieces of chocolate cake he said meaningfully an a meal for the sergeant as well flicking at the arm of his black jacket he left the room you look about done in st james said to barbara when cotter was gone we all look done in lady helen added coffee barbara at least ten cups she replied she tugged off her coat and knit cap tossed them down on the couch and walked to the fire to thaw out her numb fingers its snowing lady helen shuddered after this past weekend those are the last two words i look forward to hearing she handed st james a cup of coffee and poured out two more i do hope your day was more productive than mine barbara after spending five hours exploring geoffrey rintouls past ive begun to feel as though im working for one of those committees in the vatican who recommend candidates for canonisation she smiled at st james can you bear to hear it all again i long to he replied it allows me to examine my own disreputable past and feel suitable guilt over it as well you should lady helen returned to the couch shaking back a few feathery strands of hair that fell against her cheek she slipped off her shoes curled her legs underneath her and sipped her coffee even in exhaustion she was graceful barbara noticed utterly confi dent completely at ease being in her presence was always an exercise in feeling ungainly and decidedly unattractive and observing the womans understated elegance barbara wondered how st james wife placidly endured the fact that her husband and lady helen worked side by side three days each week in his forensic laboratory on the top floor of the house lady helen reached for her handbag and pulled from it a small black notebook after several hours with debretts and burkes and landed gentrynot to mention a fortyminute stretch on the telephone with my father who knows everything about everyone whos ever had a titleive managed to come up with a rather remarkable portrait of our geoffrey rintoul let me see she opened the notebook and her eyes skimmed down the first page born november his father was francis rintoul fourteenth earl of stinhurst and his mother was astrid selvers an american debutante in the fashion of the vanderbilts who apparently had the audacity to die in leaving francis with three small children to raise he did so with outstanding success considering geoffreys accomplishments he never remarried never it doesnt even appear that he engaged in discreet affairs either but sexual disinclination seems to run in the family as you shall note momentarily how does that fit barbara asked considering the affair between geoffrey and his sisterinlaw a possible inconsistency st james acknowledged lady helen continued geoffrey was educated at harrow and cambridge graduated from cambridge in with a first in economics and assorted honours in speech and debate which went on and on forever but he didnt come to anyones particular attention until october of and really he appeared to be the most astonishing man he was fi ghting with montgomery at the twelveday battle at el alamein in north africa his rank captain he was part of a tank crew apparently in one of the worst days of the fighting his tank was hit incapacitated and ignited by a german shell geoffrey managed to get two wounded men out dragging them more than a mile to safety all in spite of the fact that he was wounded himself he was awarded the victoria cross hardly the sort of man one expects to fi nd buried in an isolated grave barbara commented and theres more lady helen said at his own request and in spite of the severity of his wounds that could well have put him out of action for the remainder of the war he fi nished it up in the allied front in the balkans churchill was trying to preserve some british influence there in the face of potential russian predominance and evidently geoffrey was a churchill man through and through when he came home he moved into a job in whitehall working for the ministry of defence im surprised a man like that didnt stand for parliament he was asked repeatedly but he wouldnt do it and he never married no st james made a movement in his chair and lady helen held out a hand to stop him she rose herself and poured him a second cup of coffee without a word she merely frowned when he used the sugar too heavily and took the sugar bowl from him entirely when he dipped a spoon into it for the fi fth time was he homosexual barbara asked if he was then he was discretion itself which applies to any affairs he may have had not a whisper of scandal about him anywhere not even anything that attaches him to lord stinhursts wife marguerite rintoul absolutely not hes too good to be true st james remarked what do you have barbara as she was about to pull her own notebook from the pocket of her coat cotter entered with the promised food cake for st james and lady helen and a platter of cold meats cheeses and bread for barbara with she saw a third piece of cake to end her improvised meal she smiled her thanks and cotter gave her a friendly wink checked the coffeepot and disappeared through the door his footsteps sounded on the stairs in the hall eat first lady helen advised with this chocolate cake in front of me im afraid i shall be markedly distracted from anything you say we can go on when youve fi nished your dinner with a grateful nod for the nicely veiled understanding so typical of lady helen barbara fell upon the food eagerly devouring three pieces of meat and two large wedges of cheese like a prisoner of war finally with the cake before her and another cup of coffee she pulled out her notebook a few hours browsing through the public library and all i could find is that geoffreys death appeared to be an entirely straightforward affair most of this is from the newspaper accounts of the inquest there was a tremendous storm on the night he died at westerbrae or actually in the early morning hours of january that much is believable considering what the weather was like this last weekend lady helen noted according to the officer in charge of the investigationan inspector glencalviethe section of the road where the accident occurred was sheeted with ice rintoul lost control on the switchback went right over the side and rolled the car several times he wasnt thrown out apparently not but his neck was broken and his body was burned lady helen turned to st james at this but couldnt that mean no bodyswapping in this day and age helen he interrupted no doubt they had dental charts and x rays to identify him was anyone a witness to the accident barbara the closest they could get to a witness was the owner of hillview farm he heard the crash and was first on the scene and he is hugh kilbride gowans father they ruminated upon this information for a moment the fire crackled and popped as the flames reached a hard bubble of sap so i kept thinking barbara went on slowly what did gowan really mean when he said those two words didnt see to us of course at fi rst i thought it had something to do with joys death but perhaps it didnt at all perhaps it referred to something his father had told him a secret he was keeping its a possibility to be sure and theres something else she told them about her search through joy sinclairs study about the absence of any materials that referred to the play she had been writing for lord stinhurst st james interest was piqued was there any sign of forcible entry to the house none that i noticed could someone else have had a key lady helen asked then went on to say but thats not quite right is it everyone with an interest in the play was at westerbrae so how could her houseunless someone rushed back to london and managed to get everything out of the study before you arrived yet that doesnt seem at all likely does it or even possible besides who would have a key irene i imagine robert gabriel perhaps even barbara hesitated rhys lady helen asked barbara felt a stirring of discomfort she could read worlds into the manner in which lady helen had said the mans name possibly there were a number of phone calls to him on her telephone bill they were interspersed with calls to a place called porthill green her loyalty to lynley prevented her from saying anything else the ice she was walking on in this private investigation was insubstantial enough without giving lady helen any information which she might inadvertently or deliberately pass on to someone else but lady helen required no further information and tommy thinks that porthill green somehow gives rhys a motive for murder of course hes looking for a motive he told me as much and yet none of this takes us any closer to understanding joys play does it st james looked at barbara vassal he said does that mean anything to you she frowned feudalism and fi efs should it mean something more its somehow connected to all of this lady helen answered its the only part of the play that stuck in my mind why because it made no sense to anyone but the members of geoffrey rintouls family and it made perfect sense to them they reacted when they heard the character say that he wasnt about to become another vassal it seemed to be some sort of familial code word that only they understood barbara sighed so where do we go from here neither st james nor lady helen had an answer for her they fell into several minutes of meditation that were broken by the sound of the front door opening and a young womans pleasant voice calling dad im home absolutely freezing and in desperate need of food ill eat anything even steak and kidney pie so you can see how immediately in danger of starvation i am her light laughter followed cotters voice replied sternly from one of the upper floors your usbands eaten every crumb in the ouse luv and thatll teach you to leave the poor man to is own devices all these hours whats the world comin to simon hes home so soon footsteps sounded hurriedly in the hall the study door burst open and deborah st james said eagerly my love you didnt she stopped abruptly when she saw the other women her eyes went to her husband and she pulled off a beret the colour of cream loosing an undisciplined mass of coppery red hair she was dressed in business clothesa fine coat of ivory wool over a grey suitand she carried a large metal camera case which she set down near the door ive been doing a wedding she explained and together with the reception i thought id never escape youre all of you back from scotland so soon whats happened a smile broke over st james face he held out his hand and his wife crossed the room to him i know exactly why i married you deborah he said kissing her warmly tangling his hand in her hair photographs and i always thought it was because you were absolutely mad for my perfume she replied crossly not a bit of it st james pushed himself out of his chair and went to his desk there he rooted through a large drawer and pulled out a telephone directory which he opened quickly whatever are you doing lady helen asked him deborahs just given us the answer to barbaras question st james replied where do we go from here to photographs he reached for the telephone and if they exist jeremy vinney is the one man who can get them porthill green was a village that looked as if it had grown like an unnatural protuberance out of the peatrich earth of the east anglian fens close to the centre of a rough triangle created by the suffolk and cambridgeshire towns of brandon mildenhall and ely the village was not a great deal more than the intersection of three narrow lanes that wound through fi elds of sugar beets traversing chalky brown canals by means of bridges barely the width of a single car it sat in a landscape largely given over to the colours grey brown and greenfrom the cheerless winter sky to the loamy fi elds dotted irregularly by patchy snow to the vegetation that bordered the lanes in thick abundance the village possessed little to recommend itself nine buildings of knapped flint and four of plaster carelessly halftimbered in a drunken pattern lined the high street those that were places of business announced that fact with signs of chipped and sooty paint a lone petrol station with pumps that appeared to be fabricated largely from rust and glass stood sentry on the outskirts of the village and at the end of the high street marked by a weathersmoothed celtic cross lay a circle of dirty snow under which no doubt grew the grass for which the village was named lynley parked here for the green lay directly across from wines the plough a building no different from any of the other sagging structures on the street he examined it while next to him sergeant havers buttoned her coat beneath her chin and gathered her notebook and shoulder bag lynley could see that originally the pub had simply been called the plough and that on either side of its name had been fi xed the words wines and liquors the latter had fallen off sometime in the past however leaving merely a dark patch on the wall where the word had once been the shape of its letters still legible rather than replace liquors or even repaint the building for that matter to the first word had been added an apostrophe by means of a tin mug nailed into the plaster thus the building was renamed no doubt to someones amusement its the same village sergeant lynley said after a cursory examination through the windscreen aside from a livercoloured mongrel sniffing along an illformed hedge the place might have been abandoned same as what sir as that drawing posted in joy sinclairs study the petrol station the greengrocers theres the cottage set back behind the church as well shed been here long enough to become familiar with the place ive no doubt someone will remember her you take care of the high while i have a word with john darrow havers reached for the door handle with a sigh of resignation always the footwork she groused good exercise to clear your head after last night she looked at him blankly last night dinner film the chap from the supermarket oh that havers said fidgeting in her seat believe me it was very forgettable sir she got out of the car letting in a gust of air that commingled the faint odours of the sea dead fish and rotting debris and strode over to the first building disappearing behind its weathered black door by pub hours it was early yet the drive from london having taken them less than two hours so lynley was not surprised to fi nd the door locked when he tried to enter wines the plough across the street he stepped back from the building and looked above to what seemed to be a flat but his observation gained him nothing limp curtains served as a barrier against prying eyes no one was about at all and there was no automobile or motorbike to indicate that the building was currently under anyones ownership nonetheless when lynley peered through the grimy windows of the pub itself a missing slat in one of the shutters revealed a light shining in a far doorway that appeared to lead to the buildings cellar stairs he returned to the door and knocked upon it soundly within moments he heard heavy footsteps they trudged to the door not opened a mans gravelly voice said behind it mr darrow aye would you open the door please yr business is scotland yard cid that got a reaction although not much of one the door was unbolted and held open a mere six or seven inches alls in order in here eyes the shape and size of hazel nuts the colour of a brown gone bad with yellow dropped to the identification that lynley held may i come in darrow didnt look up as he considered the request and the limited responses available to him not about teddy is it your son no its nothing to do with him apparently satisfied the man held the door open wider stepped back and admitted lynley into the pub it was a humble establishment in keeping with the village it served its sole decoration appeared to be a variety of unlit signs behind and above the formicatopped bar identifying the liquors sold on the premises there was very little furniture half a dozen small tables surrounded by stools and a bench running beneath the front windows this was padded but the cushion was sunbleached from its original red to rusty pink and dark stains patterned it a stinging burnt smell tinctured the air a combination of cigarette smoke a dead fire in a blackened fi replace and windows too long closed against the winter weather darrow positioned himself behind the bar perhaps with the intention of treating lynley like a customer in spite of the hour and his police identification for his part lynley followed suit in front of it although it meant standing and he would much rather have conducted this interview at one of the tables darrow he guessed was in his midforties a roughlooking man who projected a decided air of suppressed violence he was built like a boxer squat with long powerful limbs a barrel chest and incongruously small wellshaped ears which lay flat against his skull his clothes suited him they suggested a man able to make the transition from publican to brawler in the time it would take to ball up a fist he wore a wool shirt with cuffs turned up to reveal hirsute arms and a pair of loosefitting trousers for ease of movement evaluating all this lynley doubted that any fi st fi ghts broke out in wines the plough unless darrow himself provoked them he had in his pocket the jacket of death in darkness which he had taken from joy sinclairs study removing it he folded it so that the authors smiling photograph was facing up do you know this woman he asked recognition flickered unmistakably in darrows eyes i know her what of it she was murdered three nights ago i was here three nights ago darrow replied his tone was surly saturdays my busiest anyone in the villagell tell you as much it wasnt at all the reaction lynley had been expecting perhaps surprise perhaps confusion perhaps reserve but a refl ex denial of culpability that was unusual to say the least shes been here to see you lynley stated she telephoned this pub ten times in the last month what of it i expect you to tell me that the publican seemed to be evaluating the even quality of lynleys voice he appeared disconcerted that his show of belligerent uncooperation produced virtually no reaction in the london detective i was having none of her he said she wanted to write a fl ipping book about hannah lynley asked the tightening of darrows jaw tensed every muscle in his face aye hannah he went to an upturned bottle of bushmills black label and pushed a glass against its spigot he drained the whisky not in a single gulp but in two or three slow swallows all taken with his back to lynley have one he asked drawing himself another no the man nodded drank again she came out of nowhere he said bringing a clutch of newspaper clippings about this and that book that shed written and going on about awards shed received andi dont know what else and she plain expected me to give her hannah and be thankful for the attention well i wouldnt i wasnt having it and i wasnt having my teddy exposed to that kind of muck its bad enough with his mum doing herself in and providing the local ladies with gossip till he was ten years old i wasnt about to have it start again raking it all up upsetting the lad hannah was your wife aye my wife how did joy sinclair happen to know about her claimed shed been studying up on suicides for nine or ten months to find one she thought interesting and shed read of hannahs caught her eye she said his voice was sour can you credit that man caught her eye han wasnt a person to her she was a piece of meat so i told her to fuck herself in just those words ten telephone calls suggests that she was rather persistent darrow snorted made no difference she was getting nowhere teddy was too young to know what had happened so she couldnt talk to him and she was getting nothing from me may i take it that without your cooperation there could be no book aye no book nothing and thats the way it was going to stay when she came to see you was she alone aye never anyone with her perhaps someone waiting out in the car darrows eyes narrowed suspiciously they darted to the windows and back what dyou mean it had seemed a straightforward question to lynley he wondered if darrow was temporising did she come with a companion she was always alone your wife killed herself in didnt she did joy sinclair ever give you any indication why a suicide that long ago was of interest to her darrows face darkened his lips curled with loathing she liked the chair inspector she was good enough to tell me that she liked the bleeding chair the chair right han lost a shoe when she kicked over the chair and the woman fancied that she called itpoignant he turned back to the bushmills begging your pardon if i dont particularly care that someone murdered the bitch st james and his wife were both working at their respective interests on the top fl oor of their house st james in his forensic laboratory and deborah in her developing room that adjoined it the door between the two was open and looking up from the report that he was compiling for the defence team in an upcoming trial st james engaged in a moment of simple pleasure watching his wife she was frowning over a collection of her photographs a pencil stuck behind one ear and a mass of curly hair drawn back from her face with a set of combsthe light above glittered against her head like a halo much of the rest of her was in shadow hopeless pathetic she murmured scribbling on the back of one picture and tossing another into a rubbish box at her feet blasted lightgod in heaven deborah where did you learn the basic elements of composition oh lord this is even worse st james laughed at that deborah looked up sorry she said am i distracting you you always distract me my love far too much im afraid and especially when ive been away from you for twentyfour hours or more a faint colour rose in her cheeks well after a year im glad to hear theres a bit of romance left between us isilly though isnt it were you really only gone one night to scotland i missed you simon i fi nd that i dont care for going to bed without you any longer her blush deepened when st james got down from his tall stool and crossed the lab to join her in the semidarkness of the developing room no my lovei really didnt meansimon well get no work done like this she said in insincere protest when he took her into his arms st james laughed quietly said well well get other things done wont we and kissed her a long moment later he murmured appreciatively against her mouth lord yes far more important things i think they parted guiltily at the sound of cotters voice he was pounding up the stairway talking several volumes louder than he usually did just up ere they both are he boomed workin in the lab i should guess debs got er snaps out and mr st james is doin a report o some sort tis just up above not a bit of a climb well be there in a tick this last pronouncement was made louder than all the others deborah laughed when she heard it i never know whether to be appalled or amused by my father she whispered how can he possibly be wise to what were up to all the time he sees the way i look at you and thats evidence enough believe me your father knows exactly what i have on my mind st james dutifully returned to his lab and was writing away upon his report when cotter appeared at the door with jeremy vinney behind him ere you are cotter said expansively bit of a climb that isnt it he cast a look here and there as if to make certain he hadnt caught his daughter and her husband in fl agrante delicto vinney betrayed no surprise at the stentorian manner in which cotter had heralded his arrival rather he came forward a manila folder in one hand his portly face bore the signs and shadows of fatigue and on his jawline ran a thin line of whiskers that hed missed in shaving he had not as yet bothered to take off his overcoat i think i have what you need he said to st james as cotter directed an affectionate scowl at his daughters impish smile before departing perhaps a bit more the fellow who covered geoffrey rintouls inquest in sixtythree is one of our senior editors now so we rooted through his files this morning and came up with three photographs and a set of old notes theyre hardly legible since they were done in pencil but we might be able to make something out of them he gave st james a look that endeavoured to read beneath the surface did stinhurst kill joy is that where youre heading the question was a logical conclusion to everything that had gone before and not an unreasonable one for the journalist to ask but st james was not unaware of what it implied vinney played a triple role in the drama that had occurred at westerbrae as newsman friend of deceased and suspect it was to his advantage to have that last entitlement removed entirely in the eyes of the police to see that suspicion passed on to someone else and after a show of fine journalistic cooperation what better person to see that it was done than st james himself known to be lynleys friend he answered vinney cautiously theres merely a small oddity about geoffrey rintouls death that has us intrigued if the journalist was disappointed with the obliquity of the reply he was careful not to show it yes i see he shrugged out of his overcoat and accepted the introduction to st james wife placing the manila folder onto the lab table he drew out its contents a sheaf of papers and three tattered pictures when he spoke again it was with professional formality the inquest notes are quite complete our man was hoping for a feature on it considering geoffrey rintouls distinguished past so he was careful about the details i think you can rely on his accuracy the notes were written on yellow paper which did not make the faded pencil any easier to read it says something about an argument st james remarked looking them over vinney drew a lab stool over to the table the testimony of the family was fairly straightforward at the inquest old lord stinhurstfrancis rintoul the present earls fathersaid there had been quite a row before geoffrey took off that new years eve a row about what st james scanned for the details as vinney supplied them apparently a semidrunken spat that started delving into the family history that was very close to what lynley had reported of his conversation with the current earl but it was hard for st james to believe that old lord stinhurst would have discussed his two sons love triangle before a coroners jury family loyalty would have precluded that did he give any specifi cs yes vinney pointed to a section midway down the page apparently geoffrey was hot to get back to london and decided to take off that night in spite of the storm his father testified that he didnt want him to go because of the weather because he hadnt seen much of geoffrey for the past six months and wanted to keep him there while he could evidently their recent relationship hadnt been smooth and the old earl saw this new years gathering as a way to heal the breach between them what sort of breach i gathered that the earl had taken geoffrey under considerable fire for not marrying i suppose he wanted geoffrey to feel duty bound to shore up the ancestral house at any rate that was what was at the heart of the trouble in their relationship vinney studied the notes before he went on delicately as if he had come to understand how important a show of impartiality might be when discussing the rintoul family i do get the impression that the old man was used to having things his way so when geoffrey decided to return to london his father lost his temper and the argument grew from there is there any indication why geoffrey wanted to return to london a woman friend that his father wouldnt have approved of or perhaps a relationship with a man that he wanted to keep under wraps there was an odd unaccountable hesitation as if vinney were trying to read st james words for an additional meaning he cleared his throat theres nothing to indicate that no one ever came forward to claim an illicit relationship with him and consider the tabloids if someone had been involved with geoffrey rintoul on the side he or she would probably have come forward and sold the story for a good deal of money once he was dead god knows thats the way things were happening in the early sixties with call girls servicing what seemed like half the top ministers in the government you remember christine keelers tales about john profumo that set the tories reeling so it does seem that if someone geoffrey rintoul was involved with needed the money he or she would merely have followed in keelers footsteps st james responded pensively there is something in what youre saying isnt there perhaps more than we realise john profumo was state secretary for war geoffrey rintoul worked for the ministry of defence rintouls death and inquest were in january the very same month that john profumos sexual relationship with keeler was brewing in the press is there some sort of connection between these people and geoffrey rintoul that were failing to see vinney seemed to warm to the plural pronoun i wanted to think so but if any call girl had been involved with rintoul why would she have held her tongue when the tabloids were willing to pay a fortune for a juicy story about someone in government perhaps it wasnt a call girl at all perhaps rintoul was involved with someone who didnt need the money and certainly wouldnt have benefitted from the disclosure a married woman once again they were back to lord stinhursts original story about his brother and his wife st james pushed past it and the testimony of the others they all supported the old earls story of the argument geoffrey going off in a rage and the accident on the switchback there was something rather odd however the body was badly burned so they had to send to london for x rays and dental charts to use in the formal identification geoffreys physician a man called sir andrew higgins brought them personally he did the examination along with strathclydes pathologist unusual but not out of the range of belief thats not it vinney shook his head sir andrew was a longtime school friend of geoffreys father theyd been at harrow and cambridge together they were in the same london club he died in st james supplied his own conclusion to this new revelation sir andrew may have hidden what needed to be hidden he may have brought forth only what needed to be brought forth yet all the disjointed pieces of information considered the time periodjanuary struck st james as the most relevant item he couldnt have said why he reached for the photographs the first was of a group of blackgarbed people about to climb into a row of parked limousines st james recognised most of them francesca gerrard clinging to the arm of a middleaged man presumably her husband phillip stuart and marguerite rintoul bending over to speak to two bewildered children obviously elizabeth and her older brother alec several people forming a conversational circle on the steps of the building in the background their faces blurry the second picture was of the accident site with its scar of burnt land standing next to it was a roughly dressed farmer a border collie at his side hugh kilbride gowans father st james speculated the first on the scene the last picture was of a group leaving a building most likely the site of the inquest itself once again st james recognised the people he had met at westerbrae but this photograph contained several unfamiliar faces who are these people do you know vinney pointed as he spoke sir andrew higgins is directly behind the old earl of stinhurst next to him is the family solicitor you know the others i presume save this man st james said who is he the man in question was behind and to the right of the old earl of stinhurst his head turned in conversation to stuart rintoul who listened frowning one hand pulling at his chin not a clue vinney said the chap who took the notes for the story might know but i didnt think to ask him shall i take them back and have a go st james thought about it perhaps he said slowly and then turned to the darkroom deborah will you have a look at these please his wife joined them at the table gazing over st james shoulder at the photographs after giving her a moment to evaluate them st james said can you do a set of enlargements from this last one individual pictures of each person mostly each face she nodded theyd be quite grainy of course certainly not the best quality but recognisable shall i set up to do it please yes st james looked at vinney we shall have to see what our current lord stinhurst has to say about these the police in mildenhall had conducted the investigation into hannah darrows suicide raymond plater the investigating offi cer was in fact now the towns chief constable he was a man who wore authority like a suit of clothes into which he had grown more and more comfortable with the passage of time so he was not the least concerned to have scotland yard cid popping up on his doorstep to talk about a case fifteen years closed i remember it all right he said leading lynley and havers into his wellappointed office he adjusted beige venetian blinds in a manner of proud ownership then picked up a telephone dialled three numbers and said plater here will you bring me the fi le on darrow hannah darrow itll be in a closed caseright he swivelled his chair to a table behind his desk and tossed back over his shoulder coffee when the other two accepted his offer plater did the honours with an effi cientlooking coffee maker passing steaming mugs over to them along with milk and sugar he himself drank appreciatively yet with remarkable delicacy for a man so energetic and so fi erce of feature with its implacable jaw and clear nordic eyes his face reflected the savage viking warriors from whom he no doubt had taken his blood youre not the first to come asking about the darrow woman he said leaning back in his chair the writer joy sinclair was here lynley responded and to platers quickly cocked head added she was murdered this past weekend in scotland the chief constables adjustment in position indicated his interest is there a connection merely a gut feeling at the moment did sinclair come to you alone yes persistent she was too arrived without an appointment and as she wasnt a member of the force there was a bit of a wait plater smiled just over two hours as i recall but she put in the time so i went ahead and saw her this wassometime early last month what did she want conversation mostly a look at what we had on the darrow woman ordinarily i wouldnt have made it available to anyone but she had two letters of introduction one from a welsh chief constable shed worked with on a book and another from a detective superintendent somewhere in the south devon perhaps beyond that shed an impressive list of credentialsat least two silver daggers i recallthat she wasnt above showing off to convince me she wasnt hanging about the entrance hall in the hope of an hours natter a deferential knock upon the door heralded a young constable who handed his chief a thick folder and made himself scarce plater opened the folder and drew out a stack of police photographs they were lynley saw standard crimescene work starkly black and white they still depicted death with grim attention to detail going so far as to include an elongated shadow cast by the hanging body of hannah darrow there was little else to see the room was virtually unfurnished with an openbeam ceiling a floor of wide but badly pitted planks and roughhewn wooden walls these appeared to be curved small fourpaned windows their only decoration a plain caneseated chair lay on its side beneath the body and one of her shoes had fallen off and rested against a rung she had not used rope but rather what appeared to be a dark scarf attached to a hook in a ceiling beam and her head hung forward with long blonde hair curtaining the worst distortion of her face lynley scrutinised the photographs one after another feeling a twinge of uncertainty he handed them to havers and watched as she sorted through them but she returned them to plater without remark where were the photographs taken he asked the chief constable she was found in a mill out on mildenhall fen about a mile from the village is the mill still there plater shook his head torn down three or four years past im afraid not that it would do you too much good to see it although his voice was momentarily reflective the sinclair woman asked to see it as well did she lynley asked thoughtfully he wondered about that request and considered what john darrow had told him joy had taken ten months to find the death she wanted to write about are you absolutely certain this was a suicide he asked the chief constable in answer plater riffled through the fi le he brought out a single piece of notebook paper torn in several places it bore the trace of creases from having been crumpled and then pressed in among other papers to smooth it out lynley scanned the few words written in a large childish script with rounded letters and tiny circles used in place of periods and dots i must go its timetheres a tree thats dead but it goes on swaying in the wind with the others so it seems to me that if i die ill still have a part in life one way or another goodbye my darling pretty straightforward that plater commented where was this found on the kitchen table at her home with the pen right beside it inspector who found it her husband evidently she was supposed to help him in the pub that night when she didnt show up he went upstairs to their fl at he saw the note panicked ran out looking for her when he couldnt find her he came back closed the pub and got up a group of men for a proper search she was found in the mill plater referred to the file shortly after midnight who found her her husband accompanied he noted hastily when he saw lynley start to speak by two blokes from the village who were no particular friends of his plater smiled affably i expect youre thinking what we all thought at first inspector that darrow lured his wife out to the mill strung her up and fashioned the note himself but we checked on that angle the notes genuine enough our writing people verify that and although both their prints were on the paperhannahs and her husbandshis are explained away easily enough hed picked up the paper from the kitchen table where shed left it for him hardly questionable behaviour under the circumstances besides hannah darrow was wearing plenty of ballast that night to make certain she did the job right and proper she had on two wool coats and two heavy sweaters and you cant tell me her husband talked her into going for an evening stroll all done up like that the agincourt theatre was tucked between two far more impressive structures on a narrow street off shaftesbury avenue to its left was the royal standard hotel complete with a uniformed doorman who scowled at pedestrians and traffic alike to its right was the museum of theatrical history its front windows filled with a dazzling display of elizabethan costumes weaponry and props sandwiched between these two the agincourt had the appearance of neglect and disrepair qualities disproved the moment one walked through its doors when lady helen clyde entered shortly before noon she paused in surprise the last time she had seen a production here the building had been under different ownership and although its former gloomy victorian interior had possessed a certain dickensian charm lord stinhursts renovation was breathtaking she had read about it in the paper of course but nothing had prepared her for such a metamorphosis stinhurst had given both architects and designers free rein in orchestrating the theatres improvements following a noholdsbarred philosophy of interior design they had gutted the building completely achieving light and space through their creation of an entrance that soared with three full floors of open balconies and through their use of colours that contrasted sharply with the sootcovered exterior which the building presented to the street admiring the wealth of creativity that had altered the theatre lady helen allowed herself to forget some of the trepidation with which she had been anticipating her coming interview with sergeant havers and st james she had gone over the details until nearly midnight together the three of them had explored every avenue of approach for this visit to the agincourt since havers was unable to get to the theatre without lynleys knowledge and do the job properly under the aegis of the police it was left to the devices of either lady helen or st james to encourage lord stinhursts secretary to talk about the telephone calls which her employer claimed she had placed for him on the morning that joy sinclairs body was found their late night discussion ended with a consensus that lady helen was the likeliest one among them to encourage an offering of confidences from anyone all that had sounded reasonable enough at midnighteven a bit complimentary if one wanted to take it that waybut it was far from reassuring right now with the agincourts offices a mere ten steps away and stinhursts secretary waiting unwittingly in one of them helen have you come to join the newest fray rhys daviesjones was standing at the auditorium door a mug in his hand lady helen smiled and joined him at the bar where coffee was brewing noisily emitting a pungent smell that was in large part chicory worst coffee in the world daviesjones acknowledged but one develops a taste for it over time will you have some when she declined he poured himself a mug the liquid was black resembling overused motor oil what newest fray she asked him perhaps fray isnt the best choice of words he admitted its more like political manoeuvring among our tender players for the best part in stinhursts new production with the only difficulty being that the play hasnt been decided upon yet so you can well imagine the jockeying for position thats been going on for the last two hours new production lady helen asked you dont mean that lord stinhurst intends to go on with a play after whats happened to joy and gowan he has no choice helen were all of us under contract to him the theatres due to open in less than eight weeks its a new production or he loses his shirt i cant say hes at all happy about it however and hes going to be a good sight unhappier the moment the press start storming him about what happened to joy i cant think why the media havent picked up on the story he touched lady helens hand lightly where it lay on the bar thats why youre here isnt it she hadnt thought she would see him hadnt considered what she might say if she did unprepared for his question she answered with the first thing that came into her mind not even thinking for the moment about why she was lying actually no i found myself in the neighbourhood i thought you might be here so i took the chance of dropping in his eyes remained perfectly steady on her own but they managed to convey how ridiculous her story sounded he was not the kind of man who wanted his ego massaged by an attractive woman seeking him out nor was she the kind of woman who would ever do so he knew that quite well right yes i see he studied his coffee moved the mug from one hand to the other when he spoke again it was with an altered tone one deliberately light and unaffected come into the auditorium then theres not much to see since weve got virtually nothing at all done but there have been sparks aplenty joannas been harassing david sydeham all morning with an endless list of complaints that she wants him to handle and gabriels been attempting to pour oil on their troubled waters hes managed to alienate nearly everyone present but most particularly irene the meeting may well turn into a brawl yet it does have some amusement value will you join us after the manufactured excuse for her presence at the theatre lady helen knew she could hardly refuse so she followed him into the dark auditorium and took a seat in the very last row he smiled at her politely and began to walk towards the brightly lit stage where the players lord stinhurst and several other people were gathered round a table their voices raised in discussion rhys she called when he turned back to her she said may i see you tonight it was part contrition and part desire but which was the greater and more pressing she could not have said she knew only that she couldnt leave him today on a lie im sorry but i cant helen ive a meeting with stuartlord stinhurst about the new production oh yes of course i wasnt thinking then perhaps sometime tomorrow night for dinner if youre free if thats what you want iyes yes its what i want truly he stood in shadow so she could not see his face she could only hear his words and the fragile core of tenderness behind them the timbre of his voice told her the cost of his speaking at all helen i woke up this morning knowing with perfect certainty that i love you so much god help me but i dont understand why no other moment in my life has ever been quite as frightening rhys no please tell me tomorrow he turned decisively and walked down the aisle up the steps to join the others left alone lady helen forced her eyes to remain on the stage but her thoughts would not instead they attached themselves stubbornly to a reflection on loyalty if this encounter with rhys were a test of her devotion to him she saw that without even thinking she had failed it miserably and she wondered if that momentary failure meant the very worst if in her heart she questioned what rhys had really done two nights ago while she was asleep at westerbrae the very thought was devastating she despised herself getting to her feet she returned to the entrance hall and approached the offi ce doors she decided against an elaborate fabrication she would face stinhursts secretary with the truth that commitment to honesty would in this case be a wise decision its the chair havers lynley was saying once again possibly for the fourth or fifth time the afternoon was growing unbearably cold a frigid wind had swept in from the wash and was tearing across the fens unbroken by woodland or hills lynley made the turn back towards porthill green just as barbara concluded her third examination of the suicide photographs and replaced them in the darrow file that chief constable plater had loaned them she shook her head inwardly as far as she could tell the case he was building was more than tenuous it was virtually nonexistent i dont see how you can possibly reach any viable conclusion from looking at a picture of a chair she said then you look at it again if she hanged herself how would she tip the chair onto its side it couldnt have been done she could have kicked at the back of it or even turned it sideways and still kicked at the back of it but in either case the chair would have fallen onto its back not onto its side the only way for the chair to end up in that position at hannah darrows own doing would be if she had twisted her foot into the space between the seat and the back and actually tried to toss the thing it could have happened she was missing a shoe barbara reminded him indeed but she was missing her right shoe havers and if you look again youll see that the chair was tipped over to her left barbara saw that he was determined to win her to his way of thinking there seemed little point to a further protest nonetheless she felt compelled to argue so what youre saying is that joy sinclair in innocently researching a book about a suicide fell upon a murder instead how out of all the suicides in the country how could she possibly have stumbled onto one that was a murder good god what do you think the odds are for doing that but consider why she was attracted to hannah darrows death in the fi rst place havers look at all the oddities involved that would have made it stand out glaringly in comparison to any others she looked at the location the fens a system of canals periodic fl oods land reclaimed from the sea all the natural characteristics that have made it the inspiration of everyone from dickens to dorothy sayers how did joy describe it on her tape the sound of frogs and pumps the unremittingly flat land then theres the site of the suicide an old abandoned mill the bizarre clothing she was wearing two wool coats over two wool sweaters and then the inconsistency that surely must have struck joy the moment she saw those police photos the position of that chair if it is an inconsistency how do you explain the fact that plater himself overlooked it during the investigation he doesnt exactly seem to be your bumbling lestrade type by the time plater got there all the men from the pub had been searching for hannah all of them convinced that they were looking for a suicide and when they found her and telephoned for the police they reported a suicide plater was predisposed to believe thats exactly what he was looking at when he got to the mill so hed lost objectivity before he ever saw the body and he was given fairly convincing evidence that hannah darrow had indeed intended to kill herself when she left her fl at the note but you heard plater say it was genuine enough of course its genuine lynley said im certain its her handwriting then how do you explain good god havers look at the thing is there a single misspelled word in it is there a point of punctuation that she even missed barbara took it out glanced at it turned to lynley are you trying to say that this is something hannah darrow copied why was she practising her handwriting acting out of sheer boredom life in porthill green looks like it might be less than ducky but i dont exactly see a village girl whiling away her time by improving her script and even if she did are you going to argue that darrow found this note somewhere and realised how he could use it that he had the foresight to stow it away until the time was right that he put it out on the kitchen table that hewhat killed his wife how when and how did he get her to wear all those clothes and even if he managed it all without raising anyones suspicion how on earth is he connected to westerbrae and joy sinclairs death through the telephone calls lynley said wales and suffolk over and over joy sinclair innocently telling her cousin rhys daviesjones about her frustrations in dealing with john darrow not to mention her budding suspicions about hannahs death and daviesjones biding his time suggesting that joy arrange to have a room next to helen then fi nishing her off the moment he saw his chance barbara heard him incredulous once again she saw how he was turning and interpreting all the facts skillfully using only what he needed to take him closer to an arrest of daviesjones why she demanded in exasperation because theres a connection between darrow and daviesjones i dont know what it is yet perhaps an old relationship perhaps a debt to be paid perhaps mutual knowledge but whatever it is were getting closer to fi nding it wines the plough was just minutes short of its midafternoon closing when lynley and havers entered john darrow made no secret of his displeasure at seeing them closing he barked lynley ignored the mans implied refusal to speak with them instead he approached the bar opened the file and took out hannah darrows suicide note next to him havers flipped open her notebook darrow watched all this with his mouth pressed into a hostile line tell me about this lynley suggested passing the note across to him the man gave it a moments sullen cursory attention but he said nothing instead he began gathering the pint glasses that lined the bar dousing them furiously into a pan of murky water beneath it how much education did your wife have mr darrow did she finish school did she go to university or was she selfeducated a great reader perhaps darrows scowling face revealed a stumbling search through lynleys words for a trap apparently not finding one he said shortly hannah didnt hold with books shed had enough of school at fi fteen i see but interested in the fens was she the plant life and such the mans lips moved in a quick snarl of contempt what dyou want with me pommy boy have your say and get out she writes here about trees and a tree that died but still sways in the wind rather poetic wouldnt you say even for a suicide message what is this note really darrow when did your wife write it why did she where did you find it there was no reply wordlessly darrow continued washing glasses they clanked and scraped angrily against the metal pan on the night she died you left the pub why i went looking for her id been up to the flat found thatdarrows sharp nod indicated the notein the kitchen went out to fi nd her where the village knocking on doors looking in sheds searching through houses no she wasnt likely to kill herself in someones house now was she and you knew for a certainty that she was going to kill herself it bloody well says that indeed where did you look for her here and there i dont remember its fi fteen years past i didnt heed it at the time and its buried now am i clear on that man its buried it was buried lynley acknowledged quite successfully so i should guess but then joy sinclair came here and began an exhumation and it looks very much as if someone was afraid of that why did she telephone you so many times darrow what did she want darrow swung both arms up from the dishwater irately he slammed them onto the bar ive told you the bitch wanted to talk about hannah but i was having none of it i didnt want her raking up the past and mucking about with our lives were over it god damn you were going to stay that way now get out of here or make a fucking arrest regarding the other man calmly lynley made no reply so the implication behind darrows last statement grew with every moment his face began to mottle the veins in his arms seemed to swell an arrest lynley repeated odd that you should suggest that mr darrow why on earth should i want to make an arrest for a suicide except we both know dont we that this wasnt a suicide and i believe that joy sinclairs mistake was telling you that it didnt much look like a suicide to her get out darrow roared lynley took his time about gathering the materials back into the folder well be back he said pleasantly by four oclock that afternoon the company assembled at the agincourt theatre had after seven hours of politics and debate settled on a playwright for the theatres opening production tennessee williams a revival piece the play itself was still open to discussion from the back of the auditorium st james observed the group on the stage they had narrowed the field down to the relative merits of three possibilities and from what st james could tell things were swinging in joanna ellacourts direction she was arguing strongly against a streetcar named desire her aversion to it rising it seemed out of a quick calculation of how much stage time irene sinclair would have if however incongruously she played stella there appeared to be no doubt at all as to the casting of blanche dubois lord stinhurst had been displaying a remarkable degree of patience for the quarter hour that st james had been watching in an unusual display of magnanimity he had allowed all the players the designers the director and the assistants to have their say about the crisis facing the company and the pressing need to get into production as soon as possible now he got to his feet kneading his fingers into the small of his back youll have my decision tomorrow he told them weve been together long enough for now lets meet again in the morning at half past nine be ready to read no hints for us stuart joanna ellacourt asked stretching languorously and leaning back in her chair so that her hair fell like a shimmering gold veil in the light next to her robert gabriel affectionately ran three fi ngers down its length none at all im afraid lord stinhurst replied ive not quite made up my mind joanna smiled up at him moving her shoulder to disengage gabriels hand from her hair tell me what i can do to persuade you to decide in my favour darling gabriel gave a low guttural laugh take her up on it stuart god knows our darling jo excels at persuading no one spoke for a moment in answer to that remark fully laced though it was with innuendo no one even moved at first save for david sydeham who raised his head slowly from the script he was examining and levelled his eyes on the other man his face was deadly rife with hostility but gabriel did not seem the least affected rhys daviesjones threw down his own script christ youre an ass he said to gabriel wearily and i once thought rhys and i would never agree upon anything joanna added irene sinclair moved her chair back from the table harshly it abraded the stage fl oor right well ill be off she spoke agreeably enough before making her exit down the main aisle of the theatre but when she passed st james he saw how she was working to control her face and he wondered how and why she had ever endured a marriage to robert gabriel while the other players the assistants and the designers began to drift off towards the wings st james got to his feet and went to the front of the auditorium it was not overlarge perhaps seating only fi ve hundred people and a grey haze of stale cigarette smoke hung over its open thrust stage he mounted the steps have you a moment lord stinhurst stinhurst was having a lowvoiced conversation with a spindly young man who carried a clipboard and wrote with knotted concentration see to it that weve enough copies for tomorrows readthrough he said in conclusion only then did he look up so you lied to them about not having your mind made up st james observed stinhurst didnt reply to this at once rather he called out weve no need for all this light now donald and in answer the stage leaped with cavernous shadows only the table itself was illuminated stinhurst sat down at it took out pipe and tobacco and laid them both down sometimes its easier to lie he admitted im afraid its one of the behaviours a producer grows adept at over time if youve ever been in the midst of a tugofwar of creative egos youd know what i mean this seems to be a particularly infl ammable group its understandable theyve been through a bit of hell these past three days stinhurst packed his pipe his shoulders were stiff a marked contrast to the weariness of his voice and face i dont imagine this is a social call mr st james st james handed him the stack of enlargements which deborah had made from the photograph taken at geoffrey rintouls inquest on each new photograph appeared a single face and occasionally part of a torso but nothing else there was nothing to indicate that the people had once all been part of one group deborah had been particularly careful about that will you identify these people for me st james asked stinhurst fingered through the lot turning each one slowly his pipe ignored st james could see the marked hesitation in his movements and he wondered if the man would actually cooperate stinhurst was no doubt well aware of the fact that he was not obliged to reveal a thing nonetheless he also appeared to know exactly how a refusal to respond would be interpreted by lynley if he learned of it so st james only hoped that stinhurst believed he was here in some offi cial capacity at lynleys behest after a thorough perusal the man laid all the photographs out in a line and indicated each as he spoke my father my sisters husband phillip gerrard my sister francesca my wife marguerite my fathers solicitorhe died some years ago and i cant remember his name at the moment our physician myself stinhurst had omitted the very man whose identity they needed st james pointed to the photograph he had laid next to that of his sister and this man in profi le stinhursts brow creased i dont know i cant say ive ever seen him before odd st james said why because in the original photo from which all of these were taken hes talking to you and for some reason you look in that picture as if you know him quite well indeed i may have at the time but my brothers inquest was twentyfive years ago and at this distance i dont think i can be expected to remember everyone who was there thats true st james replied and considered the fascinating fact that he had not mentioned that the photographs were from geoffrey rintouls inquest at all stinhurst was getting to his feet if theres nothing else mr st james ive things to see to before my day ends here he did not look at the photographs again as he spoke gathering pipe and tobacco readying himself to leave and that was so unlikely a human reaction it was as if the man had to keep his eyes from them lest his face reveal more than he had been willing to say one thing was a certainty st james concluded lord stinhurst knew exactly who the man in the photograph was certain kinds of lighting refuse to lie about the relentless ineluctable process of ageing they are entirely unforgiving capable of exposing flaws and baring the truth direct sunlight the harsh overhead fl uorescent lights of a business establishment the fl ood lights used to film without softfocus fi ltersthese are proficient at doing their worst in her dressing room joanna ellacourts makeup table appeared to have this sort of lighting as well at least it did today the air was quite cool the way she always liked it in order to keep the flowers fresh when they arrived from a score of admirers before her performances there were no fl owers now instead the air held that combination of odours peculiar to every dressing room she had ever inhabited the mingling scents of cold cream astringent and lotion that littered the tabletop joanna was only dimly aware of this scent as she stared unflinchingly at her refl ection and forced her eyes to rest upon each telling harbinger of approaching middle age the incipient wrinkles from nose to chin the delicate webbing round her eyes the fi rst ringed indentations on her neck prelude to the oldage cording that could never be disguised she smiled in selfmockery at the thought that she had escaped nearly everything that had constituted the psychological quicksand of her life her familys grubby fi veroom council house in nottingham the sight of her father sitting daily in unshaven gloom at his window a machinist on the dole whose dreams had died the sound of her mother whining about the cold that persistently seeped through the poorly sealed windows or the black and white telly whose knobs were broken off so that the sound remained at a constant nerveshattering pitch the future that each of her sisters had chosen one that repeated the history of their parents marriage an endless bonegrinding repetition of producing babies at intervals of eighteen months and living without either hope or joy she had escaped all that but she could not escape that process of slow decomposition that awaits every man like so many egocentric creatures whose beauty dominates the stage and the screen and the covers of countless magazines she had thought for a time that she might elude it she had in fact grown to believe that she would for david had always allowed her to do so her husband had been more than her liberation from the miseries of nottingham david had been the one true constant in a fickle world in which fame is ephemeral in which the critics apotheosis of a new talent could mean the ruin of an established actress who has given her life to the stage david knew all about that knew how it frightened her and through his continual support and lovein spite of her tantrums her demands her fl irtationshe had assuaged her fears until joy sinclairs play had come along changing everything irrevocably between them fixing her eyes on her refl ection without really seeing it joanna felt the anger all over again no longer the fire that had consumed her with such irrational revengeseeking intensity on saturday night at westerbrae it had burned itself down to a glowing pilot capable of igniting her central passion at the least provocation david had betrayed her she forced herself to think of it again and again lest the decades of their shared intimacy insinuate themselves into her consciousness and demand that she forgive him she would never do so he had known how much she had depended upon othello being the last time she performed with robert gabriel he had known how much she despised gabriels pursuit of her flavoured with accidental encounters casually inadvertent movements that grazed his hand across the very tips of her breasts longing stage kisses in front of enormous audiences who grew to believe it was part of the show private doubleedged compliments attached to references to his sexual prowess like it or not you and gabriel have magic when youre on the stage together david had said not the least bit jealous not the least bit concerned she had always wondered why until now he had lied to her about joy sinclairs play telling her that robert gabriels participation was stinhursts idea telling her that gabriel couldnt possibly be dropped from the cast but she knew the real truth although she couldnt bear to face what it implied to insist upon gabriels being sacked would mean a decrease in revenues for the show itself which would cut into her percentageinto davids percentage and david liked his money his lobb shoes his rolls his home on regents park his cottage in the country his savile row wardrobe if all this could be maintained what did it matter that his wife would have to fight off robert gabriels sweaty advances for another year or so shed been doing it for more than a decade after all when her dressingroom door opened joanna didnt bother to turn from the makeup table for the mirror provided a more than adequate view of the door even if this had not been the case she knew who was entering after all shed had twenty years of hearing them to recognise any one of her husbands movementshis steady footsteps the rasp of a match when he lit a cigarette the rustle of cloth against his skin when he dressed the slow relaxation of his muscles when he lay down to sleep she could identify any and all of them in the end they were so uniquely david but she was beyond considering any of that now so she reached for hairbrush and hairpins pushed her makeup case to one side and began to see to her hair counting the strokes from one to one hundred as if each took her further away from the long stretch of history she shared with david sydeham he didnt speak when he entered the room he merely walked to the chaise as he always did but this time he did not sit nor did he speak until she fi nally finished with her hair dropped her brush to the table and turned to look at him expressionlessly i suppose i can rest a bit more easily if i simply know why you did it he said lady helen arrived at the st james home shortly before six that evening she felt both discouraged and disheartened even a tray in st james study burdened with fresh scones cream tea and sandwiches did little to brighten her you look as if you could do with a sherry st james observed once she had removed her coat and gloves lady helen dug through her handbag for her notebook that sounds like exactly what i need she agreed heavily no luck deborah asked she was sitting on the ottoman to the right of the hearth sneaking an occasional bit of scone down to peach the scruffy little dachshund who waited patiently at her feet occasionally testing the flavour of her ankle with a delicate and loving pink tongue nearby the grey cat alaska was curled happily onto a pile of papers in the centre of st james desk although his eyes slitted open he did not otherwise stir at lady helens entrance its not exactly that she replied gratefully accepting the glass of sherry which st james brought her ive the information we want its only that it doesnt go far to helping rhys st james guessed she shot him a smile that she knew was at best only tremulous his words pained her unaccountably and feeling the force of a sudden wretchedness she realised how she had been depending upon her interview with lord stinhursts secretary to attenuate everyones suspicion of rhys no it doesnt help rhys it doesnt do much of anything im afraid tell us st james said there was after all so little to tell lord stinhursts secretary had been willing enough to talk about the telephone calls she had placed for her employer once she realised how essential those calls might be in exonerating him of any complicity in the death of joy sinclair so she had spoken openly to lady helen going so far as to produce the notebook into which she had jotted down the message that stinhurst had wished her to repeat for every call she made it was straightforward enough am unavoidably delayed in scotland due to an accident will be in touch the moment im available only one call differed from that repeated message and although it was decidedly odd it did not seem to wear the guise of guilt resurfacing forces me to put you off a second time this month terribly sorry telephone me at westerbrae if this presents a problem resurfacing st james repeated odd choice of words are you certain about that helen completely stinhursts secretary had written it down some theatre term deborah suggested st james eased himself awkwardly into the chair near her she moved on the ottoman to give him room for his leg who received that last helen she referred to her notes sir kenneth willingate a friend a colleague im not altogether sure lady helen hesitated trying to decide how to present her last piece of information in such a way that st james would be drawn into its singularity she knew how flimsy a detail it was knew also how she was clinging to it in the hope that it would take them in any direction other than towards rhys im probably grasping at straws simon she continued ingenuously but there was one thing about that last call all the others had been made to cancel appointments that stinhurst had over the next few days his secretary merely read the names to me right out of his engagement book but that last call to willingate had nothing to do with his engagement book at all the name wasnt even written there so it was either an appointment that stinhurst had arranged on his own without telling his secretary or it wasnt in reference to an appointment at all deborah finished for her theres only one way were going to know st james remarked and thats to bully the information from stinhurst or to track down willingate ourselves but we cant go any further without involving tommy im afraid were going to have to give him what little information we have and let him take it from there but tommy wont take it up you know that lady helen protested hes looking for a tie to rhys hes going to dog whatever facts he believes will allow him to make an arrest nothing else matters to tommy right now or wasnt this past weekend enough of a demonstration for you apart from that if you involve him hes bound to discover that barbaras gone her own way on the casewith our help simon you cant do that to her st james sighed helen you simply cant have it both ways you cant protect them both its going to come down to a decision do you take the chance of sacrifi cing barbara havers or do you sacrifi ce rhys i sacrifi ce neither he shook his head i know how you feel but im afraid that wont wash when cotter showed barbara havers into the study she sensed the tension at once the room felt alive with it an abrupt silence followed by a quick burst of welcoming conversation revealed the discomfort that the three others were feeling the atmosphere among them was charged and taut what is it she asked they were she had to admit nothing if not an honest group simon feels we cant go further without tommy lady helen went on to explain the peculiar telephone message that stinhurst had sent to sir kenneth willingate we have no authority to pop into these peoples lives and question them barbara st james put in when lady helen fi nished and you know they dont have an obligation to talk to us so unless tommy takes it on im afraid weve met with a dead end barbara reflected on this she knew quite well that lynley had no intention of turning away from the east anglian lead it was too enticing he would brush off an abstruse telephone message to an unknown londoner named willingate as a waste of his time especially she thought with resignation since lord stinhurst was the man who had sent it the others were right theyd come to a dead end but if she couldnt persuade them to go on without lynley stinhurst would get away cleanly without a scratch of course we know that if tommy discovers youve taken part of the case in another direction without his authorisation i dont care about that barbara said brusquely surprised to find that it was the perfect truth you may be suspended or sent back to uniform even sacked that isnt important right now this is ive spent the whole filthy day chasing spectres in east anglia without a hope of any of it coming to any good but were onto something here and ive no intention of letting it die simply because someone might put me in uniform again or sack me or anything else so if we have to tell him we tell him everything she faced them squarely shall we do it now in spite of her decision the others hesitated you dont want to think about it lady helen asked i dont need to think about it barbara replied her words were harsh and she didnt temper them as she continued look i saw gowan die hed pulled a knife out of his back and crawled across the scullery floor trying to get help his skin looked like boiled meat his nose was broken his lips were split i want to find who did that to a sixteenyearold boy and if it costs me my job to track the killer down thats a very minor cost as far as im concerned whos coming with me loud voices in the hallway precluded an answer the door swung open and jeremy vinney pushed past cotter he was breathless redfaced his trouser legs were soaked up to his knees and his ungloved hands looked raw from the cold couldnt get a taxi he panted ended up running all the way from sloane square was afraid i might miss you he stripped off his coat and threw it down on the couch found out who the fellow in the photograph was had to let you know at once names willingate kenneth the same vinney bent with his hands on his knees trying to catch his breath not all not who the bloke is that makes it so interesting its what he is he flashed a quick smile dont know what he was in but right now hes the head of mi there wasnt a person in the room who did not understand the full range of implications behind jeremy vinneys words mi military intelligence section five the counterintelligence agency of the british government it was suddenly clear why vinney had come bursting in upon them certain of his welcome completely assured that he bore information vital to the case if he had been a suspect before surely this new twist took him out of the running entirely as if convinced of this he went on theres more i was intrigued by our conversation this morning about the profumokeeler case in so i went through the morgue to see if there was any article alluding to a possible connection between their situation and geoffrey rintouls death i thought that perhaps rintoul had been involved with a call girl and was trotting back to london to see her the night he was killed but profumo and keeler seem like such ancient history deborah remarked surely that sort of scandal wouldnt affect a familys reputation now lady helen agreed but her comments were obviously reluctant theres truth to that simon murder joy destroy the scripts murder gowan all because geoffrey rintoul was seeing a call girl twentyfive years ago how can one argue that as a credible motive it depends on the level of importance attached to the mans position st james replied consider profumos case as an example he was secretary of state for war carrying on a relationship with christine keeler a call girl who also just happened to be seeing a man called yevgeni ivanov who was attached to the soviet embassy but was reportedly a soviet intelligence agent vinney added and smoothly continued in an interview with the police on an entirely different matter christine keeler volunteered the information that she had been asked to discover from john profumo the date on which certain atomic secrets were to be passed to west germany by the americans a lovely person lady helen commented this leaked to the pressas perhaps she intendedand things heated up for profumo and for the government as well havers said vinney nodded his agreement the labour party demanded that profumos relationship with keeler be debated before the house of commons while the liberal party demanded the prime ministers resignation because of it why deborah asked they claimed that as head of security services the prime minister was either aware of all the facts on profumos relationship with the call girl and was hiding them or he was guilty of incompetence and neglect however vinney finished the truth well might be that the prime minister merely felt he could not survive another serious case involving the resignation of one of his ministers as would likely occur if profumos behaviour was examined closely so he gambled that nothing against profumo would come out if the profumo affair came to light so soon after the vassall case chances are the prime minister would have to resign vassall lady helens body tensed whitefaced she leaned forward in her chair vinney looked at her clearly perplexed by her reaction to his words william vassall he was sentenced to prison in october of sixtytwo he was an admiralty clerk who was spying for the soviets my god my god lady helen cried she got to her feet spun to st james simon its the line from the play that all the rintouls reacted to another vassall the character was running off with no time to return to london he said he wouldnt become another vassall and they knew what it meant when they heard it they knew francesca elizabeth lord and lady stinhurst all of them knew this was no callgirl relationship it was nothing of the sort st james was already pushing himself out of his chair tommy will move on this helen on what deborah cried on geoffrey rintoul my love another vassall it seems that geoffrey rintoul was a soviet mole and god help them but every member of his family and a good part of the government appeared to know it lynley had left the doors open between his dining and drawing rooms largely so that he could hear the music from his stereo while he was eating dinner for the past few days food had held little attraction for himtonight was no different because of this he pushed most of his lamb aside uneaten and instead gave himself over to the passion of a beethoven symphony that swelled from the next room he moved away from the table and leaned back in his chair with his legs stretched out before him in the last twentyfour hours he had avoided thinking about what the case he was building against rhys daviesjones was going to do to helen clyde steadfastly forcing himself to keep moving forward from fact to fact he had managed to keep helen out of his mind entirely but she intruded now he understood her unwillingness to believe in daviesjones guilt she was after all involved with the man but how would she react when she was faced with the knowledgeirrefutable and supported by a score of factsthat she had been coldbloodedly used to facilitate a murder and how could he possibly protect her from the devastation that knowledge was going to cause in her life in thinking about this lynley found that he could no longer avoid looking directly at the truth of how damnably much he missed helen and how irrevocably he might lose her if he continued his pursuit of daviesjones to its logical conclusion my lord his valet was standing hesitantly in the doorway rubbing the top of his left shoe against the back of his right leg as if in the need to make adjustments to his already immaculate appearance he ran a hand over the top of his perfectly groomed hair beau brummel of eaton terrace lynley thought and said encouragingly denton when it appeared that the young man might go on with his grooming indefi nitely lady helen clydes just in the ante my lord with mr st james and sergeant havers dentons expression was a model of nonchalance something he no doubt considered suitable to the occasion however his tone conveyed some considerable surprise and lynley wondered how much denton already knewin that omniscient way of servantsabout his rift with lady helen he had after all been seeing lady helens caroline rather seriously for the past three years well dont leave them standing in the hall lynley said the drawing room then denton enquired solicitously much too solicitously for lynleys liking he rose with a nod irritably thinking i hardly expect they want to see me in the kitchen the three of them were standing in a fairly tight knot at one end of the room when he joined them a moment later they had chosen a position beneath the portrait of lynleys father and under the cover of the music they were speaking to one another in hushed urgent voices but his entrance brought their conversation to an end and then as if his presence were a stimulus to do so they began to shed their coats hats gloves and muffl ers the action had the appearance of buying a bit of time lynley turned off the stereo replaced the album in its jacket and faced them curiously they seemed unnaturally subdued weve come across some information that you need to have tommy st james said in very much the manner of a planned introduction what sort of information it concerns lord stinhurst lynleys eyes went at once to sergeant havers she met them unfl inchingly are you part of this havers yes i am sir its my doing tommy st james said before lynley could speak again barbara found geoffrey rintouls grave on the westerbrae grounds and she showed it to me it seemed worth looking into lynley maintained his calm with an effort why because of phillip gerrards will lady helen said impulsively francescas husband he said he wouldnt allow himself to be buried on the grounds of westerbrae because of the telephone calls lord stinhurst placed on the morning of the murder they werent only to cancel his appointments tommy because lynley looked at st james feeling the blow of treachery strike him from the single most unexpected quarter my god youve told them about my conversation with stinhurst st james had the grace to drop his eyes im sorry truly i felt i had no choice no choice lynley repeated incredulously lady helen took a hesitant step towards him her hand extended please tommy i know how you must feel as if were all against you but that isnt it at all please listen compassion from helen was just about the last thing lynley could bear at the moment he struck out at her cruelly without a thought i think were all perfectly clear on where your interests lie helen you can hardly be the most objective assessor of truth considering your involvement in this case lady helens hand fell her face was stricken with pain st james spoke his voice cold with quick anger nor can you tommy if the truth be faced among us he let a moment pass then he went on in a different tone but as implacably as before lord stinhurst lied to you about his brother and his wife first and last a good possibility is that scotland yard knew he planned to do so and sanctioned it the yard chose you deliberately to handle this case because you were the most likely person to believe whatever stinhurst told you his brother and his wife never had an affair tommy now do you want to hear the facts or shall we be on our way lynley felt as if ice were melting into his bones what in gods name are you talking about st james moved towards a chair thats what weve come to tell you but i think we all could do with a brandy while st james outlined the information they had gathered on geoffrey rintoul barbara havers watched lynley gauging his reaction she knew how resistant he would be to the facts considering rintouls privileged background and how closely it resembled lynleys own everything in lynleys upperclass constitution was going to act in concert provoking him to disclaim each of their facts and conjectures and the policewoman in barbara knew exactly how insubstantial some of their facts were the inescapable reality was that if geoffrey rintoul had indeed been a soviet moleworking for years within that sensitive area of the defence ministrythe only way they would know for a certainty would be if his brother stuart admitted it to them ideally they needed access to an mi computer even a file on geoffrey rintoul marked inaccessible would verify that the man had been under some sort of investigation by the counterintelligence agency but they had no access to such a computer and no source within mi who could validate their story even scotland yards special branch would be of no service to them if the yard itself had sanctioned lord stinhursts fabrication about his brothers death in scotland in the first place so it all came down to lynleys ability to see past his tangle of prejudices against rhys daviesjones it all came down to his ability to look the truth squarely in the face and the truth was that lord stinhurst not daviesjones had the strongest possible motive for wanting joy sinclair dead provided with the keys to joys room by his own sister he had murdered the woman whose playcleverly revised without his prior knowledgehad threatened to reveal his familys darkest secret so when stinhurst heard the name vassall in joys play he had to know what she was writing about st james concluded and consider how geoffrey rintouls background supports his having been a spy for the soviets tommy he went to cambridge in the thirties we know that soviet recruiting went on like the devil during that period rintoul read economics which no doubt made him even more receptive to arguments in favour of the teachings of marx and then his behaviour during the war requesting reassignment to the balkans gave him contact with the russians i shouldnt be at all surprised to discover that his control was in the balkans as well no doubt thats when he received his most important instructions to work his way into the ministry of defence god knows how much sensitive data he supplied the soviets over the years no one said anything when st james fi nished speaking their attention was on lynley they had taken their seats under the portrait of the seventh earl of asherton and as they watched lynley lifted his eyes to his fathers face as if in the need of counsel his expression was unreadable tell me again what stinhursts message was to willingate he said at last st james leaned forward he said that resurfacing forced him to put willingate off a second time this month and to telephone westerbrae if that presented a problem once we discovered exactly who willingate is the message began to make more sense barbara continued she felt a sense of urgency a need to convince he seemed to be telling willingate that the fact that geoffrey rintoul had been a mole had surfaced for the second time the first time being on that new years eve of so willingate was to telephone westerbrae to assist with a problem the problem being joy sinclairs death and the script she was writing that exposed all the details of geoffreys unsavoury past lynley nodded barbara went on of course lord stinhurst couldnt telephone willingate himself could he any research into the westerbrae telephone records would have shown us that call so he placed the one call to his secretary she did the rest and willingate understanding the message did telephone him sir twice i should guess remember mary agnes told me she heard two calls come in they had to be from willingate one to find out what in gods name had happened and the second to tell stinhurst what hed managed to set up with scotland yard remember as well st james said that according to inspector macaskin strathclyde cid never requested the yards assistance in the case at all they were merely informed that the yard would take over it seems likely that willingate arranged all that telephoning someone in high command at the yard to set the investigation up and then getting back to stinhurst with the details of who the investigating officer would be no doubt stinhurst was more than ready for your appearance on the scene tommy and he had all day to plan out a story that you a fellow peer would be likely to believe it had to be a personal story one that as a gentleman you would be unlikely to repeat what better choice than his wifes allegedly illegitimate child it was insidiously clever he simply didnt take into account that you would confide in me nor that inot very much of a gentleman myself im afraid would break your confidence and im sorry i did that had there been any other way id have said nothing i hope you believe me st james last remark bore the sound of conclusion but after it lynley merely reached for the brandy he poured himself more and passed the decanter on to st james his hands did not shake his face did not change outside a horn honked twice on eaton terrace an answering shout rose from a house nearby feeling a rising need to force him into taking a position barbara spoke the question we were trying to answer on the way here sir is why the government would involve themselves in a case like this now and the answer seems to be that in they engaged in a coverup of rintouls activitiesprobably using the official secrets actin order to spare the prime minister the embarrassment of having a soviet spy discovered in the high reaches of government so soon upon the heels of the vassall situation and the profumo scandal since geoffrey rintoul was dead he could do the defence ministry no further damage he could only be of damage to the prime minister himself if the news of his activities leaked so they kept that from happening and now theyd apparently prefer not to have that old coverup exposed i suppose it would be rather embarrassing for them or maybe theyve debts to be paid to the rintoul family and this is how theyre paying them at any rate theyve covered up again only barbara paused wondering how he would take the final bit of information knowing only that in spite of their rows and the often insurmountable differences between them she couldnt be the one to give him such pain lynley took the opportunity himself i was to do it for them he said hollowly and webberly knew it right from the beginning in the devastation behind the words barbara recognised what lynley was thinking that this situation proved he was merely an expendable object to his superiors at the met that his was not a career with either value or distinction so that if it were destroyed by the exposure of his even unconscious attempt to cover up the trail of stinhursts guilt in a murder investigation there would be no real loss to anyone when he was dismissed never mind the fact that none of this was true barbara knew even a moments belief in it would corrosively erode his pride in the past fifteen months she had loved and hated and come to understand him but never before had she perceived that his aristocratic background was a source of anguish to him a burden of family and blood that he managed to carry with an unassuming dignity even in the moments when he most longed to shrug it off how could joy sinclair have known all this lynley asked his face was impeccably painfully controlled lord stinhurst told you that himself she was there the night geoffrey died and i didnt even notice that there was nothing about joys play in her study lynleys voice was heavy with reproach christ what kind of police work is that the gentlemen from mi dont leave calling cards when theyve searched a house tommy st james said there was no evidence of a search you couldnt have known they had been there and after all you hadnt gone looking for information about the play all the same i shouldnt have been blind to its absence he smiled grimly at barbara good work sergeant i cant think where wed be if i hadnt had you along lynleys praise brought barbara no joy never had she felt so completely wretched about having been in the right what shall we she hesitated unwilling to take any more authority from him lynley got to his feet well go for stinhurst in the morning he said i should like the rest of the night to think about what needs to be done barbara knew what he really meant to think about what he himself was going to do faced with the knowledge of how scotland yard had used him she wanted to say something to lighten the blow she wanted to say that in spite of the plan to make him instrumental in a coverup it hadnt come off they had proved themselves superior to it but she knew that he would see through the words to the truth beneath them she had proved herself superior to it she had saved him from his own black folly with nothing more to be said they began putting on their coats pulling on gloves adjusting hats and muffl ers the atmosphere was fraught with words needing to be spoken lynley took his time about replacing the brandy decanter gathering the small crystal balloon glasses onto a tray turning out the lights in the room he followed them into the hall lady helen was standing in a pool of light near the door she had said nothing for an hour and now she spoke tentatively as he came to join them tommy meet me at the theatre at nine sergeant lynley said abruptly have a constable with you to take stinhurst in if she had not already realised how inconsequential her triumph really was in this game of detection that brief exchange would have illustrated the point for barbara with rare lucidity she saw the gulf widen between lynley and lady helen felt its painful impassability like a physical wound she said only yes sir and reached for the door tommy you cant ignore me any longer lady helen insisted lynley looked at her then for the fi rst time since st james had begun speaking in the drawing room i was wrong about him helen but you need to know the worst of my sin i wanted to be right he nodded good night and left them wednesday dawned under a leaden sky the coldest day yet the snow along the pavement had developed a hard thin crust grimy from soot and the exhaust of the city traffi c when lynley pulled up in front of the agincourt theatre at eight fortyfive sergeant havers was already waiting in front of it bundled up to her eyebrows in her usual unbecoming brown wool with a young police constable at her side lynley noted grimly that havers had put some considerable thought into her selection of a constable choosing the one least likely to be cowed by stinhursts title and wealth winston nkata once a mainstay of the brixton warriorsone of the citys most violent black gangsthe twentyfiveyearold nkata through the patient intercession and continuing friendship of three hardnosed officers in a branch was now an aspirant to the highest reaches of cid living proof he liked to say that if they cant arrest you theyll damn well convert you he flashed lynley one of his highvoltage smiles spector he called why you never drive that baby in my neighbourhood we like to burn pieces that nice the next riot let me know lynley responded drily next riot we send out invitations man make sure everybody have a chance to be there ah yes bring your own brick the black man threw back his head and laughed unrestrainedly as lynley joined them on the pavement i like you spector he said give me your home address i think i got to marry your sister lynley smiled youre too good for her nkata not to mention about sixteen years too young but if you behave yourself this morning im sure we can come to a suitable arrangement he looked at havers has stinhurst arrived yet she nodded ten minutes ago in answer to his unasked question she replied he didnt see us we were having coffee across the way he had his wife with him inspector that lynley said is a stroke of luck lets go in inside the theatre buzzed with the activity attendant to a new production the auditorium doors were open conversation and laughter mixed with the noise of a crew at work taking measurements for a set production assistants hurried by with clipboards in their hands and pencils behind their ears in a corner by the bar a publicist and a designer held a huddle over a large sheet of paper onto which the latter was sketching advertising draughts it was altogether a place of creativity humming with excitement but this morning lynley did not find himself at all regretful that he would be the instrument of bringing all these peoples pleasure to an end as would be the case once stinhurst faced arrest they were walking towards the door to the production offices at the far side of the building when lord stinhurst came out of it followed by his wife lady stinhurst was speaking in an agitated rush twisting a large diamond ring on her fi nger she stopped everything ringtwisting speaking walkingwhen she saw the police stinhurst was cooperative enough when lynley requested a private place to talk come into my office he said shall my wife he hesitated meaningfully lynley however had already decided exactly how lady stinhursts presence could be turned to his advantage part of himthe better part he thoughtwanted to let her go in peace and shrank from making her a chessman in the game of fact and fiction but the other part of him needed her as a tool of blackmail and he hated that part of himself even as he knew he would use her id like lady stinhurst there as well he said briefl y with constable nkata posted outside the door and instructions to stinhursts secretary to put no calls through that were not for the police lynley and havers joined lord stinhurst and his wife in the producers offi ce it was a room much like the man himself coldly decorated in black and grey fitted out with a compulsively neat hardwood desk and luxuriously upholstered wingback chairs the air holding an almost imperceptible odour of pipe tobacco the walls were hung with tastefully framed posters of former stinhurst productions proclamations of over thirty years of success henry v london the three sisters norwich rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead keswick a dolls house london private lives exeter equus brighton amadeus london at one side of the room were grouped a conference table and chairs lynley directed them towards these unwilling to allow stinhurst the comfort and command of facing the police across the width of his polished desk as havers rooted for her notebook lynley took out the photographs of the inquest as well as the enlargements which deborah st james had made he laid them out on the table wordlessly if everything st james had said was true stinhurst had no doubt telephoned sir kenneth willingate yesterday afternoon he would be well fortified for this coming interview through a long sleepless night lynley had carefully reviewed the various ways he might head off another wellcrafted set of lies he had come to the realisation that stinhurst did have at least one achilles heel lynley aimed his first remark in its direction jeremy vinney knows the entire story lord stinhurst i dont know whether hell write it since for the moment he has no hard evidence to back it up but i have no doubt that he intends to start looking for that evidence lynley straightened the photographs with deliberate attention so you can tell me another lie or we can explore in detail the one you created for me this past weekend at westerbrae or you can tell the truth but let me point out to you that had you told me the truth about your brother in the first place it would probably have gone no further than st james in whom i confided but because you lied to me and because that lie didnt fi t in with your brothers grave in scotland sergeant havers knows about geoffrey as does st james as does lady helen clyde as does jeremy vinney as will everyone with access to my report at scotland yard once i fi le it lynley saw stinhursts eyes go to his wife so whats it to be he asked relaxing into his chair shall we talk about that summer thirtysix years ago when your brother geoffrey was in somerset and you travelled the country in the regionals and your wife enough stinhurst said he smiled icily hoist with my own petard inspector bravo lady stinhursts hands writhed in her lap stuart what is all this what have you told them the question could not have come at a better time lynley waited for the mans response after a long and thoughtful perusal of the police stinhurst turned to his wife and began to speak however when he did so it was to prove beyond a doubt that he was a master player in the game of disarmament and surprise i told him you and geoffrey were lovers he said i claimed that elizabeth was your child and that joy sinclairs play was about your affair i told them that she had revised her play without my knowledge to revenge herself upon us for alecs death god forgive me at least that last part was true enough im sorry lady stinhurst sat in uncomprehending silence her mouth contorting with words that would not emerge one side of her face seemed to collapse with the effort finally she managed geoff you never thought that geoffrey and ioh my god stuart stinhurst started to reach towards his wife but she cried out involuntarily and shrank from the gesture he withdrew fractionally leaving his hand lying on the table between them the fi ngers curled then tightened into the palm no of course not but i needed to tell them something i neededi had to keep them away from geoff you needed to tell thembut hes dead her face transformed with growing revulsion as she took in the enormity of what her husband had done geoffs dead and im not stuart im not you made a whore out of me to protect a dead man you sacrifi ced me my god how could you have done that stinhurst shook his head his words were laboured not a dead man not dead at all but alive and in this room forgive me if you can i was a coward first last and always i was only trying to protect myself from what youve done nothing stuart for gods sake you did nothing that night how can you say it isnt true i couldnt tell you tell me what tell me now stinhurst stared long at his wife as if he were trying to summon courage from an examination of her face i was the one who gave geoff over to the government all of you learned the worst about him on that new years eve but igod help me id known he was a soviet agent since stinhurst held himself perfectly still as he spoke perhaps in the belief that a single movement would cause the floodgates to open and the accumulated anguish of thirtynine years to come pouring out his voice was matteroffact and although his eyes became increasingly redrimmed he shed no tears lynley found himself wondering if stinhurst was even capable of weeping after so many years of deceit i knew that geoff was a marxist when we were at cambridge he made no secret of it and frankly i took it as a bit of a lark something he would outgrow in time and if he didnt i thought what a laugh it would be to have the future earl of stinhurst committed to the workers struggle to change the tide of history what i didnt know was that his proclivities had been duly noted and that he had been seduced into espionage while he was still a student seduced lynley asked it is a process of seduction stinhurst replied a combination of flattery and cajolery making the student believe he plays an important role in the scheme of change how did you come to know this i discovered it quite by chance after the war when we were all in somerset it was the weekend my son alec was born id gone out looking for geoff directly after id seen marguerite and the baby it was he smiled at his wife for the first and only time her face did not register a single response a son i was so happy i wanted geoff to know so i went out looking and found him in one of our boyhood haunts an abandoned cottage in the quantock hills apparently hed felt that somerset was safe he was meeting someone stinhurst nodded i probably would have thought it was only a farmer but earlier that weekend id seen geoff working in the study on some government papers the sort that are stamped confi dential in garish letters across the front i thought nothing of it at the time just that hed brought work home his briefcase was on the desk and he was putting a document into a manila envelope not an estate envelope nor a government one i remember that distinctly but i thought nothing of it until i came upon him in the cottage and saw him pass that same envelope to the man he was meeting ive often thought that had i arrived a minute soonera minute lateri might well have assumed his companion was indeed a somerset farmer but as it was once i saw the envelope change hands i guessed the worst of course for a moment i tried to tell myself that it was all a coincidence that the envelope could not possibly be the same one i had seen in the study but if it was only an innocent exchange of information that id witnessedall legal and aboveboardwhy arrange for it to take place in the quantock hills in the middle of nowhere if youd discovered them lady stinhurst asked numbly why didnt they dosomething to keep you from revealing what you knew they didnt know exactly what id seen and even if they had i was safe in spite of everything geoff would have drawn the line at the elimination of his own brother he was after all more of a man than i when it came right down to it lady stinhurst looked away dont say that about yourself its true im afraid did he admit to his activities lynley asked once the other man was gone i confronted him stinhurst said he admitted to it he wasnt ashamed he believed in the cause and ii dont know what i believed in all i knew was that he was my brother i loved him i always had even though i was revolted by what he was doing i couldnt bring myself to betray him he would have known you see that i was the one to turn him in so i did nothing but it ate away at me for years i should guess you finally saw your opportunity to take action in the government prosecuted william vassall in october they already had arrested and tried an italian physicistgiuseppe martellifor espionage in september i thought that if geoffs activities were uncovered then so many years after i had come to know about them he could hardly think i was the one to give him over to the government so iin november i handed my facts to the authorities and surveillance began in my heart i hopedi prayedthat geoff would discover he was being watched and make his escape to the soviets he almost did what prevented him at the question stinhursts clenched fi st tightened his hand shook with the pressure knuckles and fingers white in the outer offi ce a telephone rang an infectious burst of laughter sounded sergeant havers stopped writing cast a questioning look towards lynley what prevented him lynley repeated tell them stuart lady stinhurst murmured tell the truth this once at last her husband rubbed at his eyelids his skin looked grey my father he said he killed him stinhurst paced the length of the room his tall lean figure like a rod save for his head which was bent his eyes on the fl oor it happened much the way joys play depicted it the other night there was a telephone call for geoff but my father and i came into the library without geoffs knowledge and overheard part of it heard him say that someone would have to get to his flat for the code book or the whole network would be blown father began to question him geoff he was always so eloquent such a master of the languagewas frantic to get away at once there was hardly time for an inquisition he wasnt thinking straight wasnt answering questions consistently so father guessed the truth it wasnt really difficult after what wed both heard of the telephone conversation when father saw that the very worst was true something simply snapped to him it was more than treason it was a betrayal of family of an entire way of life i think he was overcome in an instant with a need to obliterate so from across the room stinhurst examined the lovely posters that lined his offi ce walls my father went after him he was like a bear and igod i watched it all frozen useless and every night since then thomas ive relived that moment when i heard geoffs neck crack like the branch of a tree was your sisters husband phillip gerrard involved lynley asked yes he wasnt in the library when geoffs call came through but he and francesca and marguerite heard my father shouting and came running from upstairs they burst into the room just a moment afterit was done of course phillip immediately went for the phone insisting that the authorities be sent for at once but wethe rest of us pressured him out of it the scandal a trial perhaps father going to prison francesca became hysterical at the thought phillip was obdurate enough at first but ultimately against all of us especially francie what could he do so he helped us take hisgeoffrey the bodyto where the road forks left to hillview farm and begins the descent right towards kilparie village we took only geoffs car to leave one set of tyre prints he smiled in exquisite selfdenigration we were careful about that sort of thing theres a tremendous declivity that begins at the fork with two switchbacks one right after the other like a snake we started the engine sent the car off with geoff in the drivers seat the car built speed at the fi rst switchback it shot across the road broke through the fence made the drop to the second switchback below and went over the embankment it burst into flames he pulled out a white handkerchiefa perfectly laundered linen squareand wiped at his eyes he returned to the table but did not sit afterwards we walked home the road was almost entirely ice so we didnt even leave footprints there was never really a question of its not being an accident his fingers touched the photograph of his father still lying where lynley had placed it among the others on the table then why did sir andrew higgins come from london to identify the body and testify at the inquest as insurance lest anyone notice anything peculiar about geoffs injuries that might cause questions to arise about our story sir andrew was my fathers oldest friend he could be trusted and willingates involvement he arrived at westerbrae within two hours of the accident hed been on his way to take geoff back to london for questioning in the first place a warning of his impending arrival was evidently the content of the telephone call my brother had received father told willingate the truth and a deal was struck between them it would be an official secret the government didnt want it known that a mole had been in place for years in the ministry of defence now that the mole was dead my father didnt want it known that his son had been the mole nor did he want to stand trial for murder so the accident story stood and the rest of us vowed silence we kept it as well but phillip gerrard was a decent man the knowledge that hed allowed himself to be talked into covering up a murder consumed him for the rest of his life is that why hes not buried on westerbrae land he felt he had cursed it why is your brother buried there father wouldnt have his body in somerset it was all we could do to convince him to bury geoff at all stinhurst fi nally looked at his wife we all broke on the wheel of geoffreys sedition didnt we mag but you and i worst of all we lost alec we lost elizabeth we lost each other its always been geoff between us then she said dully all these years youve always acted as if you killed him not your father there were even times when i wondered if you had stinhurst shook his head refusing to accept exoneration i did of course i did in the library that night there was a split second of decision when i could have gone to them when i could have stopped father they were on the floor andgeoff looked at me maggie im the last person he saw and the last thing he knew was that his only brother was going to stand there and do nothing and watch him die i may as well have killed him myself you see im responsible for it in the long run treason like the plague doth take much in a blood lynley thought that websters line had never seemed so apt as it did now for from the fountainhead of geoffrey rintouls treachery had sprung the destruction of his entire family and since the destruction would not sicken it continued to feed upon the other lives that touched on the periphery of the rintouls on joy sinclairs and gowan kilbrides but now it would stop there was just one more detail to be attended to why did you involve mi this past weekend i didnt know what else to do all i knew was that any investigation would inevitably centre itself round the script we were reading the night joy died and i thoughti believed that a close scrutiny of the script would reveal everything my family and the government had been so careful to keep hidden for twentyfi ve years when willingate phoned me he agreed that the scripts had to be destroyed then he got in touch with your people in special branch and they in turn contacted a met commissioner who agreed to send someone someone specialto westerbrae those last words brought with them a renewed swelling of bitterness that lynley fought against uselessly he told himself that had it not been for helens presence at westerbrae and the crushing revelation about her relationship with rhys daviesjones he would have seen through the web of lies that stinhurst had woven he would have found geoffrey rintouls grave himself and drawn his own conclusions from it without the generous aid of his friends at the moment clinging to that belief was his only source of selfrespect im going to ask you to make a complete statement at the yard lynley said to stinhurst of course he replied and the denial that followed his acquiescence was as mechanical as it was immediate i didnt kill joy sinclair thomas i swear it he didnt lady stinhursts tone was more resigned than urgent lynley didnt respond she went on i would have known had he left our room that night inspector lady stinhurst could not have chosen a single rationale less likely to meet with lynleys belief he turned to havers take lord stinhurst in for a preliminary statement sergeant see that lady stinhurst goes home she nodded and you inspector he thought about the question about the time he still needed to come to terms with all that had happened ill be along directly once lady stinhursts taxi was on its way to the familys holland park home and sergeant havers and constable nkata had escorted lord stinhurst from the agincourt theatre lynley went back into the building he did not relish the idea of an accidental meeting with rhys daviesjones and there was no doubt at all that the man was somewhere on the premises today yet something prompted lynley to linger perhaps as a form of expiation for the sins he had committed in suspecting daviesjones of murder in doing everything in his power to encourage helen to suspect him of murder as well governed by the force of passion rather than by reason he had scrambled for facts that would point the case in the welshmans direction and had ignored those that wanted to lay the blame upon anyone else all this he thought wryly because i was so stupidly ignorant of what helen meant in my life until it was too late you neednt try to comfort me it was a womans faltering voice coming from the far side of the bar just out of the range of lynleys vision i havent come here on any but equal terms you said lets talk truthfully well lets do unsparingly truthfully even shamelessly then jo david sydeham responded its no longer a secret that i love you it never was i loved you as long ago as the time i asked you to read the stone angels name with your fingers yes it had begun that early this affliction of love and has never let go of me since and that is my story joanna shut up youve dropped at least ten lines i havent sydeham and ellacourts words pounded their way into lynleys skull he crossed the lobby reached the bar unceremoniously grabbed the script out of sydehams hand and without a word ran his eyes down the page to find almas speech in summer and smoke he didnt use his spectacles so the words were blurred but legible enough and absolutely indelible you neednt try to comfort me i havent come here on any but equal terms you said lets talk truthfully well lets do unsparingly truthfully even shamelessly then its no longer a secret that i love you it never was i loved you as long ago as the time i asked you to read the stone angels name with your fi ngersyes i remember the long afternoons of our childhood and yet for a moment lynley had assumed joanna ellacourt had been speaking for herself not using the words that tennessee williams had written just as young constable plater must have assumed when faced with hannah darrows suicide note fi fteen years earlier in porthill green because of a traffic snarl on the m he did not arrive in porthill green until after one oclock and by that time clouds humped along the horizon like enormous tufts of grey cotton wool a storm was brewing wines the plough was not yet locked for its midafternoon closing but rather than go into the pub at once for his confrontation with john darrow lynley crunched across the snow on the green to a call box that leaned precariously in the direction of the sea he placed a call to scotland yard it was only a matter of moments before he heard sergeant havers voice and from the background noises of crockery and conversation he guessed that she was taking the call from the offi cers mess bloody hell what happened to you she demanded and then amended the question truculently with sir where are you youve had a phone call from inspector macaskin theyve done the complete autopsy on both sinclair and gowan macaskin said to tell you theyve fixed sinclairs time of death between two and a quarter past three and he said with a great deal of hemming and hawing that she hadnt been interfered with i suppose that was his genteel way of telling me that there was no evidence of forcible rape or sexual intercourse he said that the forensic team arent through with everything they gathered from the room hell phone again as soon as they have it all done lynley blessed macaskins thoroughness and his selfassured willingness to be of help unthreatened by the involvement of scotland yard weve taken stinhursts statement and ive not been able to shake him into a single inconsistency about saturday night at westerbrae no matter how many times weve been through the story havers snorted scornfully his solicitors just arrivedyour typical oldboy pinchednostril type sent by the wife no doubt since his lordship hasnt lowered himself to request the use of a telephone from the likes of me or nkata weve got him in one of the interrogation rooms but unless someone comes up with a piece of hard evidence or a witness in double time were in serious trouble so where in gods name have you taken yourself porthill green he cut off her protest with listen to me im not going to argue that stinhurst isnt involved in joys death but ill not leave this darrow situation unresolved lets not lose sight of the fact that joy sinclairs door was locked havers so like it or not our access route is still through helens room but weve already agreed that francesca gerrard could well have given and hannah darrows suicide note was copied from a play a play what play lynley looked across the green to the pub smoke curled from its chimney like a snake against the sky i dont know but i expect john darrow does and i think hes going to tell me where is that going to get us inspector and what am i supposed to do with his precious lordship while you jolly about the fens take him through everything once again with his solicitor present if he insists you know the routine havers plan it out with nkata vary the questions and then then let him go for the day inspector you know as well as i that we have nothing substantial on him at the moment perhaps destruction of evidence in the burning of the scripts but absolutely nothing else save the fact that his brother was a soviet spy twentyfive years ago and he himself obstructed justice in geoffreys death i hardly think its productive to our case to arrest stinhurst for that now and you cant believe his solicitor isnt going to insist that we either charge him or release him to his family we may get something more from the forensic team in strathclyde she argued we may and when that occurs well pick him up again for now weve done all we can is that clear he heard the exasperation that edged her reply and what will you have me do when i send stinhurst toddling on his way go to my office shut the door dont see anyone wait to hear from me and if webberly wants a report on our progress tell him to rot lynley replied right after you tell him were wise to special branch and mis involvement in the case he could hear havers smilein spite of herselfacross the telephone line a pleasure sir as ive always said when the ship is sinking one may as well bash a few holes in the bow when lynley asked for a ploughmans lunch and a pint of guinness john darrow looked as if he would much rather refuse the business however the presence of three dourlooking men at the bar and an elderly woman dozing over gin and bitters by the crackling fire seemed to discourage him from doing so therefore within five minutes lynley was occupying one of the tables near the window tucking into a large plate of stilton and cheddar pickled onions and crusty bread he ate calmly enough not bothered by the curiosity evidenced in the illhushed questions of the other customers local farmers no doubt they would soon be off to see to the rest of their days work leaving john darrow with no choice but to face another interview that he appeared to be doing his best to avoid indeed darrow had become decidedly congenial towards the men at the bar within moments of lynleys arrival as if an unaccustomed infusion of bonhomie into his behaviour would encourage them to linger long after they would otherwise have departed they were talking of sports at the moment a loud conversation about newcastle football that was interrupted when the pub door opened and a young boyperhaps sixteen years old hurried in from the cold lynley had seen him coming from the direction of mildenhall on an ancient motorbike whose predominant colour was mud wearing heavy work boots blue jeans and an antique leather jacketall stained liberally with what appeared to be greasethe boy had parked in front of the pub and had spent several minutes across the street admiring lynleys car and running his hand along the sleek line of its roof he had the sturdy build of john darrow but his colouring was as light as his mothers had been whose boat he called out cheerfully as he entered mine lynley replied the boy sauntered over tossing fair hair off his forehead in that selfconscious way of the young dead nice that he gazed out the window longingly set you back a few quid and continues to do so it guzzles petrol as if i were the sole support of british petroleum most of the time frankly i think about taking on your mode of transportation sorry lynley nodded towards the street your motorbike oh that the boy laughed quite a piece that got in a smash with it last week and it didnt even take a dent not that youd notice if it had its so old that youve chores to do teddy john darrow interrupted sharply see to them while his words effectively ended the conversation between his son and the london policeman they also served to remind the others of the time the farmers dropped coins and notes onto the bar the old woman by the fire gave a loud snort and awoke and within moments only lynley and john darrow were left in the pub the muted sound of rock and roll and a banging of cupboards in the fl at above them spoke of teddy seeing to his chores hes not in school lynley noted darrow shook his head hes fi nished like his mum in that didnt hold much with books your wife didnt read hannah girl never opened a book that i saw didnt even own one lynley felt in his pocket for his cigarettes lit one thoughtfully opened the file on hannah darrows death he removed her suicide note thats odd then isnt it where do you suppose she copied this from darrow pressed his lips together as he recognised the paper lynley had shown him once before ive nothing more to say ont you do im afraid lynley joined the man at the bar hannahs note in his hand because she was murdered mr darrow and i think youve known that for fi fteen years frankly up until this morning i was certain youd done the murdering yourself now im not so sure but i have no intention of leaving today until you tell me the truth joy sinclair died because she came too close to understanding what happened to your wife so if you think her death is going to be swept aside because youd rather not talk about what happened in this village in i suggest you reconsider or we can all go into mildenhall and chat with chief constable plater the three of us you and teddy and i for if you wont cooperate ive no doubt your son has some pertinent memory of his mother you leave the lad out of it hes nothing to do with this hes never known he cant know know what lynley asked the publican played with the porcelain pulls on the ale and the lager but his face was wary lynley continued listen to me darrow i dont know what happened but a sixteenyearold boy just like your sonwas brutally murdered because he came too close to a killer the same killeri swear it i feel itwho murdered your wife and i know she was murdered so for gods sake help me before someone else dies darrow stared at him dully a boy you say lynley heard rather than saw the initial crumbling of darrows defences he pressed the advantage mercilessly a boy called gowan kilbride all he wanted in life was to go to london to be another james bond a boys dream wasnt it but he died on the steps of a scullery in scotland with his face and chest scalded like cooked meat and a butcher knife in his back and if the killer comes here next wondering how much joy sinclair managed to learn from youhow in gods name will you protect your sons life or your own from a man or woman you dont even know darrow openly struggled with the weight of what lynley was asking him to do to go back into the past to resurrect to relive this in the hope that he and his son might be secure from a killer who had touched their lives with devastating cruelty so many years ago his tongue flicked across his dry lips it was a man darrow locked the pub door and they moved to a table by the fire he brought an unopened bottle of old bushmills with him twisted off the seal and poured himself a tumbler for at least a minute he drank without speaking fortifying himself for what he would ultimately have to say you followed hannah when she left the flat that night lynley guessed darrow wiped his mouth on the back of his wrist aye she was to help me and one of the local lasses in the pub so id gone upstairs to fetch her and i found a note on the kitchen table only wasnt the same note as youve there in the file was one telling me she was leaving going with some fancy nob to london to be in a play lynley felt a stirring of affi rmation and with it a nascent vindication that told him that in spite of everything he had heard from st james and helen barbara havers and stinhurst his instincts had not led him wrong after all thats all the note said darrow shook his head darkly and looked down into his glass the whisky gave off a heady smell of malt no she took me to taskas a man and did a bit of comparing so id know for certain what shed been up to and whatd made her decide to leave she wanted a real man she said one who knew how to love a woman proper please a woman in bed id never pleased her she said never but this blokeshe described how he did it to her so she said if i ever fancied having a woman in the future id know how to do it right for once like she was doing me a favour how did you know where to fi nd her saw her when i read the note i went to the window she mustve only just left a minute or two before i went up to the fl at because i saw her down at the edge of the village carrying a big case setting off on the path to the canal that runs through mildenhall fen did you think of the mill at once i thought of nothing but getting my hands on the bloody little bitch and beating her silly but after a moment i thought how much tastier it would be to follow her catch her with him and have at them both so i kept my distance she didnt see you following her it was dark i kept to the far edge of the path where the growth is thickest she turned round two or three times i thought she knew i was there but she just kept walking she got a bit ahead of me where theres a bend in the canal so i missed the turn to the mill and kept going forperhaps three hundred yards when i finally saw id lost her i fi gured where she must be headingthere was little else out thereso i doubled back quick and made my way along the track to the mill her case was lying some thirty yards down the way shed gone on without it it was dead heavy i thought shed gone on to the mill to have that bloke come back for it so i decided to wait and have at him right there on the path then id go on and see to her in the mill darrow poured himself another drink and shoved the bottle towards lynley who demurred but no one came back for the case he went on i waited some five minutes then i crept up along the path to have a better look hadnt got as far as the clearing when this bloke come out of the mill at a run he tore round the side i heard a car start and take off that was it did you get a look at him too dark i was too far away i went on to the mill after a moment and i found her he set his glass on the table hanging was she exactly as the police pictures show her aye except there was a bit of paper sticking from her coat pocket so i pulled that out it was the note i gave to the police when i read it i saw how it was meant to look like a suicide yes but it wouldnt have looked like suicide had you left her suitcase there so you brought it home with you i did i took it upstairs then i raised a cry using the note from her pocket the other note i burned in spite of what the man had been through lynley found himself feeling a sore spot of anger a life had been taken callously coldbloodedly and for fifteen years the death had gone unavenged but why did you do all that he asked surely you wanted her murderer brought to justice darrows look betrayed a derisive weariness youve no idea what its like in a village like this do you pommy boy youve no idea how itd feel to a man having his neighbours all know that his randy little wifed been snuffed while she was trying to leave him for some ponce she thoughtd make her feel better between her legs and not snuffed by her husband mind you which everyone in the village would have understood but by the very bastard who was poking her behind her husbands back are you trying to tell me that had i let hannah stand as murdered none of that would have come out although his voice rose incredulously darrow continued as if to shun a response at least this way teddys never had to know what his mum was really like as far as i was concerned hannah was dead and teddys peace of mind was worth letting her murderer go free better his mother should be a suicide than his father a cuckold lynley enquired darrow pounded a fist hard onto the stained table between them aye for its me hes been living with these fifteen years its me hes to look in the eye every day and when he does he sees a man by god not some puling fairy who couldnt hold a woman to her marriage vows and do you think that bloke could have held on to her any better he poured more liquor spilling it carelessly when the bottle slipped against the glass he promised her acting coaches lessons a part in some play but when that all fell through how much fl aming a part in a play coaches lessons how do you know that was it in her note jerking himself towards the fire darrow didnt answer but lynley suddenly saw a sure reason why joy sinclair must have made ten telephone calls to him what she had been insistently seeking in her conversation with the man no doubt in his anger he had inadvertently revealed to her the existence of a source of information she desperately needed to write her book is there a record darrow are there diaries a journal there was no response good god man youve come this far do you know her killers name no then what do you know how do you know it still darrow watched the fi re impassively but his chest heaved with repressed emotion diaries he said girl was always too bloody full of herself she wrote everything down they were in her valise with all her other things lynley took a desperate shot knowing that if he phrased it as a question the man would claim he had destroyed them years ago give the diaries to me darrow i cant promise that teddy will never learn the truth about his mother but i swear to you that he wont learn it from me darrows chin lowered to his chest how can i he muttered lynley pressed further i know joy sinclair brought everything back to you i know she caused you grief but for gods sake did she deserve to die alone with an eighteeninch dagger plunged through her neck who of us deserves that kind of death what crime committed in life is worth that kind of punishment and gowan what about the boy hed done absolutely nothing yet he died as well darrow think man you cant let their deaths count for nothing and then there were no more words to be said there was only waiting for the man to decide the fire popped once a large ember dislodged and fell from the grate to roll against the fender above them darrows son continued with his chores after an agonising pause the man raised his heavy head come up to the flat he said tonelessly the flat was reached by an outer rather than an inner stairway running up the rear of the building below it a gravelstrewn path led through the tangled mass of a forlorn garden to a gate beyond which the endless stretch of fields lay broken only by an occasional tree a canal the hulking shape of a windmill on the horizon everything was colourless under the melancholy sky and the air carried upon its rich peaty scent an acknowledgement of the generations of flooding and decay that had gone into the composition of this desolate part of the country in the distance drainage pumps rhythmically tuhtumped opening the door john darrow admitted lynley into the kitchen where teddy was on his hands and knees with scouring pads rags and a pail of water seeing to the interior of a grimy oven well past its youth the fl oor surrounding him was damp and dirty from the radio on a counter a male singer squawked in a catarrhal voice at their entrance teddy looked up from his toil grimacing disarmingly waited too long on this mess dad id do a sight better with a chisel im afraid he grinned wiping his hand on his face and laying a streak of something sludgy from cheekbone to jaw darrow spoke to him with gruff affection get below with you lad see to the pub the oven can wait the boy was more than agreeable he hopped to his feet and flicked off the radio ill take a few rubs at it every day shall i that way again the grin we might have it cleaned by next christmas he sketched a lighthearted salute in the air and left them when the door closed on the boy darrow spoke to lynley ive her things in the attic ill thank you to look through them up there so teddy wont come upon you and want to have a look for himself its cold youll want your coat but at least theres a light he led the way through a meagrely furnished sitting room and down a shadowy hall off of which the flats two bedrooms opened at the end of this a recessed trapdoor in the ceiling gave them access to the attic darrow shoved the door upwards and pulled down a collapsible metal stairway fairly new by the look of it as if reading lynleys mind he said i come up here time and again whenever i need reminding reminding darrow responded to the question drily when i feel the urge for a woman then i have a look through hannahs diaries that cures the itch like nothing else he heaved himself up the stairs the attic bore qualities not entirely unlike those of a tomb it was eerily still airless and only slightly less cold than the outofdoors dust hung thickly upon cartons and trunks and sudden movements sent clouds of it fl ying upwards in suffocating bursts it was a small room filled with the scent of age those vague odours of camphor of musty clothing of damp and rotting wood a weak shaft of afternoon light sifted its way through a single heavily streaked window near the roof darrow pulled on a cord hanging from the ceiling and a bulb cast a cone of light onto the floor beneath it he nodded towards two trunks that sat on either side of a single wooden chair lynley noted that neither chair nor trunks were dusty he wondered how often darrow paid visits to this sepulchre of his marriage her thingsre in no sort of order the man said as i wasnt much concerned with what i did with everything the night she died i just dumped the case out into her chest of drawers as fast as i could before getting the village up to search then later after the funeral i packed everything up in those two trunks why did she wear two coats and two sweaters that night greed inspector she couldnt fi t anything more into her case so if she wanted to take them she had to wear or carry them i suppose wearing seemed easier it was cold enough darrow took a set of keys from his pocket and unlocked the trunks on either side of the chair he shoved the top off each and then said ill leave you to it the diary you wants on the top of the stack when darrow was gone lynley put on his reading spectacles but he did not reach at once for the five bound journals that lay on top of the clothes rather he began by examining her other belongings developing an idea of what hannah darrow had been like her clothes were of the sort that are cheaply made with the hope of passing themselves off as expensive they were showybeaded sweaters clingy skirts short gauzy dresses cut very low trousers with narrow legs and fl ared bottoms and zips in the front when he examined these he saw how the material stretched and pulled away from the metal teeth she had worn her clothes tight moulded to her body a large plastic case gave off the strange odour of animal fat it held a variety of inexpensive cosmetics and creamsa painters box of eyeshadows half a dozen tubes of very dark lipstick an eyelash curler mascara three or four kinds of lotion a package of cotton wool tucked into a pocket was a fi ve months supply of birth control pills one set of the pills was partially used a shopping bag from norwich contained a collection of new lingerie but here again her selections were tawdry an uneducated girls idea of what a man might find seductive insubstantial bikini panties of scarlet black or purple lace overhung with garter belts of the same material and colour diaphanous brassieres cut low to the nipple and decorated with strategically placed coy little bows slithering petticoats slit to the waist two nightgowns designed identically without bodices and merely concocted with two wide satin straps that crisscrossed from waist to shoulders covering nothing much at all underneath this was a stack of photographs looking through them lynley saw that they were all of hannah herself each one showing her off at her best whether she was posing on a stile laughing down from horseback or sitting on the beach with the wind in her hair perhaps they were to be publicity photographs or perhaps she had needed reassurance that she was pretty or validation that she existed at all lynley picked up the journal on top of the stack its cover was cracked with age several of the pages were stuck together and a number of others had become swollen with the damp he leafed through them carefully until he found the final entry onethird of the way through written on march it was the same childish handwriting that was on the suicide note but unlike that note this work was rich with misspellings and other errors its settled im leaving tommorrow night im so glad its fi nally decided between us we talked and talked tonight for hours to get it all planned out when it was decided for good and all i wanted to love him but he said no weve not enough time han and for a moment i thought praps he was angry becouse he even pushed my hand away but then he smiled that melty smile of his and said darling love well have plenty of time for that every night of the week once we get to london london london this time tommorrow he said his flats ready and that hes taken care of everything i cannt think how im going to get threw tommorrow thinking about him darling love darling love lynley looked up his eyes on the attics single window and on the dust motes that fl oated in its weak oblong of light he had not considered the possibility that he might feel even slightly moved by the words of a woman so long dead a woman who painted herself with a garish array of colours dressed herself with an eye for lubricity and still managed to become caught up with excitement at the idea of a new life in a city that was for her a place of promise and dreams yet her words had indeed touched him somehow with her buoyant confidence she was like a waterstarved plant thriving for the very fi rst time under someones skill and attention even in addressing herself awkwardly to sensuality she wrote with an unconscious innocence unschooled in the world hannah darrow had ultimately made herself the perfect victim he began to flip forward through the journal skimming the entries looking for the point at which her relationship with the unidentified man began he found it on january and as he read he felt the fi re of certainty begin its slow burn through his veins had the best time ever in norwich today which is fair hard to beleive after the row with john me and mum went to shop there as she said that should cheer me up proper we stopped in for aunt pammy and took her along as well shed been tippling again since the morning and smelled of ginit was awful at lunch we saw a playbill and pammy said we owed ourselfs a treat so she took us to the play mostly i think becouse she wanted to sleep it off which she did with proper snoring till the man behind her kicked her seat i was never at a play befor can you credit that it was about some dutchess who gets passed a dead mans hand and then ends up getting strangled and then everyone stabs each other and one man kept talking about being a wolf quite a piece i say but the customes were real pretty ive never seen nothing like them all these long gowns and head pieces the ladys so pretty and the men wearing funny tights with little pouches in front and in the end they gave the dutchess lady fl owers and people stood and clapped i read in the programe whear they travel all round the country doing plays fancy that made me want to do somthing as well i hate being stuck in pgreen somtimes the pub makes me want to scream and john wants to do it to me all the time and i just dont want it anymore ive not been right since the baby but he wont beleive me there followed a week in which she wearily catalogued her life in the village a round of doing laundry seeing to the babys needs talking to her mother on the telephone daily cleaning the flat working in the pub she seemed to have no female friends nothing other than work and television occupied her time on january lynley found the next pertinent entry somthing happened i can harly beleive it even when i think about it i lied and told john i was bleeding again and had to see the doctor a new doctor in norwich a specalist i said said id stop by aunt pammys for supper as well so he was not to worry if i was late i cant think why i was clever enough to say that i just wanted to see that play again and those customes i didnt get a very good seat i was way in the back without my specs and it was a different play dead boring with lots of people talking about getting married or moving away and these three ladys hating the woman there brother married funny thing is that it was the same actors and they were all so different from the other play i cant think how they dont get mixed up after it was over i went round to the back i just thought praps i could say a word to one or two of them or have them sign my programe i waited for an hour but everyone came out in couples or groups only bloke was alone i dont know who he played becouse like i said my seat was too far back but i wanted him to sign my programe only i got nervous so i followed him i cant think what made me do it but he went to a pub and got himself a meal and drank and i watched him and finally i just walked up and said your in that play arent you will you sign my programe just like that cor he was hansome he was real suprised so he asked me to sit down and we got to talking about the theatre and he said hes been involved in it for lots of years i told him how much i liked the dutchess play and how pretty the customes were and he said did i want to come back to the theatre and have a real look at them he said they werent much to look at up close he said i could probaly even try a custome on if no one was about so we went back there its so big behind the stage i didnt know what to think all these dressing rooms and waiting areas and tables filled with props and the sets there made of wood and they look just like stones we went into a dressing room and he showed me this row of customes they were velvet i never touched nothing so soft ever so he said do you want to try it on no one will know and i did only when i took it off my hair got caught in it and he worked it loose and then he started kissing my neck and running his hands all over me and there was this couch thing in the corner but he said no no right now on the fl oor and he pulled down all the gowns and we made love in the middle of them afterwards we heard a womans voice in the theatre and i was real scared and he said i dont bloody care who it is oh god i dont care i dont care and he laughed so happy and started in on me again and it didnt even hurt i was hot and cold and things happened inside and he laughed again and said silly girl thats how its sposed to be he asked me will i come to him next weekwill i i got home after midnight but john was still down in the pub so he didnt know i hope he dosent want it i cant think but itll still hurt with him the next five days in the journal were refl ections on the norwich lovemaking the sort of dramatic nonsense that lives in a young girls head the first time a man fully awakens her to the joysrather than the dutiesof the fl esh the sixth day took her thoughts in another direction it was dated january he wont be there forever its a touring company and there off in march i cant bear the thought i shall see him tommorrow i shall try to get his home address john asks why im off to norwich again and i said i have to see the doctor i said i have a bad pain inside and the doctor said he was not to touch me for a while till it goes away how long he wanted to know what kind of pain i said when you do it to me it hurts and the doctor said thats not right so your not to do it to me until the pain stops ive not been right since teddys birth i told him i dont know if he beleives me but hes not touched me thank god on the next page she reported her meeting with her lover he took me to his rooms well there not much just a grotty bedsit in an old house near the cathedral he dosent have harly anything in it becouse his real digs are in london and i cant think why hes taken a place so far from the theatre he says he likes to walk besides he said with that smile of his we dont need much do we he undressed me right by the door and we did it fi rst standing then after i told him i knew he was leaving in march with the theatre group i said i thought i could be an actress it dosent look hard i could do as well as those ladys ive seen he said yes that i ought to think about it that he could see to it i got acting lessons and a coach and then i said i was hungry and could we go out for somthing to eat and he said he was hungry as wellbut not for food apparently for the next week hannah had no contact with the man but she spent most of her time planning out a future with him it centred itself on the theatre which was to be the way she tied herself to him and escaped porthill green she wrote briefly about her plans on february he cares for me he said as much mum would say all men say that when there having a grind and you just as well not trust them till there trousers are up but this is different i know he means it so ive thought it out and it seems the best way is to join the company i wouldent expect a big part at first i dont know much about what to do but i could memerise easy enough and if im in the company we wont have to worry about being apart i dont want to lose him i gave him the number so he could ring me here in the flat but he hasent yet i know hes busy but if he dosent ring me by tommorrow im going back to norwich to see him ill wait by the theatre her visit to norwich was not recorded until february lots has happened i did go into norwich i waited and waited outside the theatre then he came out but he wasnt alone he was with one of the ladys in the play and another man they were talking together like it was some sort of argument i said his name at first he didnt here me so i went up to him and touched him on the armthey went all just sort of dead when i did thatthen he smiled and said hello i didnt see you there have you been waiting long excuse me for a moment and he and the lady and the other man went to a car the lady and man got in and left but he came back to me he was mad i could tell but i said why didnt you interduce me to them and he said what are you doing here without letting me know your coming and i said why should i are you embrassed of me and he said dont be a little fool dont you know im trying to get you into the company but i cannt make a move too soon before your ready these are professonals and they wont accept anyone whos not a professonal as well so start acting like one so i started to cry and he said oh damn han dont do that come on so we went to his rooms lord i was there till am i went back the day before yesterday and he said he was working on an awdition for me but i would have to learn a very hard scene from a play i was hoping it would be the dutchess play but it was the other one he said to copy the part down and then to memerise it it seemed awfully long and i asked why i had to write it why couldent he just give me a script but he said there arent enough and it would be missed and then they would know and my awdition wouldent be a surprise so i copied but i didnt get it done and will have to go back tommorrow we made love he didnt seem to want to at first but he was happy enough after we did it lynley did not miss the perfunctory quality of the girls final statements and he wondered that she did not notice it herself but apparently she had been too intent upon joining the theatrical company and starting life with a new man to notice the moment that lovemaking became simply an expected routine her next entry was on february teddy was ill for days bad john went on and on about it till i thought i would scream but i got away x to finish copying that old script i dont know why i just cant have one but he says they would know he says just to memerise my part and not to worry about how to act it he says hell show me how to act it of course he should know thats what hes good at anyway its only pages so what im going to do is suprise him ill act it for him then he wont have any douts about me sometimes i think he dose have douts except when we go to bed he knows how mad i am for him i can harly be round him without wanting to take off his close he likes that he says oh god hannah you know what i like dont you you really know how better than anyone your better than anything then he forgets what were talking about and we do it hannah had devoted her next several entries to a detailed description of their lovemaking these pages were heavily thumbed no doubt the section that john darrow turned to whenever he wanted to remember his wife in the worst possible light for she was meticulous in description omitting nothing and at the last comparing her husbands endowments and his performance with those of her lover it was a brutal evaluation nothing that a man would get over very quickly it gave lynley an idea of what her farewell note to john darrow must have been like the penultimate entry was on march ive been practicing all week when johns down in the pubteddy watches me from his cot and laughs something wicked to see his mum prancing round like a russion lady but ive got it down was dead easy that and in nights im off to norwich so we can decide what to do and when im to have my awdition i can harly wait im lonely for him right now john was on me like a pig this morning he said its been months since the doctor said he couldent and he was threw with waiting for him to say he could it almost made me sick when he put his tong in my mouth he tasted like shit i swear it he said thats better now isnt it han and he did me so hard i tried not to crywhen i think that till months ago i thought thats what it was sposed to be like and i was just sposed to put up with it i have to laugh now i know better and ive decided to tell john befor i leave he deserves it after this morning he thinks hes such a man if he only knew what a real man and i do to each other in bed hed probaly faint god i dont know if i can wait more days to see him again i miss him so i do love him lynley snapped the journal closed as hannah darrows comments came together in his mind like a puzzle finally completed prancing around like a russian lady a play about a man who gets married whose sisters hate his wife people talking endlessly about moving away or marrying and the poster itselfas big as lifeon lord stinhursts offi ce wall the three sisters norwich the life and death of hannah darrow he began searching through the rest of her belongings digging past clothes and handbags and gloves and jewellery but he did not fi nd what he was looking for until he turned to the second trunk there at the bottom past sweaters and shoes beneath a girlhood scrapbook filled with clippings and mementoes was the old theatre programme he had prayed to fi nd hannahs wirerimmed spectacles hooked onto its cover designed with a diagonal stripe across the front to serve as division between the two pieces that the company were doing in repertory the programme was fashioned with stark letters white upon black on the top half and the reverse on the bottom the duchess of malfi and the three sisters impatiently lynley skimmed through the pages looking for the cast but when he came to it he stared incredulously scarcely believing the obscene twist of mocking chance that had governed the casting of the performances for with the exception of irene sinclair and the addition of actors and actresses in whom he had no interest everyone else was absolutely the same joanna ellacourt robert gabriel rhys daviesjones and to complicate matters further jeremy vinney in a minor role no doubt the swan song of a brief career on the stage lynley tossed the programme to one side he got up from the chair and paced across the little room rubbing his forehead there had to be something that he had not noticed in the few entries hannah had made about her lover something that revealed his identity in even an oblique fashion something lynley himself had already read without realising what it meant he returned to his chair picked up the journal and began it all again it was not until the fourth time through that he found it he says hell show me how to act it of course he should know thats what hes good at the words implied only two possibilities the director of the production or the actor who was in the scene from which hannahs suicide note had been drawn the director would be skilled in showing an untutored girl the rudiments of a performance an actor from the same scene would be able to show her how to play the role with ease since he had been performing opposite an actress doing it for several weeks a quick survey of the programme told lynley that lord stinhurst had been the director he scored a point for sergeant havers intuition now all that was left was to fi nd out where in the three sisters the suicide note belonged and who played the roles in that scene for he could visualise it nowhannah going to the mill to meet her lover in her pocket the eight pages of script that she had meticulously copied by hand for her audition and the man who killed her who took those eight pages tore off the single part that would look like a suicide note and took the rest with him leaving her body hanging from the ceiling lynley closed the trunks turned off the light and grabbed the stack of journals and the programme downstairs in the flat he found teddy in the sitting room with his feet propped up on a cheap foodsplattered coffee table eating fi sh fi ngers from a blue tin plate a pint of ale stood on the floor half drunk a small colour television was tuned in to a sports programme downhill skiing by the look of it seeing lynley the boy hopped to his feet and turned off the television have you any books of plays in the fl at lynley asked although he was fairly certain what the reply would be books of plays the boy repeated with a shake of his head not a one youre sure you want a book weve records and such magazines as well he seemed to realise as he spoke that lynley was not looking for sources of entertainment dad says youre a cop says im not to talk to you something you appear to be disregarding for the moment the boy made a wry face and nodded towards the journals under lynleys arm about mum isnt it ive read m you see dad left the keys one night ive been through m all he rolled onto the balls of his feet awkwardly driving one hand into the pocket of his blue jeans we dont talk about it dont think dad could but if you catch this bloke will you let me know lynley hesitated the boy spoke again she was my mum you know she wasnt perfect wasnt no ladeda type but she was my mum all the same she didnt do bad to me and she didnt kill herself no she didnt that lynley headed for the door he paused there and thought of a way he might answer the boys need you watch the papers teddy when weve got the man who killed joy sinclair thatll be the man you want will you get him for my mum as well inspector lynley considered lying to save the boy from facing yet another harsh reality but as he studied his friendly anxious face he knew he couldnt do so not unless he confesses the boy nodded with childish sophistication although his jaw tightened whitely he said with deliberate and painful carelessness no evidence i suppose no evidence but its the same man teddy believe me the boy turned back to the television i remember her a bit is all he fi ddled with a knob without turning on the set do get him he said in a low voice rather than stop in mildenhall and run the risk of wasting time finding no public library lynley drove on to newmarket where he knew there would be one once there however he spent twenty minutes fighting his way through the late afternoon traffic until he found the building he was looking for at a quarter past five he parked illegally left his police identifi cation in plain sight propped against the steering wheel and hoped for the best concerned that it had begun to snow knowing that every moment was precious as a result of this he dashed up the steps into the library with the norwich theatre programme folded into a pocket of his overcoat the building smelled powerfully of beeswax old paper and a central heating system that was sadly overworked it was a place of high windows dark bookcases brass table lamps fitted out with tiny white shades and an enormous ushaped circulation desk behind which a welltailored man in large spectacles pumped information into a computer this last looked gratingly outofplace in the otherwise antique environment but at least it made no noise lynley strode to the card catalogue and hunted through it for chekhov within fi ve minutes he was sitting down at one of the long battleworn tables with a copy of the three sisters opened in front of him he began scanning it at first reading only the first line of each speech midway through the play however he realised that from the length of the speeches and the way the suicide note had been torn what hannah had written might well have come from the middle of a speech he began again more slowly yet all the while anxiously aware of the bad weather outside that would impede the fl ow of traffic to london aware of the time that was passing and what might be happening in the city while he was gone it took him nearly thirty minutes to find the speech ten pages into act he read the words once then a second time to make sure what trifl es what silly little things in life will suddenly for no reason at all take on meaning you laugh at them just as youve always done consider them trivial and yet you go on and you feel that you havent the power to stop oh lets not talk about that i feel elated i see these fi r trees these maples and birches as if for the fi rst time and they all gaze at me with curiosity and expectationwhat beautiful trees and in fact how beautiful life ought to be with them i must go its timetheres a tree thats dead but it goes on swaying in the wind with the others so it seems to me that if i die ill still have a part in life one way or another goodbye my darlingthe papers you gave me are on my table under the calendar the speaker had not been one of the women as lynley had originally supposed but one of the men baron tuzenbach speaking to irina in the final moments of the play lynley pulled the norwich programme out of his pocket opened it to the cast ran his finger down the page and found what he had dreadedand hopedto see rhys daviesjones had indeed played tuzenbach to joanna ellacourts irina jeremy vinneys ferapont and robert gabriels andrei in that winter of it was at last the verification he had sought for what better man to know how a set of lines could be used than the man who had said them night after night the man helen trusted the man she loved and believed to be innocent lynley shelved the book and went in search of a telephone for the entire day lady helen had known that she should have felt exultant after all they had done what she had been determined they should do they had proven tommy wrong through their explorations into lord stinhursts background they had proven nearly every suspicion against rhys daviesjones in the deaths of joy sinclair and gowan kilbride to be without merit they had in doing so altered the entire direction of the case so when sergeant havers telephoned st james at noon with the information that stinhurst had been brought in for interrogation that he had admitted to the truth about his brothers involvement with the soviets lady helen knew that she should have been swept up in a tide of jubilation shortly after two she had left st james house had spent the remainder of the day in preparation for her evening with rhys an evening that would be one of loving celebration she had prowled the streets of knightsbridge for hours in search of the perfect sartorial accompaniment to her mood except that soon enough she found that she wasnt at all sure of her mood she wasnt sure of anything she told herself at first that the welter she was in arose from the fact that stinhurst had admitted to nothing in the deaths of joy sinclair and gowan kilbride but she knew she could not hold on to that lie for long for if strathclyde cid were able to turn up a hair a spot of blood or a latent fi ngerprint to tie the scotland deaths to stinhurst she would then have to face what was really at the centre of her turmoil today and at the centre was not an argument over one mans guilt and another mans innocence at the centre was tommy his despairing face his final words to her last night yet she knew quite distinctly that whatever pain tommy felt couldnt be allowed to matter to her now for rhys was innocent innocent and she had clung so tenaciously to that belief for the past four days that she could not let it go long enough to think of anything else could not let herself be turned in any other direction but his she wanted rhys cleared completely in everyones eyes wanted him to be seen for what he truly wasand seen by everyone not just by her it was after seven when her taxi drew up to her flat on onslow square snow was falling heavily wave after silent wave of it drifting from the east into soft piles along the iron fence that bordered the green at the centre of the square when lady helen stepped into the frosty air and felt the sweet sting of fl akes against her cheeks and eyelashes she spent a moment admiring the change that fresh snow always brought to the city then shivering she scooped up her packages and ran up the tiled front steps of the building that housed her flat she fumbled in her handbag for her keys but before she could fi nd them the door was swung open by her maid who drew her inside hastily caroline shepherd had been with lady helen for the past three years and although she was five years younger than her employer she was passionately devoted to lady helens every interest so she minced no words when the cold night air caught at her cloud of black hair as she slammed the door home thank god ive been that worried about you do you know its gone seven and lord ashertons been ringing again and again and again this past hour and mr st james as well and that lady sergeant from scotland yard and mr daviesjones has been here these last forty minutes waiting for you in the drawing room lady helen dimly heard it all but acknowledged only the last she handed her packages over to the younger woman as they hurried up the stairs lord am i really as late as that rhys must wonder whats become of me and its your evening off isnt it i am sorry caroline have i made you dreadfully late are you seeing denton tonight will he forgive me caroline smiled hell see his way to that if i encourage him proper ill just pop these in your room and be on my way lady helen and caroline occupied the largest flat in the building seven rooms on the fi rst floor with a large drawing room that overlooked the square below here the curtains were undrawn and rhys daviesjones stood at the french doors that spilled light onto a small balcony crusted with snow he turned when lady helen entered theyve had stinhurst at scotland yard for most of the day he said his brow furrowed she hesitated at the door yes i know do they actually thinki cant believe that helen ive known stuart for years he couldnt have she swiftly crossed the room to him youve known all these people for years havent you rhys yet one of them did kill her one of them killed gowan but stuart no i cantgood god why he asked fi ercely the rooms lighting placed part of his body in shadow so she could not see him distinctly but she could hear in his voice the insistent plea for trust and she did indeed trust him she knew that without a doubt but even so she couldnt bring herself to delineate for him all the details of stinhursts family and background for doing that would ultimately reveal lynleys humiliation all the errors in judgement he had made over the past few days and for the sake of the long friendship she had shared with lynleyno matter that it might well be dead between them nowshe found that she could not bear to expose him to the possibility of anyones derision deserved or not ive thought about you all day she answered simply laying her hand on his arm tommy knows youre innocent ive always known that and were here together now what else really matters at the heart of it she felt the change in his body even as she spoke his tension dissolved he reached for her his face melting warming with his lovely smile oh god nothing nothing at all helen only you and i he pulled her to him kissing her whispering only the single word love no matter the horrors of the past few days they were over now it was time for going on he drew her away from the windows to the couch that sat in front of a low fi re at the opposite end of the room pulling her down next to him he kissed her again with more assurance with a rising passion that kindled her own after a long while he lifted his head and ran his fingers in a featherlike touch along the line of her jaw and across her neck this is madness helen ive come to take you to dinner and i find that all i can manage to think about is taking you to bed at once im rather ashamed to admit wed best be off before i lose interest in dinner altogether she lifted a hand to his cheek smiling fondly when she felt its heat at her gesture he murmured bent to her again his fingers working loose the buttons of her blouse then his mouth moved warmly against her bare throat and shoulders his fi ngers brushed against her breasts i love you he whispered and sought her mouth again the telephone rang shrilly they jumped apart as if an intruder were present staring at each other guiltily as the telephone went unanswered it made its way through four jarring double rings before lady helen realised that caroline already two hours behind schedule on her free evening had left the flat they were entirely alone her heart still pounding she went into the hallway and lifted the receiver on its ninth ring helen thank god thank god is daviesjones with you it was lynley his voice was tightly strung with such unmistakable anxiety that lady helen froze her mind felt numb what is it where are you she knew she was whispering without even intending to do so in a call box near bishops stortford theres a bloody great wreck on the m and every back road ive tried has been done in by the snow i cant think how long its going to take me to get back to london has havers spoken to you yet have you heard from st james damn it all youve not answered me is daviesjones with you ive only just got home what is it whats wrong just answer me is he with you in the drawing room rhys was still on the couch but leaning towards the fi re watching the last of the flames lady helen could see the play of light and shadow on the planes of his face and in his curly hair but she couldnt speak something in lynleys voice warned her off he began to talk rapidly driving the words home to her with the strength of a terrifying passionate conviction listen to me helen there was a girl hannah darrow he met her when he was in the three sisters in norwich in late january of they had an affair she was married with a baby she planned to leave her husband and child to take up a life with daviesjones he convinced her that she was going to audition for the stage and she practised a part he chose for her believing that after her audition she would run off with him to london but the night they were to leave he murdered her helen and then he hanged her from a hook in the ceiling of a mill it looked like a suicide she managed only a whisper no stinhurst joys death had nothing at all to do with stinhurst she was planning to write about hannah darrow it was to be her new book but she made the mistake of telling daviesjones about it she phoned him in wales the tape recorder in her purse even had a message to herself helen reminding her to ask daviesjones how to handle john darrow hannahs husband so dont you see he knew all along that joy was writing this book he knew as early as last month so he suggested to joy that you be given the room right next to her to make sure he had access now for the love of god ive had men out looking for him since six oclock tell me if hes with you helen every force within her joined in conjunction to prevent her from speaking her eyes burned her throat closed her stomach tightened like a vise and although she fought against the vivid memory she heard rhys voice clearly those words of condemnation spoken so easily to her at westerbrae id been doing a winters season round norfolk and suffolkwhen i got back to london she was gone hannah darrow left a diary lynley was saying desperately she left the programme from the play ive seen them both ive read it all helen please darling im telling you the truth dimly lady helen saw rhys get up saw him go to the fire saw him pick up the poker he glanced in her direction his face was grave no it was impossible absurd she was in no danger not from rhys never from rhys he wasnt a murderer he had not killed his cousin he couldnt kill anyone but tommy was still speaking even as rhys began to move he arranged for her to copy a scene from the play in her own writing and then he used part of what shed copied as the suicide note but the wordsthey were from one of his own speeches in the play it was tuzenbach he was tuzenbach hes killed three people helen gowan died in my arms for the love of god answer me tell me now her lips formed the hateful word in spite of her resolve she heard herself say it yes hes there again yes are you alone yes oh god carolines out it was easy so easy such a simple word yes and as lynley continued to speak rhys turned back to the fire poked at it added another log returned to the couch watching him understanding the implications of what she had just done of the choice she had made lady helen felt tears sting at the back of her eyes felt the constriction in her throat and knew that she was lost listen to me carefully helen i want to put a tail on him until we get the fi nal forensic report from strathclyde cid i could bring him in before then but all it would amount to is another goround with nothing to show so i shall phone the met now theyll send a constable but it may take as long as twenty minutes can you keep him with you for a while do you feel safe enough with him to do that she battled against despair she could not speak lynleys own voice was torn helen answer me can you manage twenty minutes with him can you for gods sake her lips were stiff dry i can manage that easily for a moment she heard nothing more as if lynley were evaluating the exact nature of her response then he asked sharply what does he expect from you tonight she didnt reply answer me has he come to take you to bed when still she said nothing he cried helen please she heard herself whisper hopelessly well that should take up your twenty minutes nicely shouldnt it he was shouting no helen dont when she hung up the phone she stood with her head bent struggling for composure even now he was placing his call to scotland yard even now the twenty minutes had begun odd she thought that she felt no fear her heart throbbed in her ears her throat was dry but she was not afraid she was alone in the flat with a killer with tommy miles away with a snowstorm sealing off easy escape but she was not at all afraid and it came to her as hot tears seared and demanded release that she was not afraid because she no longer cared nothing mattered any longer least of all whether she lived or died barbara havers picked up the telephone in lynleys office on the second ring it was a quarter past seven and she had been sitting at his desk for over two hours smoking so steadily that her throat was raw and her nerves strung to breaking she was so relieved to hear lynleys voice at last that her release of tension gave way to hot anger but her imprecations were interrupted by the intensity of his voice havers wheres constable nkata nkata she repeated stupidly gone home get him i want him at onslow square now she stubbed out her cigarette and reached for a piece of paper youve found daviesjones hes in helens flat i want a tail on him havers but if it comes to it were going to have to bring him in how why she demanded incredulously weve virtually nothing to work with in spite of this hannah darrow angle which god knows is about as thin as what we have on stinhurst you told me yourself that every single one of them save irene sinclair was involved in that norwich production in seventythree that still includes stinhurst and besides macaskin no arguments havers ive no time at the moment just do as i say and once youve done it telephone helen keep her talking to you for at least thirty minutes more if you can do you understand thirty minutes what am i supposed to do tell her the flipping story of my life lynley made a sound of furious exasperation god damn it do as i say for once now and wait for me at the yard the line went dead havers placed the call to constable nkata sent him on his way slammed down the receiver and stared moodily at the papers on lynleys desk they comprised the fi nal information from strathclyde cidthe report on fingerprints the results of having used the fibreoptic lamp the analysis of blood stains the study of four hairs found near the bed the analysis of the cognac rhys daviesjones had taken to helens room and all of it amounted to a single nothing not one shred of evidence existed that could not be argued away by the least skilled barrister barbara faced the fact that lynley was as yet unaware of if they were going to bring daviesjonesor anyone elseto justice it was not going to be on the strength of anything they could get from inspector macaskin in scotland her name was lynette but as she sprawled beneath him writhing hotly and moaning appreciatively at his every thrust robert gabriel had to school himself to remember that had to discipline himself not to call her something else after all there had been so many over the past few months who could possibly be expected to keep them all straight but at the appropriate moment he recalled who she was the agincourts nineteenyearold apprentice set designer whose skintight jeans and thin yellow jersey now lay in the darkness on the floor of his dressing room he had discovered soon enoughand with considerable joythat she wore absolutely nothing beneath them he felt her fingernails clawing at his back and made a sound of delight although he would have vastly preferred some other method of her signalling her mounting pleasure still he continued to ride her in the manner she seemed to preferroughlyand tried his best not to breathe in the heavy perfume she wore or the vaguely oleaginous odour that emanated from her hair he murmured subtle encouragement keeping his mind occupied with other things until she had taken satisfaction and he might then seek his own he liked to think he was considerate that way better at it than most men more willing to show women a good time ohhhh dont stop i cant stand it i cant lynette moaned nor can i gabriel thought as her nails danced abrasively down his spine he was threequarters of the way through a mental recitation of hamlets third soliloquy when her ecstatic sobbing reached its crescendo her body arched she shrieked wildly her nails sank into his buttocks and gabriel made a mental note to avoid teenagers henceforth that decision was affirmed by lynettes subsequent behaviour having taken her pleasure she became an inert object passively and not so patiently waiting for him to fi nish with his own which he did quickly groaning out her name with feigned rapture at the appropriate moment and all the time as eager to bring this encounter to an end as she seemed to be perhaps the costume designer would be a likelier possibility for tomorrow he thought ohhh tha was a bit all right wasnt it lynette said with a yawn when it was over she sat up swung her legs off the couch and groped on the floor for her clothes ave you the time gabriel glanced at the luminous dial of his watch a quarter past nine he replied and in spite of his desire that she be on her way so that he could have a thorough wash he ran his hand up her back and murmured lets have another go tomorrow night lyn you drive me mad just in case the costume designer proved unattainable she giggled took his hand and placed it on her melonsized breast even at her age it was beginning to sag the result of her eschewing undergarments cant luv me usbands on the road tonight but ell be back tomorrow gabriel sat up with a jerk your husband christ why didnt you tell me you were married lynette giggled again squirming into her jeans didnt ask did you e drives a lorry gone at least three nights a week so god a lorry driver twelve or thirteen stone of muscle with the iq of a goodsized vegetable marrow listen lynette gabriel said hastily lets cool this thing off shall we i dont want to come between you and your husband he felt rather than saw her careless shrug she pulled on her jersey and shook back her hair again he caught its odour again he tried not to breathe es a bit thick she confided ell never know theres nothing to worry about as long as im there when e wants me still and all gabriel said unconvinced she patted his cheek well you jus let me know if you want another tumble you arent alf bad a bit slow is all but i spose thats due to your age isnt it my age he repeated sure she said cheerfully when a bloke gets along in years things take a bit of time to heat up dont they i understand she scrambled on the floor seen my andbag oh ere it is im off then praps well ave a go on sunday my jimll be back on the road by then that being her sole form of farewell she made her way to the door and left him in the dark my age he thought and he could hear his mothers cackle of ironic laughter she would light one of her foul turkish cigarettes regard him speculatively and try to keep her face vacant it was her analysts expression he hated her when she wore it cursing himself for having been born to a freudian what were dealing with she would say is typical in a man your age robert midlife crisis the sudden realisation of impending old age the questioning of lifes purpose the search for renewal coupled with your overactive libido this propels you to seek new ways of defi ning yourself always sexual im afraid that appears to be your dilemma which is unfortunate for your wife as she seems to be the only steadying influence available to you but you are afraid of irene arent you shes always been too much woman for you to cope with she made demands on you didnt she demands of adulthood that you simply couldnt face so you sought out her sisterto punish irene and to keep yourself feeling young but you couldnt have everything lad people who want everything generally end up with nothing and the most painful fact was that it was true all of it gabriel groaned sat up began the search for his clothes the dressingroom door opened he had only time to look in that direction to see a thick shape against the additional darkness of the hallway outside his door he had only a moment to think someones shut off all the corridor lights before a fi gure stormed across the room gabriel smelled whisky cigarettes the acrid stench of perspiration and then a rain of blows fell on his face against his chest savagely pounding into his ribs he heard rather than felt the cracking of bones he tasted blood and ate the torn tissue in his mouth where his cheek was driven into his teeth his assailant grunted with effort spewed spittle with rage and finally rasped on the fourth vicious blow between gabriels legs keep your soddin piece in your trousers from now on man gabriel thought only absolutely no teenagers next time before he lost consciousness lynley replaced the telephone and looked at barbara no answer he said barbara saw the muscle in his cheek contract what time did nkata first phone in a quarter past eight she replied where was daviesjones hed gone into an offlicence near kensington station nkata was in a call box outside and he was alone he hadnt taken helen with him youre certain of that he was alone sir but you spoke to her havers you did speak to helen after daviesjones left her fl at barbara nodded feeling a growing concern for him that she would have rather lived without he looked completely worn out she phoned me sir right after hed left saying barbara patiently repeated what she had told him once already only that hed gone i did try to keep her on the line for thirty minutes when i first phoned just as you asked but she wouldnt have it inspector she only said that shed got company and could she telephone me later and that was it i dont think she wanted my help frankly barbara watched the play of anxiety cross lynleys face she finished by saying i think she wanted to handle it alone sir perhapswell perhaps she doesnt see him as a killer yet lynley cleared his throat no she understands he pulled barbaras notes across his desk towards him they contained two sets of data the results of her interrogation of stinhurst and the fi nal information from inspector macaskin at strathclyde cid he put on his spectacles and gave himself over to reading outside his office night subdued the normal jangle of noises in the department only the occasional ringing of a telephone the quick raising of a voice the congenial burst of laughter told them that they were not alone beyond snow muffled the sounds of the city barbara sat opposite him holding hannah darrows diary in one hand and the playbill from the three sisters in the other she had read them both but she was waiting for his reaction to the material she had prepared for him during his absence in east anglia and his entanglement in traffic on the way back to london he was she saw frowning as he read and looking as if the past few days had made demands upon him that were scarring their way into his very flesh she averted her eyes and made an exercise out of considering his office pondering the ways it reflected the dichotomy of his character its shelves of books bowed to the proprieties of his job there were legal volumes forensic texts commentaries upon the judges rules and several works from the policy studies institute evaluating the effectiveness of the metropolitan police they composed a fairly standard collection for a man whose interest was well focussed on his career but the office walls inadvertently cut through this persona of professionalism and revealed a second lynley one whose nature was filled with convolutions little enough hung there two lithographs from americas southwest that spoke of an abiding love of tranquillity and a single photograph that disclosed what had lain long at the heart of the man it was of st james an old picture taken prior to the accident that had cost him the use of his leg barbara noticed the overtly innocuous details how st james stood his arms crossed leaning against a cricket bat how the left knee of his white flannels bore a large jagged tear how a grass stain made a cumulous shadow on his hip how he laughed unrestrainedly and with perfect joy summer past barbara thought summer dead forever she knew quite well why the photograph hung there she moved her eyes away from it lynleys head was bent supported by his hand he rubbed three fingers across his brow it was some minutes before he looked up removed his spectacles and met her gaze weve nothing here for an arrest he said gesturing at the information from macaskin barbara hesitated his passion on the telephone earlier that evening had so nearly convinced her of her own error in seeking an arrest of lord stinhurst that even now she thought twice before pointing out the obvious but there was no need to do so for he went on to speak of it himself and god knows we cant take daviesjones on the strength of his name in a fi fteenyearold playbill we may as well arrest any one of them if thats all the evidence we have but lord stinhurst burnt the scripts at westerbrae barbara pointed out theres still that if you want to argue that he killed joy to keep her silent about his brother yes there is still that lynley agreed but i dont see it that way havers the worst stinhurst really faced was familial humiliation if the entire story about geoffrey rintoul became known through joys play but hannah darrows killer faced exposure trial imprisonment if she wrote her book now which motive seems more logical to you perhaps barbara knew she had to suggest this carefully weve a double motive but a single killer stinhurst again he did direct the three sisters in norwich inspector he could be the man hannah darrow met and he could have gotten the key to joys bedroom door from francesca look at the facts that youve forgotten havers everything about geoffrey rintoul had been removed from joys study but everything related to hannah darroweverything that led us right to her death in was left in plain sight of course sir but stinhurst could hardly have asked the boys at mi to collect everything about hannah darrow as well that hardly applied to the governments concern did it it wasnt exactly an official secret and besides how could he have known what she had gathered on hannah darrow she merely mentioned john darrow at dinner that night unless stinhurstall right unless the killerhad actually been inside joys study prior to the weekend how would he know for sure what material she had managed to gather or managed not to gather for that matter lynley stared past her his face telling her that he was caught up in a sudden thought youve given me an idea havers he tapped his fingers against the top of his desk his eyes dropped to the journal in barbaras hand i think weve a way to manage it all without a single thing from strathclyde cid he said at last but well need irene sinclair irene sinclair he nodded thoughtfully shes our best hope she was the only one of them not in the three sisters in directed by a neighbour who had been drawn into staying with and calming her children they found irene sinclair not at her home in bloomsbury but in the waiting area of the emergency room at the nearby university college hospital when they walked in she jumped to her feet he asked for no police she cried out frantically how did youwhat are you did the doctor phone you weve been to your home lynley drew her to one of the couches that lined the walls the room was inordinately crowded filled with an assortment of illnesses and accidents manifesting themselves in selected cries and groans and retchings that pharmaceutical smell so typical of hospitals hung heavily in the air whats happened irene shook her head blindly sinking onto the couch cradling her cheek with her hand roberts been beaten at the theatre at this time of night what was he doing there going over his lines weve a second reading tomorrow morning and he said that he wanted a feeling for how he sounded on the stage lynley saw that she didnt believe the story herself was he on the stage when he was attacked no hed gone to his dressing room for something to drink someone switched off the lights and came upon him there afterwards he managed to get to a phone mine was the only number he could remember this last statement had the ring of excusing her presence not the emergency number he didnt want the police she looked at them anxiously but im glad youve come perhaps you can talk some sense into him its only too clear that he was meant to be the next victim lynley drew up an uncomfortable plastic chair to shield her from the stares of the curious havers did likewise why lynley asked irenes face looked strained as if the question confused her but something told lynley it was part of a performance designed specifi cally and spontaneously for him what do you mean what else could it be hes been beaten bloody two of his ribs are cracked his eyes are blackened hes lost a tooth who else could be responsible its not the way our killers been working though is it lynley pointed out weve a man perhaps a woman who uses a knife not fists it doesnt really look as if anyone intended to kill him then what else could it be what are you saying she drew her body straight to ask the question as if an offence had been given and would not be brooked without some form of protest i think you know the answer to that i imagine youve not told me everything about tonight youre protecting him why what on earth has he done to deserve this kind of devotion hes hurt you in every possible way hes treated you with a contempt that he hasnt bothered to hide from anyone irene listen to me she held up a hand and her agonised voice told him her brief performance was at an end please all right thats more than enough hed had a woman i dont know who she was he wouldnt say when i got there he was stillhe hadnt she stumbled for the words he couldnt manage his clothes lynley heard the admission with disbelief what had it been like for her going to him soothing his fear smelling those unmistakable odours of intercourse dressing him in the very same clothes he had torn from his body in haste to make love to another woman im trying to understand why you still feel loyalty to a man like this a man who went so far as to deceive you with your very own sister even as he spoke he considered his words considered how irene had attempted to spare robert gabriel tonight and thought back to what had been said about the night joy sinclair died he saw the pattern clearly enough youve not told me everything about the night your sister died either even in that youre protecting him why irene her eyes closed briefly hes the father of my children she replied with simple dignity protecting him protects them ultimately yes john darrow himself could not have said it better but lynley knew how to direct the conversation teddy darrow had shown him children generally discover the worst there is to know about their parents no matter how one longs to protect them your silence now does nothing but serve to protect your sisters killer he didnt he couldnt i cant believe that of robert nearly anything else god knows but not that lynley leaned towards her and covered her cold hands with his own youve been thinking he killed your sister and saying nothing about your suspicions has been your way of protecting your children sparing them the public humiliation of having a murderer for a father he couldnt not that yet you think he did why sergeant havers spoke if gabriel didnt kill your sister what you tell us can only help him irene shook her head her eyes were hollows of terrible fear not this it cant she looked at each one of them her fi ngers digging into the worn surface of her handbag she was like a fugitive determined to escape but recognising the futility of further flight when she began to speak at last her body shuddered as if an illness had taken her as in a way it had my sister was with robert that night in his room i heard them id gone to him like a foolgod why am i such a pathetic fool he and i had been in the library together earlier after the readthrough and there was a moment then when i thought that we might really go back to the way things had been between us wed been talking about our children aboutour lives in the past so later i went to roberts room meaning tooh god i dont know what i meant to do she ran a hand back through her dark hair gripping it hard at the scalp as if she wanted the pain how much more of a fool can i possibly be in one lifetime i almost walked in on my sister and robert for a second time and the funny partits almost hysterical when one really thinks about itis that he was saying exactly the same thing that he had been saying to joy that day in hampstead when i found them together come on baby come on joy come on come on and grunting and grunting and grunting like a bull lynley heard her words recognising the kaleidoscopic effect they had on the case they threw everything into a new perspective what time was this late long after one perhaps nearly two i dont actually know but you heard him youre certain of that oh yes i heard him she bent her head in shame yet after that lynley thought she would still seek to protect the man that kind of undeserved selfless devotion was beyond his comprehension he avoided trying to deal with it by asking her something altogether different do you remember where you were in march of she did not seem to take in the question at once in i wassurely i was at home in london caring for james our son he was born that january and id taken some time off but gabriel wasnt home she pondered this no i dont think he was i think he was appearing in the regionals then why what does that have to do with all this everything lynley thought he put all his resources into compelling her to listen and understand his next words your sister was getting ready to write a book about a murder that occurred in march of whoever committed that murder also killed joy and gowan kilbride the evidence we have is virtually useless irene and im afraid we need you if were to bring this creature to any kind of justice her eyes begged him for the truth is it robert i dont think so inspite of everything youve told us i simply dont see how he could have managed to get the key to her room but if he was with her that night she could have given it to him that was a possibility lynley acknowledged how to explain it and then how to align it with what the forensic report revealed about joy sinclair and how to tell irene that even if by helping the police she proved her husband innocent she would only be proving her own cousin rhys guilty will you help us he asked lynley saw her struggle with the decision and knew exactly the dilemma she faced it all came down to a simple choice her continued protection of robert gabriel for the sake of their children or her active involvement in a scheme that might bring her sisters killer to justice to choose the former she faced the uncertainty of never knowing whether she was protecting a man who was truly innocent or guilty to choose the latter however she in effect committed herself to an act of forgiveness a posthumous absolution of her sisters sin against her thus it was a choice between the living and the dead wherein the living promised only a continuation of lies and the dead promised the peace of mind that comes from a dissolution of rancour and a getting on with life on the surface it appeared to be no choice at all but lynley knew too well that decisions governed by the heart could be wildly irrational he only hoped irene had grown to see that her marriage to gabriel had been infected with the disease of his infidelities and that her sister had played only a small and unhappy role in a drama of demise that had been grinding itself out for years irene moved her fingers left damp marks on her leather handbag her voice caught then held ill help you what do i have to do spend tonight at your sisters home in hampstead sergeant havers will go with you when deborah st james answered the door to lynleys knock the next morning at half past ten her unruly hair and the stained apron she wore over her threadbare jeans and plaid shirt told him he had interrupted her in the midst of her work still her face lit when she saw him a diversion she said thank god ive spent the last two hours working in the darkroom with nothing but peach and alaska for company theyre sweet as far as dogs and cats go but not much for conversation simons right there in the lab of course but his entertainment value plunges to nothing when hes concentrating on science im so glad youve come perhaps you can rout him out for morning coffee she waited until he had removed overcoat and muffler before she touched his shoulder lightly and said are you quite all right tommy is there anything you see theyve told me a bit about it andyou dont look well are you sleeping at all have you eaten should i ask dad would you like she bit her lip why do i always babble like an idiot lynley smiled affectionately at her jumble of words gently pushed one of her fallen curls back behind her ear and followed her to the stairs she was continuing to speak simons had a phone call from jeremy vinney its put him into one of those long mysterious contemplations of his and then helen rang not fi ve minutes later below her lynley hesitated helens not here today inspite of his tone which he had endeavoured to keep guarded he saw that deborah read through the question easily her green eyes softened no shes not here tommy thats why youve come isnt it without waiting for his answer she said kindly do come up and talk to simon he knows helen better than anyone after all st james met them at the door to his laboratory an old copy of simpsons forensic medicine in one hand and a particularly grislylooking anatomical specimen in the other a human finger preserved in formaldehyde are you rehearsing a production of titus andronicus deborah asked with a laugh she took the jar and the book from her husband brushed a kiss against his cheek and said heres tommy my love lynley spoke to st james without preamble he wanted his questions to sound purely professional a natural extension of the case he knew he failed miserably st james wheres helen ive been phoning her since last night i stopped by her flat this morning whats happened to her whats she told you he followed his friend into the lab and waited impatiently for a response st james typed a quick notation into his word processor saying nothing lynley knew the other man well enough not to push for an answer when none was forthcoming he bit back his misgivings waited and let his eyes roam round the room in which helen spent so much of her time the laboratory had been st james sanctuary for years a scientific haven of computers laser printers microscopes culture ovens shelves of specimens walls of graphs and charts and in one corner a video screen on which microscopic samples of blood or hair or skin or fibre could be enlarged this last modernity was a recent addition to the lab and lynley recalled the laughter with which helen had described st james attempts to teach her how it worked just three weeks past hopeless tommy darling a video camera hooked into a microscope can you imagine my dismay my god all this computerage wizardry ive only just recently come to understand how to boil a cup of water in a microwave oven untrue of course but hed laughed all the same immediately freed of whatever cares the day had heaped upon him that was helens special gift he had to know whats happened to her whats she told you st james added another notation to the word processor examined the consequent changes in a graph on the screen and shut down the unit only what you told her he replied in a voice that was perfectly detached nothing more im afraid lynley knew how to interpret that careful tone but for the moment he refused to engage in the discussion that st james words encouraged instead he temporised with deborahs told me vinney phoned you indeed st james swung around on his stool pushed himself off it awkwardly and walked to a wellordered counter where fi ve microscopes were lined up three in use apparently no newspapers are picking up the story of the sinclair death according to vinney he turned in an article about it this morning only to have it rejected by his editor vinneys the drama critic after all lynley noted yes but when he phoned round to see if any of his colleagues were working on the murder he discovered that not one had been assigned to the story its been killed from higher up for the time being according to what hes been told until theres an arrest he was in a fair state to say the least st james looked up from a pile of slides he was organising hes after the geoffrey rintoul story tommy and a connection between that and joy sinclairs death i dont think he plans to rest until he has something in print hell never see it happen in the fi rst place theres not one accessible shred of evidence against geoffrey rintoul in the second place the principals are dead and without damned solid evidence no newspaper in the country is going to take on so potentially libelous a story against so distinguished a family as stinhursts lynley felt suddenly restless needing movement so he walked the length of the room to the windows and looked down at the garden far below like everything else it was covered with last nights snow but he saw that all the plants had been wrapped in burlap and that breadcrumbs were spread out neatly on the top of the garden wall deborahs loving hand he thought irene sinclair believes that joy went to robert gabriels room the night she died he said and sketched out the story that irene had related to him she told me last night shed been holding it back hoping to protect gabriel then joy saw both gabriel and vinney during the night lynley shook his head i dont see how its possible she cant have been with gabriel at least not in bed with him he related the autopsy information from strathclyde cid perhaps the strathclyde team have made a mistake st james noted lynley smiled at the idea with macaskin as their di what do you think the likelihood of that is certainly nothing id want to make book on last night when irene told me i thought at fi rst that she had been mistaken in what she heard gabriel with someone else thats what i thought that irene had only assumed it was joy or perhaps assumed the worst about what was going on between joy and gabriel in the room but then i thought that she might very well have been lying to me to implicate gabriel in joys death all the time protesting that she wants to protect him for her childrens sake a fine revenge that deborah noted from the doorway of her darkroom where she stood listening with a string of negatives in one hand and a magnifying glass in the other st james crisscrossed the stack of slides absently it is indeed clever as well we know from elizabeth rintoul that joy sinclair was in vinneys room so theres corroboration if elizabeths to be trusted but whos to corroborate irenes claim that joy was also with her husband gabriel of course not hell deny it hotly and no one else heard it so its left to us to decide whether to believe the philandering husband or the longsuffering wife he looked at lynley are you still certain about daviesjones lynley turned back to the window st james question brought back with stinging clarity the report he had received from constable nkata just three hours before immediately after the constables night of trailing daviesjones the information had been simple enough after leaving helens fl at he had gone into the offlicence where he purchased four bottles of liquor nkata was completely certain of the number for following the purchase daviesjones had begun to walk although the temperature had been well below freezing he appeared to notice neither that nor the snow that continued to fall instead he had kept up a brutal pace along the brompton road circling hyde park making his way up to baker street and ultimately ending at his own flat in st johns wood it had taken over two hours and as daviesjones walked he twisted off the cap of one bottle after another but in lieu of a swig of the liquid inside he had rhythmically savagely dashed the contents out into the street until hed gone through all four bottles nkata had said shaking his head at the waste of fi ne liquor now lynley thought again about daviesjones behaviour and concentrated on what it implied a man who had overcome alcoholism who was fighting for a chance to put his career and his life back together a man rigidly determined not to be defeated by anything least of all by his past hes the killer lynley said irene sinclair knew it had to be the performance of her career knew she had to gauge the proper moment without a single cue from anyone to tell her when it had arrived there would be neither an entrance nor an instance of supreme drama when every eye was focussed on her she would have to forego both of those pleasures for the theatre of the real and it began after the companys lunch break when she and jeremy vinney arrived at the agincourt theatre simultaneously she was alighting from a cab just as vinney dodged through the heavy traffic to cross the street from the café a horn sounded its warning and irene looked up vinney was carrying his overcoat rather than wearing it and seeing this she wondered if his departure from the café had been prompted hastily by her own arrival the journalist verifi ed this himself with his first words they were tinged with what sounded like malicious excitement someone got to gabriel last night i understand irene stopped her hand on the theatre door her fi ngers were curled tightly round its handle and even through her gloves she could feel the sharp stab of icy metal there didnt seem to be a point to questioning how vinney had come upon the news robert had managed to get himself to the theatre this morning for the second reading in spite of taped ribs a black eye and five stitches in his jaw the news of his beating had travelled through the building within minutes of his arrival and although cast members crew designers and production assistants had smote the air with their hot exclamations of outrage any one of them could have surreptitiously phoned vinney with the story especially if any of them felt the need to engineer a spate of embarrassing public notoriety that would enable them to settle a private score or two with robert gabriel are you asking me about this for publication irene asked hugging herself against the cold she entered the theatre vinney followed no one appeared to be about the building was hushed only the persistent odour of burnt tobacco gave evidence that the actors and staff had been meeting all that morning what did he tell you about it and no this isnt for publication then why are you here she kept her brisk pace towards the auditorium with vinney dogging her stubbornly he caught her arm and stopped her just short of the heavy oak doors because your sister was my friend because i cant get a single word from anyone at the met in spite of their long afternoon with our melancholy lord stinhurst because i couldnt get stinhurst on the phone last night and ive an editor who says i cant write a syllable about any of this until weve some sort of miraculous clearance from above to do so everything about the mess stinks to heaven or doesnt that concern you irene his fi ngers dug into her arm what a filthy thing to say i come by it naturally i get particularly filthy when people i care for are murdered and life just cranks on with merely a nod of acknowledgement to mark it sudden anger choked her and you think i dont care about what happened to my sister i think youre delighted as hell he replied the crowning glory would have been to be the one to plunge the knife yourself irene felt the cruel shock of his words felt the colour drain from her face my god thats not true and you know it she said hearing how close her voice was to breaking she jerked away from him and dashed into the auditorium only imperfectly aware of the fact that he followed her that he took a seat in the darkness of the last row like a lurking nemesis champion of the dead the confrontation with vinney was exactly what she had not needed prior to meeting with the cast members again she had hoped to use all of her lunch hour to reflect upon how she would perform the role that sergeant havers had schooled her for last night now however she felt her heart pounding her palms sweating and her mind taken up with a violent denial of vinneys fi nal accusation it was not true she swore that to herself again and again as she approached the empty stage yet the turmoil she felt would not be stilled by such a simple expedient as denial and knowing how much rested on her ability to perform today she fell back upon an old technique from drama school she took her place at the single table in the centre of the stage brought her folded hands to her forehead and closed her eyes thus it proved nothing at all for her to move into character a few moments later when she heard approaching footsteps and her cousins voice are you all right irene rhys daviesjones asked she looked up managing a weary smile yes fine a bit tired im afraid that would be enough for now others began to arrive irene heard rather than saw them mentally ticking off each persons entrance as she listened for signs of strain in their voices signs of guilt signs of increased anxiety robert gabriel gingerly took his place next to her he fingered his swollen face with a rueful smile ive not had a chance to say thank you for last night he said in a tender voice im well im sorry about it renie im most wretchedly sorry about everything in fact i would have said something when the doctors had finished with me but youd already gone i rang you up but james said you were at joys in hampstead he paused for a reflective moment renie i thoughti did hope we might she cut him off no there was a great deal of time for me to think last night robert and i did that clearly at last gabriel took in her tone and turned his head away i can guess what kind of thinking you accomplished at your sisters he said with aggrieved fi nality the arrival of joanna ellacourt allowed irene to avoid an answer she swept up the aisle between her husband and lord stinhurst as david sydeham was saying we want fi nal approval of all the costumes stuart its not part of the original contract i know but considering everything thats already happened i think were within our rights to negotiate a new clause joanna feels joanna did not wait for her husband to argue the merits of their case id like the costumes to reflect who the starring role belongs to she said pointedly with a cool glance at irene stinhurst did not reply to either of them he looked and moved like a man ageing rapidly managing the stairs seemed to drain him of energy he appeared to be wearing the very same suit shirt and tie that hed had on yesterday the charcoal jacket rumpled its sleeves badly creased as if hed given up interest in his appearance entirely watching him irene wondered with a chill if he would even live to see this production open when he took his chair with a nod of acknowledgement towards rhys daviesjones the new reading began they were midway through the play when irene allowed herself to drop off to sleep the theatre was so warm the atmosphere on the stage was so close their voices rose and fell with such hypnotic rhythm that she found it easier than she had supposed it would be to let herself go she stopped worrying about their willingness to believe in the role she was playing and became the actress she had been years ago before robert gabriel had entered her life and undermined her confi dence with year after year of public and private humiliation she even felt herself beginning to dream when joanna ellacourts voice snapped angrily for gods sake would someone wake her up ive no intention of trying to work my way through this with her sitting there like a drooling grandmother snoring at a kitchen fi re renie irene she opened her eyes with a start pleased to feel the rush of embarrassment sweep over her did i drop off im terribly sorry late night sweetie joanna asked tartly yes im afraidi irene swallowed smiled flickeringly to mask pain and said i spent most of the night going through joys things in hampstead stunned astonishment met this announcement irene felt pleased to see the effect her words had upon them and for a moment she understood jeremy vinneys anger how easily indeed they had forgotten her sister how conveniently their lives had moved on but not without a stumbling block for someone she thought and began to construct it with every power available to her she brought tears into her eyes there were diaries you see she said hollowly as if instinct alone told her that she was in the presence of a performance capable of upstaging her own joanna ellacourt sought their attention again no doubt an account of joys life makes absolutely fascinating reading she said but if youre awake now perhaps this play will be fascinating as well irene shook her head she allowed her voice to raise a degree no no that isnt it you see they werent hers they had come by express yesterday and when i opened them and found the note from the husband of that wretched woman who had written them for gods sake is this really necessary joannas face was white with anger i started to read i didnt get very far but i saw that they were what joy had been waiting for to do her next book the one she talked about just the other night in scotland and suddenlyi seemed to realise that she was really dead that she wouldnt ever be back irenes tears began to fall becoming suddenly copious as she felt the fi rst swelling of genuine grief her next words only marginally touched upon the script that she and sergeant havers had so painstakingly prepared she was rambling she knew it but the words had to be said and nothing else mattered but saying them so shell never write it now and i felt as ifwith hannah darrows diaries sitting there in her housei ought to write the book for her if only i could as a means of saying thatin the end i understood how it happened between them i did understand oh it hurt god it was agony all the same but i understood and i dont thinkshe was always my sister i never told her that oh god i cant go back there now that shes dead and then having done it she let herself weep understanding at last the source of her tears mourning the sister she had loved but forgiven too late mourning the youth she had wasted in devotion to a man who fi nally meant nothing to her she sobbed despairingly for the years gone and the words unspoken caring for nothing at last but this act of grief across from her joanna ellacourt spoke again this cuts it cant any of you do something with her or is she going to blubber for the rest of the day she turned to her husband david she insisted but sydeham was gazing out into the theatre weve a visitor he said their eyes followed his marguerite rintoul countess of stinhurst was standing midway down the centre aisle she waited only as long as it took to close the door to her husbands office where were you last night stuart she demanded doing nothing to hide the asperity in her voice as she pulled off her coat and gloves and threw them down on a chair it was a question which lady stinhurst knew quite well she would not have asked twentyfour hours ago then she would have accepted his absence in her usual pathetically cringing fashion hurt and wondering and afraid to know the truth but now she was beyond that yesterdays revelations in this room had combined with a long night of soulsearching to produce an anger so fi nely honed that it could not be blunted by any stony wall of protective and deliberate inattention stinhurst went to his desk sat behind it in the heavy leather chair sit down he said his wife didnt move i asked you a question i want an answer where were you last night and please dont ask me to believe that scotland yard kept you until nine this morning i like to think im not that much of a fool i went to an hotel stinhurst said not your club no i wanted anonymity something you couldnt have at home of course for a moment stinhurst said nothing fi ngering a letter opener that lay on his desk long and silver it caught the light i found i couldnt face you perhaps more than anything else her reaction to that single sentence signalled the manner in which their relationship had changed his voice was even but brittle as if the slightest provocation might cause him to break down his skin was pallid his eyes bloodshot and when he placed the letter opener back on his desk his wife saw that his hands trembled and yet she felt herself unmoved by all this knowing perfectly well that its cause was not his concern for her welfare or the welfare of their daughter or even for himself but concern over how he was going to keep the story about geoffrey rintouls despicable life and his violent death out of the newspapers she had seen jeremy vinney herself in the back of the theatre she knew why he was there her anger swelled anew there i was at home stuart patiently waiting as i always have done worrying about you and what was happening at scotland yard hour after hour i thoughti realised only later how foolish i was beingthat somehow this tragedy might serve to bring us closer to each other imagine my thinking that in spite of the story you produced about my affair with your brother we might still put this marriage of ours back together but then you never even phoned did you and like a fool i waited and waited obediently until i fi nally saw that things are quite dead between us they have been for years of course but i was far too afraid to face that until last night lord stinhurst raised a hand as if in the hope of forestalling further words you do choose your moments dont you this isnt the time to discuss our marriage i should think youd see that if nothing else always it was his voice of dismissal so cold and final so rigid with restraint odd how it didnt affect her one way or the other now she smiled politely youve misunderstood we arent discussing our marriage stuart theres nothing to discuss then why ive told elizabeth about her grandfather i thought we might do it together last night but when you didnt come home i told her myself she walked across the room to stand in front of his desk she rested her knuckles against its pristine surface her fingers were newly bare of rings he watched her but did not speak and do you know what she said when i told her that her beloved grandfather had killed her uncle geoffrey had snapped his handsome neck in two stinhurst shook his head he lowered his eyes she said mummy youre standing in the way of the telly would you move please and i thought isnt that rich all these years dedicated to protecting the sacred memory of a grandfather she adored have come down to this of course i stepped out of her way at once im like that arent i always cooperative eager to please always hoping things will turn out for the best if i ignore them long enough im a shell of a person in a shell of a marriage wandering round a fine house in holland park with every advantage save the one ive wanted so desperately all these years love lady stinhurst watched for a reaction on her husbands face there was nothing she continued i knew then that i cant save elizabeth shes lived in a house of lies and halftruths for too many years she can only save herself as can i whats that supposed to mean that im leaving you she said i dont know if its permanent i dont have the bravado to claim that im afraid but im going to somerset until i have everything sorted out in my mind until i know what i want to do and if it does become permanent youre not to worry i dont require much just a few rooms somewhere and a bit of peace and quiet no doubt we can work out an equitable settlement but if not our respective solicitors stinhurst swung his chair to one side dont do this to me not today please not on top of everything else she gave a regretful laugh thats really what it is isnt it im about to cause you one more headache just another inconvenience something else to have to explain away to inspector lynley if it comes down to that well i would have waited but as i needed to talk to you anyway now seemed as good a time as any to tell you everything everything he asked dully yes theres one thing more before im on my way francesca telephoned this morning she couldnt bear it any longer she said not after gowan she thought she would be able to but gowan was dear to her and she couldnt bear to think that she had made less of his life and his death by what she had done she was willing to at first for your sake of course but she found that she couldnt keep up the pretence so she plans to speak to inspector macaskin this afternoon what are you talking about lady stinhurst pulled on her gloves picked up her coat preparatory to leaving she took brief hostile pleasure in her final remarks francesca lied to the police about what she did and what she saw the night joy sinclair died ive brought chinese food dad barbara havers popped her head into the sitting room but i shall have to ask you not to fi ght with mum over the shrimp this time where is she her father sat before the television set which was tuned deafeningly into bbc the horizontal hold was slipping and peoples heads were being cut off right at the eyebrows so that it looked a bit like a science fi ction show dad barbara repeated he gave no answer she walked into the room lowered the volume and turned to him he was asleep his jaw slack the tubes that fed him oxygen askew in his nostrils racing magazines covered the floor near his chair and a newspaper was opened over his knees it was too hot in the room in the entire house for that matter and the musty smell of her parents ageing seemed to seep from the walls and the fl oor and the furniture this mixed with a stronger more recent scent of food overcooked and inedible barbaras movement made suffi cient noise to waken her father and seeing her he smiled showing teeth that were blackened crooked and in places altogether missing barbie mussa dozed off wheres mum jimmy havers blinked adjusting the tubes in his nostrils and reaching for a handkerchief into which he coughed heavily his breathing sounded like the bubbling of water just next door mrs gustafsons come down with fl u again and mums taken her some soup knowing her mothers questionable culinary talents barbara wondered briefly if mrs gustafsons condition would improve or worsen under her ministrations nonetheless she was encouraged by the fact that her mother had ventured out of the house it was the fi rst time she had done so in years ive brought chinese she told her father indicating the sack she cradled in one arm im off again tonight though ive only half an hour to eat her father frowned mum wont like that barbie not one bit thats why ive brought the food peace offering she went on to the kitchen at the back of the house her heart sank at the sight of it a dozen tins of soup were lined up near the sink with their lids gaping open and spoons stuck in them as if her mother had sampled each one before deciding which to offer their neighbour three had actually been heated in separate pans which still stood on the stove with the fire left carelessly on beneath them and their contents burnt to nothing sending up a scent of scalded vegetables and milk perilously near the flame a package of biscuits lay open spilling out its contents its wrapper hastily torn away and part of it discarded on the fl oor oh hell barbara said wearily turning off the stove she put her package down onto the kitchen table next to her mothers newest album of travel information a glance told her that brazil was this weeks destination but she wasnt interested in looking at the collection of brochures and photographs clipped from magazines she rummaged beneath the sink for a rubbish sack and was dropping the tins of soup into it when the front door opened hesitant steps teetered down the uncarpeted hall and her mother appeared at the kitchen door a badly scored plastic tray in her hands soup biscuits and a withered apple were all in place upon it it went cold mrs havers said her colourless eyes trying to focus past her own confusion she was wearing only an irregularly buttoned cardigan over her shabby housedress i didnt think to cover the soup lovey and when i got there her daughter had come to stay and said that mrs gustafson didnt want it barbara looked at the curious mixture and blessed mrs gustafsons daughter for her wisdom if not for her tact the soup was a blend of everything on the stove an unappealing concoction of split pea clam chowder and tomato with rice rapidly cooling in the night air it had formed a puckered skin on the top so that it vaguely resembled coagulating blood her stomach churned uneasily at the sight well no matter mum she said you thought about her didnt you and mrs gustafson will be sure to learn of that you were neighbourly werent you her mother smiled vacantly yes i was wasnt i she set the tray down on the very edge of the table barbara lunged forward to catch it before it toppled to the fl oor have you seen brazil lovey affectionately mrs havers fingered the tattered artifi cial leather cover of her album i did some more work on it today yes i had a quick glance barbara continued sweeping things off the work top into the rubbish the sink was piled with unwashed crockery a faint odour of rot emanated from it telling her that uneaten food was also buried somewhere beneath the mess ive brought chinese she told her mother im off again in a bit though oh lovey no her mother responded in this cold in the dark i dont think thats wise do you young ladies should not be on the streets alone at night police business mum barbara replied she went to the cupboard and saw that only two clean plates were left no matter she thought she would eat out of the cartons once her parents had taken their share she was setting the table as her mother puttered uselessly in her wake when the front doorbell rang they looked at each other her mothers face clouded you dont suppose thatsno i know tony wont come back will he hes dead isnt he hes dead mum barbara replied fi rmly put the kettle on for tea ill get the door the bell rang a second time before she had a chance to answer it muttering impatiently flipping on the exterior light she pulled the door open to see unbelievably lady helen clyde standing on the front step she was dressed completely in black from head to toe and that should have served as warning enough for barbara but at the moment all she could contemplate was the horrifying thought that unless this was a nightmare from which she could mercifully awaken she was going to have to ask the other woman into the house the youngest daughter of the tenth earl of hesfield child of a surrey great house denizen of one of the most fashionable districts in london come to this netherworld of actons worst neighbourhoodfor what barbara gaped at her wordlessly looked for a car in the street and saw lady helens red mini parked several doors down she heard her mothers nervous whimper some distance behind her lovey who is it its not no mum its fine dont worry she called back over her shoulder forgive me barbara lady helen said if there had been any other way i would have taken it the words brought barbara back to herself she held the door open come in when lady helen passed her and stood in the hall barbara felt herself looking at her home involuntarily seeing it as the other woman must see it as a place where lunacy and poverty whirled wildly hand in hand the worn linoleum on the floor unwashed for months at a time tracked with footprints and puddles of melted snow the faded wallpaper peeling away at the corners with a damp patch growing mouldy near the door the battered stairway with hooks along the wall on which ragged coats hung carelessly some unworn for years the old rattan umbrella rack with great gaping holes in its sides where wet umbrellas had eaten through the palm over time the odours of burnt food and age and neglect my bedrooms not like this she wanted to shout but i cant keep up with them and pay the bills and cook the meals and see that they clean themselves but she said nothing she merely waited for lady helen to speak feeling a hot tide of shame wash over her when her father shambled to the door of the sitting room in his baggy trousers and stained grey shirt pulling his oxygen along behind him in its trolley this is my father barbara said and when her mother peeped out of the kitchen like a frightened mouse and my mother lady helen went to jimmy havers extending her hand im helen clyde she said and looking into the kitchen ive interrupted your dinner havent i mrs havers jimmy havers smiled expansively chinese tonight he said weve enough if you want a bite dont we barbie at another time barbara might have taken grim amusement from the thought of lady helen clyde eating chinese food out of cartons sitting at the kitchen table and chatting with her mother about the trips to brazil and turkey and greece that occupied the inner reaches of her madness but now she only felt weak with the humiliation of discovery with the knowledge that lady helen might somehow betray her circumstances to lynley thank you lady helen was replying graciously but im not at all hungry she smiled at barbara but it was at best only an unsteady effort seeing this barbara realised that whatever her own state was in the face of this visit lady helens was worse thus she spoke kindly let me just get them started eating helen the sitting rooms over there if you dont mind a rather large sort of mess without waiting to see how lady helen might react to her first sight of the sitting room with its ancient creaking furniture and general air of decay barbara ushered her father into the kitchen she took a moment to soothe her mothers querulous fears about their unexpected visitor dishing out rice fried shrimp sesame chicken and oyster beef as she considered why the other woman had appeared on her doorstep she didnt want to think that lady helen might already be aware of the machinery set in progress for tonights arrest she didnt want to think that the potential arrest might be the reason for this visit in the first place yet all the time she knew in her heart that there could be no other reason she and lady helen clyde did not exactly travel in the same circle of friends this was hardly an impulsive social call when barbara joined her in the sitting room a few minutes later lady helen did not leave her long in suspense she was sitting on the edge of the sagging artifi cial horsehair couch her eyes on the wall opposite where a single photograph of barbaras younger brother hung among ten rectangles of darker wallpaper remnants of a previous collection of memorabilia devoted to his passing as soon as barbara entered the room lady helen got to her feet im coming with you tonight she made a small embarrassed movement with her hands id have liked to put that more politely but there doesnt seem to be a point does there there also seemed to be no point to lying how did you find out barbara asked i telephoned tommy about an hour ago denton told me he was on a surveillance tonight tommy generally doesnt do surveillance does he so i assumed the rest she gestured again with an unhappy smile had i known where the surveillance was to be i simply would have gone there myself but i didnt know denton didnt know there was no one at the yard who could or would tell me so i came to you and i will follow you there if you dont let me come with you she lowered her voice im terribly sorry i know what kind of position this puts you in i know how angry tommy will be with both of us then why are you doing this lady helens eyes moved back to the photograph of barbaras brother it was an old school picture not very well taken but it depicted tony the way barbara liked to remember him laughing showing a missing front tooth a face freckled and elfish a mop of hair aftereverything thats happened i must be there lady helen said its a conclusion i need it and it seems that the only way i can bring it to an end for myselfthe only way i can forgive myself for having been such a blundering foolis to be there when you take him lady helen looked back at her she was barbara saw terribly pale she looked frail and unwell how can i tell you how it feels to know that he used me to know how i turned on tommy when all he wanted to do was to show me the truth we phoned you last night the inspector has been trying to reach you all day hes halfmad with worry im sorry i didnti couldnt face him forgive me for saying so barbara said hesitantly but i dont think the inspectors taken any pleasure at all from being in the right in this case not at your expense she did not go on to mention her afternoon meeting with lynley his restless pacing as he set up the surveillance team his continuous telephone calls to lady helens flat to her familys home in surrey to the st james house she did not go on to mention his black brooding as the afternoon wore on or how he jumped for the telephone each time it rang or how his voice maintained an indifference that was contravened by the tension in his face will you let me come with you lady helen asked barbara knew the question was a mere formality i dont see how i can stop you she replied lynley had been at joy sinclairs home in hampstead since half past fourthe members of the surveillance team had arrived not long after establishing themselves in prearranged locations two in a dirty van with a fl at tyre parked midway down flask walk another above the bookstore on the corner of back lane another in an herb store still another on the high street with a view towards the underground station lynley himself was in the house not far from the most logical means of access the diningroom doors that faced the back garden he sat in one of the low chairs in the unlit sitting room monitoring the conversation that came spitting through the radio from his men on the outside it was just after eight when the van team announced havers on the lower end of flask walk sir shes not alone perplexed lynley got to his feet went to the front door and cracked it open just as sergeant havers and lady helen passed under a street lamp their faces exposed in its eerie amber glow after a quick survey of the street they hurried into the front garden and through the door what in gods name lynley began hotly once hed shut the door behind him and they stood in a circle of darkness within the hall i gave her no choice tommy lady helen said denton told me you were on a surveillance i put the rest together and went to sergeant havers house i wont have you here damn it all anything could happen lynley walked into the sitting room where the radio was picked it up and began to speak im going to need a man here to no dont do this to me lady helen reached out desperately but did not touch him i did just what you asked of me last night i did everything you asked so let me be here now i need to be tommy i wont get in your way i promise i swear it just let me end this the way i need to please he felt suddenly torn by irrational indecision he knew what he had to do he knew what was right she no more belonged here than caught up in the middle of a public brawl words came to his lipsappropriate and dutifulbut before he could say them she spoke in a manner that struck him to the quick let me get over rhys the best way i know how i beg it of you tommy inspector a voice crackled from the radio lynleys own voice was harsh its all right maintain your positions thank you lady helen whispered he couldnt reply all he could think of was the single most telling remark she had made i did everything you asked remembering her final words to him last night he couldnt bear the thought of what that meant unable to respond he moved past her into a dim corner of the dining room flicked the curtains a scant inch to view back lane saw nothing and returned their long waiting together began for the next six hours lady helen was as good as her word she did not move from the chair she had taken in the sitting room she did not speak there were times when lynley thought she was asleep but he could not see her face clearly it was merely a ghostly blur under the black bandana she wore a trick of lighting made her seem insubstantial as if she were fading from him the way an image on a photograph does over time the soft brown eyes the arch of brow the gentle curve of cheek and lips the frankly stubborn chinall these became less defi nite as the hours passed and as he sat opposite her with sergeant havers making a third of their triangle of anticipation he felt a yearning for her that he had never known before having nothing at all to do with sex and everything to do with the souls calling out to a spirit kindred and essential to the completion of ones own he felt as if he had been travelling a great distance only to arrive where he had started only to know the place truly and for the very fi rst time yet all along he had the distinct sensation of being too late the radio crackled to life at ten past two company inspector coming down flask walkkeeping hard to the shadowsoh very nice technique thatan eye out for coppersdark clothes dark knit cap collar on the coat pulled upstopped now three doors down from the nest there was a pause of several minutes duration then the whispered monologue began again crossed the street for another lookcontinuing the approach crossing over again towards back lanethis is our baby inspector no one walks this way down a street at two in the morning in this kind of weather giving it over ive lost sight turned down back lane another voice picked it up said only suspect approaching the garden wallpulling something down over the facerunning a hand along the bricks lynley switched off the radio he moved noiselessly into the deepest shadows of the dining room sergeant havers followed behind them lady helen stood at first lynley saw nothing beyond the dining room doors and then a black shape appeared against the inky sky as the intruders body rose to the top of the garden wall a leg swung to the inside then another then a soft thud as he hit the ground no face was visible which at first seemed impossible since there was light enough from both stars and the street lamps on back lane to illuminate the snow the sketching of the tree against it the contrast of mortar against the brick wall even to a certain extent the interior of the house but then lynley saw that the man was wearing a ski mask and suddenly he was so much less of an intruder so much more of a killer helen go back in the sitting room lynley breathed but she did not move he looked over his shoulder to see that her wide eyes were fixed upon the figure in the garden upon his stealthy progress to the door her fi st was raised clenched to her lips and then the unbelievable happened as he mounted the four steps reached a hand out to try the door lady helen cried frantically no oh god rhys and chaos erupted outside the figure froze only for an instant before he bolted for the wall and took it in a single leap jesus christ sergeant havers shouted and headed for the dining room doors fl inging them open letting in a rush of freezing night air lynley felt immobilised by the force of disbelief at what helen had done she couldnt haveshe hadnt meantshe would never she was coming towards him in the darkness tommy please her shattered voice brought him to his senses abruptly shoving her to one side he dashed for the radio and said tersely weve lost him that done he ran for the front door raced outside insensible to the sound of pursuit behind him up towards the high street a voice shouted from above the bookstore across the street as lynley tore past he did not need to hear it ahead of him he saw the black shape running heard the frantic pounding of his footsteps on the pavement saw him slip on a patch of ice right himself and run on he was not bothering to seek the safety of the shadows instead he dashed down the middle of the street flashing in and out of the light from the street lamps the sound of his flight thundered on the night air a few steps behind him lynley heard sergeant havers she was running at full speed cursing lady helen violently with every foul word she knew police the two constables from the van had exploded round the corner coming up quickly behind them ahead their quarry burst onto heath street one of the larger arteries of hampstead village the headlamps of an oncoming car trapped him like an animal tyres screeched a horn honked wildly a large mercedes skidded to a stop inches from his thighs but he did not run on instead he whirled lunging for the door even at the distance of half a block lynley could hear the terrifi ed screaming from inside the car you stop another constable charged round the corner from the high street less than thirty yards from the mercedes at the shout however the blackgarbed fi gure spun to the right and continued his flight up the hill but the pause at the car had cost him time and distance and lynley was gaining on him was close enough to hear the roaring of his lungs as he surged towards a narrow stone stairway that led to the hillside and the neighbourhood above he took the steps three at a time stopping at the top where a metal basket of empty milk bottles stood outside the shadowed arch of a front door grabbing this he hurled it down the steps in his wake before running on but the shattering glass served only to frighten several neighbourhood dogs who set up a tremendous howling lights went on in the buildings that lined the stairs making lynleys going easier and the broken glass nothing to contend with at all at the top of the stairs the street was sided by enormous beech and sycamore trees that filled it with looming shadows lynley paused there listening against the night wind and the howling animals for the sound of fl ight looking for movement in the darkness havers came up next to him still cursing as she gasped for breath wheres he lynley heard it first coming from his left the dull thud against metal as the runner his vision impaired by the ski maskfell against a dustbin it was all lynley needed hes heading for the church he spun havers back to the stairs go for the others he ordered tell them to head him off at st johns now lynley didnt wait to see if she would obey the pounding footsteps ahead of him drew him back into the chase across holly hill to a narrow street where he saw in a moment of triumph that every advantage was going to be his a series of high walls along one side an open green on the other the street offered absolutely no protection in an instant he saw his man some forty yards ahead turning into a gateway that was open in the wall when he reached the gate himself he saw that the snow had gone uncleared in the drive that elongated footprints led across a broad lawn into a garden there a struggling form battled a hedge of holly his clothes snagging on the spiny leaves he gave a raw cry of pain a dog began to bark furiously floodlights switched on on the high street below the sirens started grew maddeningly loud as the police cars approached this last seemed to give the man the rush of adrenaline he needed to free himself from the bushes as lynley closed in he cast a wild glance towards him gauged his proximity and tore himself from the plants painful embrace he fell to his kneesfreeon the other side of the hedge scrambled back up ran on lynley spun in the other direction saw a second gate in the wall and ploughed his way to it through the snow at the cost of at least thirty seconds he threw himself into the street to his right st johns church loomed beyond a low brick wall there a shadow moved crouched leaped and was over it lynley ran on he took the wall easily himself landing in the snow in an instant he saw a fi gure moving swiftly to his left heading for the graveyard the sound of sirens grew nearer the sound of tyres against wet pavement echoed and shrieked lynley fought his way through a snowdrift up to his knees gained hold on a spot of cleared pavement ahead the dark shape began dodging through the graves it was the kind of mistake lynley had been waiting for the snow was deeper in the graveyard some tombstones were buried completely within moments he heard the other man thrashing frantically as he crashed into markers trying to make his way across to the far wall and the street beyond it nearby the sirens stopped the blue lights flashed and twirled and police began to swarm over the wall they were carrying torches which they shone on the snow white light arcing out to catch the runner in its glare but it also served to illuminate the graves distinctly and he picked up his pace dodging sarcophagi and monuments as he headed for the wall lynley stuck to the cleared path which wound through the trees thickly planted pines that spread their needles on the pavement providing a rough surface for his shoes against the ice he gained time from ease of movement here precious seconds that he used to locate his man he was perhaps twenty feet from the wall to his left two constables were fi ghting their way through the snow behind him havers was on his path through the graves to his right was lynley on a dead run there was no escape yet with a savage cry that seemed to signal a final surge of strength he made a leap upwards but lynley was on him too quickly the man whirled swung wildly lynley loosened his grasp to dodge the punch giving the other a seconds opportunity to climb the wall he made his vault caught at the top gripped fiercely lifted his body began to go over but lynley countered grabbing at his black sweater he pulled him back locked his arm round the mans neck and flung him into the snow he stood panting above him as havers arrived at his side wheezing like a distance runner the two constables ploughed their way up and one of them managed to say youre done for son before he gave way to a fit of coughing lynley reached forward yanked the man to his feet pulled off his ski mask jerked him into the torchlight it was david sydeham joys door wasnt locked sydeham said they sat at a metallegged table in one of the interrogation rooms at new scotland yard it was a room designed to allow no escape bearing not a single decorative appointment that might give fl ight even to imagination sydeham did not look at any of them as he spoke not at lynley who sat across from him and worked to draw together all the details of the case not at sergeant havers who for once took no notes but merely interjected questions to add to their body of knowledge not at the yawning shorthand typista twentytwoyear veteran of police work who recorded everything with an expression of boredom that suggested she had already heard every entanglement possible in the kinds of human relationships that end in violence faced with the three of them sydeham had turned his body to give them the benefit of his profile his eyes were on a corner of the room where a dead moth lay and he stared at it as if seeing there a recreation of the past days of violence his voice sounded nothing more than monumentally weary it was half past three id got the dirk earlier when i went down to the library for the whisky it was easy enough to pull it off the dining room wall go through the kitchen up the back stairs and along to my room and then of course all i had to do was wait did you know that your wife was with robert gabriel sydeham moved his eyes to the rolex whose gold casing glittered in a halfcrescent beneath his black sweater caressingly he rotated a finger round its face his hands were quite large but without callosity unexposed to labour they didnt look at all like the hands of a killer it didnt take long to work it out inspector he finally replied as joanna herself would no doubt point out i had wanted her together with gabriel and she was just giving me what i wanted theatre of the real in spades it was an expert revenge wasnt it of course i wasnt sure at first that she was actually with him i thoughtperhaps i hoped shed gone somewhere else in the house to sulk but i suppose i really knew thats not at all her style and at any rate gabriel was fairly forthright about his conquest of my wife the other day at the agincourt but then it isnt the kind of thing hed be likely to keep quiet about is it you assaulted him in his dressing room the other night sydeham smiled bleakly it was the only part of this bloody mess that i truly enjoyed i dont like other men stuffing my wife inspector whether shes a willing participant or not but youre more than willing to have another mans wife if it comes down to it ah hannah darrow i had a feeling that little minx would do me in in the end sydeham reached for a styrofoam cup of coffee on the table before him his nails made crescent patterns upon it when joy talked at dinner about her new book she mentioned the diaries she was trying to get off john darrow and i could see fairly well how everything was going to come down she didnt seem the sort to give up just because darrow said no once she hadnt got to where she was in her career by shrinking away from a challenge had she so when she talked about the diaries i knew it was just a matter of time before she had them and i didnt know what hannah had written so i couldnt take the chance what happened that night with hannah darrow sydeham brought his eyes to lynley we met at the mill she was some forty minutes late and id begun to thinkto hope actuallythat she wasnt coming but she showed up at the last in her usual fashion hot to make love right there on the floor but ii put her off id brought her a scarf shed seen in a boutique in norwich and i insisted she let me put it on her right then he watched his hands continue their play on the white cup fi ngers pressing upon its rim it was easy enough i was kissing her when i tightened the knot lynley thought about the innocent references he had been too blind to see earlier in hannahs diary and took a calculated gamble with im surprised you didnt have her one last time right there in the mill if thats what she wanted the payoff he was looking for came without a pause id lost the touch with her each time we met it was becoming more diffi cult sydeham laughed shortly an expression of contempt that was selfdirected it was going to be joanna all over again the beautiful woman who rises to fame whos the object of every mans steamy fantasy whose own husband cant service her the way she wants id say youve got the picture inspector nicely put yet youve stayed with joanna all these years shes the one thing in my life that i did completely right my unmitigated success one doesnt let something like that go easily and as for me id never have considered it i couldnt let her go hannah merely came along at a bad time for jo and me things had beenoff between us for about three weeks shed been thinking of signing on with a london agent and i felt a bit left out in the cold useless that must have been what started mytrouble then when hannah came along i felt like a new man for a month or two every time i saw her i had her sometimes two or three times in a single evening christ it was like being reborn until she wanted to become an actress like your wife and then it was history repeating itself yes but why on earth kill her why not just break it off shed found my london address it was bad enough when she showed up at the theatre one evening when jo and i were setting off with the london agent after that happened i knew if i left her behind in the fens shed show up one day at our flat i would have lost joanna there simply didnt seem to be another choice and gowan kilbride where did he fit in sydeham placed his coffee cup back onto the table its rim caved in all around entirely useless now he knew about the gloves inspector they completed their preliminary interview with david sydeham at fivefifteen in the morning and staggered redeyed out into the corridor where sydeham was led to a telephone to make a call to his wife lynley watched him go feeling caught in a fl ood of pity for the man this surprised him for justice was being served by the arrestyet he knew that the effect of the murdersthat stone thrown into a pond whose surface cannot remain unchanged by the intrusionhad only just begun for everyone he turned away there were other things to contend with among them the press finally eager for a statement materialising from nowhere shouting questions demanding interviews he pushed past them crumpled into nothing a message from superintendent webberly that was pressed into his hand nearly blind with exhaustion he made his way towards the lift caught up at last in only one conscious thought to fi nd helen in only one conscious need to sleep he found his way home like an automaton and fell onto his bed fully clothed he did not awaken when denton came in removed his shoes and covered him with a blanket he did not awaken until the afternoon it was her eyesight lynley said i noticed nearly everything else in hannah darrows diaries save the reference to the fact that she hadnt worn her spectacles to that second play so she couldnt see the stage clearly she only thought sydeham was one of the actors because he came out the stage door at the end of the performance and of course i was too blinded by daviesjones role in the three sisters to realise what it meant that joanna ellacourt had been in the same scene from which the suicide note was drawn sydeham would know any scene joanna was in probably better than the actors themselves he helped her with her lines i heard him doing that myself at the agincourt did joanna ellacourt know her husband was the killer st james asked lynley shook his head taking the proffered cup of tea from deborah with a faint smile the three of them sat in st james study dividing their attention among cakes and sandwiches tarts and tea a misty shaft of late afternoon sunlight struck the window and reflected against a mound of snow on the ledge outside some distance away rushhour traffic on the embankment began its noisy crawl towards the suburbs shed been told by mary agnes campbellas had they allthat joys bedroom door was locked he responded like me she thought daviesjones was the killer what she didnt knowwhat no one knew until late yesterday afternoonwas that joys door hadnt been locked all night it was only locked once francesca gerrard went into the room to look for her necklace at threefi fteen found joy dead and assuming her brother had done it went down to her office for the keys and locked the door in an attempt to protect him i should have heard the lie when she told me the pearls were on the chest of drawers by the door why would joy have put them there when the rest of her jewellery was on the dressing table on the other side of the room id seen that myself st james selected another sandwich would it have made a difference had macaskin managed to reach you before you left for hampstead yesterday what could he have told me only that francesca gerrard had confessed to him that she lied to us at westerbrae about the door being locked i dont know whether i would have had the common sense to put that together with a number of facts that i had been choosing to ignore the fact that robert gabriel had a woman with him in his bedroom the fact that sydeham admitted that joanna had not been with him for some hours the night joy died the fact that jo and joy are two easy names to confuse especially for a man like gabriel who pursued women tirelessly and took as many to bed as he could manage so thats what irene sinclair heard st james moved in his chair to a more comfortable position grimacing as the lower part of his leg brace caught against the piping on the ottomans edge he disengaged it with an irritable grunt but why joanna ellacourt shes not made it a secret that she loathes gabriel or was that dramatic loathing part of the ploy she loathed sydeham more than gabriel that night because hed got her into joys play in the first place she felt hed betrayed her she wanted to hurt him so she went to gabriels bedroom at half past eleven and waited there to take her revenge on her husband in coin that he would well understand but what she didnt realise was that in going to gabriel shed given sydeham the opportunity he had been looking for ever since joy made the remark about john darrow at dinner i suppose hannah darrow didnt know that sydeham was married lynley shook his head evidently not shed only seen them once together and even then another man was with them all she knew was that sydeham had access to drama coaches and voice coaches and everything else that went into success as far as hannah was concerned sydeham was the key to her new life and for a time she was his key to a sexual prowess he had been lacking do you suppose joy sinclair knew about sydehams involvement with hannah darrow st james asked she hadnt got that far in her research and john darrow was determined she never would she merely made an innocent remark at dinner but sydeham couldnt afford to take a chance so he killed her and of course irenes references to the diaries at the theatre yesterday were what took him to hampstead last night deborah had been listening quietly but now she spoke perplexed didnt he take a terrible chance when he killed joy sinclair tommy couldnt his wife have returned to their room at any moment and found him gone couldnt he have run into someone in the hall lynley shrugged he was fairly sure where joanna was after all deb and he knew robert gabriel well enough to believe that gabriel would keep her with him as long as he could possibly continue to demonstrate his virility everyone else in the house was easily accounted for so once he heard joy return from vinneys room shortly before one all he had to do was wait a bit for her to fall asleep deborah was caught on an earlier thought but his own wife she murmured looking pained i should guess that sydeham was willing to let gabriel have his wife once or twice if he could get away with murder but he wasnt willing to let the man boast about it in front of the company so he waited until gabriel was alone at the theatre then he caught him in his dressing room i wonder if gabriel knew who was beating him st james mused as far as gabriel was concerned it probably could have been any number of men and he was lucky it wasnt anyone else might have killed him sydeham didnt want to do that why not deborah asked after what happened between gabriel and joanna i should think sydeham would be more than happy to see him dead sydeham was nobodys fool the last thing he wanted to do was narrow my field of suspects lynley shook his head his next words reflected the shame he felt of course what he didnt know was that i had suffi ciently narrowed it myself already a field of one havers said it best police work to be proud of the other two did not respond deborah twisted the lid on the porcelain teapot slowly tracing the petal of a delicate pink rose st james moved a bit of sandwich here and there on his plate neither of them looked at lynley he knew they were avoiding the question he had come to ask knew they were doing it out of loyalty and love still undeserving as he was lynley found himself hoping that the bond between them all was strong enough to allow them to see that he needed to fi nd her in spite of her desire not to be found so he asked the question st james wheres helen when i got back to joys house last night shed vanished where is she he saw deborahs hand drop from the teapot saw it tighten on the pleats of her russet wool skirt st james lifted his head thats too much to ask he responded it was the answer lynley had expected the answer he knew was owed to him yet in spite of this he pressed them i cant change what happened i cant change the fact that i was a fool but at least i can apologise at least i can tell her its not time shes not ready lynley felt a surge of anger at such implacable resolution damn you st james she tried to warn him off did she tell you that as well when he came over the wall she gave a cry that he heard and we nearly lost him because of helen so if shes not ready to see me she can tell me that herself let her make the decision shes decided tommy the words were spoken so coolly that his anger died he felt his throat tighten in quick reaction shes gone with him then where to wales nothing deborah moved casting a long look at her husband who had turned his head to the unlit fire lynley felt rising desperation at their refusal to speak hed met with the same kind of refusal from caroline shepherd at helens fl at earlier the same kind of refusal on the telephone when he spoke to helens parents and three of her sisters he knew it was a punishment richly due him and yet in spite of that knowledge he railed against it refused to accept it as just and true for gods sake simon he felt riven by despair i love her you above all people know what it means to be separated like this from someone you love without a word without a chance please tell me unexpectedly then he saw deborah reach out quickly she grasped her husbands thin hand lynley barely heard her voice as she spoke to st james my love im sorry forgive me i simply cant do this she turned to lynley her eyes were bright with tears shes gone to skye tommy shes alone he faced only one last task before heading north to helen and that was to see superintendent webberly and through seeing him to put a period to the case to other things as well he had ignored the earlymorning message from his superior with its offi cial congratulations for a job well done and its request for a meeting as soon as possible filled with the realisation of how blind jealousy had governed every step of his investigation lynley had hardly wanted to hear anyones praise much less the praise of a man who had been perfectly willing to use him as an unwitting tool in the master game of deceit for beyond sydehams guilt and daviesjones innocence there still remained lord stinhurst and scotland yards dance of attendance upon the commitment of the government to keeping a twentyfiveyearold secret out of the public eye this remained to be dealt with lynley had not felt himself ready for the confrontation earlier in the day but he was ready now he found webberly at the circular table in his office there as usual open fi les books photographs reports and used crockery abounded bent over a street map which was outlined heavily in yellow marking pen the superintendent held a cigar clenched between his teeth filling the already claustrophobic room with a malodorous pall of smoke he was talking to his secretary who sat behind his desk cooperatively nodding and notetaking and all the time waving her hand in front of her face in a useless attempt to keep the cigar smoke from permeating her welltailored suit and smooth blonde hair she was as usual as close a replica of the princess of wales as she could make herself she rolled her eyes at lynley wrinkled her nose delicately in distaste at the smell and the clutter and said heres detective inspector lynley superintendent lynley waited expectantly for webberly to correct her it was a game the two of them played webberly preferred mister to the use of titles dorothea harriman call me dee please vastly preferred titles to anything else this afternoon however the superintendent merely growled and looked up from his map saying did you get everything harriman his secretary consulted her notes adjusting the high scalloped collar of her edwardian blouse she wore a pert bow tie beneath it everything shall i type this lot up if you will and run thirty copies the usual routing harriman sighed before i leave superintendentno dont say it i know i know put it on the tick harriman she shot lynley a meaningful look ive so much time on the tick right now that i could take my honeymoon on it if someone would be so good as to pop the question lynley smiled blimey and to think im busy tonight harriman laughed at the answer gathered up her notes and brushed three paper cups from webberlys desk into the rubbish see if you can get him to do something about this pit she requested as she left webberly said nothing until they were alone then he folded the map slid it onto one of his filing cabinets and went to his desk but he did not sit rather puffing on his cigar contentedly he looked at the london skyline beyond the window some people think its lack of ambition that makes me avoid promotion webberly confided without turning but actually its the view if i had to change offices id lose the sight of the city coming to light as darkness falls and i cant tell you what pleasure thats given me through the years his freckled hands played with the watch fob on his waistcoat cigar ash fluttered ignored to the fl oor lynley thought about how he had once liked this man how he had respected the fi ne mind inside the dishevelled exterior it was a mind that brought out the best in those under his command conscientiously using each one to his personal strength never to his weakness that quality of being able to see people as they really were had always been what lynley admired most in his superior now however he saw that it was doubleedged that it could be usedindeed had been used in his case to probe a mans weakness and use that weakness to meet an end not of his own devising webberly had known without a doubt that lynley would believe in the given word of a peer that kind of belief was part and parcel of lynleys upbringing a precious clinging to my word as a gentleman that had governed people of his class for centuries like the laws of primogeniture it could not be sloughed off easily and that is what webberly had depended upon sending lynley to hear lord stinhursts manufactured tale of his wifes infi delity not macpherson stewart or hale or any other di who would have listened sceptically called in lady stinhurst to hear the story herself and then moved on to uncover the truth about geoffrey rintoul without a second thought neither the government nor the yard had wanted that to happen so they had sent in the one man they believed could be depended upon to take the word of a gentleman and hence to sweep all connections to lord stinhurst right under the carpet that to lynley was the unpardonable offence he couldnt forgive webberly for having done it to him he couldnt forgive himself for having mindlessly lived up to their every expectation it didnt matter that stinhurst had been innocent of joy sinclairs death for the yard had not known that had not even cared had desired only that key information in the mans past not come to light had stinhurst been the killer had he escaped justice lynley knew that neither the government nor the yard would have felt a moments compunction as long as the secret of geoffrey rintoul was safe he felt ugly unclean he reached into his pocket for his police identification and tossed it onto webberlys desk the superintendents eyes dropped to the warrant card raised back to lynley he squinted against the smoke from his cigar whats this im done with it webberlys face looked frozen im trying to misunderstand you inspector theres no need for that is there youve all got what you wanted stinhurst is safe the whole story is safe webberly took the cigar from his mouth and crushed it among the stubs in his ashtray spattering ash dont do this lad theres no need i dont like being used its a funny quirk of mine lynley moved to the door ill clean out my things webberlys hand slammed down against the top of his desk sending papers flying a pencil holder toppled to the fl oor and you think i like being used inspector just whats your fantasy about all this what role have you assigned me you knew about stinhurst about his brother about his father thats why i was sent to scotland and not someone else i knew only what i was told the order to send you north came from the commissioner through hillier not from me i didnt like it any better than you did but i had no choice in the matter indeed lynley replied well at least i can be grateful that i do have choices im exerting one of them now webberlys face flooded with angry colour but his voice stayed calm youre not thinking straight lad consider a few things before your righteous indignation carries you nobly towards professional martyrdom i didnt know a thing about stinhurst i still dont know so if you care to tell me id be delighted to hear it all i can tell you is that once hillier came to me with the order that you were to have the case and no one else i smelled a dead rat floating in somebodys soup yet you assigned me anyway damn you for a fool i wasnt given a choice in the matter but see it for what it was at least i assigned havers as well you didnt want her did you you fought me on it didnt you so why the hell do you think i insisted she be on the case because of all people i knew havers would stick to stinhurst like a tick on a dog if it came down to it and it came to that didnt it blast you answer me didnt it it did webberly drove a thick fist into his open palm those sods i knew they were trying to protect him i just didnt know from what he fired lynley a dark look but you dont believe me i dare say youre right i dont youre not that powerless sir you never have been youre wrong lad i am when it comes to my job i do as im told its easy to be a man of inflexible rectitude when youve the freedom to walk out of here anytime you smell something a little unpleasant but i dont have that kind of freedom no independent source of wealth no country estate this job isnt a lark its my bread and butter and when im given an order i follow it as unpleasant as that may seem to you and if stinhurst had been the killer if id closed the case without making an arrest you didnt do that did you i trusted havers to see that you wouldnt and i trusted you i knew that your instincts would take you to the killer eventually but they didnt lynley said the words cost him dearly in pride and he wondered why it mattered so much to him that he had been such a fool webberly studied his face when he spoke his voice was kind yet still keen with perception and thats why youre tossing it in isnt it laddie not because of me and not because of stinhurst and not because some higherups saw you as a man they could use to meet their own ends youre tossing it in because you made a mistake you lost your objectivity on this one didnt you you went after the wrong man so welcome to the club inspector youre not perfect any longer webberly reached for the warrant card fi ngered it for a moment before taking it to lynley without formality he shoved it into the breast pocket of his coat im sorry the stinhurst situation happened he said i cant tell you it wont happen again but if it does i should guess you wont need sergeant havers there to remind you that youre more of a policeman than you ever were a bloody peer he turned back to his desk and surveyed its mess youre due time off lynley so take it dont report in till tuesday and then having said that he looked up his words were quiet learning to forgive yourself is part of the job lad its the only part youve never quite mastered he heard the muted shout as he drove up the ramp from the underground car park and pulled onto broadway it was fast growing dark braking he looked in the direction of st james park station and among the pedestrians he saw jeremy vinney loping down the pavement topcoat flapping round his knees like the wings of an ungainly bird as he ran he waved a spiral notebook pages covered with writing fluttered in the wind lynley lowered the window as vinney reached the car ive done the story on geoffrey rintoul the journalist panted managing a smile jesus what a piece of luck to catch you i need you to be the source off the record just to confi rm thats all lynley watched a flurry of snow blow across the street he recognised a group of secretaries making their endofday dash from the yard to the train their laughter like music rising into the air theres no story he said vinneys expression altered that momentary sharing of confidence was gone but youve spoken to stinhurst you cant tell me he didnt confirm every detail of his brothers past how could he deny it with willingate in the inquest pictures and joys play alluding to everything else you cant tell me he talked his way out of that theres no story mr vinney im sorry lynley began to raise the window but stopped when vinney hooked his fingers over the glass she wanted it his voice was a plea you know joy wanted me to follow the story you know thats why i was there she wanted everything about the rintouls to come to light the case was closed her murderer had been found yet vinney pursued his original quest there was no possibility of a journalistic coup involved for him since the government would quash his story without a thought here was loyalty far beyond the call of friendship once again lynley wondered what lay at its heart what debt of honour vinney owed joy sinclair jer jerry for gods sake hurry up paulies waiting and you know hell get himself all hot and bothered if were late again the second voice drifted from across the street delicate petulant very nearly feminine lynley tracked it down a young man no more than twenty years oldstood in the archway leading into the station he was stamping his feet shoulders hunched against the cold and one of the passageway lights illuminated his face it was achingly handsome possessing a renaissance beauty perfect in feature in colour in form and a renaissance assessment of such beauty rose in lynleys mind marlowes assessment as apt now as it had been in the sixteenth century to hazard more than for the golden fleece finally then that last puzzle piece clicked into position so obvious a piece that lynley wondered what had kept him from placing it before joy hadnt been talking about vinney on her tape recorder she had been talking to him reminding herself of a point she wanted to make in a future conversation with her friend and here across the street was the source of her concern why be in such a lather over him its hardly a lifetime proposition jerry jemmy the voice wheedled again the boy spun on one heel an impatient puppy he laughed when his overcoat billowed out round his body like a circus clowns garb lynley moved his eyes back to the journalist vinney looked away not towards the boy but towards victoria street wasnt it freud who said there are no accidents vinneys voice sounded resigned i must have wanted you to know so youd understand what i meant when i said that joy and i were alwaysand onlyfriends call it absolution i suppose perhaps vindication it makes no difference now she did know i had no secrets from her i dont think i could have had one if i tried vinney looked deliberately back at the boy his expression softened his lips curved in a smile of remarkable tenderness we are cursed by love arent we inspector it gives us no peace we seek it endlessly in a thousand different ways and if were lucky we do have it for a shuddering instant and we feel like free men then dont we even when we bear its most terrible burden joy would have understood that i dare say god knows she was the only one in my life who ever did his hand dropped from the window so i owe her this about the rintouls you see its what she would have wanted the story the truth lynley shook his head revenge is what she wanted mr vinney and i do think she got that after a fashion so thats the way its to be can you really let it end this way inspector after what these people have done to you he waved in the direction of the building behind them we do things to ourselves lynley replied he nodded raised the window and drove on he would later see the trip to skye as a phantasmagorical blur of continually changing countryside that he was only dimly aware of as he flew towards the north stopping merely for food and petrol and once for a few hours of rest at an inn somewhere between carlisle and glasgow he arrived at kyle of lochalsh a small village on the mainland across from the isle of skye in the late afternoon the following day he pulled into the car park of an hotel on the waterfront and sat gazing at the strait its rippled surface the colour of old coins the sun was setting and on the island the majestic peak of sgurr na coinnich looked covered in silver far below it the car ferry pulled away from the dock and began its slow movement towards the mainland carrying only a lorry two hikers who hugged one another against the bitter cold and a slender solitary fi gure whose smooth chestnut hair blew round her face which was lifted as if for blessing to the last rays of the winter sun seeing helen lynley all at once perceived the sheer lunacy of his coming to her now he knew he was the last person she wanted to see he knew that she wanted this isolation yet none of that mattered as the ferry drew nearer to the mainland and he saw her eyes fall upon the bentley in the car park above her he got out pulled on his overcoat and walked down to the landing the wind blew frigidly against him buffeting his cheeks whipping through his hair he tasted the salt of the distant north atlantic when the ferry docked the lorry started up with a foul emission of smoke and trundled down the invergarry road arm in arm the hikers passed him laughing a man and a woman who stopped to kiss then to ponder the opposite shore of skye it was hung with clouds dove grey turning to the lavish hues of sunset the drive north from london had given lynley long hours in which to contemplate what he would say to helen when he fi nally saw her but as she stepped from the ferry brushing her hair from her cheeks words were lost to him he wanted only to hold her in his arms and knew beyond a doubt that he did not have that right instead he walked wordlessly at her side up the rise towards the hotel they went inside the lounge was empty its vast front windows offering a panorama of water and mountains and the sunsetshot clouds of the island lady helen walked to these and stood before them and although her posturethe slightly bent head the small curved shouldersspoke volumes of her desire for solitude lynley could not bring himself to leave her with so much left unsaid between them he joined her and saw the shadows under her eyes smudges of both sorrow and fatigue her arms were crossed in front of her as if in the need of warmth or protection why on earth did he kill gowan more than anything else tommy that seems so senseless to me lynley wondered why he had ever given a moment to thinking that helen of all people would greet him with the score of recriminations that he had so steadfastly earned he had been prepared to hear them to admit to their truth somehow in the confusion of the last few days he had forgotten the basic human decency that was the central core of helens character she would put gowan before herself at westerbrae david sydeham claimed that hed left his gloves at the reception desk he replied watching her eyes lower thoughtfully the lashes dark against her creamy skin he said hed left them there when he and joanna fi rst arrived she nodded in comprehension but when francesca gerrard ran into gowan and spilled all those liqueurs that night after the reading gowan had to clean the entire area and he saw that david sydehams gloves werent there at all didnt he but he must not have remembered it at once yes i think thats what happened at any rate once gowan remembered he would have realised what it meant the single glove that sergeant havers found at the reception desk the next dayand the one that you found in the bootcould have got there only one way through sydehams putting them there himself after he killed joy i think thats what gowan tried to tell me just before he died that he hadnt seen the gloves at the reception desk but ii thought he was talking about rhys lynley saw her eyes close painfully upon the name knew she hadnt expected to hear it from him how did sydeham manage it he was still in the sitting room when macaskin and the westerbrae cook came to me and asked if everyone could be allowed out of the library he slipped into the kitchen then and got the knife but with everyone in the house especially with the police theyd been packing up to leave everyone was wandering here and there and besides it was only the work of a minute or two after that he went up the back stairs and along to his room without thinking lynley raised his hand grazed it gently along the length of her hair following its curve to touch her shoulder she did not move away from him he felt his heart beat heavily against his chest im so sorry about everything he said i had to see you to say at least that much helen she didnt look at him it seemed as if the effort to do so was monumental as if she found herself unequal to the task when she spoke her voice was low and her eyes were fixed on the distant ruin of caisteal maol as the sun struck its crumbling walls for the fi nal time that day you were right tommy you said i was trying to replay simon to a different ending and i discovered that i was but it wasnt a different ending after all was it i repeated myself admirably when it came down to it the only thing missing from the wretched scenario was a hospital room for me to walk out of leaving him lying there entirely alone no acrimony underscored her tone but lynley didnt need to hear it to know how each word carried its full weight of searing selfloathing no he said miserably yes rhys knew it was you on the telephone was that just two nights ago it seems like forever and when i rang off he asked me if it was you i said no i said it was my father but he knew and he saw that youd convinced me that he was the killer i kept denying it of course denying everything when he asked me if id told you he was with me i even denied that as well but he knew i was lying and he saw that id chosen just as hed told me id choose she lifted a hand as if to touch her cheek but again it seemed that it required too much effort she dropped it to her side i didnt even need to hear a cock crow three times i knew what id done to both of us whatever his own desires in coming to her here lynley knew he had to convince lady helen of his culpability in the sin she believed she had committed he had to give her that much if nothing else it isnt your fault helen you wouldnt have done any of that had i not forced you into it what were you to think when i told you about hannah darrow what were you to believe whom were you to believe thats just it i could have chosen rhys in spite of what you said i knew that then i know it now but instead i chose you when rhys saw that he left me and who could blame him believing ones lover is a murderer does rather irreparable damage to a relationship after all she finally looked at him turning so near that he could smell the pure fresh scent of her hair and until hampstead i did think rhys was the killer then why did you warn him off was it to punish me warn him is that what you thought no when he came over the wall i saw at once it wasnt rhys iid grown to know rhys body you see and that man was too big so without thinking i reacted it was horror i think the realisation of what id done to him the knowledge that id lost him her head turned back to the window but only for a moment when she went on her eyes once again sought his at westerbrae id come to see myself as his saviour the fine upright woman who was going to make him whole again after hed been in ruins i saw myself as his reason for never drinking again so you see you were really right at the heart of it werent you it was just like simon after all no helen i didnt know what i was talking about i was halfmad with jealousy you were right all the same as they spoke shadows lengthened in the lounge and the barman walked through turning on lights opening the bar at the far end of the room for its evening business voices drifted to them from the reception desk a crucial decision to be reached about postcards a goodhumoured debate about the next days activities lynley listened longing for that sweet normality of a holiday from home with someone he loved lady helen stirred i must change for dinner she began to move towards the lift why did you come here lynley asked abruptly she paused but did not look at him i wanted to see skye in the dead of winter i needed to see what it was like to be here alone he put his hand on her arm her warmth was like an infusion of life and have you seen enough of it alone i mean both of them knew what he was really asking but instead of replying she walked to the lift and pressed the button watching its light singlemindedly as if she were observing an amazing act of creative genius he followed and barely heard her when she fi nally spoke please i cant bear to cause either of us any more pain somewhere above them the machinery whirred and he knew then that she would go on to her room seeking the solitude she had come for leaving him behind but he saw that she intended this to be no few minutes separation between them instead this was something indeterminate endless something not to be borne he knew it was the worst possible time to speak but there would probably not be another opportunity helen when she looked at him he saw that her eyes were liquid with tears marry me a small bubble of laughter escaped her not a sound of humour but one of despair she made a tiny gesture eloquent in its futility you know how i love you he said dont tell me its too late she bowed her head in front of her the lift doors opened as if they beckoned her to do so she put into words what he had been afraidand had knownshe might say i dont want to see you tommy not for a while he felt wrenched by the words managed only how long a few months perhaps longer that feels like a sentence of death im sorry its what i need she walked into the lift pushed the button for her fl oor even after this i still cant bear to hurt you i never could tommy i love you he said and then again as if each word could serve as its own painful act of contrition helen helen i love you he saw her lips part saw her fl eeting sweet smile before the lift doors closed and she was gone barbara havers was in the public bar of the kings arms not far from new scotland yard moping into her weekly pint of ale shed been nursing it along for the past thirty minutes it was an hour before closing long after the time when she should have made her way back to her parents and acton but she hadnt been able to bring herself to that yetthe paperwork was filed the reports completed the conversations with macaskin at an end for now but as always at the conclusion of a case she had a sense of her own uselessness people would go on brutalising one another despite her meagre efforts to stop them buy a bloke a drink at lynleys voice she looked up i thought youd gone to skye holy god you look done in he did indeed unshaven his clothes rumpled he looked like last years christmas wish i am done in he admitted making a pathetically visible effort to smile ive lost count of the hours ive spent in the car over the last few days whatre you drinking not tonic water tonight i take it not tonight ive moved up to bass but now youre here i may change my poison depends on whos paying i see he took off his overcoat threw it down carelessly on the next table and sank into a chair feeling in his pocket he produced cigarette case and lighter as always she helped herself regarding him over the flame that he held for her whats up she asked him he lit a cigarette nothing ah they smoked companionably he made no move to get himself a drink she waited then with his eyes on the opposite wall he said ive asked her to marry me barbara it was as she expected you dont exactly look like the bearer of glad tidings no im not lynley cleared his throat studying the tip of his cigarette barbara sighed felt the weighty sore blanket of his unhappiness and found to her surprise that she wore it as her own at the nearby bar evelyn the blowsy barmaid was fi ngering her way blearyeyed through the nights receipts and doing her best to ignore the leering advances of two of the establishments regular patrons barbara called out her name aye evelyn responded with a yawn bring on two glenlivets neat barbara eyed lynley and added and keep them coming will you sure luv when they were delivered to the table and lynley reached for his wallet barbara spoke again its on me tonight sir a celebration sergeant no a wake she tossed back her whisky it lit her blood like a flame drink up inspector
