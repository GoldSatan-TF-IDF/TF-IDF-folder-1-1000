bertrice small skye omalley the first book in the skye omalley series prologue what the hell do you mean she can have no more children demanded dubhdara omalley of his brother the omalley chief of clan omalley was a big man sixfootfour arms and legs like thick tree limbs ruddy sunburnt skin snapping blue eyes and a mop of dark hair that was just getting a sprinkling of silver you priests are always prating that the purpose of marriage is to procreate well ive done what the church wanted ive gotten children on her and not one of them a living son now you tell me i must stop but i dont suppose youll be granting me an annulment so i can wed with some fresh and healthy blood faugh you make me sick father seamus omalley looking almost his brothers twin though not quite as dark of skin viewed dubhdara with genuine sympathy and understanding he knew how he felt but there was just no help for it his sisterinlaw couldnt take another pregnancy the midwife had been quite certain about that another child would take lady omalleys life that would be outright murder the priest drew a deep breath youve been married ten years brother and in that time peigis been pregnant ten times shes miscarried three this birth nearly killed her the omalley whirled bitterness flooding his rugged face aye he said shes miscarried thriceand all boys too the only one of my sons she managed to birth lived barely long enough for you to baptize god assoil his wee soul and what am i left with girls six girls five of whom are as plain of face as their mother faugh damn i thought surely this time he paced the room angrily caring nothing that his harsh words were overheard by the woman who lay half dead and weeping with bitter disappointment in the next room she had prayed so hard for a son she had made a novena every month of her confinement she had fasted and sacrificed giving to those less fortunate than herself and what was the result of her piety another girl and the knowl edge that she would now never be able to bear her husband a son unknowing and uncaring dubhdara omalley raged on and on why could she not give me sons seamus why ive gotten a brace of healthy lads on lasses about the countryside but my own wife can give me nothing but girls i wish to god she had died and the female brat with her god forgive you dubhdara exclaimed seamus omalley shocked to his soul omalley shrugged at least i might start anew but wait and see seamus you wait shell outlive me yet no ill not stop trying i must have a legitimate son i must you get peigi with child again dubh and she dies ill have the church on you itd be deliberate murder for ive warned you what will happen if she conceives again the midwife said she almost bled to death the wee lass shes borne is healthy and strong though thanks be to god omalley made a derisive noise what will we baptize her dubh encouraged the priest omalley thought a minute call her skye after the place from which her mother came her oldest sister moire can stand her godmother she needs a godfather too brother you be her godfather seamus six daughters is too many to provide dowries for so i intend skye omalley for the church the churchll take a smaller portion and tis fitting that the future nuns godfather be a priest seamus omalley nodded satisfied it was high time his brother singled out a daughter for the church but then the priest looked closely at his new niece for the first time and was quickly certain that this was not the daughter dubh would send to a convent his five older nieces were as their father had said plain as pikestaffs with their ordinary brown hair their pale gray eyes they were like little sparrows this child however was a bird of paradise her skin was gardeniafair her eyes a wonderful blue like the waters off kerry and she already had a thick headful of black curls like her fathers no said seamus omalley softly to himself you are definitely not convent material skye omalley he smiled down at the babe if she fulfilled her promise her beauty could be bartered for a powerful match the church would be delighted to accept a less spectacular omalley one whose dowry could be enriched by sister skyes good fortune on the following day skye omalley was baptized in the family chapel her mother still weak from childbirth was not present but her father and five older sisters were moire aged ten and the eldest became skyes godmother looking on admiringly were peigi nine bride seven eibhlin four and sine eighteen months when seamus omalley poured the holy water on the childs head skye did not cry out as custom decreed thus allowing the devil to depart her instead to everyones shock she made a sound very much like a giggle and for the first time dubhdara omalley looked at his new daughter with interest so he chuckled his blue eyes narrowing with speculation its not afraid of water is it well shes a true omalley at any rate maybe ill not be giving you to the church after all skye omalley what do you think brother seamus the priest smiled back i think not brother perhaps one of the others will be better suited and even has a true vocation time will tell dubh time will tell the omalley took his new daughter from his brother and cradled her in the crook of his big arm with his startingly bright blue eyes shoulderlength black hair and bushy black beard he very much resembled a pirate indeed his searoving activities bordered on piracy however his fierce appearance did not frighten his new daughter at all she gurgled contentedly before closing her eyes and falling asleep as the omalley left the chapel with his brother his five older daughters trailing in their wake he did not relinquish his hold on the infant the bond between skye and her father had been formed and when peigi omalleys milk refused to come in he chose the wet nurse himselfa healthy pretty farmgirl whose bastard had been strangled by its umbilical cord six months later dubhdara omalley departed on a seagoing expedition which would keep him away from ireland for several months to his priestly brothers outrage he took baby skye and her wet nurse megi with him youre a disgrace to the family dubhdara omalley what the devil will people say about megi and if thats not bad enough youre endangering the child ill not have skye harmed roared the doting uncle the omalley laughed stow your gab seamus im not endangering skye shes already gone sailing with me for a day or so she likes being on my ship as to megi i would be endangering skye if i did not take her along megis milk is better for skye than a goats which is the only alternative and i suppose youll deny youve been fucking with megi no ill not deny it you know i like all the comforts the priest threw up his hands in despair there was nothing he could do with his brother dubh was the most carnal man he knew well one good thing would come of it at least poor peigi would be safe from her husbands lust for the time being in the summer of the omalley of innisfana sailed out of his stronghold on innisfana island into the western seas it was the first of skyes many voyages she took her first tottering steps on the heaving deck of her fathers ship her small baby teeth cut marks into the ships wheel while her wet nurse megi cowered in her bunk fighting seasickness and praying she wouldnt drown skye omalley clapped her fat baby hands and laughed at the storms the baby became a toddler and the toddler a little girl dubhdara omalley was the lord of the seas around ireland he had many ships and several hundred men who answered only to him skye soon became his acknowledged heir and a favorite among the rough sailors she was spoiled and cosseted by them all she barely knew her mother and sisters and had no time or patience for them and their silly lives in the spring of skyes mother died soon her uncle seamus urged that skye stay home and learn some womans ways to sustain her in marriage as the priest pointed out to his brother skyes husband was more likely to appreciate a wife who could run his home than one who could navigate a ship through the fog reluc tantly omalley sent skye home to innisfana to learn how to be a lady angry at being taken from her beloved sea skye set about making her older married sisters lives miserable she quickly learned however that dubhdara omalleys mind was made up she must learn womanly arts so as her father wished skye set about making a good job of it when her next oldest sister sine was married a few months later skye had become accomplished in the household arts and was scheduled to be wed next but though skye had learned the womanly arts she had not become a biddable female not skye omalley part i ireland chapter it was a perfect early summer day in the year innisfana island its great green cliffs tumbling into the deep and spar kling blue sea shone clear at the mouth of omalley bay english weather the irish inhabitants of the region called it and it was nearly the only english thing they approved of there was a slight breeze and in the skies above the island the gulls and terns soared and swooped their eerie skrees the only counterpoint to the breaking surf standing tall against the horizon was omalley castle a typical tower house of dark gray stone rising several stories high it com manded a view of the sea from all its windows it had a wide moat and beyond that moat wasof all thingsa rose garden planted by the late lady omalley after her death now four years past the new lady omalley kept the garden up now in full bloom it was a riot of yellows pinks reds and whites a perfect background for the wedding of the youngest daughter inside the tower house in the main hall the five older daughters of the omalley family sat happily gossiping with their pretty stepmother while they sewed and embroidered the brides trousseau it had been a long time since they had all been together now each had her own home and they all met only on special occasions they were as similar now as they had been as children medium tall they all ran to partridge plump it was the kind of comfortable figure that kept a man warm on a cold night each was fairskinned with soft peachcolored cheeks serious gray eyes and long straight lightbrown hair none was beautiful but none was ugly either the eldest moire was twentyfive and had been married for twelve years she was mother to nine living children seven sons moire stood high in her fathers favor peigi at twentythree had been married ten years and was mother to nine sons peigi stood even higher in her fathers favor bride twentyone had been mar ried eight years and had only four children two of whom were boys dubhdara tolerated bride and constantly exhorted her to greater productivity youre more like your mother than the others he would say ominously eibhlin eighteen was the only one with a religious calling she had been such a quiet little thing that they hadnt even suspected her piety until the boy to whom she was to be wed succumbed to an attack of measles the year eibhlin was twelve as omalley con sidered a possible replacement bridegroom for his fourth daughter eibhlin begged to be allowed to enter a convent she genuinely desired that life because her uncle seamus now bishop of muirisk was present for the talk dubhdara omalley was forced to give his consent eibhlin entered her convent at thirteen and had just recently taken final vows sine omalley butler was sixteen wed three years and the mother of one boy she was eight months pregnant but she would not have missed skyes wedding the married sisters were dressed in simply cut fullskirted silk dresses with bell sleeves and low scooped necklines moire was in a deep rich blue peigi in scarlet bride in violet and sine in golden yellow the lacy frill of their chemises peeked elegantly up through the low bodices eibhlin struck the only somber note her allcovering black linen gown was relieved only by a severe white starched rectangular bib in which was centered an ebony silverbanded crucifix about her waist the nun wore a twisted silk rope also black which hung in two plaits to the hem of her gown one plait knotted into three knots symbolized the trinity the other knotted in the same man ner symbolized the estates of poverty chastity and obedience by way of vivid contrast her sisters wore chains of wrought gold or silver about their waists and each woman had attached to her chain a rosary a needlecase a mirror or simply a set of household keys because this was an informal home garthering the married sisters wore their hair loose parted in the center sine and peigi had added pretty arched linen caps and of course eibhlin whose hair had been cut when she took her vows wore starched and pleated white wings over her white wimple presiding over this gathering was dubhdara omalleys second wife anne was the same age as her stepdaughter eibhlin and a pregnant with her fourth child as was her stepdaughter sine anne was a pretty woman with chestnutbrown curls merry brown eyes and a sweet sensible nature annes silk gown was of a deep win shade and fashioned identically to her stepdaughters gowns but over her ruffled bodice anne wore a double strand of creamy baroque pearls none of the omalley daughters had resented their father marriage to anne and everyone liked her enormously one could not help liking anne for nine years after skyes birth dubhdara omalley had obeyed his priest brothers edict and stayed out of his wifes bed he really did not wish to kill peigi free of yearly pregnancies peigi regained her strength and even began to bloom then one night dubhdara omalley had arrived home from a long voyage it was late he had no current mistress and there wasnt a servant girl in sight he had gotten drunk and sought his wifes bed nine months later peigi omalley died giving birth to the longawaited son born september and baptized michael the little boy was now almost six within an almost indecently short time omalley had taken his second wife a girl of thirteen nine months from their wedding day anne had birthed brian a year later shane and in another year shamus unlike her meek predecessor anne omalley possessed good health and high spirits this child she carried was to be the last she told her husband firmly it would also she assured him be a boy five sons should give him the immortality he craved omalley had laughed and slapped her playfully on the backside his daughters took this to mean that he was either in his dotage or growing mellow with age had their own mother ever made such a statement she would have been beaten black and blue but then anne omalley was the mother of sons moire looked up from her embroidery to gaze with pleasure about the hall it had never looked so nice in their mothers time for she poor soul had spent much of her life in her own rooms the stone floors were always well swept now the rushes changed weekly the oak trestles were polished to a mellow golden hue reflecting the great silver candlesticks with their pure beeswax tapers the big brass andirons were filled with enormous oak logs ready to be lit when the evening arrived behind the high board promi nently displayed hung a large new tapestry depicting saint brendan the monk on a skyblue background guiding his ship across the western seas anne had designed it and had been working on it almost every evening of her married life it had been a labor of love for the second lady omalley adored not only her bluff big husband but their sons and their home as well moires eyes lit upon several big colorful porcelain bowls filled with roses their pungent spicy scent gave the room a wonderful exotic smell moire wrinkled her nose with pleasure and said to anne the bowls are new aye came the reply your father brought them back from his last voyage he is so good to me moire and why not demanded moire you are good to him anne where is skye interrupted peigi out riding with young dom i am surprised at your father in pursuing this betrothal they do not suit at all they were promised in the cradle explained moire it wasnt easy for da to find husbands for us all for weve none of us large dowries skyes marrying the heir to the ballyhennessey oflahertys is the best match of us all anne shook her head i fear this match your sister is a very independent girl and its all das fault for he has spoiled her terribly said peigi she should have been married off two years ago at thirteen like the rest of us but no skye did not want it he lets her have her way all the time thats not so peigi eibhlin chided her sister anne is correct when she says that skye and dom do not suit skye is not like us in temperament we favor our mother while she favors da dom is simply neither strong enough nor sensitive enough to be skyes husband hoitytoity sister said peigi sourly it amazes me how much the wee nun knows about human nature indeed and i do replied eibhlin calmly for whom do you think the poor women of my district pour out their unhappiness to peigi certainly not the priest he tells them it is their christian duty to be abused by their menfolk and then he adds to their guilt by giving them a penance the sisters look shocked and anne broke the tension by laughing youre more a rebel than a holy woman stepdaughter eibhlin sighed you speak the truth anne and it troubles me greatly but though i try i cannot seem to change anne omalley leaned over and fondly patted her stepdaughter on the hand being a woman is never ever easy she said wisely no matter what role we chose to play in life the two young women smiled fondly at each other with complete understanding then everyone looked startled as they heard shouting in the entry hall below them as the noise came toward them up the steps the omalley sisters glanced knowingly at each other they recognized the voices of dom oflaherty and their sister skye as the two burst into the main hall anne omalley was again struck by the beauty of the two young people she had never seen two more physically perfect people and perhaps this was why her husband insisted on the match anne shivered with apprehension dom oflaherty threw his riding gloves on a table at eighteen he was of medium height slender with beautifully shaped arms hands and legs having inherited his french grandmothers color ing he had glorious closecropped curly golden hair and skyblue eyes he affected a tailored short beard that hugged the perfectly sculpted sides of his face and ended in a softly rounded point because he was angry however his fair skin was now an unattrac tive mottled red his handsome face with its long straight nose and narrow lips was contorted with rage its indecent he shouted at skye its indecent and immodest for a maiden to ride astride a beast my god skye that horse of yours when were married i will see that youre more suitably mounted upon a palfrey what ever possessed your father to let you ride mat big black brute ill never know you lost dom came the infuriatingly cool reply you lost the race to me and as you always did when we were children you try to retaliate by clouding the issue well let me tell you what you can do with your bloody palfrey skye anne omalleys voice was sharp with warning the girl looked to her stepmother then laughed oh all right annie she acquiesed prettily i will try to behave myself but dom oflaherty hear me well finn is my horse i have raised him from a colt and i love him if were to be happily married you must accept that for i have no intention of exchanging him for a rocking horse just to soothe your male pride and while her bridegroom fumed skye signaled to a servant to bring some wine as if in afterthought she ordered some for dom as well flinging himself into a chair he glowered at her but all the while his eyes roamed her body and he thought how beautiful she was in her darkgreen silk riding habit the skirt was divided and the neckline open plunging into the valley of her young breasts tiny beads of moisture had gathered on her chest and the sight excited him he realized that he longed to possess this lovely young woman at fifteen skye omalley was well on the way to fulfilling the promise of unequaled beauty that she had shown at birth she stood every bit as tall as her betrothed like him she was beautifully proportioned with a slim waist that moved into softly rounded hips her breasts were small but full she had a heartshaped face her eyes were still the color of the seas off the kerry coast sometimes pure blue sometimes dark sometimes azure with a faint hint of green they were fringed in thick ebony lashes that brushed tender pink cheeks her nose was slim turning up just slightly at the tip and if you looked carefully you could see a few soft golden freckles across the bridge of her nose the red mouth was surprisingly se ductive with a full lower lip and when she laughed she revealed small perfect white teeth her skin was the color of cream and seemed even fairer by the contrasting mass of blueblack hair that tumbled about her shoulders she excited dom very much although he it seemed did not interest her she far preferred galloping that great black stallion of hers at breakneck speed about the countryside or sailing off with her father on some piratical adventure the realization was quite a shock to his pride dom oflaherty was not used to indifference from the fair sex women ordinarily made fools of themselves over him and he was very proud of his sexual prowess dom tried to console himself with the thought that once he bedded her she would soon be tamed hottempered virgins usually turned out to be passionate lovers he licked his thin lips in anticipation and quaffed his goblet of wine he was not aware that his betrothed was eying him with disgust dom oflaherty would run to fat in his middle years skye decided again from the entry below came the noises of arrival anne omalley rose to her feet with a smile your father is back she said and it sounds like he brings guests two large wolfhounds several setters and a large terrier all bounded into the hall one of the wolfhounds trotted up to anne and dropped two small velvet bags at her feet bending lady omalley picked up the bags and loosening the strings poured the contents of one bag into her cupped hand she stared at the sapphire anddiamond necklace that nestled in her palm holy mary she gasped dubhdara omalley chuckled with pleasure from the doorway then you like it lovey theres earbobs and a ring to match in the other like it oh dubh its the most beautiful thing ive ever owned where portuguese galleon got itself blown off course and then wrecked aways up the coast we were just in time to save the captain from the scavengers he was most grateful anne said no more but she read between the lines it was obvious that her husband and his crew had battled coastal wreckers for pos session of the damaged galleon the omalleys had been pirates for centuries it was their way of life undoubtedly the captain of the unfortunate ship and the survivors among his crew were now housed in the dungeons below where they would spend the next several months awaiting ransom anne shuddered and reminded herself that such thoughts were not her concern and wheres my wee lass demanded the omalley here da skye rose from her chair and came forward seeing her garb he frowned with disapproval still riding astride poppet dont scold me da she wheedled him prettily it was you who taught me and i simply cant gallop finn sitting sideways its most unnatural the omalley cocked an eyebrow must you gallop him wouldnt a nice trot do you you must think of the babes youre going to bear dom now poppet she ignored his last remark have you ever tried to trot with one leg slung over a pommel da the last time i tried it i ended up with bruises all over my skye weve guests for the first time her attention was drawn to the man by his side my lord she heard her father say this is my youngest daugh ter skye who will shortly be the bride of young oflaherty skye this is niall lord burke the macwilliams heir niall an iarain niall of the iron she said softly this was a famous man the secret dream lover of half the maidens in ireland i see my reputation precedes me my lady skye it is an open secret that you are captain revenge and that you conduct those daring raids against the english who live in the dublin pale of course no one would dare accuse you of this yet you my lady do not fear me he murmured holding her fast with his gaze until she blushed the voice was deep and sure but as smooth as fine velvet she shivered she raised her eyes to his they were a silvery gray and she imagined that in anger they would be colder than the far northern sea but in the heat of passion they would be fiery warm like rich wine guilty color flooded her cheeks at these immodest thoughts the gray eyes twinkled infuriatingly as if reading her mind he towered over her by a good eight inches his smoothly shaven face had been tanned by the outdoors the shortcropped hair was as midnight dark as her own raising her hand he kissed it it was all she could do not to snatch it away for his lips burned her flesh like a brand sweet mary she thought hes so much more sophisticated than dom yet hes only ten years older than i am my lord welcome to innisfana she murmured politely dear god was that husky breathless voice hers and why was anne staring at her so strangely her fathers voice brought her back to reality these are for your dowry poppet he said handing her a marvelous collection of rubies set in gold they were a necklace earrings bracelets a ring and a hair ornament everyone exclaimed and dom oflaherty congratulated himself as though he had been personally responsible for choosing his bride skye clutched the jewelry to her thanking her father she left the hall damn thought anne omalley she has been attracted to lord burke and why not now why couldnt dubh have betrothed her to a strong fierce man like lord burke instead of that vain boy oflaherty skye walked up the stairs to her chamber with what she hoped was great dignity she was quite surprised that she could move at all for her legs were shaking terribly she was very confused and not just a little frightened by her reaction to lord burke she hoped she hadnt behaved like a green maid but never had she had this kind of a reaction to a man she had never seen niall burke before though his romantic and military escapades were legend as she had dared to say aloud minutes before he was known to some as the famous captain re venge who caused havoc for the english and their irish allies when ever he felt that their policies were not serving ireland captain revenge exacted a high penalty from english overlords who dealt unfairly with their native irish underlings once in an escapade later to have all of ireland laughing up its sleeve captain revenge had made love to the daughter of an important english nobleman who had estates in ireland having learned the layout of her fathers castle from the lovebesotted girl captain revenge ransacked the castles treasure room and used the noblemans store to pay the taxes of several impoverished irish families the english accepted the money and rendered receipts when the deception was uncovered it was too late for anything to be done and the english fumed with impotent rage certainly they suspected the connection between captain revenge and niall lord burke but what could anyone do londons policy was that the overload of midconnaught was not to be antagonized he was after all an allyan ally to the english being anybody not openly waging war against england and too they asked themselves what possible real damage could one highspirited young man do he was indeed a fascinating man thought skye and when their eyes met there had been a moment of deep recognition safe in her room she watched as molly her maid prepared her bath molly thought the lady skye bathed too much but molly had to admit that her mistress smelted better than anyone she knew she took the riding clothes from the girl and brushing them put them in the wardrobe skye divested herself of her undergarments pinned her long hair up and climbed into the tub the warm water felt good slowly skye rubbed the cake of scented soap between her hands then washed her face niall burke niall burke her mind repeated his name like a litany he was so tall he had made her feel petite which she most certainly was not he had been dressed in the english fashion with elegant particolored hose and matching green pantaloons to the knee she imagined the rippling muscles beneath the green velvet doublet she suddenly wondered what it would feel like to be crushed against that broad chest and to her shame the little nipples on her small breasts hard ened thrusting above the water what on earth was the matter with her she had never had thoughts like these before she knew so little about what went on between men and women and dom had certainly never inspired her in fact for all his good looks dom repelled her molly took the soap from skye finished washing her and dried her off with a linen towel she had barely finished wrapping the girl in a silken chamber robe when a knock sounded on the door molly opened it bobbed a flirtatious curtsey and admitted dom oflaherty he sauntered in with a lascivious look to his bridetobe whose young body was well outlined by the robe i have to leave you for a few days skye sir murrough has sent word that i am needed i will be back in time for our wedding skyes heart soared he would be gone and lord burke would be here go with god dom she said sweetly for a moment there was an awkward silence then dom reached out and pulled his betrothed into his arms no kiss lovey you would send me on my way without the least sign of affection were not wed yet dom i dont have to kiss you dont have to he exploded christ skye dont be such a little prude youll have to do more than kiss me in a few days time damn but she was a sweet armful all perfumed and warm from the bath he could feel his desire growing he sought for her mouth but she squirmed away no his blue eyes narrowed in anger but then he laughed all right lovey but in a short time ill have you begging for my kisses he mocked her a bow then turned and left the room she shuddered oh squealed molly hes a lusty one to be sure mistress youll have good bedsport with him and thats lucky in a husband be quiet you little fool snapped skye instead of drooling over my betrothed fetch my new burgundy velvet gown i intend wearing it tonight with the rubies da gave me molly scurried to obey skye omalley was a better mistress than most rarely cruel but not above administering a slap now and then the maid laced her mistress into a little beribboned busk that pushed her pretty breasts up so that they seemed almost to spill from her palepink underblouse the nearly transparent sleeves were striped in gold carefully skye drew her stockings up her shapely legs they were pink silk embroidered with a flowering vine of gold thread and had been made in paris several petticoats followed and then the dress a beautiful creation of the finest softest velvet it was a shimmering jewelred with a full flowing skirt slashed sleeves revealed the pinkandgoldstriped sleeves of the under blouse skye now sat careful not to wrinkle her skirts before her precious mirror while molly brushed her dark hair until it shone with bluish lights she was not allowed to bind it up until after her marriage this had been a source of great frustration to skye especially at sea but her father had been very firm about it she might braid it but the braids must hang long no omalley maiden puts her hair up until she weds he stated and there was no point in arguing looking at herself in the mirror however she had to admit that her long wavy hair was beautiful especially now as molly placed a little gold lace cap with a tiny veil on her head skye clasped the ruby necklace about her throat and studied the effect the great stones glittered almost savagely against the creamy softness of her bare chest and when she caught her breath she noted with surprise mat her breasts swelled provocatively beneath the glittering rubies the jeweled hair ornament was to be put aside until she wore her hair up but she slipped on the earrings bracelet and ring sliding her feet into red velvet shoes she stood lor mistress breathed molly reverently i never seen you look so beautiful what a pity master doms not here now to see you you could drive a man to madness skye laughed pleased do you really think so molly secretly she was wondering whether lord burke could be driven to madness her insides fluttered with fearful delicious anticipation she almost flew out the door bumping into her pretty stepmother as she did so gracious skye laughed anne omalley if you would impress the hall then you must not rush so make a grand entrance slowly gliding thusly my love she demonstrated prettily your pardon anne i did not hurt you did i no love but stop so i may look at you dear heaven how lovely you are and not yet grown if young dom could but see you now skye made a face i dont want to marry him anne the words tumbled out all by themselves anne omalley was suddenly serious and fully sympathetic i know love i know and i do understand please anne please speak to da he adores you and hell listen to you hed do anything for you oh skye ill try you know i will but it will do no good your father is a man of his word and he has given his word on this marriage youre the last of his girls and he wants you well settled young ofiaherty is a very good match for an omalley of innisfana i hate him came the whispered reply hes always undressing me with his eyes perhaps it will be different when youre wed soothed anne though in her heart she knew it wouldnt maidens are often fearful of the unknown but really there is no cause for alarm my love tomorrow i will come and explain it all to you skye speak to da anne please promise me you will i will skye i promise i will the two women moved down the steps to the main hall of the castle and all the while anne was aware that niall burkes eyes were fastened to her beautiful stepdaughter at the bottom of the steps he was there tucking skyes small hand in his arm wordlessly sweeping her away while anne watched helplessly no one else saw the dangerous hopeless attraction between the two she must speak to dubhdara the floor beneath skyes feet seemed to have disappeared she was floating shyly she glanced down at the hand covering hers it was big and square and brown it was magically warm and she could feel the strength hidden deep within it her heart was pounding why did he affect her this way they walked over to the great fireplace which was flanked by enormous stone lions it was red with the oak logs that now burned merrily with an occasional crackle and snap they stopped and observed the leaping flames for a moment they did not look at each other but merely stood side by side finally he spoke why do you tremble when i touch you i am not used to the attentions of men she answered him breathlessly turning her so that she faced him he looked down at her i do not understand that skye omalley for you are outrageously fair has no man even your betrothed whispered sweet words of love into your little shell ear no her cheeks were softly pink now and her voice was so low that he had to bend to hear her niall burke was enchanted he felt something strange sweeping over him possessing him rushing him onward to something his inner voice warned against look at me sweetheart he com manded her i promise not to bite you though god knows youre a tempting morsel shyly she raised her blue eyes to his silvery gray ones and for a moment skye felt as if she were drowning she realized he felt it too neither could tear their gaze away they were suspended in time their souls flowing back and forth between their bodies twining into one perfect being a great guffaw of laughter from the other side of the hall broke the spell with shock niall swore christ what is it you do to me little witch he was astounded by himself turn your eyes from me skye darling before i shame us both he signaled a servant bearing a tray of wine goblets and snatching two gave one to skye he gulped down the other welcoming the burning sensation that spread through his stomach it gave him something to concen trate on to prevent himself from carrying this girl away from the hall forever when dinner was announced lord burke as the highestranking guest was seated next to the bridetobe he was artful enough to hide his troubled emotions but the meal tasted like sawdust to him he was a man of the world experienced beyond most but the girl had affected him as no other female had ever done he admitted to himself that he desperately wanted to bed the wench but there was a great deal more to it than that something he had never felt before it had all come on him so quickly that be couldnt understand it niall burke was the only son of rory burke the macwilliam of middle connaught the macwilliam had almost despaired of ever having an heir all three of his wives had died in childbirth the last of them maerid obrien had given him his only child from the moment of his birth niall had been a strong and healthy lad but the macwilliam anxiously protected him his wet nurse ate at the macwilliams table so that the lord of midconnaught could oversee her diet the babys nursery was kept well warmed in the winter and dry in the damp weather no child had ever been so well taken care of even his sleep was overseen by a night nurse who sat first by his cradle and later by his bedside monitoring his every bream despite it all the boy flourished convinced that he had a lively heir the macwilliam finally eased his stranglehold intelligent niall was educated first by the priests and then sent to england for polish at cambridge in sports there was no one to touch him and because he could not be bested in any field he was called ironman he could run faster than any man in ireland was unbeaten in wrestling from the time he was twelve was both an excellent swords man and an excellent falconer he swam as though bom to water rode like a centaur and could follow a stags trail better than most hounds niall proved a lusty animal between the ages of fourteen and sixteen there wasnt a serving wench in his fathers castle or a girl in the surrounding countryside who was safe from his attentions gradually however he calmed down and became more discerning rory burke adored his only son and in the number of nialls bastards scattered about the countryside the father saw a resurgence of his branch of the burke family rory now wanted his heir safely wed to a suitable young woman niall however had preferred to remain free but today had changed that he had fallen instantly in love with skye omalley never having been denied anything in his entire life niall fully expected to have her on nialls right sat eibhlin omalley and throughout dinner he devoted himself to the nun much to eibhlins secret amusement like her perceptive stepmother she had seen the sudden powerful attraction between skye and lord burke she pitied them both after dinner omalley suggested that skye show the omalley rose garden to lord burke it wasnt an unusual request for dubhdara was proud of his youngest daughters beauty wit and manners he enjoyed impressing his guests with her anne could only hope to god that lord burke remembered skye was to be wed in a few days niall and skye walked slowly from the hall down the steps to the entry and across the lowered drawbridge neither spoke the mauve and golden twilight of the early irish summer gave more than enough light the air was cool with an occasional slight breeze that carried to them the sensuous fragrance of the roses my mother planned this garden for years murmured skye she loved roses it was the one thing da indulged her in he had bushes brought in from all over the world its a beautiful garden isnt it it is most charming replied lord burke gravely thank you they walked a bit farther in silence once more as they came to the end of the roses skye turned to go back to the castle but lord burke touched her shoulder and she stopped her face upturned his strong arms wrapped about her a flame of fierce joy shot through her she had known this would happen she had wanted it to happen his dark head dipped and skye omalleys lips parted slightly like an opening rosebud as she received her very first kiss to her great surprise his lips were soft she hadnt expected that in a man then he was drawing her even closer and the mouth on hers became demanding instinctively she answered that demand freeing her arms and sliding them around his neck so that their bodies touched for a brief moment she was floating then suddenly abruptly he released her mouth his eyes were dark with passion looking down on her he muttered huskily i knew it i knew it would be this way with you for the briefest moment reason returned and she began to trem ble concern filled his eyes and catching her face between his thumb and forefinger he whispered no sweetheart dont regret or be afraid of me god not that i could not bear it i i dont understand she whispered i dont understand what is happening to me to us sweetheart its happening to me too skye i barely know you but im in love with you i have never been in love before skye but i know that i am in love with you no tears rolled down her cheeks you must not say these things to me my lord in a few days time i am to wed with dom oflaherty but you dont love him skye my lord burke you know the way of these things i have been betrothed since the cradle i will speak to your father at once sweetheart you must not marry young oflaherty she looked at him wonderingly are you not contracted my lord she died before we could be wed i did not even know her come sweetheart i would kiss you again his mouth swooped down and skye gave a small cry of joy as she yielded herself wholly to him it was utter madness yet he loved her this great and famous man loved her and dear god she loved him she the levelheaded skye had fallen in love at first sight she could feel his powerful body restraining itself in its desire and she loved him the more for if he tried to take her now she would give herself gladly and he must surely know it reluctantly he loosed her his eyes warm and caressing skye sweet skye how you intoxicate me my love come sweetheart let us return before i lose my head he took her hand and led he slowly back to the castle anne omalley watched them enter the hall and silently she despaired skyes cheeks were flushed her lips softly bruised with recent kisses her eyes dreamy with anticipation anne rose from her chair she had to talk with her husband suddenly a pain tore through her belly her waters broke soaking her stockings shoes and her petticoats the baby she cried doubling over clutching her swollen middle instantly she was surrounded by the women dubhdara omalley shouldered his way through the crowd and picking up his wife carried her out of the hall and upstairs to their bedchamber no one could believe that a woman who had borne three children so easily would have such a difficult labor with the fourth but anne omalley struggled for two days eibhlin trained in midwifery worked hard but the child was large and turned the wrong way four times the young nun turned the baby to the correct position and four times the infant reversed itself finally in desperation eibhlin turned the baby a fifth time and finding its small shoulder gently grasped it and drew the child slowly down the birth canal after that anne was able to finish the job as anne had predicted it was a son the boy weighed over ten pounds he would be named conn dubhdara omalley came to his young wifes bedside they had bathed her and put her between clean lavenderscented sheets she had been given a nourishing drink of beef broth mixed with red wine and herbs which would stop the bleeding and help her sleep she was exhausted the room emptied omalley bent and kissed his wifes cheek he looked somewhat older for he had suffered untold agonies at the possibility of losing this loving woman no more annie i am happy to settle for five sons and the bonniest wife in ireland i dont want to lose you love she smiled weakly and patted his hand then suddenly she re membered her promise skye she began weakly for a moment he looked puzzled then his brow cleared skye ah yes the wedding is scheduled for tomorrow youd not have it called off eh love well dont worry annie skye will be wed tomorrow never fear you just rest and get strong and if youre awake before tomorrow evening ill send the bride and groom in to visit you she tried to speak tried to tell him that he must call it off that the wedding of skye and dom would be a terrible mistake but the herbs and exhaustion had taken effect anne struggled to speak but could not her eyes slowly closed and she couldnt open them again anne omalley had fallen into a deep druginduced sleep chapter dubhdara omalley stood looking down at his sleeping daugh ter it shocked even him to realize how beautiful skye really was and he wished he had the name and the fortune to assure her a nobler husband than young oflaherty he bore no love for the english but he knew mat their royal court was at this moment the center of the earth and he thought how skye would shine there still he hadnt done badly by her her husband would be the next chief of the ballyhennessey oflahertys and skye would be mother to the chief after dom he had her safely settled hed miss her though well he chuckled to himself why not admit he had a special place in his heart for the lass she was pure omalley himself in female form and like none of his other children for a few minutes more he watched her in silent wonder and men he gently shook her by the shoulder wake up skye wake up lassie she resisted having no desire to be yanked from the dream in which she and niall were kissing he persisted however and finally she opened her eyes a bit da whats the matter annies been delivered of a fine healthy son poppet but shes fair worn with the effort still she doesnt want your marriage postponed the wedding feast will go on as scheduled but you and dom are to be married in an hour in the family chapel get up skye lass this is your wedding day she was instantly awake no da no anne promise its all right love he interrupted its all right with anne shes sorry to miss the festivities but she knows that with a castle full of guests we couldnt postpone it skye sat up her long dark hair tumbling about her white shoul ders her eyes were enormous and deep blue in her heartshaped face he shifted his eyes uncomfortably from the perfection of her small breasts visible through the thin lawn of her shift da listen to me please i do not want to marry dom oflaherty oh why wont you listen to me dubhdara omalley sat down on the edge of his favorite childs bed now poppet weve been over this before of course youre going to marry dom hes a fine young man and its a good match for you these bridal nerves are natural but you must not give way why didnt he understand no please da no i hate dom i cannot i will not marry him there was an hysterical edge to her voice skye his voice had become stern enough now i have post poned this wedding for two years in hopes you would outgrow your willfulness but no more poppet youve no reason to cry off no religious calling only silly maiden fears that will have vanished by this time tomorrow he stood up make yourself beautiful for dom poppet and he left her skye began to weep a combination of frustration anger and fear great gulping sobs of anguish poured hot and salty from her eyes until they were almost swollen shut molly finding her young mistress in this shocking state turned about and sought the lady eibhlin the young nun came instantly and taking her younger sister into her loving arms tried to soothe her when the sobs had finally abated eibhlin laid her sister back on her pillows and mixed some herbs in a goblet of wine that she made skye drink the medication would soothe her eibhlin had seen cases of bridal nerves before next the nun took soft pads of linen soaked in rose water and lay them on skyes closed eyes it will take the swelling down she told molly well let her rest for half an hour then dress her for the wedding very soon thereafter skye omalley stood beside dom oflaherty in the castles candlelit chapel and was wed all the guests agreed that there had never been a more beautiful bride her gown was of creamy white satin with a deep square neck edged in a wide ruffle of silver lace the low neckline gave the groom a fine view of her breasts and dom oflaherty licked his lips in anticipation at the sight of small pink nipples as the elderly priest intoned the ancient latin words of the cer emony over them the bridegroom thought lasciviously of how he would pillow his head tonight on those soft breasts when she raised her hand to receive the marriage ring dom noted the richness of her gown for the first time the sleeves were slashed the inserts filled with silver lace this lace also edged the wrists her beautiful mack hair was unbound in recognition of her innocence and topped by a simple wreath of sweetly scented white flowers she was whiter than her gown and had dom bothered to look closer he would have seen the helpless trapped look in her eyes the drug given her by her sister forced her to comply with the farce her responses were so low that they could barely be heard and she moved like a puppet her family assumed it was bridal nerves they were pronounced man and wife they turned to face their families and at that moment the chapel doors were flung open revealing niall burke his face anguished his eyes stark with a pain that only she could understand skye simply wanted to die kiss the bride kiss the bride came the ribald shouts dom oflaherty turned skye so that she faced him now he said triumphantly you belong to me his mouth found hers he forced his tongue between her soft lips and into her mouth around them came the crude cries of encouragement the tongue was soft and demanding seeking to escape this horror skye fainted ho shouted dubhdara omalley well pleased heres fine proof of my lasss innocence her first kiss and she swoons loosen her laces lad youre no stranger to womens clothes or so im told while the laughter that greeted omalleys sally echoed around the chapel dom oflaherty picked up his bride and carried her from the room helplessly niall burke watched as the unconscious skye was borne back to her room he wanted to hit the smug young man who cradled skye in his arms with such obvious pride of ownership for the first time in his life the heir to one of the most powerful families in ireland had been thwarted for the last three days niall had tried unsuccessfully to see the omalley but dubhdara had been unavailable to his guests because of his young wifes lying in under the circumstances niall hadnt expected them to marry skye off so quickly he had thought he had time to speak with the omalley though the situation would have been embarrassing there would have been no real disgrace in omalley exchanging the heir to ballyhennessey for the heir to the macwilliam of mayo niall pushed along with the family into the bedchamber dom laid his burden upon the bed with nimble fingers the bridegroom loosened the girls laces momentarily forgetful of his audience dom caressed the soft creamy swell of skyes breast the hunger in his paleblue eyes was unmistakable and niall felt a murderous rage well up in him now now my son well have none of that until tonight chuckled omalley your brides got to be able to stand for all the toasts thatll be drunk at the feast and shell be in no condition if you have her now oflaherty flushed amid the leers and snickers then eibhlin pushed through the crowd to skyes side and kneeling began to rub the girls wrists mollythe wine please and a burnt feather da it would help if all these people left you too brother dom if skye is to be up to enjoy her own wedding feast she must rest now the room slowly emptied and eibhlin and molly raised skye up first the feather was burnt and waved beneath her nose then the drugged wine was forced between her lips skye coughed choked and opened her eyes you fainted said the nun drily he he put his tongue in my mouth eibhlin said skye visibly shocked he he said that i belong to him you do no never to dom oflaherty never to any man eibhlin turned you may leave us she told the reluctant molly then eibhlin said quietly its niall burke isnt it skye dear lord he didnt take your virginity miserably skye shook her head he wanted to wed with me eibhlin he was to speak with da but he didnt or if he did da said no youre married to dom oflaherty skye you must face it it is your duty to be a good wife to him he loves you and he is your lord in the eyes of the church i cannot eibhlin i simply cannot i hate dom and i cant bear his touch some women are like that skye perhaps you are one no when niall burke kissed me it was perfect i wanted him the way a woman wants a man in marriage but i dont feel mat way about dom go to sleep little one said the nun soothingly in a few hours time you must hostess your wedding feast sighing skye lay back the herbs were doing their work and suddenly she fell asleep her face still wet with tears eibhlin shook her head what on earth possessed da to insist on this marriage knowing skye was so against it he had always indulged his young est daughter adoring her lavish beauty delighting in her love of the sea he had never before forced her into something eibhlin speculated perhaps their father wanted the last of peigi omalleys daughters out of his house so that he could be free to enjoy his second wife and his five sons at any rate though she would never admit it to skye the nun shared her sisters dislike of oflaherty he was stubborn far too vain and for all his fine education woefully ignorant eibhlin sighed there was simply no help for it it was a mans world and a decent woman was either a wife or a nun perhaps she thought wistfully it would be different someday eibhlin went back to the chapel to pray for her sister there was nothing else she could do when skye awoke several hours later the terrible reality of her situation swept over her once more her knowledge of men was limited but she instinctively understood that her husband was the sort of man who preyed on the weak and helpless dom liked win ning she must not let him know how upset she was slowly she rose from the bed feeling just slightly dizzy and bathed her face in rose water still unlaced she breathed deeply clearing her head she whirled at the sound of the door behind her furious that her privacy was to be so quickly disturbed how dare you enter my chamber he smiled lazily you forget skye pet that i have the right to enter your chamber whenever i choose to do so i am your husband she shivered i forget nothing dom she bravely answered he moved toward her and her courage cracked dont come near me she backed away from him but he kept on until she felt the edge of the bed against the backs of her legs the look in his eyes terrified her and she had to force herself to stand straight to look directly at him she could hear the sound of her own heart drumming in her ears your maiden shyness pleases meto a point skye his hand caressed her cheek slid down her neck to her shoulder then gripped the soft flesh i am your husband and i will brook no disobedience from you your father has spoiled you badly but i will not i will school you as i do the bitches in my kennel and you will do your duty by me when you err i shall punish you do you understand me skye yes dom her eyes were lowered in apparent compliance but really to hide her smoldering hatred good he said his voice softening a little now come here to me pet he took her chin between his fingers and forced her head up his wet mouth ground on hers and his tongue forced itself between her clenched teeth she shivered with revulsion the wet lips were on her throat he pushed her onto the bed and atop her pulled down her gown exposing the small perfect breasts his mouth opened to capture a little pink nipple and she screamed he stopped raised his eyes and looked down on her please dom we must face our guests groaning with frustration he stood up slowly and giving her a venomous look stumbled from the room outside in the hallway he stopped a moment to catch his breath to massage the ache in his groin she was right damn her he didnt dare take her until tonight but he needed to cool the fire in his loins at that moment his wifes buxom maid came around the corner dom oflahertys blue eyes narrowed speculatively and a quick winning smile lit his features molly stopped eyed him and instantly ascertained his need wordlessly she took his hand and led him around the corner into a darkened alcove she loosened his codpiece and gasped with delight oh my lord youll more than do her arms slid up around his neck and she whispered excitedly give us a kiss love he bent to find her mouth all the while fumbling to raise her petticoats he backed her up against the stone castle wall and molly wrapped her legs about his waist clasping the plump cheeks of her buttocks in his hands dom oflaherty buried himself deep in the servant girls willing warmth he worked himself back and forth not caring that he was banging her head against the wall she moaned half with pleasure and half with pain he obtained his release quickly molly was set back down on her feet and straightening his garments oflaherty left her without so much as a word or a glance molly slipped to the floor whimpering skye who seldom prayed outside church was thanking every saint in the calendar for her temporary reprieve tonight there would be no reprieve she would be forced to submit to whatever it was men did with women she had some vague ideas but her sisters had never discussed sex and anne had not gotten around to enlightening her she was going to be at doms mercy she took her brush and removed the tangles from her hair then smoothing the wrinkles from her wedding gown skye opened the door and left her room dom appeared from the darkness and arm in arm they descended into the hall below to greet their guests the festivities had begun without them and a cry went up as they entered dubhdara omalley already half drunk lurched forward and escorted his daughter and her new husband to the high board skye was horrified to find herself with her husband on her right and lord burke on her left good evening mistress oflaherty my best wishes on your future happiness he said formally thank you my lord she answered she dared not look at him lest she begin to weep again but her hand shook as she reached for her goblet noting this his heart contracted painfully the omalley of innisfana had spared no expense huge bowls of raw oysters platters of prawns and shrimp boiled in white wine and herbs were set on all the tables whole sea trout broiled and stuffed first with salmon then with smaller freshwater trout and finally with small shellfish were placed at intervals on the tables the bridegroom stuffed himself with raw oysters loudly reminding everyone of their aphrodisiac quality the next course consisted of whole swans capons in a lemon ginger sauce larded ducks plump golden broiled pigeons whole baby lambs sides of halfcooked beef dripping their fat and bloody juices potted rabbits small pasties of minced meats bowls of new lettuces and small green onions in vinegar silver trenchers of bread and crocks of sweet butter no one went thirsty for silver pitchers of wine both red and white and earthenware pitchers of ale were placed on all the tables and kept filled the last course consisted of shaped jellies in all colors custards fruit pies wheels of sharp cheeses sweet cherries from france and oranges from spain the chef hired for the occasion had done himself splendid credit with a magnificent marzipan confection its top decoration depicted a married couple the bridegrooms codpiece conspicuously large the bride with a coy smile upon her face her eyes fixed on the bulge toast after toast was drunk some were ribald some thoughtful finally dom oflaherty turned to his bride go prepare yourself for me pet i am well fed by your fathers gracious bounty now i would feast on your sweet flesh her cheeks reddened and she shivered i must bathe she an swered there was no time this morning how long an hour half skye i will be denied no longer she stood and immediately a shout went up gathering her skirts up skye fled the hall followed by her sisters and behind them a group of laughing young men if they caught the bride or any of her maids they would be allowed a kiss as forfeit with incredible swiftness the omalley sisters gained skyes chamberwhere the young couple would spend their wedding nightand slammed the door successfully shutting out the young men before the fireplace a small steaming tub of water stood ready skye looked gratefully to her servant bless you molly you anticipated me knew you didnt have time before replied the maid helping skye undress the sisters busied themselves putting skyes beautiful gown away and straightening the chamber sine took the warming pan and ran it smoothly beneath the bedcovers nothing cools a mans ardor like cold sheets she observed skye kept her mind on her bath if she allowed herself to think of what was coming she would go to pieces she glanced about her bedchamber aside from the flowering branches placed there in keeping with the old pagan fertility ritual it seemed the same the large black oak bedstead hung with azure blue velvet had been freshly made with fine linen sheets redolent of lavender the tall matching armoire was now empty of course her clothing having been packed for transport to her new home she washed quickly stepping out of her tub into a warmed towel her lovely body was rosy from the heat of the water molly quickly dried her and lavishly applied scented powder with a lambs wool puff the sisters sneezed as the excess filled the air open the window a bit commanded moire and fetch the silk robe molly skye flushed oh no moirenot that for pitys sake skye moires voice was sharp its an omalley family cus tom and we have all followed it lord sister youre the fairest of us all theres nothing for you to be ashamed of lass but for all those leering men to see me naked we omalleys are proud to show we come to our husbands unblemished you will follow the custom as we all have the silk robe was loosely wrapped around the bride and then moire said peigi unbolt the door i hear the men coming peigi had no sooner stepped back from the door when it burst open and the laughing guests poured into the little room dom oflaherty had already been partially disrobed by his friends dubhdara omalley stepped up to his youngest daughter he was very drunk but he could yet play his part he held his hand up for silence and the room quieted this is the last of me daughters to be wed as with all my girls i am proud to show that she comes unblemished and free of pock marks to her bridegroom he nodded to moire and peigi who drew the simple robe from skye and let it slip to the floor the girl was now com pletely naked as she turned the sisters held up skyes long dark tresses to show the assembled guests that nothing was hidden beneath her hair in the candlelight her beautiful body glowed like mother ofpearl an audible sigh rippled through the room as the men and women admired and envied the young virgins perfection the bridegroom was visibly affected skye was exquisite with her small pinktipped breasts her slim long legs ending in slender higharched feet suddenly the guests were thrown into shock as niall burke pushed forward boldly allowed his silver eyes to slide over the bride and announced omalley as your overlord i claim the droit du seigneur of this woman the master of innisfana swallowed hard a poor jest my lord he replied now very sober he was hoping to god that burke was only drunk but he knew burke wasnt my daughters no peasant wench he stated firmly lord burke drew himself up to his full imposing height his proud glance swept the room i am your overlord dubhdara omalley you swore obedience to me on my tenth birthday it was by my most generous hand that you received this barony of innisfana our laws demand that you comply with my request no shouted dom shes mine mine and i am not your vassal lord burke looked scornfully at the younger man i will remind you oflaherty that your family owes obedience to my father whose deputy i am i claim the droit du seigneur of your bride will either of you gentlemen endanger your families and insult me over a girls maidenhead besides oflaherty when i am finished schooling her shell be much more to your taste you are not i understand very good with virgins there was a sharp intake of breath around the room dubhdara omalley shifted uncomfortably then suddenly it came to him that the final decision rested with his new soninlaw i yield to you my lord he said quickly nearly sighing with relief the complete silence in the hot little room was finally broken by doms voice ill pay a penalty my lord said dom you have but to name it niall burke eyed dom arrogantly then drawled your life or the wenchs maidenhead a gasp went up this was high drama the sort of thing that would be spoken of for years to come in both the halls and hovels of ireland why was lord burke so intent on having the bride to be sure she was a lovely creature but it was very rare for an overlord to claim the droit du seigneur of a vassals bride dom oflaherty whitened then reddened with fear and helpless rage his eyes swept over skye then back to lord burke he pictured them locked in an embrace damn the bastard thought dom hes got me trapped at last he said savagely i yield and damn you to hell my lord burke turning he stamped from the chamber followed quickly by the omalley and the rest of the guests niall burke walked slowly to the door of the room and shutting it slammed the bolt home turning back he looked at skye throughout the whole exchange she had remained as silent and still as a hiding rabbit i do mean to take you he said quietly her eyes were enormous bluegreen against her white face i know she answered softly youll have to tell me what to do no one has ever told me what is required and i am very ignorant anne didnt have time to explain she finished helplessly a warm smile lit his features and he was suddenly her niall again i think sweetheart he said in a kindly voice that the first thing would be to get you into bed you look chilled with a sweeping movement he pulled the covers back and scooping her up gently tucked her beneath the down coverlet kiss me niall it was a simple request and it was also the first time she had called him by his name i have every intention of doing just that skye give me but a moment to divest myself of my clothes please now had she been anyone else he would have made a ribald jest she was so intense so urgent instead he bent kissed the lips she offered it was a sweet kiss and they were both loath to stop but finally she drew away i had to be sure it would be as lovely with you this time as it was the last when dom kissed me today i wanted to die because he revolted me so and is it still as lovely my darling his silvery eyes caressed her warmly yes niall it is still lovely thoughtfully without haste he removed his clothes and approached the bed have you ever seen a man naked before skye the firelight from the small corner fireplace flickered across his bare body only the top part the sailors often strip their shirts off when it gets too hot ive seen bare feet and part of the leg too her eyes slowly traveled the length of him lingering a moment on his sex then blushingly moving upward he grinned mischievously at her i trust i meet with your com plete approval sweetheart he teased climbing into bed with her her heartshaped face was very serious i dont understand how it works let me worry about that he answered taking her into his arms he rolled her beneath him ah skye sweet skye i have dared much for you my darling his mouth found hers again but this time it was different his lips teased playing lightly across her mouth her fluttering eyelids her forehead cheeks chin and lastly the tip of her nose the shock of his sweet assault left her slightly breathless and she was certainly not ready for the warm hand that gently cupped her breast oh then oh niall i am sorry i am so small she apologized shyly unable to meet his warm gaze you are perfection skye see how sweetly your breast nestles into my hand it is like a little white dove he bent his dark head and kissed the pink peak pleased that it hardened almost immediately beneath his lips gently he pressed her back among the pillows lightly straddling her his warm mouth now pressed kisses all across her trembling breasts taking pleasure in her rapid rise to passion her beautiful hair billowed shining and dark across the white linen pillows head thrown back to reveal the slender column of her throat she tempted the warm lips to leave a string of burning kisses down the quivering flesh his big hands slipped over her torso enjoying the silken skin suddenly skye was afire and she moaned helplessly frightened her body felt liquid she was languid yet filled with a great strength at the same time his voice murmured soft and reassuring words of love still she gasped softly surprised as his fingers gently explored her probing tenderly forcing the tension from her body then she became aware of a new touch that of his manhood hard against her soft leg gently his knee nudged her thighs apart the pulsing root of him touched the tip of her womanhood and in a sweet haze of fear and desire she heard him say it will hurt you just once skye after that there will never be pain again my love yes yes oh please yes she panted not even knowing what it was that she sought but desperately wanting it a deep burning pain quickly receded leaving her filled with a wonderful throbbing warmth his silvery eyes met her blue ones and passion mirrored passion as he loved her for a moment they hung suspended in time and then she cried out her pleasure as his hardness broke filling her with his creamy juices after a few breathless minutes he rolled away and cradled her in his arms he stroked her hair marveling at its soft density when he spoke again his velvety voice held the faintest hint of a tremor thank you skye my little love thank you for the most precious gift a man can receive from a maiden she moved so that she could see his face her new womanhood making her brave i have waited all my life for you niall burke do not leave me now for i should sooner be your leman than dom oflahertys wife i would go where you go he sighed i cannot let you go now skye we will get your marriage annulled based on your adultery with me i have no inten tion of returning you to oflaherty we will leave for my fathers castle in the morning your husband is a vain peacock a fat financial settlement and a new and noble bride should soothe his swollen pride you will not leave me her eyes were shining with happiness oh niall i love you i love you so much god sweetheart i adore you he kissed her hard i love you too my darling i love you their bodies melted together once more skye was completely overwhelmed by these new and delicious stormy sensations sweeping over her her body responded to his every touch eagerly seeking each new thrill he lay on his back and lifting her lay her atop him her blushes delighted him shyly she hid her face in his shoulder he chuckled nay sweetheart now you must love me but niall i dont know how she protested touch me skye its the best start she sat up her legs on either side of his torso she couldnt quite meet his gaze yet shyly she touched his chest with a trembling hand the dark mat of hair was soft his skin smooth and warm her hand moved to his shoulder then down his wellmuscled sword arm in a sudden bold move she leaned forward and brushed his cheek with her breast niall softly caught his breath and waited for her next move slowly she rubbed his face and then a hard little nipple was against his lips it was now skyes turn to gasp as she found the taut little peak in the warmness of his mouth his tongue teased it sending darts of fire through her she wriggled eyes half closed his arms came up around her and she once more found herself on her back he caught her hand and drew it down to his manhood unbidden she caressed him with devastating effect he groaned into the dark and tangled night of her hair the clean heathery smell of her soap the warm woman scent of her body maddened him again he slid his great sword into her sweet sheath sighing she took as much of him to herself as she could her arms held him as tightly as his held her put your legs about me my darling i cannot have enough of you his voice was strange fierce and husky obeying she cried out softly as she felt him drive deeper into her soft body the world about her exploded into a whirlpool of pleasure upon pleasure it could get no better and yet it didwith each smooth thrust niall oh niall i die she finally sobbed seemingly unable to bear any more he was experienced enough to control their spiraling rise but he could not stop loving her just a little more skye ah god youre so sweet i dont want to stop he muttered thickly no no dont stop please no she whispered back frantically she did not want to leave this marvelous world deeper deeper faster faster they were lost in each other as they climaxed together she gave a long wail half in joy half in sorrow gathering her to him he crooned low ah skye sweet skye you are perfection my little love pure perfection i love you so sweetheart her bluegreen eyes were heavy with exhaustion but they shone with love give me a son niall she whispered fiercely tenderly he stroked her cheek in time my darling in time now sleep skye my love in the morning we will face the world with the shocking news mat we would be together we will need to be well rested to meet the uproar thats sure to follow you meant it when you said you wouldnt leave me her voice trembled aye sweetheart only the devil himself can separate us now skye id go with you into hell itself niall she answered passion ately at last enclosed in each others arms they fell asleep trusting the power of their love chapter in the gray halflight before dawn niall burke and skye lay sleeping heart hammering the little pot boy crawled through the unshuttered window and for a brief moment stared quite openmouthed at the two people lying on the bed both were naked the man was on his stomach face down his arm flung across the woman she was curled on her side the pot boy who was rarely freed from his kitchen thought the two were the most beautiful sight he had ever seen he felt saddened at what he must do the woman stirred in her sleep and guiltily recalling his duty the boy tiptoed across the room softly sliding the bolt back he opened the door dubhdara omalley and three of his menatarms came silently into the room omalley nodded to his retainers niall burke was swiftly pulled off the bed a cloth stuffed into his mouth then he was halfdragged halfcarried out of the room the door shut softly but firmly behind him fiercely niall struggled against his captors who hustled him down into the main hall of the castle he was not afraid for he knew that if it had been his life they sought he would already be dead youll not yell my lord omalley asked him when they en tered a room down the hall niall shook his head his arms were freed and the gag was pulled from his mouth he took up the goblet of ale placed at his hand drinking it he began to dress in his clothes which the little pot boy had thoughtfully brought along niall burke was furious but arguing with the omalley stark naked put him at a disadvantage his an tagonist spoke first you will be on your way immediately my lord young oflaherty has spent an unhappy night drinking and abusing skyes maid the sight of you now could drive him to rashness i should not like to answer to the macwilliam if his heir were harmed niall yanked on his boots i want skyes marriage annulled omalley for three days i tried to get to you to ask you to call off this marriage i love skye and she loves me i want her to wife ill see that oflaherty is pacified with a new bride and a large bribe why do you think i did what i did last night to amuse myself man i love your daughter omalley and i hope my action will force oflaherty to give her up dubhdara omalley looked amazed laddie laddie if i have nothing else in this world i have my good name and my good word the word of dubhdara omalley has never been questioned because it is as good as gold i have never broken my word i will not do so now skye was betrothed to dom as a child even if i had postponed the marriage your father would not permit you to marry an omalley of innisfana for you it will be an oneill an odonnell or an obriendaughters of the high aristocracy not my little lass nialls silver eyes flashed she is fit to be a queen omalley ah laddie youll get no argument from me on that account but my daughter is dom oflahertys wife till death parts them youve exercised the droit du seigneur on the bride there is nothing else here for you go home leave me to mend the broken fences and my childs broken heart i will not leave without skye omalley she comes with me the master of the castle barely nodded to his men niall burke was tapped lightly on his head rendering him unconscious carry him to the boat and tell captain macguire to take him home macguires to put this letter directly into the macwilliams hand and await a reply omalley said tersely omalley sat watching a moment as his most honored guest was slung over the shoulder of one of his men and removed from the hall then without a backward glance omalley returned to his daughters bedchamber he shook her awake gently skye lass wake up now slowly her blue eyes opened then widened in surprise da her gaze quickly swept the room and her voice became a frightened whisper niall gone skye niall burke has gone home no he promised we would never be parted he promised men frequently make promises in the heat of passion that they have no intention of keeping said the omalley brutally get up and get dressed daughter youll go with eibhlin to her convent on innishturk until doms temper cools and were sure you dont carry burkes bastard ill send someone to help you dress youre lying to me da what have you done with niall im not lying skye burke has gone home wheres molly shes sick this morning omalley said as he left the room skye sat numbed he had promised they would not be parted he had meant it she knew he had meant it where was he had they killed him oh god no she began to tremble no of course they hadnt killed him her father would not kill his overlords heir perhaps said an evil voice in her head perhaps he is telling you the truth after all your experience with men is not great perhaps the great lords heir has amused himself with you and has now gone back to his own her heart began to hammer fiercely and for a moment she thought she would faint then from deep inside skye called on the reservoir of strength she had built up over the years if she listened to doubt she would go mad she must trust to her intuition skye omalley would not give in to panic climbing from the bed she walked naked across the chamber and drew her clothing from a leatherbound trunk she began to dress first pulling on her underclothes then a skirtlike object this garment was a design of skyes own fashioning omalley had objected to his daughter wearing mens clothing but skye had felt hampered aboard ship by long skirts so she had made her skirts into wide pants that came below the knee beneath she wore hose and kneelength leather boots she had cut her chemises off at the waist hemmed them and worn them beneath her silk shirts washed and dressed her long black hair braided and affixed atop her head she gathered up a dark plaid cloak and left the room she found a manatarms waiting and directed him to fetch the small trunk in her room and see it safely stowed in the waiting boat regally she descended the stairs below in the castles main hall her father her sister eibhlin and dom awaited her dom looked terrible his eyes were badly bloodshot and puffy and his face was marked with several scratches and bruises she steeled herself for the confrontation good morning dom he eyed her angrily nodded but said nothing she shrugged then turned to her father i am ready to go da but before i do i want to know the truth niall would not have left me unless forced dom oflahertys lightblue eyes widened then narrowed he turned to his fatherinlaw what the hell treachery is this omalley its bad enough that burke demanded the droit du seigneur of my bride before the entire district now it appears she was in collusion with him he whirled on skye you little bitch how long has it been going on how long have you been whoring with burke i ought to beat you black and blue skye eyed her husband coldly her voice was calm and level i met niall but a few days ago dom yes we are in love i do not understand how it happened but it did i do not particularly like you dom but i would not have hurt or embarrassed you deliber ately niall burke wants to marry me give me an annulment you dont love me niall will arrange for you to have a new and noble bride and a fat financial settlement to soothe your wounded pride dom looked as if she had lost her mind have you given me a halfwit to wife omalley he turned on skye listen you little fool the macwilliam isnt about to let his heir marry with the likes of you niall burke is a rake he wanted only to fuck with you which ive no doubt he did quite well if his reputation is warranted its over now youll go with eibhlin to innishturk until im sure burkes seed did not take root when you come home to me skye youll be a proper wifelike me or noand youll go no more awhoring get out of my sight now woman da obey your husband skye he is your master now never dom oflaherty leaped the distance between them and grasping skye by the arm slapped her brutally several times shocked for her father had never hit her she could only try and protect herself from his blows whore i warned you what would happen if you disobeyed me he shook her hard furious and fearful both skye pulled away angrily whoreson she hissed hit me again and ill stick a knife into your black heart enough roared omalley stepping between the two enough dom his voice was sharp eibhlin take your sister to the boat and go skyes eyes were almost black in anger ill not forgive you for this da she said quietly shooting him a look of pure hatred she left the hall with her sister outside the day was chill and gray the wind whipped the womens cloaks about them as they hurried across the drawbridge and through the rose garden for a moment skye stopped her eyes softened and swam with tears plucking a red rose she inhaled its fragrance sighed and continued on her way carefully picking her way down the path that led from the cliff top to the damp beach below a sailboat and two of her fathers men waited on the beach she could see her trunk already in the boat one of the men helped eibhlin into the little craft skye brushed aid aside clambering up into the craft and seating herself in the stern she took a firm grip on the tiller while one sailor pushed the boat from the damp sand the other hoisted the sail the sailor connor grinned nodded and sat back when skye took the tiller theyd be at innishturk island in a jig time for no one could sail a boat like mistress skye the other sailor newer to omalleys service sat silently skye tacked the boat smartly across the castles sheltered cove and nosed it into the open sea the day was turning fair and there was a good breeze the small boat skimmed across the deep blue waves innishturk but a few nautical miles away was easily visible skye carefully set her course to bring the craft in on the piece of coast closest to eibhlins convent eibhlin wanted desperately to talk to her but skye suddenly looked older and very forbidding the young nun was suddenly sad what could she possibly say to cheer her sister what did you say to a woman forcibly married to one man when she deeply loved another once again eibhlin felt the frustration of being a woman in a mans world again she asked herself why it was so then eibhlin saw a terrible bruise beginning to form on skyes left cheekbone silently the nun dipped her handkerchief in the icy cold sea and squeezing it out wordlessly handed it to her sister a brief smile was her thanks as skye took the wet cloth and held it to her injured face innishturk came closer then closer and soon the little boat was scudding up onto the beach eibhlin was lifted out in her element now she commanded bring mistress skyes trunk connor padraic you stay with the boat yes sister aye sister skye swung herself over the side of the boat and dropped lightly to the sand she knew the way quite well for she had often come with her father to see eibhlin silently she trudged up the path from the beach at the cliff top she undid a small wicket gate and held it open for her sister and the panting connor the gate swung shut and they were on the convent grounds ahead of them stood st brides of the cliffs built over one hundred years before the convent was built around a quadrangle the four towers of its corners rising stark against the sky the dark gray stones of the main building were weathered by the wind and the sea there were several outbuildings for the convent livestock a bakehouse and a washhouse at the convent portala double oaken door bounded in brassthey stopped connor will have to wait here said eibhlin ill send someone to bring your trunk ill wait with him said skye quietly if i am to be cloistered for a month id just as soon postpone my captivity eibhlin did not argue she pulled on the bell when it was an swered by the portress she entered hurriedly alone with skye connor observed strange place for a hon eymoon if you ask me i didnt snapped skye but its as good a place as any when youre wed to the wrong man repeat that you old gossip and im sure to be beaten for it the omalley never laid a hand on you in your life lass no he didnt but the little bastard hes married me to did the bruise on my cheek is a mark of his affection connor saw nothing wrong with a man occasionally giving his woman a clout to keep her in line but he was truly shocked mat a bridegroom would beat his bride of one day mistress skye was not just any lass she was special besides he was related to her maid molly whod barely survived her night with oflaherty better to warn the young mistress id best say this straight out lass sos youll be on your guard oflaherty took molly to his bed last night fair killed her too made her do all kinds of things no decent man would ask of a woman then he beat her half to death and kicked her out when youve got to go back to him be careful skyes face betrayed no emotion will molly be all right her bruises will heal tell her if she chooses not to serve me anymore ill understand if that is her decision she may remain at the castle to serve my stepmother tell the lady anne that i will need a stout serving woman of middle years and plain countenance if i am forced to return to him i would not expose another young girl to oflaherty the convent portal creaked open again and eibhlin came forward escorted by two stout nuns skye bid connor farewell then followed her sister through the door her trunk would be brought in by the other nuns the two sisters walked silently through the long hallway until they came to a heavy oak door eibhlin rapped on the door a voice bid them enter and they obeyed seated in a chair was one of the most beautiful women skye had ever seen her oval face was serene beneath the white wimple with its starched and pleated white wings her black habit was relieved of its severity by a stiff white rectangle of a bib upon which rested an ebony crucifix banded in silver a silver lily on its face kneeling eibhlin caught the aristocratic hand and kissed the silverandonyx ring of office rise my daughter came a cool cultivated voice reverend mother may i present my sister skye skye this is the reverend mother ethna thank you sister eibhlin you may return to your duties now mistress monahan from our village went into labor this morning and you have our permission to attend her eibhlin bowed herself out and the reverend mother ethna waved skye to a chair welcome to st brides of the cliffs lady oflaherty your father has already apprised us of the reason for your visit we will endeavor to make you as comfortable as pos sible thank you skye said tonelessly quiet brown eyes surveyed skye and the nun appeared to be debating with herself then she said i was ethna oneill before i took the veil it was my niece to whom lord burke was betrothed she never knew him but i did he has a most winning way about him a small smile played about the corners of her mouth we met but a short time ago said skye softening somewhat i dont know what happened to us but we are in love da simply would not listen niall wants to have my marriage annulled so we may wed the nun shook her head perhaps he can arrange it or at least get the proceedings started while youre here youre the first person whos not told me that the macwilliam wont let his heir marry with an omalley of innisfana the reverend mother laughed ah these men and their pride take heart my daughter the macwilliam is a stern man but he loves his son but tell me child have you no feeling for your young husband i do not love dom nor did i ever wish to wed with him i begged my father not to force me to it even before i met niall burke in fact i did not wish to wed at all until i met niall i do not believe a woman should have to spend her life with someone she dislikes so chuckled the nun youre a revolutionary like your sister lady oflaherty no and please i beg of you reverend mother do not call me lady oflaherty i shall never acknowledge doms name as mine i am skye omalley very well skye omalley we shall try to make your stay with us as pleasant as possible the nun picked up a bell and rang it sharply it was instantly answered by a little novice sister feldelm this is skye omalley sister eibhlins sister she is sheltering with us for several weeks the west tower guest suite has been prepared for her will you please escort her there yes reverend mother said the novice bobbing a curtsey if youll come along with me mistress omalley you are free to go wherever you chose on the grounds skye and the chapel and public rooms of the convent are open to you you need not keep to your rooms thank you skye turned to follow sister feldelm my daughter i shall pass on to you any information i receive skye flashed her a small smile then followed the novice out how sad thought the reverend mother another young woman pushed into an unhappy marriage she wondered what the mac william would do she knew what he would not do he would not let niall have skye for he sought a better match for his heir damn him and the others like him for the fools they were hadnt they yet learned that overbred wenches invariably proved to be bad breeders a good sturdy lass of less elegant lineage made a better wife the reverend mother ethna realized that beneath the gallant defiance skye omalley was a frightened and desperate girl if the child was to be disappointed best she learn it now so she might face her grief with the nuns in the time she was with them they could with the grace of god help her make peace with herself alone in her apartment skye inspected her surroundings there were two rooms a goodsized dayroom and a small bedroom both had fireplaces the bedroom fireplace was set into the corner the room held only a big oak bed with claret velvet hangings there was no room for any other furniture the size of the bed amused and puzzled skye until it dawned on her that the convent probably relied on the generosity of its friends to furnish its rooms giggling to herself she wondered what the nuns thought of the great bed it faced the one small window in the bedroom and looked out over the sea the dayroom was a bright pleasant room with windows on two sides they faced north giving a far view of her home on innisfana island and west across the open sea into the setting sun on the east wall of the room was a large stone fireplace flanked by two great carved winged angels to the north of the fireplace was the stout oak door that served as an entry on the opposite side of the fireplace a small floortoceiling book case had been built into the wall matching a larger one that shared the south wall with the paneled bedroom door before the lead paned western windows was a polished oak refectory table with armchairs at the head and foot to one side of the fireplace was a settle and on the other a comfortable chair there was a large carved chest and in the space between the windows stood a little priedieu with an embroidered cushion skyes trunk had been placed in the bedroom beneath the window the convents benefactors had been more than generous heavy claretred velvet draperies hung from all the windows and a large turkey carpet in reds and blues was spread across the floor matching a smaller one in the bedroom skye later learned that the oneills had furnished the west towers guest quarters when their own ethna became the head of st brides of the cliffs skyes days quickly took on a comfortable pattern she rose early and attended mass in the convents chapel she was not particularly religious but she prayed now that niall would soon come for her afterward she obtained her own breakfast from the kitchen and went off by herself to walk across the convent grounds a small sailboat belonging to the order was placed at her disposal and skye spent many hours sailing and fishing to pass the time the convent soon enjoyed a number of fresh seafood dinners courtesy of their young guest the main meal of the day was served at two in the afternoon and skye ate it alone in her dayroom the evening meal was served after vespers and sometimes eibhlin joined her young sister oth erwise skye was again alone the convent had a surprisingly fine library and the bookshelves in skyes dayroom were also well filled on very wet days she read skye omalley was a welleducated woman for her day she could speak her native gaelic as well as english french and latin she could write and though she might not sew as fine a seam as her sisters did her needlework was passable and she could knit she knew how to run a household understanding provisioning salting conserving preserving soapmaking and perfumemaking she knew the rudiments of brewing and household medicine she had been taught to keep accounts for omalley firmly believed that the only way to avoid being cheated by ones own steward was to do ones own household accounts and as if that were not enough skye was one of the finest navigators her father had ever sailed with the omalley often joked that he thought his daughter could smell out her ships destination though she saw the nuns as she moved through the uneventful pattern of her days skye actually spent most of her time alone the order of st brides was not a cloistered one nor was it a begging order the nuns were workers devoted first to their god and second to the poor some of the nuns were teachers and others gave medical aid to the surrounding area the rest farmed for the convent cooked knitted sewed and did the farm and household chores skye adapted instantly and entered into the spirit of the convent doing her share of fishing snaring rabbits and one day even bringing down a young buck the venison was a rare treat for the nuns skye needed that constant physical activity had she not worked so hard she might never have slept why had niall not communicated with her surely he understood the anguish she was feeling he could not she was sure have made love to her with such exquisite delicacy while intending to leave her forever it might have eased her mind to know that niall burke suffered no less than she did he had clawed his way up through the swirling darkness to discover himself trussed like a damned christmas goose on a cockle of a boat that was bouncing all over the ocean the bearded captain of the little boat gave him a wicked but sympathetic grin so youre awake me lord where the hell am i snarled niall unloose me at once the captain looked unhappy ah now your worship i cant do that if i were to unloose you and you became violent which i can see youre sure to do id be in terrible trouble take lord burke home to the macwilliam was what the omalley told me to do and thats just what ill do at least sit me up man and give me a dram im cramped my head feels like the little people are mining gold inside it and im not sure i wont be seasick captain macguire chuckled all right lad you dont ask a great deal of a man and im no fool to make you any more uncom fortable than you already are bending he hauled niall into a sitting position his back against the mast and held a flask to his lips niall gratefully swallowed several gulps of the smoky peat scented whiskey it hit the pit of his stomach like a burning rock but almost immediately it began to spread its warmth through his cramped wet body so the omalley sent me home he said thoughtfully aye me lord and youve slept as peaceful as a babe most of the way were just about there niall craned his neck and looked to the coast but he was not a sailor and the distant landscape looked all the same to him how long he demanded a bit came the infuriatingly vague answer see that little point over there once were around it youre home thats where well land and then ill walk you from there ive a message to deliver to the macwilliam walk niall exploded well take the first available horses we can find the macwilliams stronghold is a good stretch of the legs from the sea man do you ride about as good as you sail laddie then god help you macguire youll soon be as uncomfortable as i am now when they finally reached shore the captain untied his passenger and helped him from the boat niall burke rubbed his wrists where the ropes had chafed him he was anxious to be home so he might speak with his father he clambered up the hillside from the beach without even looking to see if macguire was with him niall strode quickly away following a faint path after about a halfhour they came in view of a thatched roofed farmhouse next to the farmhouse bloomed a kitchen garden of herbs carrots and other root vegetables cress and a few bright flowers the nearby fields well kept were already colored with barley and rye and in a pasture just beyond the garden a dozen sleek horses grazed peacefully there was no sign of life though macguire could have sworn he had seen smoke coming from the chimney ho the house tis niall burke and a friend after a long moment the farmhouse door swung open and a big man stepped out he called back out into the house its all right maeve its his lordship the man came forward a grin on his face and clasped nialls hand in his own large bearlike paw wel come my lord how may we serve you i need two horses brian this evillooking fellow is captain macguire one of the omalleys men hell return the horses to you later at once my lord if youre not in too great a hurry the wife is just taking bread from the oven niall burkes silvery eyes crinkled in appreciation ah he breathed maeves bread with her own honey come on macguire ive a treat for you despite the fact that youve treated me badly the captain in his wake he burst through the door and swept up a sparrow of a woman into his embrace he held her high above him lowering her to smack kisses on both of her flushed cheeks while she laughed and scolded him to put her down ive come for your virtueand your fine bread maeve love he teased returning her to her feet she gave him a friendly whack and said none of your naught iness now master niall tis long past time you grew up come along with you and your friend too sit down the breads just from the oven they obeyed her and sat niall turning to macguire explained maeve was my nurse until i was seven then she deserted me to wed with brian as a boy i used to come here often for she bakes the best bread in the district and for some reason her bees make the best honey youve ever tasted its the salt air said maeve it gives the honey a wee bit of a nip macguire shortly found that lord burke was no liar and he said to maeve if you had a daughter who could bake half as well as you do mistress id wed with her in a thrice maeve flushed with pleasure if you return this way captain stop for a meal with us thank you mistress and i will the horses are ready my lord called brian from the doorway niall burke stood up licking a drop of honey from his finger like a small boy lets go macguire im anxious to be home the captain was surprised to see two fine wellbred mounts waiting they mounted and with a wave to brian rode off your peasants must be prosperous to have any horses at all let alone such fine ones observed macguire as they cantered along these are our horses answered burke we keep good horses with several specially chosen families for just such purposes as these that way were never stranded he then spurred his horse to a gallop come on man he called to the captain who was bouncing up and down on his mount looking decidedly uncomfortable im for home niall burke was to regret his haste no sooner had he entered into the macwilliams presence than the omalleys letter was handed over to the great lord macguire was sent off to be served refreshment and niall stood impatiently while the macwilliam his strong features darkening skimmed over the parchment finally the macwilliam snorted and looking angrily at his son roared well you arrogant puppy i hope you have a helluva good explanation for your conduct dubhdara omalleys ships are vital to the defense of this area as is the goodwill of the ballyhennessey oflahertys niall of course had not read the letter caught off guard he blurted like a schoolboy i love her father i love skye omalley i tried to speak with omalley and get him to call off the wedding but his wife went into labor before i could talk to him she had a hard birth he was unavailable all that time and they wed the girl ahead of schedule practically in secret omalley wouldnt have called off the match you young fool it was made years ago he was bound to it and a damn good match it was for his youngest lass how dared you interfere i love her and she loves me she detests the oflaherty bastard theyve wed her to she always hated him even before we met and you felt that gave you the right to claim the droit du seigneur of the bride jesus man if you were anyone else id kill you youre lucky omalley has a sense of humor the girls been sent to her sisters convent to be sure your night results in nothing worse man embarrassment i love her shouted niall i want her marriage annulled so i may wed her there must be a bishop in this family over my dead body roared the macwilliam omalleys ships are valuable to me his wench is not ill have no pirate wench mothering my grandchildren ive arranged for you to wed with darragh oneill the younger sister to your late betrothed she is thirteen and ripe for marriage youll be joined in three weeks time no yes listen you young idiot take omalleys girl as a mistress if you wish but you cannot wed her she already has a husband and from what i hear of him once he takes her to bed youll become just a pretty memory to her go to hell niall burke stormed out of his fathers study and got gloriously drunk the following day his head feeling twice its normal size he was summoned back to his father this said the macwilliam was brought for you this morning i have taken the liberty of reading it and can only say that omalleys daughter is wiser than you are she obviously has more sense than you do here niall snatched the parchment and read it with shock my lord burke i have retired with my sister to her convent of st brides on innishturk island where i shall pray to our lady that the shameful night we spent together bears no unhallowed fruit what we did was wrong and i can only hope and pray that my husband will forgive me i beg that you forget me and for the good of your soul enter into christian marriage with a good woman at the earliest possible moment may god go with you always skye lady oflaherty he wanted desperately to deny what he read and after all he had never seen her writing was it a forgery the hand however was sweetly rounded and feminine and he recognized the imprint on the wax seal as the one she wore on a ring perhaps they had forced her to write this message but he knew how stubborn skye was they could have burned her feet with hot irons and shed not have written it had she not wished to do so damn her damn her was that all he meant to her a shameful night damn her for the fickle bitch she was anguished beyond anything he had ever known niall blinked back his tears and said hoarsely ill marry darragh oneill then he dropped the letter and strode from the room without a backward glance the macwilliam waited a moment to be sure his son had gone then said you can come out now captain macguire go back and tell the omalley that his strategy worked my son will be wed in three weeks time and will give him no further trouble macguire bowed nodded wordlessly and departed alone the macwilliam felt a twinge of conscience he loved his son deeply and hated denying him anything still when given the choice between an oneill and an omalley for his daughterinlaw there was only one choice the macwilliam could make yes niall would settle down quite nicely with darragh oneill by this time next year he would have a grandson chapter an especially nice tiling came of skyes stay at st brides walking on the beach one day she came across an injured young wolfhound not quite full grown the poor creature was half starved its ribs plainly visible its fur was so filthy and matted with salt that it was difficult to tell the dogs true color its leg had been caught in a rock crevice hearing the weak bark skye ran to the dog who looked up at her hopefully and thumped his long tail in a friendly fashion ah poor beastie murmured skye sympathetically and set about freeing the dog carefully she removed the small rocks about the animals leg and then as gently as she could she drew the leg from its prison the dog winced but did not growl skye patted him there love come along now and lets find some food for you the dog fought his way to his feet and limped stumbling a little after her the nuns were as sympathetic as skye had been and allowed the dog into the convent his origin and owner remained a mystery the island peasants would not dare claim the royal canine peasants kept only working dogs such as terriers mastiffs and mongrels the irish wolfhound that great killer of wolves and other predators belonged to the ruling class as did irish setters skye named the dog inis after the favorite hound of partholan an early settler in ireland inis attached himself to her with a singular devotion he walked out with her in the mornings sailed with her in the convents little boat and slept with her at night spreading his great lanky frame across the foot of her bed within a few weeks he had regained his normal adult weight one hundred sixty pounds and stood thirtyeight inches high bathed his fur became a shining silvery gray that reminded skye of nialls eyes iniss ears and the feathers on his legs were black the hound was skyes slave his soulful eyes lighting up with pleasure each time he looked at her skye needed the dogs love for niall burke appeared to have forgotten her entirely and then there came the day when her show of blood arrived right on schedule she wept into iniss soft neck her heartbreak complete the reverend mother ethna sent a message to the young oflaherty informing him that his wife was not pregnant and a week later dom arrived to claim his wife the reverend mother personally showed him into skyes apartment i would have come sooner he said smiling smugly but i was obliged to attend niall burkes wedding to darragh oneill skye fainted when she came to she was lying on the settle she heard dom speaking solicitously to the nun i did not realize the news of lord burkes marriage would so unsettle my lady did you not my lord said ethna oneill coolly oflaherty smiled and ignoring the nuns sarcasm continued i realize it is unusual for a gentleman to spend the night in your convent but i really do not think my wife should be moved until the shock wears off the reverend mother ethna had decided she did not like dom oflaherty but she did agree with him that skye should not be moved right now she was forced to assure him that though it was unusual it was not forbidden him to spend the night under st brides roof he was welcome dom thanked her politely then asked if she would take his wifes hound see that it was fed and have it put in the stables with his men and horses inis who had taken an instant dislike to dom was removed under protest they were alone dom oflaherty walked to the settle and said coldly i know youve recovered your swoon skye now get up and greet your lord and master properly slowly she rose and placed a quick kiss on his mouth he chuck led and with lightning swiftness pulled her close she tensed and he laughed ah yes you dont like me do you wife how unfor tunate for you for youll soon be spreading yourself wide for my pleasure and my pleasure alone and when im deep inside you ill wipe all thought of niall burke from your mind his mouth ground down on hers and she beat her clenched fists against his chest then suddenly she was rescued by a knock on the door dom smothered a curse and called out sharply come in two nuns each laden down with a tray of steaming food hurried in their eyes lowered placing their trays on the great refectory table they hurried out as quickly skye pulled from her husbands grasp how thoughtful she exclaimed brightly we have been sent supper ive no appetite for food yet he said in a surly tone she raised the cover of a dish look boiled shrimp and heres a lovely capon and a small joint of mutton if we dont eat it now it will get cold let it he came swiftly up behind her and loosened her laces sliding his hands around to cup her breasts this is what im hungry for skye be said squeezing her flesh the food will wait your laces are loosened go into the bedroom finish undressing and wait for me in the bed she closed her eyes to squeeze back tears oh dom she pleaded not here ill do whatever you want me to but not here in this holy house not here i hadnt considered it that way he said thoughtfully but the idea of fucking you in a convent appeals to me shall we pretend youre a young nun about to be ravaged by a viking chief she blanched at his sacrilege and he snarled quickly skye im hot for youhaving been denied my marital rights for over a month he punctuated his words with a light slap to her cheek she wanted to fight him but she had been so badly broken by the news of nialls marriage that she couldnt find the spirit she fled into the bedroom and with shaking fingers pulled her clothes off and climbed into the big bed a moment later dom entered the room drinking from a goblet of wine placing the goblet on the nightstand he undressed swiftly letting his clothes fall where they dropped when he turned to enter the bed she bit back a cry of terror niall had been a big man but skyes husband was unnaturally large enormous seeing her fear he chuckled the wenches in paris call me le taureau do you know what that means terrified she nodded the bull her voice was a whisper aye the bull he said proudly and i am wife now spread yourself wide ive got something for you he tore back the covers she clutched to her breasts the sight of her naked body inflamed his lust and he flung himself on her skye managed to gasp but dom i am not ready he raised himself above her and gazed down at her youre not ready his look was incredulous had he not been so astounded he might have hit her you do not have to be ready skye i am and she felt herself being ripped asunder by his monster sex before she could cry out his hand clapped over her mouth he pushed himself into her muttering all the while youre tight as a drum woman burkes cock must be no bigger than a worm to have left you so tight he grunted his pleasure while beneath him her eyes reflected pain and fright she tried to lie still hoping to ease the pain but she couldnt she writhed in an effort to escape him and mistaking her actions for growing passion he laughed i knew it beneath all the ladylike manners youve the makings of a good whore im a lucky man and he drove deeper and harder into her dont fear lovey he panted ill teach you many a good trick to please us both then with a growl of pleasure he collapsed for a moment they lay sandwiched together then oflaherty got up and returning to the dayroom poured himself more wine skye felt tears gushing down her cheeks but she made no sound for fear of angering him she heard him lifting the covers of the dishes sampling the food he didnt think to offer her any coming back into the small bedroom clutching a chicken leg dom sat on the side of the bed he patted her backside skye feigned sleep hoping he would leave her in peace she heard the sound of his slow methodical munching and then the leg bone hit the floor spread yourself resistance was useless she was his wife his chattel she obeyed and was once again subjected to pain and degradation when he was through this time he rolled off her and fell asleep on his back snoring contentedly skye waited until she was sure he slept soundly then crept from the bed she could barely walk but she would have crawled on her hands and knees to get out of that room gaining the dayroom she shakily poured herself some wine spill ing half on the table adding some more wood to the fire she collapsed into the large chair niall his gentle hands his loving mouth he had sought to please her while teaching her to please him damn him damn him she had been betrayed they had all been right the great lords heir had only been amusing himself with her and his lust for her in nocence was no less foul than doms lust to subdue her a hand dropped on her shoulder and she started looking up with dread i woke and you were gone he said plaintively youre weep ing still sad im not niall eh she wiped at the tears guiltily quickly shaking her head and his tone softened a bit i probably hurt you he said matteroffactly well dont worry skye itll get easier with use and youll soon stretch to take my bulk come on lovey lets fuck a bit more for if you cant sleep then ive not used you enough besides he chuckled lasciviously youre a far sweeter piece than i thought you would be all the rest of the night while she endured her husbands em braces she hated niall burke with a growing fury and considered how she would revenge herself on him one day oh yes he would pay for her broken dreams and a similar scene was being enacted miles away at the stronghold of the macwilliam darragh oneill burke had been destined for the church since her birth her eldest sister had been betrothed and eventually wed to an oconnell her middle sister had been betrothed to niall burke but ceit had died suddenly last winter and darragh who had been in her beloved st marys convent since the age of five was brought home to take her middle sisters place in the marriage bed it was a particularly tragic choice for darragh oneill had a true religious vocation when it was decided that she would replace her sister darragh was two days from taking her final vows her father and his troupe of men had arrived with much noise and shouting just in time to prevent darraghs blond hair from being shorn oneill had waived the return of darraghs dowry from the religious order knowing that mis would make darraghs mother superior more easily amenable to his change of plan he lost nothing by it as the money had been paid in full eight years prior just as ceits dowry had been paid to the macwilliams at the time of her betrothal the mother superior explained the change to the horrified young nun saying smoothly that god and our lady had quite obviously made other plans for darragh darragh must accept gods will with good grace she would leave the convent immediately and wed lord burke weeping bitterly the girl obeyed thus niall burke was greeted on his wedding day by a pale girl whose redrimmed eyes gave evidence of much weeping as he had not been fully informed of her religious commitment he was annoyed that she should face the marriage with so little enthusiasm later that evening when the bride and groom went to bed dar ragh fainted at the sight of her naked husband niall gently elicited an explanation from darragh touched he gently stroked the pale blond hair i think that under the circumstances theres no need for us to hurry the physical side of our marriage he said quietly let us take time to know one another better the truth of the matter was that niall had no taste for raping unwilling virgins and he cursed both their fathers for their blind stupidity the girl had a deep religious commitment and he ques tioned whether she would ever get over that he laughed bitterly they had torn him from the woman he loved who would gladly have given him sons because his father didnt think her highborn enough and in her place they had given him a dedicated nun it was too funny and he would have laughed again had he not become aware that his new wife still seemed troubled what will people say if the sheets have no bloody stain tomor row he chuckled ah darragh burke tis truly innocent you are many a lass has played at carnal games before marriage yet flown the bloody sheet the morning after her wedding move over lass and ill show you wideeyed she watched with amazement as he took the fruit knife from the bowl by the bed and pricked the inside of his thigh a small trickle of blood flowed forth staining the sheets darraghs virtue was thus proved while her husbands honor was saved and his prowess attested to it had been now two weeks since their wedding night darragh reasoned that her virginity had been saved forever and as she had long ago dedicated that precious gift to god she had no intention of giving it to niall she would keep his house but that was all nialls kindness on their wedding night seemed a weakness she could continue to exploit once again as he had every night since their wedding niall gently tried to make love to his wife darraghs inexperience pre vented her knowing how patient her husband really was she was determined that he would not succeed but he was equally determined he would if he must be married to this girl then she would mother his children now darragh informed him that she would be his bride in name only her virginity belonged to god you cannot force me as you did poor skye omalley my lord i can but imagine the poor womans shame she finished right eously at the mention of skyes name nialls head whirled and he stared with revulsion at the cold pious feelingless creature they had wedded him to a tiny fairskinned flatchested girl with watery blue eyes whiteblond hair and a prim mouth was his wife the comparison between her and skye with her gardenia skin flowing blueblack hair and bluegreen eyes was ludicrous skye with her sweetly rounded small breasts rosebud mouth and innocently eager passion skye dom oflahertys willing wife who had given niall a night of bliss only to destroy his happiness almost imme diately with a cold letter he groaned skye would soon give dom sons and so he decided with growing anger would darragh oneill burke give her husband sons seeing the grim purpose in his silvery eyes darragh fell to her knees clutching her rosary beads her lips moving silently in prayer niall angrily snatched away the beads and pulling darragh to her feet ripped the white linen nightgown from her catching her in his arms he kissed her deeply forcing the narrow lips open she fought him clawing at him with surprisingly sharp nails squirming wildly darragh truly believed that god would strike her husband with a bolt of lightning for his impudence and she prayed it would kill him as they fell back onto the bed and she felt his great manhood penetrate her maidenhead darragh called on every saint in the cal endar to avenge her but soon she was moaning at him to continue her skinny legs wrapping around him her lean hips finding the rhythm and moving with it afterward he felt disgusted with himself and with her as well he had never in his life forced a woman but she had driven him to it with her denial of him and the mention of his beloved treach erous skye women they were all alike they said one thing meant another beside him his wife sniveled and complained you hurt me you hurt me it always hurts the first time darragh itll get better now youre never going to do that to me again never therell be no immaculate conceptions in this family wife and besides you enjoyed it i know when a woman likes it my dear and like it or not its your duty to give me sons you might even admit to liking it eventually theres nothing wrong with a woman taking pleasure with her husband never she spat at him as he pulled her back into his arms his big hand stroked her tense body soothingly ill endure it for it is obviously gods will but ill hate it every time you stick that awful thing inside me have it your own way my dear he said just remember that i was no more anxious for this marriage than you were i would just as soon you stayed in your convent and he thrust into her again making her cry out give me a couple of sons darragh and ill leave you in peace forever and down the coast across the water on innishturk island dom oflaherty bent over his beautiful wife pumping smoothly skye was too sensuous a woman to deny her body its release she let herself begin to fall away into a lovely world of sweet sensations and then she heard her husband moan he collapsed atop her she had not reached her own heaven but he didnt care niall had cared she turned her head away from dom a tear sliding unchecked down her cheek damn niall would he never stop haunting her chapters the macwilliam had commanded that his vassals keep the twelve days of christmas with him they came from all over midconnaught including dom oflaherty and his bride of several months the hospitality was lavish for unlike his less powerful neighbors the macwilliams tower house had sprouted three additional inter connected towers over the years consequently he now owned a fine stone castle built along norman lines around a gardened and cobbled quadrangle his guests were housed quite comfortably although skyes fathers tower house was most comfortable and very well furnished the macwilliams large castle was lavish by comparison there were four oflahertys partaking of their overlords gen erosity doms father gilladubh and his younger sister claire had come with dom and skye skye frankly hoped that they could find a husband for claire oflaherty though neither claires father nor her brother seemed to realize that at fourteen claire was practically an old maid the girl was pretty enough with thick flaxen braids doms paleblue eyes and a pinkcheeked complexion but there was some thing sly about her something skye did not like on the one or two occasions skye had attempted to correct the girl for minor faults claire had complained to both her father and her brother and skye had been told to leave her be behind the doting mens backs claire had smiled smugly at her sisterinlaw but skye had had some measure of revenge when she caught claire helping herself to skyes jewelry boxing the girls ears soundlywhich gave skye great pleasureshe warned her that if she stole again she would have claires head shaved and if you complain to either dom or your father dear sister skyes voice dripped sweetness youll be bald for a year claire oflaherty needed no further warning the fierce look in skyes eye convinced her that her brothers wife was not the soft fool she had originally thought she was from that moment on the two women maintained a wary truce now skye was determined to marry the girl off as quickly as possible to get her out of her house skye had known that niall would be at the christmas gathering she soon learned that he was to be their host as his father was suffering with gout if niall expected to find her heartbroken she would soon disabuse him of that notion in the six months since dom had taken her from st brides she had made a kind of peace with herself she did not love her husband nor did she ever believe she would but she played the obedient wife her motherinlaw was long dead and the running of the oflaherty household was left entirely in her hands claire seemed not to care or even have the necessary knowledge skye did her job well which pleased her fatherinlaw gilladubh oflaherty was an older version of dom a pompous lecher with a penchant for fine wines and good whiskey skye soon learned to avoid his quick hands once going so far as to brandish a candlestick at him and threaten to expose his outrageous behavior sitting on the macwilliams fine guest bed in her petticoats and beribboned busk she brushed her hair with angry vicious strokes tonight skye omalley would be as beautiful as she could make herself and she would hold her head up before the arrogant burkes and oneills it was her good fortune to own a more magnificent wardrobe than most women did for her father had always delighted in showing off her beauty mag her tiring woman brought her gown and laid it carefully across the foot of the bed she held a small round mirror for her mistress and skye skillfully outlined her eyes with kohl and put just the tiniest bit of red to her cheeks giving her fair skin a faint healthy blush her shining dark hair was smoothly parted in the center carefully tucked into dainty gold wire cauls then pinned on either side of her head lastly skye applied to the deep valley between her breasts to her wrists to the base of her throat and to the back and sides of her neck a rare perfume made especially for her of musk and attar of roses let him smell the scent of roses on her let him remember and know she cared not skye stood up and mag hurried to help her mistress into her gown the tiring woman quickly laced the dress and then stood back to survey her lady a toothless smile split her weathered face aye youll break his fickle heart my lady one look at you in this gown and hell wish hed stood up to that old devil his father is lady burke so displeasing to the eye then mag asked skye with feigned disinterest mag cackled with laughter and hugged herself nay lady shes pretty enough its just that youre so wickedly fair skye smiled a little cats smile get my jewel case you old crone she ordered affectionately and when the woman hurried to obey snatched up the mirror holding it away from herself she studied her reflection the gown of deepblue velvet was beautiful and its low square neckline revealed her snowwhite breasts the bodice flowed into a full skirt parting in the center to reveal a persian blue underskirt of heavy satin embroidered in gold and silver thread her shoes matched her gown but her stockings were pure silk and matched the underskirt right down to the embroidery skye twirled slightly and was pleased to see that the stockings would show to great advantage during the dancing mag held open the jewel case and skye lifted out a sapphire necklace the large square stones interspersed with round gold me dallions twelve in all each representing a sign of the zodiac at the bottom of the necklace a large pink pearl teardrop hung pro vocatively between her breasts there were sapphires in her ears and she wore three rings a sapphire an emerald and a large baroque pearl dom strode into the room and asked jealously are you dressing to please niall burke skye rather to please you my lord she said smoothly but if my gown displeases you i will change to whatever gives you pleasure he eyed her carefully he knew there wouldnt be a woman at tonights banquet to compare with her she would be the fairest creature in the hall and she belonged to him he would be the envy of every man there roughly he pulled her into his arms and buried his face in the warm scented cleft between her breasts dont her voice was sharp familiarity had removed her fear of him and now only a veiled contempt remained dont dom youll put me in disarray he stepped away from her how handsome you look she quickly noted your skyblue velvet goes quite well with my deep blue day and midnight he said offering her his arm she laughed careful my lord you verge on the poetical your fine paris education may have not gone for nought after all the banquet hall of the macwilliams castle was a great room with heavy beamed ceilings and four fireplaces they blazed now with giantsized logs tall narrow windows gave views of the snow covered countryside the plainness of the hills and fields broken at intervals by large stands of black bare trees to the west the hills were stained orangered with the sunset the room was crowded with elegantly dressed guests servants scurried to and fro with trays of wine amid a low steady hum of voices as they entered the hall the majordomo announced them and skye felt the eyes of the entire room on them the story of her wedding night was yet spoken of throughout the district and now the nobility of midconnaught watched to see the first meeting of the oflahertys and the burkes since that fateful day of last may the gossips had to admit that skye and dom were an outrageously handsome couple skye and dom moved with a stately slow pace as they proceeded down the length of the hall to greet their host and hostess niall and darragh skye kept her head high her face expressionless her glance at a point just above the top of nialls head for a brief instant she gave in to her curiosity and glanced at his face his silvergray eyes were ice and sent a wave of bitter coldness sweeping over her to penetrate the very core of her heart she was puzzled she had expected a smug smile certainly not this disdain she was discomfited by his attitude but a quick glimpse of the tiny woman at his side restored her confidence she felt joy surge through her with the knowledge that darragh burke was for all her noble breeding no beauty they had reached the dais now and skye looked past niall and his wife to where the macwilliam sat his painful leg cushioned upon a stool she flashed nialls father a brilliant smile her even little teeth almost blinding in their whiteness the old man let his glance sweep over her and it gave her great pleasure to see the regret in his eyes now they both knew that he had made a mistake she swept him a graceful curtsey my lord it amused him to realize how quickly she had read his thoughts he enjoyed a worthy adversary and she would make one if he had been twenty years younger he would have made an attempt to bed her himself my friend gilly oflaherty tells me youre a good wife to his boy growled the macwilliam i am she answered him coolly i thought you were happiest being a pirate wench i am that too when i can my lord and are you good at that too lady oflaherty im good at whatever i set my mind to my lord he chuckled welcome to you and to your husband and then his eyes crinkled wickedly undoubtedly you both remember my son niall she felt dom stiffen beside her and she squeezed his hand re assuringly they would not even acknowledge the insult doms good manners asserted themselves with the knowledge his wife stood by him the two men bowed curtly to each other then nialls eyes raked her cruelly i see youre already with child lady oflaherty he said loudly aye my lord wed seven months and six months gone with child the women of my family are known to be prolific breeders she spoke as loudly as he had then she turned and insolently eyed darragh burke i see your own bride of half a year is not yet as fortunate as i are you my dear darragh flushed her nay was audible to all skye smiled sweetly curtseyed again and taking her husbands arm turned away behind her she heard the macwilliam chuckle skye allowed dom to seat her by the fire she stared into the leaping flames as he went in search of some mulled wine she was almost shaking with suppressed fury how could niall behave in such a fashion he had shamed her before the entire county on her wedding night left her after making extravagant promises he never intended keeping and now he pretended that he had been the injured party the bastard a goblet was shoved into her hand and she gulped a mouthful of wine to calm herself you were magnificent she heard her husband say by god you showed niall burke and in front of all connaught too not that i think it would be easy to get that skinny overbred oneill wench pregnant i dont even envy him the task he laughed shut up you overblown fool she hissed at him through gritted teeth god why were all men such idiots i dont give a tinkers damn for niall burke but id not insult the macwilliams hospi tality so try not to be too obvious in your glee husband dom looked at her strangely but before he could say another word anne omalley came to greet them she sent dom off to join his friends then settled herself comfortably and looked at her stepdaughter was it wise to insult niall burke and his wife she asked was it wise for him to insult me skye snapped you still love him i hate him for pitys sake anne speak of something else the babe has a tendency to make me weepy and id rather not be misunderstood of course said anne omalley sagely it would hardly do for niall burke to think you weep for him i never realized before what a bitch you can be stepmother said skye evenly anne laughed oh the babe does make you testy doesnt it he said skye dom and his father are convinced its a lad and they will accept nothing less oh i see and how goes it with you otherwise quite well actually anne da did me a great service in wedding me to dom not only have i gained a lecher for a husband i also have one for a fatherinlaw my husbands sister is a common bitch not averse to stealing my possessions when she can and whining to her father and brother when shes caught its a charming new family i have i am most grateful to da my new home is in a shocking state of disrepair and despite the fine dowry da gave me i am told that no money can be found to put it to rights half the household items i brought to oflaherty house the silver bowls and candlesticks in particular are myste riously missing in short i am the mistress of a dung heap peopled by a vain and randy old cock a vain and randy young cock and a flighty hen anne was shocked do you want to come home until the child is bom skye sweet mary she couldnt let skye have her baby in that place god yes i do want to come home but theyll not let me for the next oflaherty must be born in his own home anne i would appreciate it however if you could arrange for eibhlin to come to me immediately after candlemass though the child isnt due until early spring a latewinter storm at the wrong time could delay her and i would be frightened if she were unable to reach me in time besides skye smiled wryly i need the company claire is none and neither she nor mag nor our old cook knows about birthing a child anne was now very upset what of the other women in your household the maids the laundresses is there no midwife in your village the few women we can get to work for us come from our nearby village each day and return to their homes at night they love their children and no family would allow their daughters in my house because of dom and his father they will work oflaherty lands and pay oflaherty taxes and fight for the oflahertys but too many of their girls have been abused by the oflaherty men for them to allow their daughters in our house even so dom and gilly have had their share of the poor creatures they go out on horseback and hunt them down while the girls are working in the fields the oflahertys reputation is so bad that even claire has no tiring woman of her own i knew it was all wrong from the beginning said anne i knew it then why didnt you speak to da as you promised me anne you encouraged him to wed me off the very morning of conns birth no no skye thats not so at all i tried to tell your father right after conn was bom but theyd given me herbs in wine to make me sleep and your father misunderstood me when i finally awoke two days later you were wed and had already been sent to st brides then you did not betray me to get me out of the house you foolish goose whatever made you think such a thing once you were firmly wed there was nothing i could do i only wish your father had waited even though he was firmly set on the match perhaps i could have prevented the afterward no said skye softly at least with niall burke i learned that love can be sweetnot true but sweet had it not been for him i might have gone my whole life believing all men were animals some men are more vigorous in bed than others skye dom is a pig was the flat reply why do you hate niall if youre grateful to him skyes eyes blazed blue fire and her voice was rock hard be cause be betrayed me because he swore he loved me because he promised to have my marriage annulled to wed with me instead he crept from my side before the dawn without even so much as a goodbye kiss and rode merrily home to wed his high oneill i will never forgive him for that anne never in the silence that followed anne omalley struggled terribly with her conscience she knew the full truth finally she decided that silence was the best policy to tell skye the truth now would do nothing more than hurt and anger her further nothing could be changed now skye was wed and pregnant with her husbands child niall burke was wed if either of them learned now of the deception that had been practiced on them it would only cause greater unhappiness who knew what those two strongwilled passionate people would do if they ever learned the truth anne was saved from further talk by the announcement that dinner was served once in the banquet hall they separated for in deference to the omalleys value to the macwilliam omalley and his wife were seated higher up on the board than skye and dom who were seated much below the salt dom however cared not one whit for thanks to his wifes beauty and wit he was very much the center of a gay group of young people some of whom were wellendowed wenches with bold eyes he anticipated a pleasant twelve days of christmas and skye sparkled determined to show niall how indifferent she was it seemed to those who sat in the more favored places at the table that those below the salt were having a far better time than those above it there was simply no denying that young lady oflaherty was a delightful and charming beauty skye ate carefully taking of the first course only a thin slice of fresh salmon and of the second only the wing of a lemoned capon she ate two small pieces of newly baked brown bread liberally spreading the butter across it with her thumb around her the other guests gorged themselves on dish after dish but skye was revolted by the overrich menu when the sweet was served she enjoyed a small tart of dried peaches licking the clotted cream from about her mouth like a child watching her from the high board niall longed to kiss that mouth as much as he longed to strangle her for her perfidy as the meal drew to a close more of those seated above the salt began drifting farther down the table to cluster about skye occa sionally great bursts of laughter issued forth from the group when the dancing began skye refused all but the least strenuous dances but even so she never lacked for partners she moved proudly and with much grace her gown showing to great advantage her blue eyes sparkled and her smile flashed again and again at the high board niall burke sprawled in his chair glowering his big hand clutching his jewelstudded goblet so hard it was a wonder the stem was not bent his silvergray eyes pantherlike half closed followed her wherever she went occasionally he took great gulps of the dark red wine emptying and refilling his cup several times she was beautiful damn her and even in her present state outrageously desirable young lady oflaherty is most popular ventured darragh aye he growled suddenly standing up and striding away from his wife to join the dancers the young man partnering skye suddenly felt a hard hand on his shoulder looking up to see his scowling blackbrowed host the young man quickly stepped aside niall clamped an arm about her waist and took one of her hands in his her smile faltered but she never missed a step should you be dancing i am expecting a child my lord i am not mortally ill with a wasting sickness youve changed skye nay my lord i have simply learned not to put my faith in pillow talk they separated and she wove in and out of the figure meeting him again on the other side i find it hard he said to understand the workings of a fickle womans mind you behave as though i rejected you instead of the other way around you betrayed me you left me without even a goodbye and hurried home to wed and bed your dead fiancee i had no chance to reject you but i do now i was not betrothed to darragh oneill until after your marriage skye it was her dead sister ceit who was to be my wife again they were separated by the figure when they met again he said i would never have wed darragh had it not been for your letter skye stopped dead what letter she demanded of him one look at her face told niall burke that something was very wrong but they were in a roomful of people some of whom were eying them with speculative curiosity but of course youre ex hausted in your condition lady oflaherty allow me to escort you to a seat and get you some chilled wine he said loudly leading her from the floor he found her a seat within a windowed alcove though they were plainly visible to the entire room they had the privacy to talk without being overheard niall snatched two goblets of wine from a passing valet and handed her one understanding the need for deception she leaned back with half closed eyes feigning exhaustion her heart was hammering not from weariness but from the sudden realization that they had probably been tricked what letter she asked again i did not leave you willingly skye your father sent a little lad up the vine outside your window and the boy opened your bedchamber door to the omalley and his men i was gagged and taken from the room i explained our plight to your father but he would not listen rather he had me knocked unconscious and taken home by one captain macguire the next day i was given a letter in which you repudiated our relationship for gods sake skye the handwriting was feminine and i recognized the seal as the one on your own ring we all have these rings niall all my sisters even eibhlin i did not know he sighed deeply it would seem my love that those two old spiders our fathers have gotten their way by foul means damn them both do you love her niall no she was to be a nun and in her heart she still is she spends more time on her knees than in our bed im glad she said fiercely and he understood the child is doms there is no doubt niall i swear it do you think i would be here if it were not have you learned to love him then i will never love him but i am his wife as you are darraghs husband she said quietly and now my lord bid me good night for we are fast becoming the center of curiosity in the hall and i see dom coming i will find another opportunity to speak with you he said he did not leave her side but stood waiting until dom joined them your wife is fatigued from the dancing oflaherty you must take good care of her since she carries your heir youre very fortunate in that respect dom taken off guard was speechless niall bent over skyes hand briefly but tenderly kissing it good night lady oflaherty then he was gone across the floor to rejoin the dancers will you escort me to our room dom i am very tired she fought to keep her voice flat dom must not know not even suspect of course my love he answered his voice sweet helping her up he walked her slowly from the hall when they had gained their room she asked him to call her maid nay love ill maid you myself skye his voice had become soft and caressing it was a dangerous sign there wasnt a woman tonight who could compare with you he murmured every man envied me my beautiful wife every one of them imagined what it would be like to stick himself in you but im the only one who can do that skye arent i he had her bodice unlaced now and drew it off his fingers swiftly drew her gown and her petticoats down and off then her chemise and finally she stood naked and shivering in her embroidered stock ings with their gold ribbon and silk rosette garters slowly he let his eyes wander over the new fullness of her breasts and the sweet swelling of her belly his hand caressed the living roundness and skye barely breathing prayed he would be satisfied by this show of ownership kneel on the edge of the bed skye she shivered dom please its not good for the child kneel you little bitch or do you want me to believe what my eyes told me when i looked across the hall tonight to see the fine lord burke bending solicitously over my wife ogling her tits and you you encouraged him no i didnt every muscle in her body tensed then sighing she knelt on the edge of the bed her knees drawn up beneath her her hands were clenched into tight balls there was no fighting him resistance brought further punishment he looked down at her so meek so obedient he was angry with her and tempted to sodomize her for he knew how she hated that particular degradation but he feared for the child it was his son and it bound her irrevocably to him without the child she might run to niall burke and become his leman making the oflahertys the laughingstock of all connaught he did no more than loosen his codpiece and his organ swollen already burst forth he saw her shiver again and the feeling of power her fear gave him aroused him further he easily found his way inside her sliding his hands beneath her breasts to play with the very sensitive nipples while he moved himself with long smooth strokes your hound does it mis way to the bitches in my kennel ive watched him many a time he murmured biting the back of her neck she said nothing to her relief he was finished quickly im going back to the hall now he said get some rest skye fastening his clothes he was gone for a few moments she lay quietly her face wet with silent tears then she stood and removing her stockings wrapped herself in a soft woolen robe before lying down again if she could have boiled her body she would have done so but even that would not rid her of the memory of his touch the smell of his lust on her skin she could not stop the tears from flowing it had all been too much learning that her father and the macwilliam had conspired to keep niall from her had come close to breaking her heart all over again it had been easier when she could simply hate niall ex hausted she slept the sudden sound of the door latch rasping woke her and she tensed dom was back and probably drunk she lay quietly hoping he would believe she was sleeping skye came the soft whisper niall she sat up are you mad in gods name go quickly before dom returns please my lord he shut the door quietly and drew the bolt closed dom is lying in the hall in a drunken stupor with his friends my page is watching should dom awaken the lad will warn us long before he can get here dearest heaven she was beautiful her black cloud of hair swirling about her shoulders her eyes enormous and dark with con cern niall sat on the edge of the bed and drew her into his arms youve been weeping it was a statement it was easier when i thought youd betrayed me she said softly believing he would understand for me also my darling he reached out and caressed her dark hair your wifet she had to ask is keeping one of her interminable vigils in the chapel she does it to avoid me but i care not bedding her is like bedding a dead thing oh niall her voice broke and she buried her face in his shoulder skye ah love dont weep damn skye youll break my heart his mouth gently found hers sighing deeply she slid her arms about his neck and gave herself over into his keeping his hand found the swell of her breast and it seemed so natural so right she pulled her lips away from him long enough to whisper yes niall oh please love me then her mouth fused fiercely to his again and she was lost in a burst of searing passion that swept over her body instantly nearly rendering her unconscious his hand gently caressed the ripening mound i wish to heaven he were mine he muttered huskily god youre so beautiful with the babe growing in you like one of the old celtic fertility god desses i prayed so hard she whispered when i was at st brides i prayed youd gotten me with child how i wept when i found it wasnt so eibhlin says they feared for my sanity then dom came her voice trailed off ill kill him niall said quietly and what of your poor wife would you kill her also what harm has that unfortunate creature done to either of us you say she was to be a nun and from what you tell me she had a true vocation has she not been harmed as deeply as we skye drew a deep breath and pulled away from him her blue eyes intent niall oh niall my love we are inescapably wed to other people there is no hope for us i love you niall but when i return to ballyhennessey i want never to set eyes on you again i cannot see you and keep my love for you from the world dom is already suspicious i want no trouble between the two of you for he is foolish and apt to be treacherous i am not so innocent as to beg that you forget me we will not forget either of us but we must part he pulled her back into his arms i cannot bear to lose you again he said brokenly oh my love you never really had me she answered sadly for a few minutes longer they clung to each other unwilling for the bittersweet interlude to end then kissing her tenderly he laid her back against the pillows ill find other times during this visit when we can talk he said promise me one thing though promise me youll ask my help should you ever need it i will not rest easy if you do not give me your word skye and swear to it ill not have oflaherty mistreating you i do not fear dom as long as i play the beautiful and docile wife for him in public his vanity is fed enough she would not tell him the truth tell him of her husbands degrading ways in their bed for it would only infuriate niall and there was nothing he could do about it sit with me but a moment longer she begged smiling he took her hand she closed her eyes soon she was asleep gently drawing the featherbedding over her he unbolted the door and slipped from the room making his way back to the banquet hall niall dismissed his page for the night then turning to seek his own quarters he almost collided with a young squire your pardon my lord but the macwilliam would see you niall nodded and immediately sought the old mans rooms he found his father sitting up in bed a nightcap upon his leonine head his gouty foot was freshly bound and he held a goblet in his hand niall bent and sniffed the cup i thought malmsey was bad for your foot he noted that quack of a doctor tells me everything is bad for my foot i suppose if i could still fuck hed tell me that was bad for my foot also was the flinty retort the macwilliam paused i would say that the beauteous young lady oflaherty is bad for more than your foot niall my son the two men eyed each other and the macwilliam sighed i was wrong to force you into marriage with the oneill lass i can see omalleys girl would have made you a better wife christ wed seven months and already with child and she carries the babe well what a breeder shell give oflaherty a houseful of sons and still have a waist a man could span with his two hands and what a beauty that hair and those kerryblue eyes and those marvelous tits damme i wish i werent so old niall laughed but his father now continued in a more serious tone keep away from her niall oflaherty wont wear the horns of a cuckold gracefully hed kill you if he catches you with his wife i know you were with her in her bedchamber tonight while her husband lay drunk in the hall be careful lad youre my only son my heir and i love you until you get a legitimate son were not safe rest easy father skye and i but talked if we had done it in public the gossips would have had a field day you talked gods nightshirt if i were twenty years younger and alone with that beauty it would not have been talking id have been doing again niall laughed come father shes six months gone with child there are ways boy i know and perhaps if the child were minebut its not be sides and here niall eyed his father firmly finding out the trick that you and omalley played to separate us has made skye very vulnerable i would not hurt her further i love her if she lost the babe then shed be free of oflaherty said the old man slyly his wife yes but free to come to you and she would id recognize any bastards she gave you as my heirs for i strongly doubt the oneill girl will ever conceive dont tempt me father if you think skye worthy to bear our heirs then surely she is worthy of our name as well you see her as nothing but a brood mare who will secure our immortality but i love skye i have never wanted any woman but her for my wife he took a deep ragged breath but oflaherty is strong and healthy he will probably live forever she and i have no hope his death could be arranged but youre too noble for your own good niall love has made you a weakling if you dont mean to claim the woman for your own then keep away from her else her husband kills you in a fit of jealous rage growled the old man or i kill him mused lord burke quietly chapter skyes son ewan was born in early spring eibhlin helped deliver her new nephew having come to the oflahertys immediately after twelfth night eibhlin was shocked by the poverty of the oflahertys tower house anne had of course repeated skyes descriptions of her home but the nun had assumed that skyes bitter disappointment over her marriage caused her to exaggerate now she saw that everything anne had reported was dismayingly true the masonry of the tower house was in poor repair and there were drafts everywhere the floors were covered by nothing except dirty muchused rushes the few wall hangings were threadbare and virtually useless for warmth let alone comfort the furniture was sparse as well eibhlin was puzzled she knew that her father and stepmother had sent a number of fine pieces along to skye but when she questioned her younger sister all she got was a mumbled answer about gilly and dom and their endless debts having her sister with her made it a happy winter for skye ewans birth was a relaxed and easy one and eibhlin left four weeks afterward she returned within several months to aid her sister once again for skyes second son murrough was separated from his brother by but ten months murrough made his entry into the world during a brutal midwinter storm fortunately this birth was also an easy one for eibhlin had other factors beside the baby to contend with the strong winds had blown so hard that the floors of oflaherty house were covered with half an inch of snow in some places it had blown through cracked walls and the sheepskincovered windows the fires had gone out several times and eibhlin had been hardpressed to keep her sister and the newborn boy warm and dry eibhlin was angry she was ashamed that her sister should live this way skyes dowry gone to pay gaming debts or for wine or to buy gifts for the women dom and his father amused themselves with eibhlin made herself a vow skye would have no more babes especially so quickly until dom grew up and took his responsibilities seriously ten months between babes is too soon she scolded now you must rest at least a year or two before conceiving again tell dom said skye weakly hell be on me within the month despite his whores he harbors a constant lust for me besides i thought i could not conceive as long as i nursed ewan an old wives tale that has done more harm than you can imag ine replied eibhlin and i shall talk to dom myself then ill give you the recipe for a potion that will prevent conception eibhlin skye was both amused and shocked and you a nun how on earth do you know such things i have as much knowledge as a doctor replied eibhlin more perhaps since i have also learned midwifery and herbal medicine from the old ones doctors scorn these things but they are wrong to do so i can tell you several ways to prevent conception but does not the church forbid such wicked practices my sis ter the nun answered forcefully the church has not seen innocent babes dying of starvation because there are too many mouths in the family to feed they have not seen little children and their sickly mothers freezing to death blue with the cold because there are not enough blankets or clothes in the hovels they call housesnot even food or wood for warmth what do the wellfed priests and bishops snug in their stone houses on this snowy night know of these poor souls and their endless torments i help where i can skye for those innocent and superstitious poor i offer a tonic to help them regain their strength after the ordeal of several births they know not what i give them if they did they would not take it because they truly believe the churchs threat of eternal damnation you sister are not so foolish no eibhlin i am not and i want no more of doms children i will not be made old before my time nor shall i nurse this child knowing what i do now one of doms women gave birth but a month ago she has breasts like udders and it will amuse me to have her nurse both doms son and his bastard she can live in the nursery with both boys and have ewans wet nurse for company youve grown hard skye if i were not eibhlin i should not be able to survive in this house you have been here enough to know what the oflahertys are like the nun nodded have you had any luck in finding a husband for claire none and im not likely to unless i can convince da to dower her gilly and dom have gambled away the dowry left to claire by her mother theres nothing left and if i didnt know better i would swear she was a halfwit for she cares not the few young men who have come calling have been met with indifference one is too fat another too lean this one is a buffoon but that one lacks a sense of humor one is too ardent in his wooing and another has no blood in his veins i dont understand her at all she has no religious vocation no passion for anyone so far as i can see nor does she seem to desire to control her own life as i did she cares for nothing perhaps she is merely content to stay with her father and brother some women are like that skye looked candidly at her sister do you really think claire oflaherty is like that eibhlin no came the quick reply shes a sly and secretive girl for all she looks like an angel there is something and here eibhlin hesitated loath to criticize yet genuinely concerned there is some thing unwholesome about claire she finally finished skye agreed but there seemed nothing she could do with claire unless she could find a husband for her what bothered skye most was that claire always appeared to be laughing at her hugging some secret to herself that she would not share with anyone else least of all skye eibhlin soon left to return to st brides but she talked to dom first he said later since your sister tells me your health will suffer if i get another son on you you can hardly complain if i seek diversion elsewhere have i ever complained before she asked him amused hiding her delight in the knowledge that she would be spared nay youre a good lass and youve given me two fine boys skye smiled sweetly and bit her tongue to keep from laughing dom saw her only as a credit to himself she had become he thought exactly what hed always wished her to bea gracious chatelaine and a good breeder he was willing to be generous now to leave her alone for the time being her life now took on a sameness giving her the peace she craved she worked to run the estate so that it supported them all and still paid the macwilliam his annual tribute as their overlord neither dom nor his father cared what she did as long as they had the time and the wherewithal to pursue their own pleasures she drove her peasants hard though she was fair used to the laxity of the oflahertys they had gotten out of hand at first they resented her but when winter came and the peasants found them selves warm dry and well fed for the first time in years they blessed their lady she had managed the miracle of preparing them for winter then ewan was past two and murrough sixteen months and one day skye realized that in all those sixteen months dom still hadnt come near her silently she blessed the woman or women who were keeping her husband amused and it came to her that it had been many months since she had heard any gossip linking dom with any particular woman it was a disquieting thought it was june again and skye was eighteen the weather was unusually sunny and warm for ireland her healthy fully healed young body was beginning to crave loving once again even doms though they had been invited twice more to spend twelfth night with the macwilliam she had kept to ballyhennessey using her pregnancy as an excuse not to travel and playing ill the second time she dared not see niall again although both her mind and her body craved him with a desperation that almost tore her apart with the knowledge imparted to her by eibhlin she might easily have become his mistress with no one the wiser the temptation had been fierce but she held herself in too high a regard to be anything less than his cherished wife dom and his father had attended the twelfth night revelries skye had insisted that they go to the macwilliams castle leaving her behind with her babes though she had impressed upon the two men the importance of every opportunity in finding claire a husband they had returned both times to say that no suitable husband could be found skye could not understand it thanks to dubhdara omalley claire now had a respectable dowry that neither her father nor her brother could steal either the girl was being too fussy or else there was someone in claires life whom she knew was not suitable but foolishly sought after anyway skye was determined to find out what was going on for claire oflaherty was seventeen now and skye did not want to have her with them the rest of their days skye picked her time carefully choosing an evening after the meal when both gilly and dom had disappeared she had seen claire head for her own rooms at the very top of the tower house skye had never been there before she had never been asked and there had never before been a reason to violate claires privacy when the house had quieted she slowly climbed the stairs to her sisterinlaws apartment entering the dayroom skye was shocked to find many of her longmissing dowry items the windows were hung with the french velvets she had planned to use in her own chambers the small polished oak sideboard dubhdara and anne had had made particularly for her stood against one wall on it was her small silver tray with her handblown venetian goblets and decanters gods nightshirt she swore under her breath ill skin the sly bitch dear god there were her silver bowls and candle sticks stunned then furious skye was about to storm off to seek out her husband and demand an explanation when she heard laughter and the murmur of voicesone very definitely masculinefrom the bedchamber above so she thought mistress claire does have a lover well whoever he is hell soon find he has himself a new wife unless god forbid he already has one serf or lord shell wed him silently skye crept up the stairs reaching the little landing then neared the bedcham bers halfopen door the closer she got the more vividly she heard the sounds of vigorous lovemaking reaching the door she peeked into the room what she saw confirmed her suspicions claire and a man both naked were intertwined color flooded skyes face at the sight of claires long white legs wrapped tightly about her lover he brutually rammed himself into the writhing straining woman claire began to moan harder dom harder yes yes brother darling its so good so good skye felt the first wave of nausea sweep over her as she clung to the door dom claires lover was dom her own brother slowly skye slipped to the floor still clutching the door faint with the sight whore dom growled what a little whore you are sweet sister mine shall i fuck you until you cant stand up ive done it before havent i tonight however it pleases me to fuck you till you beg me for mercy and then youll pleasure me in a hundred other ways i can invent yes yes breathed claire whatever you want my darling ill do whatever you want oh dom dont i always still on her knees skye was frozen with both horror and terror on your hands and knees bitch claire scrambled to obey and was quickly and cruelly sodomized by her brother skye felt the bitter taste of bile rise in her constricted throat as claire panted hurt me dom yes hurt me still dom did not spend now he lay his sister on her back and straddling her put himself into her open eager mouth skye closed her eyes to blot out the sight but she could not close her ears to the throaty gobbling noises made by claire or the groans of pleasure made by dom unable to contain herself skye sobbed aloud claire shrieked oh my god theres someone here someone has seen us dom leapt from the bed and yanking the door fully open caught sight of his halffainting wife well well he murmured nastily what have we here its my sweet wife claires eyes narrowed bitch how dare you spy on me she shrieked i wasnt sspying skyes voice was shaking i came to ttalk to you about getting mmarried dom began to laugh uproariously but a look from his sister quieted him married why on earth would i want to marry you ninny rasped claire the only man ive ever loved is dom and i dont ever intend leaving him hes mine the only reason he married you was for the money and to get heirs hes got both now and we dont need you at all except to run the estate for us so get out of here and dont ever come back again snooping and spying skye turned to flee but doms big hand grasped her shoulder his other hand slid around to squeeze her breast and as the nipple hardened he laughed softly its been a long time skye she tried to pull away claire snarled from the bed leave her be brother you dont need her as long as you have me be quiet bitch she has pleasured me too and now i think i would have you both at the same time no wailed skye struggling to reach the door but his arms closed about her and claire a sudden vicious look in her paleblue eyes reached out and ripped skyes gown from her as her sister inlaws body became more visible claires gaze softened becom ing almost dreamy and she reached out again this time to caress skyes body skye shrank from her touch sick with revulsion claire laughed nastily let me have her first brother let me prepare her for you please you can watch while i love her remember how you loved watching me and the little maid i once had no dom oh god no dom smiled sweetly at his sister his eyes bright with memory then he nodded ill watch but when im ready claire you must give over promise me now no teasing like you did with little sorcha yes darling claire purred and then with doms aid they tied the struggling skyes arms to the bedposts claire straddled her victim and holding skyes head between her hands she kissed her slowly and wetly skye seemed faint and laughing claire began leisurely to explore the shrinking flesh the degradation she was inflicting added to her enjoyment taking skyes nipples between her thumb and forefinger she rolled them gently before bending and sucking on them bound though she was skye fought to escape but her helplessness only stimulated her antagonist slowly claire slid her lush body down skyes until their breasts and bellies met then she rotated her pelvis and mons veneris against skyes murmuring vilely dont tell me that with all the sisters you have youve not done a bit of girlfucking in your time and rememberwhile we pleasure each other dom is watching us and readying himself for both of us big bull that he is dont fight me sister for now that you know about dom and me theres no reason we cannot share him and enjoy each other all the time skye turned her head away ashamed of what was happening to her and confused by the stirrings of desire she was beginning to feel claire thrust and moaned against skyes helpless body with increas ing fervor until suddenly dom pulled her away and mounting his wife thrust into her skye screamed which only seemed to madden him claire was now kneeling within skyes view slackmouthed with lust as she watched her brother use his wife when dom had sated himself with skye he rolled off her and loosened her bonds he pushed her away pulled his sister over and mounted her next skye curled into a tight protective ball and sobbed she had never felt so fouled in her entire life she knew that if anyone so much as touched her again she would kill strengthened by this realization she marshaled her courage and crawled off the bed stumbling across the room she reached the door dom and his sister had finished by this time and claire saw her she cried out shes escaping dom get her back i want her again dom lurched off the bed and lunged for his wife skye had now wrenched the door open as he reached out for her skye sidestepped him dom stumbled through the door lost his balance and fell screaming headlong down the flight of stone steps leading to his sisters day chamber there was a stunned silence he lay still twisted grotesquely claire leaped from the bed and stood gazing down into the room below then she turned on skye and howled youve killed him youve killed dom holy mother forgive me thought skye but i hope so then as relief brought strength sweeping over her she turned on claire and furiously slapped her leaving the imprint of her hand on the girls face shut up you vicious little bitch shut up we must get help whimpered claire not yet you do want him dead came the horrified accusation ill not deny it said skye flatly and claire shrank away from her but before we can get help we must all dress how will it look to the servants to find the three of us mother naked ill not put that scandal on my sons get dressed then go and fetch me some clothes from my room quickly the procedure seemed to take forever but at last both women were dressed struggling together they forced dom into his clothes to skyes sorrow he was still breathing now said skye rouse the house what will i tell them quavered claire that dom has had an accident i will handle the rest go now claire fled shrieking loudly enough to rouse the entire household and quickly the room was filled with babbling servants skye calmly directed the removal of her injured husband to his own rooms the familys surgeon was sent for and arrived as the dawn was breaking dom lived but it would have been better if he had died his spine was broken in two places he was paralyzed from the waist down he would not walk or function as a man ever again skye thanked the surgeon paid his fee and sent him away then she took on the oflahertys gilly blustered at her claire says youre responsible for my sons condition your son is responsible for his own condition replied skye coldly last night after the meal was finished and i had seen to my household duties i went to your daughters rooms to speak to her about arranging a marriage i found her and your precious son fuck ing merrily and it was not the first time they had engaged in mis incest when i tried to flee from them they ripped my clothes from me and used me vilely both of them i tried to escape again and dom lunged at me when i stepped aside he fell through the open door and down the stairs im only sorry he didnt break his damned neck it would have saved me the trouble of caring for him if you still believe that i have wronged your son gilly then we will take our case and place it before the macwilliam yes sobbed claire for once in your life father take the initiative dom will spend the rest of his life half a man because of her she deserves to be punished skye drew herself up proudly and looked down upon the vengeful claire yes claire she purred take your case to the mac william do and then be prepared either to prove your virginity before the midwives panel or name your lover who will you say it is claire one of the serfs i think not youre far too proud a bitch to admit to fucking with a serf who then there is no one else no one ever comes to visit you no one perhaps you could claim the devil for your lover in a sense youd be speaking the truth skyes fatherinlaw looked suddenly old and defeated claire wept helplessly skyes next words held a finality i am going home to innisfana she announced and i am taking my sons with me i will not be back since claire loves her brother so deeply she will remain here to care for him for the rest of his life i will see that da withdraws her dowry she has no chance of a decent marriage without it and i would not knowing what i do now see her wed with some poor unsuspecting lad she will be fed and clothed at my expense or she may go with what she has the choice is hers frang the bailiff will run the estate for me and answer to me alone this is after all to be ewans inheritance someday and i want it turned over to him in good condition gilly you will be taken care of but my fathers lawyers will shortly have a paper for you to sign that will prevent you from gambling away any part of the estate mark me well gilly i will not pay for your wines your women or your gambling debts father are you going to let her do this to us gilly stared straight ahead and skye smiled triumphantly yes claire he is he knows the alternative i will bring my case before the macwilliamand before the church if i do i will accuse you not only of incest with your brother but of witchcraft as well you deserve to bum for what youve been doing i love him claire screamed you were his sister i loved him claire repeated from the time we first bedded when i was but a maid of eleven i was the only woman who ever really satisfied dom skye looked pityingly at claire in the years that dom has left we will see how much you really love him in the morning skye bid her husband an unemotional farewell i hope you enjoyed what you and your sister did the other night for the memory of it will have to last you a lifetime bitch he snarled at her what kind of a woman are you to leave me a better woman than you ever knew or appreciated dom your conduct with your sister has wiped free any obligation on my part toward you farewell he struggled to rise bitch come back i command you skye come back she never turned back his voice alternating between curses threats and pleas followed her until the sound became quite un intelligible and finally faded altogether skye rode away from the oflaherty house ewan before her on her saddle behind her were the carts carrying her younger son the two nurses and her household goods but when skye reached lnnisfana several days later there was no peaceful haven there dubhdara omalley lay dying having been badly injured by a falling mast in a storm as he was bringing his ship home a stubborn man he had refused to die until he reached his home and until he had seen his youngest daughter the mes senger he sent to skye had found her as she took ship for lnnisfana island she was barely in time to bid her father a final farewell tearful she kissed his cold and sweating brow im back for good da he nodded explanations were unimportant now your brothers are too young for the ships yet he gasped weakly youve got to take charge for me it never crossed her mind that he was thrusting a huge respon sibility upon her she answered simply i will youre the best of them lassie even the boys oh da she whispered oh da i do love you skye lass this time follow your heart were dubhdara omalleys last words to his favorite child he died a few minutes later holding her hand her beautiful blue eyes overflowing she looked wordlessly to her uncle seamus i heard him he said and ill uphold your rights skye youre the new omalley and may god be with you for youll be needing all the help you can get skye looked to her stepmother i heard him and i trust you said anne youll do right by us all besides its your full brother michael who is the next male in line not my lads in this family answered skye its not necessarily the eldest but the most competent at least two of your boys show more promise than michael hes most like my mother lord help him hes more likely to follow our lord christ than the sea am i not right uncle seamus omalley nodded hed asked me to talk with dubh he wants to enter st padraics and become a priest skye turned to anne you see it rests with brian and shane now as quickly as the family of the omalley chief could be assem bled they determined the length of the wake and the date of the funeral with seamus omalley and anne to back her skye was reluctantly recognized as the new omalley by her brothersinlaw and her very shocked sisters her clansmen and vassals came quickly almost joyfully to pay their homage to skye the new omalley the next step was a journey to the macwilliams stronghold to pledge him her fealty only anne eibhlin and her uncle knew the truth behind her leaving her husband all three were horrified but swore to keep the secret seamus omalley added to his nieces mystique by claiming that she had returned home because of a dream in which her father called her from over the waves the men who had sailed with her father and with her when she was a child cir culated once again the old tales of her bravery and skill the macwilliam would have been hard pressed indeed to deny skye her inheritance she rode into his stronghold with all her captains escorting her niall burke watched her arrival from one of the towers of the castle and wondered what would happen between them now she rode astride as she had in the old days and upon the black stallion finn she was dressed in lincoln green hose over which she wore high brown cordoba leather boots and a midthighlength doeskin jerkin with silver buttons beneath the jerkin was a creamcolored silk shirt with small pearl buttons her glorious blueblack hair was parted in the center and twisted into a smooth coil at the nape of her neck her gardenia skin was a little flushed upon her left hand he could see a blue flash and knew she wore the great sapphire ring that had been her fathers seal of office he descended from the tower and strode swiftly to his own quarters to his surprise darragh was waiting for him the three years of their marriage had been a bad joke and he rarely saw her let alone cohabited with her it was obvious that she would never conceive him a child she had never come to him willingly and each time he had taken her it had been a battle in which she yielded to the flesh and then did penance for her weakness she had had coarse brown robes made up for herself robes that resembled those worn by her old religious order she rarely bathed believing it a concession to the flesh for over a year now she had spent her days and nights in constant prayer he no longer went near her her personal habits disgusted him and attempting to claim his rights seemed now like raping a nun a thing for which niall burke had no taste he greeted her courteously and she replied lady oflaherty is here to see your father niall why has she come her father has died darragh and it was his deathbed wish that she take over his duties until her brothers are grown she is now the omalley and she has come to pledge her fealty to her overlord and what of her husband i have been given to understand that she tried to murder him and then left him taking his sons with her he lies paralyzed for life with only his loyal sister to care for him where did you obtain this information darragh he kept his voice quiet and level i have a letter from the unfortunate lady claire oflaherty begging me to intercede with the macwilliam on her poor brothers behalf i do not believe the tale darragh i have never known skye to be anything but generous and thoughtful those are not the qualities that made the omalley leave her in charge of his small empire noted darragh shrewdly it was an unusually sensible observation for darragh skye would never harm anyone i refuse to believe it of course you do not believe it you lust after her but for the sake of your immortal soul you must not yield to her wiles niall he laughed bitterly whose wiles would you have me yield to then wife yours let me tell you something about skye omalley my dear the last time i saw her she told me she never wanted to set eyes on me again because through an awful quirk of fate we were wed to other people i then said i would kill her husband she chided me asking what i would do with my own wife kill her also she said you had been as wronged as the rest of us were and we must all make the best of our situations she would tempt neither herself nor me by seeing me again ah the most wicked ones are always the most clever niall she has skillfully misled you into believing her virtuous beware of her beware and with a strange look in her weak blue eyes darragh turned and left him niall went about the business of changing his clothes his father had told him he wanted him there when the omalley swore her fealty for she must swear it not only to the macwilliam but also to his heir he debated whether to be elegant or simple finally settling on black velvet because it was both entering the main hall of the castle he was surprised to find that skye had not changed from her riding clothes her captains at her back she knelt placing her hands in the old and gnarled ones of the macwilliam and then into nialls warm firm grasp she twice swore her loyalty to the burkes then rose gracefully to accept their kiss of peace lord burke noted the pride and love flowing from the eyes of the roughlooking omalley captains that they adored her was obvious and he was reassured to know that she would sail with such devoted men then suddenly to everyones shock and embarrassment darragh appeared in their midst her nuns robes swirling about her and cried out my lord the macwilliam on behalf of the oflahertys of ballyhennessey i cry for judgment against this evil woman oh wicked whore of babylon your days of evil are numbered the lord god will strike thee down with fire and the sword skye looked swiftly to niall her eyes filled with pity clear the hall dammit shouted the macwilliam redfaced and very angry when all but the four of them had gone the old man turned on darragh i hope madam that you have a bloody fine explanation for this intrusion and for your unwanted charges no longer madam sir but sister mary penitent that was to have been my name before you stole me from my convent and forced me into carnal bondage with your son it will soon be my name again for i will no longer remain here but return to st marys before i go however i will right a great wrong done by this wicked woman first she deliberately crippled her husband then she willfully deserted him stealing both his sons and his money she must be punished god demands it what the hell nonsense is this roared the macwilliam she claims to have a letter from claire oflaherty said niall quietly to his father the lying deceitful bitch said skye furiously and the macwilliam and his son grinned at each other all right omalley whats your explanation demanded the old man skye glanced scornfully at darragh is she strong enough to hear the truth of this its not very pretty speak omalley commanded the macwilliam claire oflaherty lies my lord i caught her and her brother my husband in incest skye outlined the story concluding when i dodged him he fell down a flight of stairs darragh burke who had turned white at the mention of the word incest gave a moan of horror and fell to the floor in a faint the macwilliam and his son glanced briefly at her then returned their attentions to skye the surgeon said dom will never walk again under the cir cumstances i feel no obligation to him the estate was in a ruinous condition when i married dom your annual tributes had not been paid in three years but it is all paid up now thanks to me the oflaherty lands are again prosperous because of my skillful man agement this despite doms having gambled and whored away my dowry claire oflaherty owes me for every mouthful of food she consumes every drop she drinks the very clothes on her back she might have been safely wed but for her own crimes it was her choice to remain at ballyhennessey and commit incest with her brother rather than wed her own man when dom was injured i told her she could stay and nurse him or go as she pleased skye looked hard at the macwilliam if you feel her charges have merit my lord i will abide by your decision the old man reached out and gently stroked skyes beautiful hair there is no merit in her charges omalley he said gruffly if she will not accept my decision in this matter then i shall turn her over to the church they will deal with the wench far more harshly than you or i would he smiled at skye now lass will you accept my hospitality for a few days time youve come through a hard time and youve great responsibility ahead of you she smiled back at him and he thought again how extraordinarily beautiful she was for the briefest moment he regretted his age and his infirmities he envied his son this beautiful woman who would undoubtedly become his mistress i will accept your kindness my lord but only for a day youre right in that i am now laden with responsibilities my fathers entire fleet stands awaiting my orders and they must remain idle until i have studied his books my eldest brother prefers the church to the sea and though i will train him in my fathers ways for boys are known to be fickle creatures with changeable minds i doubt that michael will change therefore it will be my halfbrother brian whos most likely to become the next omalley he is but six now it will be at least ten years before he can take over his duties then too there are my own two sons to raise stop lassie said the macwilliam youre exhausting me its too much for a woman to take on and i wonder at your father god assoil him skye looked at the old man proudly my father knew i would not fail him he might have chosen any of my sisters husbands or even my uncle seamus but he chose me i am the omalley then her look softened and her eyes which had been a deep purpleblue lightened to a clear bluegreen tonight however i shall be just skye omalley and your most grateful guest she turned without another word and walked from the room the mac william bellowed for a servant who quickly removed the still unconscious darragh if you mean to have the omalley lass he said to niall you had best tame her quickly my son this is no milkandwater wench but a fullblown woman once she gets the bit of power into her teeth youll not easily get a bridle on her ill see if i can start annulment proceedings on your marriage for the oneill girl belongs back in her convent as to oflaherty the health of a cripple is precarious at best i trust youre not too noble to object if we assist him now to a better life discreetly of course niall shook his head without hesitation may i speak to skye of marriage the old man grinned wickedly if twill aid you in your wooing yes and i imagine youll need all the help you can get shes a strongminded woman niall grinned back as he strode from the hall and headed for skyes chambers his heart was singing she was his they would finally be together and they would make marvelous love and she would bear him strong sons and beautiful daughters and they would be happy he burst into her room startling mag and a halfclothed skye my fathers starting the annulment proceedings my love we can soon be wed he reached out for her but she eluded him mag get out ill call you then dont touch me niall i cannot bear to be touched i told you what they did to me i never want to be touched again i am happy youre to be free of darragh oneill but find yourself another wife my lord my husband lives and even if he did not i would not remarry i will never again put myself at a mans mercy she shuddered deeply he was stunned this was not the girl he had known skye my love he began gently i know they have hurt you but never hurt you remember how it was with us it was sweetness beyond mea sure come love and he held out his hand to her come let me love you and wipe away the unhappy memories niall her eyes filled with tears please understand i cannot even bear for mag to touch me my own good mag i bore doms brutal lovemaking for three years even then i remembered how it had been with us and i prayed that someday we could be together there was no obscenity that dom forced upon me that spoiled you for me not ever not until the night he and his vile sister she could not go on he finished it quietly for her until the night they both raped you aye she said and was silent once more i do understand he said as his deep voice soothing and tenderly warm sought to reassure and comfort her the wounds are still too new and i in my happiness have foolishly assumed you would share my joy at the prospect of our being together again forgive me my love you have suffered two wicked shocks and now youre burdened with an awesome responsibility youll need time to adjust and you shall have it sweetheart her lashes were silken smudges against her pale skin a great wave of pity washed over him as two crystalline tears slipped from beneath her closed eyelids and down her cheeks he wanted to reach out enfold her in his arms comfort her wipe away completely all the terrible hurt but he stood with clenched fists and fought to maintain a rigid control on himself lest he frighten her and risk losing her forever finally she spoke i love you niall i have never loved anyone else i know skye he answered quietly and that is why i will wait what her wet jewel eyes flew open yes my precious love wait in time the terror will fade and when it does i will be here skye be it a month from now or a year or ten years you need an heir niall your father wants one so very much youll give me one someday my love youre mad but a small smile played at the corners of her mouth not mad my darling simply in love with a wild and sweet vixen who will eventually come home to me again suddenly she held out her hand to him he grasped it and felt her tremble but she did not pull away give me time niall i will come back to you i know now that i will just give me time a wonderful warm smile lit his face turning his mouth up at the edges crinkling his silvery eyes at the corners madam i offer you whatever time you need for i have surely never known anything better worth waiting for than you he bowed low over her slim hand his cool lips gently brushing her skin sending a small shiver was it revulsion or was it desirerippling through her then straightening he turned and left her chambers skye stood frozen barely breathing he loved her despite it all he still loved her he was willing to wait and now as she felt the blood begin to course through her veins wanning her as she had not been warmed since that terrible night she knew it would be all right the horrible memories were fresh but she would heal even tually and when she did niall would be waiting on the following day the omalley thanked her overlord for his hospitality and after a short ride to the coast sailed home to innisfana island within the month word came to the macwilliam that the transition from the old to the new omalley had been made smoothly and that the fleet was sailing once again so niall burke waited the healing process had begun for skye and when it was complete they would be together forever he would not go to her before then there was plenty of time chapter a year passed and dom died his death though sudden was not unexpected with the loss of his legs he had lost the will to live claire oflaherty disappeared shortly after the visit of an english cousin and only gilly remained at ballyhennessey a sad shadow of his former self content to spend his days and nights in a drunken haze the estate was well managed by frang the bailiff the small prosperous trading empire of the omalleys grew more prosperous through skyes skillful handling and the macwilliam was forced to admit that dubhdara omalley had known exactly what he was doing when he had placed his daughter in charge how she would behave in wartime was another matter and he had yet to call upon her for that at nine michael omalley was more a priest than child his calling so obvious that skye finally sent him to school at the mon astery of st brendans preparatory to his entering the priesthood at sixteen he would not take his final vows until he was twenty by which time his two oldest halfbrothers would have wed and probably produced heirs brian and shane at seven and a half and six and a half had begun the process of learning about the sea about ships and about their late fathers halflegal halfillegal methods of doing business brian was assigned to a ship named western wind and shane went aboard the north star neither ship would ever be out when the other was also out and occasionally the boys were at home at the same time which gave skye a chance to see her halfbrothers work ing together and to evaluate them as they grew each was a true omalley taking to the sea as to an old and respected friend skye wished her father could have seen them for he would have been proud with the aid of bishop omalley and the donation of a fine manor to the church niall burke was finally given an annulment from his wife darragh oneill and she happily returned to her convent where she quickly took final vows on his sons behalf the macwilliam sent to seamus omalley and formally requested his nieces hand in marriage with her permission the negotiations would begin at once i dont know now said skye mischievously christs bones roared the bishop for a moment so like his late brother that his niece burst into laughter looking very aggrieved the bishop demanded what do you mean you dont know now from the moment niall burke looked at you nothing would do but that you have him now you can and you dont know if you will god almighty woman make up your mind his plump face was red and his blue eyes almost black with anger skyes laughter died in her throat kneeling she leaned her silky head against the prelates knee it isnt because i dont love niall uncle i do he is the only man for me and he always will be but i am no longer a girl whose only interest is her man and their babes perhaps i never really was beware lassie warned seamus omalley this is the macwilliam and his heir that we deal with they are your overlords let them beware also shot back skye am the omalley seamus omalley mastered his temper what is it you want niece specifically my marriage must not affect my status as the omalley and neither must my husband or my fatherinlaw interfere with that the responsibility for the clan remains mine until i see fit to pass it on to one of my brothers da wanted it that way i will not have the burkes dabbling greedy fingers into the omalley coffers i will come to them with a dowry worthy of a princess but that is all they will receive i want no interference by the burkes into omalley affairs the bishop nodded tis shrewd you are niece but i dont know if we can get the macwilliam to swallow such a big pill hes a sly old man come uncle youre a brilliant negotiator did you not arrange with your friends in rome for nialls annulment we both know the reason the macwilliam seeks me for his son is not my bonnie blue eyes or my pretty tits he looks to our ships but they are not mine to give they belong to my halfbrothers and i will not cheat my fathers sons out of their inheritance even to gain my own hap piness i offer that wicked old man a bigger dowry than any of his betterbred wenches and i also offer him something even better than money for i am a proven breeder of sons tempt him with that for all his cleverness he has but one heir i will give him half a dozen more the bishop laughed youre a very naughty wench niece your attitude toward the holy sacrament of matrimony is really quite shocking i am tempted to pile you with penances i will accept them gladly uncle if niall burke truly loves me she became deadly serious now this is what i must know the last time he accepted his fathers will too easily and did not fight for me now he must battle the macwilliam to prove his love and if the macwilliam refuses your terms he wont but if he did then niall would wed with me anyway if he really loves me very well skye twill be your way thank you uncle she replied meekly with downcast eyes and he chuckled and fondly whacked her backside the macwilliam angrily roared his outrage but seamus omalley stood firm even after skye wed with lord burke she was to remain the omalley and she was to retain complete control of omalley affairs the obriens have a fine lass ripe for marriage said the macwilliam slyly the devil take her shouted niall and the bishop masked his smile tis skye i want and skye ill have even if i must slit your scrawny throat the macwilliam looked at his son with an injured air if youre that hot for her then you might as well have her i hope youll quickly breed me several grandsons before much more time has passed i am not growing any younger seamus omalley returned to his niece happy to tell her that her terms had been accepted and that niall burke had been willing to fight for her the omalleys were in a state of great excitement because one of their own was to wed with niall burke yet skye remained calm throughout you must be made of ice remarked her sister peigi hes what youve always wanted and god knows his reputation with women would set an ordinary woman to fainting youve already had a taste of his lovemaking so surely you must be excited to finally be marrying him i am but were not wed yet peigi i am fearful of rejoicing too soon lest i awaken to find it all nought but a dream if i remain quiet and unobtrusive i will not attract the undue attention of those spirits who might envy me my good fortune god ha mercy little sister what unchristian nonsense is this thank the lord you do not run our business so foolishly skye shook her head but said nothing further she knew that even here in the heart of devout christian ireland food and drink were placed upon the doorsteps nightly in offering to the little people she knew that certain maidens of unblemished virtue were marked as sacred and the keeping of their virginity placed in the care of an ancient celtic demon who materialized to destroy the violator if the girls innocence was threatened she and the men of her fleet made verbal obeisance to mannanan maclir the ancient irish sea god before each voyage it had been almost eighteen months since she had seen niall and she was somewhat frightened for in all that time she had been free of mens demands her aversion to being touched had eased some what and mag could again bathe and dress her as if sensing her fears from afar niall burke came unannounced to innisfana island he found her in her mothers rose garden clipping some late blooms for a few minutes he stood in the shadow of a tree and watched her he realized he had never seen her in a moment of leisure she was dressed in the irish fashion wearing a bright red skirt of soft lightweight wool she had tucked it up and he saw that she was barelegged and barefoot her blouse was of fine linen as white as many washings could make it the sleeves were short and it was deepnecked revealing her breasts when she bent to inhale the sweet fragrances of the flowers her blueblack hair was loose and billowed softly about her shoulders in the light breeze she carried a wide nearly flat straw basket halffilled with roses her giant hound inis walked slowly by her side she was lovelier than he had remembered and his heart beat a little quicker when he realized that this beautiful woman had con sented to be his wife the young innocent of fifteen was long gone he barely remembered her now as this lovely creature of nineteen quickened his blood he let his eyes feast on her enjoying the soft pink in her cheeks the way her lashes made a dark smudge against her skin her slim figure moved with such grace it gave him pleasure just to watch her after a little longer he stepped from behind the tree and the big hound stiffened his hackles rising inis growled low in warning i am glad to see you so well guarded skye put your hand out niall so inis may get your scent she patted the dog friend inis niall is a friend lord burke suffered himself to be thoroughly sniffed he patted the animal speaking reassuringly to him receiving first a long searching look from the liquid amber eyes and then finally a wet cold nose pushed into his palm he likes you and if he hadnt you might have had difficulty claiming your rights once were wed my lord she said mischievously she sobered suddenly and he did too then he held out his arms to her and without a moments hesitation she walked into them his arms closed securely about her and she stood quietly listening to the rapid beat of his heart just beneath her cheek i love you lass he said quietly and i love you my lord burke i would seal that love with a kiss she said softly raising her head his mouth gently found hers at the first touch of his lips she panicked but his big hand caressed her hair and he murmured against her mouth no love its niall and i love you with a sigh she gave herself up to him and when he released her at last her eyes were shining with joy is it all right now sweetheart he asked already knowing the answer yes my lord for a moment but it quickly passed i will always be gentle with you skye i know she smiled happily how long were you watching me a few minutes youre a charming sight barefoot and clipping roses but hardly dignified she blushed as the omalley i should have sailed out to meet you my betrothed husband leave the omalley at sea my love i prefer shoeless lasses especially the one now in my arms besides you did not know i was coming and but a day behind me is himself anxious that your uncle perform the betrothal ceremony here in two days time and that we sign the contracts would that please you pet oh niall yes yes yes and then he continued we can be wed in three weeks time after the banns are all read yes then her face fell no it cannot be in three weeks time damn i must go to algiers and we sail in a week to algiers why it has been suggested that we set up a trading post in algiers and i cannot give my approval unless i have investigated the situation myself i must not waste omalley gold or omalley resources why must you leave next week cant you go another time she could hear the irritation in his voice oh niall i am sorry in order to gain a trading license in algiers we must have permission from the dey who represents the sublime porte in constantinople without the deys approval we cannot trade safely in the mediterranean why not simply bribe him skye laughed we are going to but the turks do things differ ently than we do we are rather straightforward whereas they de mand grace and elegance even in their business dealings when the dey learned that the head of the omalley company was a woman he demanded to meet me my representatives dared not refuse him so i must go or else risk insulting the dey to insult the dey is to insult the sultan in that case we would not get the trading permit worse our ships would be marked as fair game by the barbary pirates who sail out of algiers under the deys supervision we would be ruined i have to go the appointment is set how long at least three months three months dammit skye its too long to be separated from you her eyes lit up come with me niall sail with me to algiers i know we must allow our families the privilege of marrying us off with pomp and fuss but once were betrothed and pledged to wed no one will think to mind if you accompany me we can have our church wedding when we get home come with me my love oh please come with me it was a wild impractical idea and he almost said no then he thought of the long days and longer nights ahead niall burke took a deep breath and said yes skye my love ill sail with you though i must be mad to do so with a cry of joy she flung herself into his arms several days later in the same chapel that had seen skyes baptism and illfated marriage to dom oflaherty her betrothal to niall burke was celebrated she regretted the absence of her father at the moment of her greatest happiness but the macwilliams open joy eased her sorrow the ceremony was barely over when skye left her husbandtobe and their guests in the care of her sisters so that she could oversee the preparation of her ships they would sail in a fleet of nine ships skyes flagship was the faoileag the seagull with her would be her fathers ship the righ amhara king of the sea annes ship the banrigh aceo queen of the mist which had been a wedding gift from her late husband and the six ships belonging to skye and her sisters these were known as the six daughters for each was named a daughter of they were inghean asian daughter of the storm inghean aceo daughter of the mist inghean amhara daughter of the sea inghean aear daughter of the east inghean alar daughter of the west and the inghean aay daughter of the island each ship was carefully prepared and provisioned and the crews were handpicked by skye she wished to make a good impression on the dey permission to trade with algiers meant untold wealth thus it was that one week from the day of his betrothal niall burke found himself standing on the quarterdeck of a ship as it sailed south out of omalley bay into the rolling blue atlantic ocean he was not a sailor by nature and had no special feeling for the sea nevertheless the weather was tolerable and he quickly found his sea legs what he could not find as easily was an end to his amazement for skye omalley in command on the sea was completely different from the woman he knew and loved she was amazingly competent highly knowledgeable in areas of which he had little or no understanding the men about her did her bidding unquestioningly and listened to her with open respect had she not been his sweet skye in the privacy of her cabin niall would have been genuinely frightened of the amazon who commanded this small fleet fortunately niall burke had a sense of humor and he quickly realized he was going to need it though he shared the captains quarters with her he slept alone in a single bunk in a small side cabin with the wolfhound inis as his companion the great dog had attached himself to niall with a singular devotion that delighted skye for inis had hated dom lord burke amused himself by training the dog it was intelligent but lacked manners niall also spent a good deal of time in the company of the same captain macguire who had returned him to the macwilliam several years back it was macguire who began to teach niall the rudiments of sea manship for as he succinctly put it the omalleys are all half fish and if youre to wed one youd best understand why they love the sea even if you dont niall burke listened learned and began to have great admiration for those who made the sea their life he spent the evenings with skye though she would not share her bed with him i am not a passenger on this voyage she told him if i were needed in the night and we her blue eyes twinkled and he laughed in spite of his disappointment to reward his patience she flung herself into his arms and kissed him ardently her soft breasts pressing provocatively against his pounding heart her little tongue darting teasingly about his mouth niall pushed her back and kicking her legs from beneath her they fell to the big captains bed skye felt her shirt buttons opening as if by magic and his mouth burned into the soft flesh of her breasts nuzzling against a suddenly hard nipple sucking until the throb between her legs was almost unbearable then he lifted his head and his silvery eyes stared down at her with tolerant amusement youre captain of this ship skye but i will if you dont mind be captain in our bedchamber if you tease me like that again ill have you on your back before you can say sail ho do you understand me sweetheart aye captain she answered and he was flattered to see the admiration in her eyes the weather remained miraculously fair as the seagull and her sister ships sailed farther south avoiding the treacherous bay of biscay entirely by the simple maneuver of keeping far enough out to sea they now sailed shoreward rounding cape st vincent ploughing across the gulf of cadiz and through the straits of gi braltar into the mediterranean they were but a few days out of algiers when a freak storm struck the omalley fleet scattering it haphazardly the wind and waves were tremendous the heavy rains soaked into the decks and through into the belowdecks area just when they thought them selves safe the storm having died the boom of a cannon brought them face to face with barbary pirates the pendant sent them by the dey to insure their safe journey had been ripped away in the storm and they were under attack by two ships there was no choice but to fight skyes men were delighted laughingly they broke out the weapons and turned with relish to meet the enemy the grappling hooks flew and the seagull found herself pinioned against a pirate ship below decks her gun crews worked frantically to sink the fastclosing second ship while above deck skye sword in hand led her men in defense of her ship horrified admiring her courage but scared to death for her lord burke grabbed his own sword but macguire held him back shes doing fine laddie stay with me you go to her now and shell be more concerned for your safety than for her ships she doesnt need you if she does well go but for now well just defend this area from the mangy infidels and clay pipe still clenched between his teeth he leaped forward to engage a burly bearded turbaned ruffian who was attempting to gain the quarterdeck knowing macguire was right niall joined in the fight to keep the quarterdeck free the seagulls gun crew succeeded in sinking the second enemy ship and a great shout of triumph went up from the omalley men with renewed vigor they began to force the invaders from their decks and off their ship the grappling hooks were disengaged and slowly a border of water began to appear between the two ships the pirates fled back to their own vessel what happened next was never quite clear in the minds of the sailors who lived through it a freak wavea remnant of the recent stormhit the ship sharply broadside and niall burke found him self pitched overboard into the sea he heard skye scream his name and then inis hit the water near him and swam to his side he could see a boat being quickly lowered and he knew it would be only a matter of minutes before he and the dog were safely back aboard the seagull on the ship above skye raved in a manner previously unknown to her crew jesu jesu you idiots hurry lower the boat before he drowns if either he or the dog is drowned ill keelhaul the lot of you all the way back to ireland the boat hit the water and was swiftly rowed toward lord burke and inis both of whom were treading water skye leaned from the quarterdeck frantically directing the rescue in the foaming sea nialls dark head bobbed next to inis silvery black one intent on the rescue they all forgot about the pirates the pirate captain and his crew had been staring amazed and now the captain nodded to one of his seaman the pirate was swung swiftly across the gap between the two ships grasping skye firmly about the waist the man lifted her from the deck of the seagull and the two of them swung back to the pirate ship she turned on him with a shriek of fury nails clawing but her captor laughed his teeth white against his tanned face and black beard as she struggled with the man she heard her own crew shouting but the pirates were now breaking out muskets and shooting down into the water in an attempt to hinder the rescue of lord burke the rescue boat finally reached niall and he and the dog were hauled into it thank god sobbed skye she heard niall call her name and taking her captor unawares for a moment she fought free and shrieked niall niall he stood up in the boat and shouted desperately were coming beloved were coming to get you there was a sharp crack of a musket and a bright blossom of scarlet burst from lord burkes chest skye stared in horror then screamed endlessly as she watched him fall into the little boat ive killed him oh sweet christ ive killed him and with a moan of anguish she slid down into the darkness that rose to free her of her pain part ii algiers chapter the garden of khalid el bey had been designed to be a haven of perfect peace rectangular in shape it lay directly behind the beys villa a twostory marble building high atop the city of algiers the view from both garden and villa was mag nificent allowing a panoramic vista of the city below with its recently built turkish fortcalled the casbahand the blue mediterranean lapping at its feet there were orange and lemon trees in the garden as well as tall full pines and roses of every imaginable color a tshaped pool its longer bar interspersed with spraying fountains ran the length of the garden the paths held carefully raked light gravel and small white marble benches were placed at intervals along them there were three distinct sounds in the garden of khalid el bey the tinkling of fountains bird songs and the murmur of the breeze in the pines occasionally the buzzing of a bee intruded itself the only human inhabitant of the garden at this moment was a beautiful young woman who lay dozing on a portable chaise longue she wore a simple paleblue caftan and her slim feet were shod in gold leather sandals her skin was very fair with the faintest blush of pink on her cheeks her eyelids softly shadowed in blue kohl her thick blueblack hair lay curling in gentle disarray about her shoul ders khalid el bey who had come into the garden from the villa stood silently watching the woman he was a tall man in early middle years his dark hair just beginning to silver slightly at the sides his skin bore a faint golden tint which set off his short black beard his ambergold eyes were fringed in long thick dark lashes unusual in a man but most attractive khalid el bey was neither fat nor thin but possessed a firm wellmuscled body which he exercised regu larly his face was oval the eyes set well apart the nose long and aristocratic the lips thin but still sensuous now as he stood gazing quietly down on the lovely woman in his garden he knew that his instincts had been correct she was indeed a great beautythough when she had been brought to him two months before one would not have known it she had been thin then her hair matted and lank and she had been suffering from shock still he had seen a valuable jewel beneath the filth and despite yasmins objections had bought her for his house of felicity she had healed slowly he himself had spooned nourishing chicken broth between her cracked lips during that first week his gentleness had communicated itself to her and it was to him that she first spoke who are you my name is khalid el bey where am i you are at my house in the city of algiers she became silent again after a moment she ventured how came i here you were brought to me by capitan rais el abdul tell me now my beauty what is your name my name is skye she answered him and where do you come from he probed her enormous sapphireblue eyes seemed bewildered then filled with tears i dont know she sobbed i dont know where i come from surely this capitan rais el abdul must know khalid el bey shook his head no you were transferred to his ship from another the first vessel was just going out on a voyage and hailed the capitan who was homeward bound then seeing the fear in her eyes he spoke soothingly do not be frightened beautiful skye i am sure your memory will return soon we know you are european for we are speaking french though your accent is not that of a native frenchwoman rest now we will talk again but her memory still had not returned his moorish physician had examined her throughly her age was between eighteen and twenty she was not a virgin in fact she had borne more than one child she was free of disease and had all her teeth because the physician could find no evidence of a head injury he concluded that the memory loss was due to some terrible emotional shock and that her mind refused to remember her beautiful blue eyes which changed from sapphire to blue green as her moods changed opened now and looked at him my lord khalid he smiled how are you feeling my beautiful one sitting down beside her he caressed her dark hair i am ever so much better my lord we must talk now skye of what my lord you know that my name is khalid el bey but i have another name skye i am called the whoremaster of algiers i own many houses filled with beautiful women whose very reason for existence is to please the men who come to visit them i own the women as i own you you do she was incredulous you own me yes capitan rais el abdul bought you from the fust capitan and men he sold you to me why did you buy me he smiled her memory loss had affected so many areas in cluding her knowledge of worldly things i bought you skye because i intend to train you to be the finest courtesan algiers has ever known then i will place you in my best house which is called felicity what must i do my lord do you remember nothing of lovemaking he shook her head he sighed i will have to have yasmin instruct you in certain matters then i will personally instruct you we will begin tomor row for the doctor has assured me that you are well enough yasmin does not like me my lord khalid yasmin is a slave like you skye she will do as she is told if she should distress you in any way you will tell me yes my lord khalid and thank you she said softly i will endeavor to learn well so you will be pleased he mused later on her answer if as he suspected she was a highborn european then she was also a christian yet the loss of memory had left her free of both her religion and its ethics if he could introduce her to the physical delights of lovemaking and make it pleasant for her he could make her the most famous courtesan since aspasia it was a magnificent challenge and one he was looking forward to with great enthusiasm that evening when khalid el bey had finished his meal he dis missed bis laves and giving orders to his majordomo regarding his bed partner of the evening welcomed the woman who oversaw his most famous brothel when yasmin sat opposite him he marveled at her beauty he knew she was close to forty still she was a circassian and they were famed as the most beautiful slaves in the world he had purchased her over twenty years before from a breed ing farm she had been the first of his special women thanks to her he had been able to place his business above his competitors brothels in algiers for the most part had been confined to the waterfront and served sailors of all nations the wealthy residents of the city had private harems and needed no such services but the flesh peddlers of the city had overlooked one important market algiers being the chief city on the north african coast entertained many wealthy visitors these had no women available to them khalid el bey was the fust to meet that need and he became famous doing so the women in his house of felicity were the most beautiful the most skilled and the most entertaining in all of algiers there were no two alike for khalid el bey especially prided himself on offering variety though others had tried to imitate him they had all failed miserably leaving him with the undisputed title of the whore master not only did he own the house of felicity he now also possessed full or part interest in almost every house of prostitution in the city he was admired and respected by the other businessmen for though very shrewd he was scrupulously honest still few men really knew the man and his origins were a mystery though many thought him a moor he was actually spanish he had been born diego indio goya del fuentes near the city of granada the second son of an old and noble family he was well educated for his time and might have gone on to marry and lead the circumspect life of a sixteenthcentury spanish nobleman then fate in the guise of a beautiful moorish girl named noor had intervened in the young mans life they had been desperately in love but noor had been as firm in her faith islam as any devout christian was in his diego goya del fuentes had long been betrothed now his sisters took malicious delight in teasing his fiancee about noor the fiancee a prim religious girl felt it her moral duty to inform the inquisition of the existence of the moorish maiden on the day that noor was burned at the stake as a heretic diego stood helpless on the edge of the city square his hooded face wet with tears watching as the gentlest kindest person he had ever known was burned to death she was tortured cruelly yet as the flames licked her graceful body her sweet voice lifted in a song of praise to her god allah that day diego goya del fuentes disappeared from spain forever he wandered for several years through europe and the middle east finally settling in the city of algiers he changed his name to khalid the title el bey being his by virtue of a journey to the holy cities of mecca and medina he converted to islam in honor of noors memory though he felt no strong religious leaning his feelings for women were ambiguous on one hand he re membered his lost love and her gentle sweet ways on the other he recalled his sisters malice and the cruelty and ignorance of his fiancee perhaps this explained why though he enslaved women into the profession of prostitution he was a kind and good master skye had touched him as no woman had since noor her help lessness appealed to him and this was why he now carefully in structed yasmin about her care but yasmin argued why do you fuss so over this one girl my lord she is like a thousand others the circassian voice was spiteful and khalid el bey hid a smile yasmin had been in love with him for years but he felt no more for her than he had for the others no woman had claimed his heart since noor skye is like a child now he explained patiently although she recalls some things her loss of memory has wiped out all carnal knowledge she knows nothing and has no prejudices if we handle her carefully we may mold her as we desire he cleverly empha sized the we and yasmin leaned forward eagerly this would really please you my lord yes yasmin it would skye is not simply a pretty face or body i sense a good mind behind those lovely blue eyes and that is what her specialty shall be like the courtesans of ancient athens skye shall entertain the gentlemen with a skilled body and with her in telligence as well she will not be used for those of our clientele whose tastes run to the bizarre but rather for elegant men men of culturesuch as the ottoman commandant of the casbah or perhaps the sea captains who come to us from the italian states france or england together yasmin you and i will make skye an intriguing exciting muchsoughtafter woman i will do my part my lord khalid i will teach her all i know even certain things i have kept from the others skye shall be unique and she shall be perfection he smiled his wonderful smile at her you have always exceeded my faith in you since the very beginning yasmin thank you he twice clapped his hands sharply then sent the answering slave for coffee turning back to the woman he asked the women now in the house of felicity are satisfactory except two the english girl sweet rose has fallen in love with one of her gentlemen and consequently is balking at her job with your permission i can correct that for the gentleman involved wants to buy her and add her to his harem sell but accept only the highest price for her after all were losing a good investment what of the other girl the gypsy rhia is not adjusting my lord i think i must rec ommend severe punishment in her case why i sent her along with two other girls to a party of half a dozen young turkish officers they had requested they be allowed to play the rape game we assigned them to the suite of clouds it was arranged that as the girls sat at their leisure the turks would break in and ravish them it is a harmless game and the officers involved are regular customers of ours all highly recommended while the other two girls fell in with the spirit of the game shrieking and protesting prettily before yielding rhia screamed in earnest and fought wildly severely scratching two of our guests about the face naturally they subdued her and i am pleased to say that all six of them enjoyed her despite her protests but the other girls of course felt slighted they were angry that she should draw all the attention to herself in such a fashion the officers complained too that afterward she wept as one demented i finally had to remove her from their presence and send in another girl has she ever before partaken of this sort of fantasy yasmin no she was of course half wild when she came to us but shes been treated well and has done very well with the gentlemen individually i believed her ready for this sort of thing what is her specialty oral gratification my lord and i understand she is quite good at it khalid el bey thought a moment she was probably raped some time in her life the fantasy in which you placed her brought back the memory and hence her terror do not put her in such a situation again let her do what she is good at you are too soft my lord rhia offended our guests when they ask what shall i tell them has been done do not wait for them to ask send a message to the two who were scratched that the matter has been taken care of and offer them each an evening of pleasure at our expense it shall be as my lord has said answered yasmin khalid el bey rose from the cushions and helped the circassian to rise you must return now i know he said quietly gently dismissing her you will come tomorrow and begin your instruction of skye as my lord commands she said bowing out of the room he almost sighed his relief she was beautiful and loyal but of late she had become clinging and presumptuous of their long as sociation he wasnt quite sure what he would do about her to free her would only give her ideas above her situation for she was a slave born of slave parents he smiled thinking back to those many years ago when he had gone to a circassian breeding farm with an egyptian friend his friend was a slave merchant in alexandria a connoisseur of beautiful young men and women who preferred buying directly from the breeder so he might have the best selection the owners of the farm had paraded before their valued customer and his guest a variety of exquisite virgins and youths yasmin had been among them and khalids friend remarked on her saying that they had shown her to him in his two previous visits alas sighed their host she is lovelier than an april morning but i cannot seem to sell her i have just about decided to breed her with our best stud what are her bloodlines asked khalids friend pythias out of iris came the reply whew exclaimed the alexandrian admiringly khalid el bey had no idea what they were talking about but there was something touching about the little slave girl what is her age he asked fifteen came the reply a bit old is she a virgin sir the farm owner was indignant khalid el bey laughed i will take her my friend i simply wish to know what it is i am buying an outrageous price was named which khalid el bey scoffed at reminding the slave breeder of the girls age and the possibility of her being barren if he bred her rather than sold her they haggled back and forth until finally a price was agreed upon that suited khalid el bey but according to the merchant impoverished him the money was exchanged and khalid el bey found himself the owner of a beautiful circassian slave girl with long blond hair and nile green eyes when they returned to alexandria he set about introducing her to the joys of physical love she had been taught its many arts but had never used them she knew the human body and its sensitive areas well her skillful fingers could bring an impotent man to a firm and longlasting erection she could sing while accompanying herself on the lute she danced well and after several weeks in khalid el beys bed she found that she performed very well there too then one night khalid el bey had several guests in for the eve ning and when the meal was done she danced for the company afterward he sent her to her room telling her that perhaps one or two of his guests might visit her and if they did she was to please them for that would please him in fact four of khalid el beys guests came to her spacious quarters that night and with each she was soft and charming and skilled they left singing her praises and khalid el bey rewarded his slave girl with a strand of coral beads the next night and the night after and almost every other night after that yasmin pleasured her masters friends then another girl alyia joined their household where yasmin was fair alyia had skin like a dusky rose thick and waving hair the color of a ravens wing enormous brown eyes and a pouting red mouth to yasmins fury alyia shared their masters bed for several weeks but then she too joined the circassian in entertaining khalid el beys friends several months later khalid el bey left his two women in the hands of his friend the slave merchant he made a quick trip and returned several weeks later with two more girls he moved them all to the city of algiers they were installed in a small beautifully appointed house and every night khalid el beys women entertained a variety of guests ranging from wealthy visitors to turkish officers of the imperial ottoman army who were stationed in algiers within a year khalid el bey owned twenty beautiful women and a larger house at the end of two years he owned fifty beautiful women who lived in two houses and he had begun the construction of his present villa when the third year drew to a close the villa was finished and khalid el bey was the undisputed whoremaster of algiers two things were constant yasmin remained the head of khalid el beys women gradually becoming less of a courtesan and more of an administrator and manager and there was not a girl who entered khalid el beys service who was not first tried by him it gave each of them a close touch with their master for during the time they served him per sonally he loved and cherished them he had never used force to bend a women to his will consequently his women all adored him with skye he saw his greatest challenge with the proper training she could become the finest whore hed ever owned unlike the others who all cherished the secret dream of being bought and married by one of their customers skye would have no such hopes as she had no knowledge of marriage and if as he hoped she proved totally uninhibited she could be taught some more exotic forms of lovemaking that would command a very high price the more he thought of her the more curious he became many times he had observed her secretly in the bath and in her bedchamber her figure was as lovely as her coloring but it was her skin that intrigued him it was flawless utterly flawless smooth beautiful skin the color of rich cream or was it old ivory silk he longed to touch it with his sensitive fingers his lips would it be soft yes undoubtedly it would be soft would it be soft and warm beneath his mouth or would it be cool and smooth he shivered in antici pation although he enjoyed his women it had been a long time since he had actually looked forward to one and it would be several weeks until he could even consider sampling skyes charms he sighed and went to his bedchamber perhaps the little houri who was to be his partner tonight could ease some of his longings at midmorning on the following day yasmin began skyes les sons in love she looked with dislike on the young woman she intuitively knew to be the most serious rival she had ever had for khalids affections still she reasoned the sooner skye was taught what she needed to know the sooner shed be out of khalids villa and skye must be taught well for then khalid would be pleased disrobe for me commanded yasmin and when skye quickly complied her caftan dropping to the floor yasmin scolded no no you show all the sensuousness of a donkey let me show you and her fingers undid the frog closings on her pink caftan as grace fully as if shed been playing a musical instrument turning she gently shrugged the garment from her shoulders exposing her smooth fair skin slowly slowly she allowed the garment to slide downward revealing the line of her back her plump round buttocks her legs then she turned to face skye her breasts were big but firm sliding to her knees her head bent to touch the floor and she murmured huskily as my lord commands then suddenly yasmin stood up briskly and said matteroffactly that is how to disrobe properly you try it quietly skye picked up her robe and dressed then imitating exactly and with equal skill yasmins movements she removed the caftan again sinking to the floor at last her dark head bowed her soft voice clear and sweet she said is that what you want yes came the terse reply it is fortunate you learn quickly we will now discuss perfumes sit down no dont bother dressing i must show you the proper places to anoint yourself a womans body is a work of art but in order to remain a masterpiece you must work at it constantly she reached into the basket by her side and then handed skye some green leaves mint chew them your breath should always be fragrant and your teeth clean all of our women are perfection that is what makes them famous and justly so we are not common street trulls to be had for a few sequins yasmin carefully laid out several bottles on the carpet musk ambergris attar of roses all of our perfumes have one of these as a base she uncorked them and held each out so skye might smell which do you prefer the roses good i would have chosen that one for you myself though my lord khalid tells me that you are not a virgin there is an air of innocence about you that we will concentrate upon it appeals to many men i will use the attar of roses to demonstrate she stood up and taking the stopper between her thumb and forefinger stroked it generously between the deep valley of her breasts carefully lifting each of the heavy globes she perfumed beneath them next the stopper touched the base of her throat the back of her neck the soft spots behind her ears then came her wrists beneath her arms and in the blueveined hollows of her inner arm yasmin dipped the stopper again and touched it to her navel the backs of her legs her ankles the arches of her feet and her venus mound you must go lightly here she explained for men sometimes enjoy the sweet taste of a woman and that should not be overwhelmed by another scent skye appeared puzzled and yasmin gazed at her enviously you really dont remember do you she said allah how i envy you it will be like the first time again for you but without the pain of virginity then catching herself she handed skye the attar of roses and said brusquely let me see you do it now carefully skye imitated her teacher and when she had finished she looked expectantly toward yasmin you have forgotten one area said yasmin taking the bottle stopper from her student cupping one of skyes breasts she dotted the scent beneath it dont to the older womans surprise skyes face was drained of color her body stiff her eyes held horror yasmin was genuinely fright ened what is it skye are you all right slowly the fear drained from the younger womans eyes and she said bewildered i dont believe i like being touched by another woman what do you remember skye nothing i remember nothing but when you touched me she shivered with genuine revulsion yasmin was concerned what if skye didnt like being touched by men either she could hardly be a successful whore then and khalid el beys investment would be lost normally yasmin would not have introduced the subject of male anatomy until a later lesson but she felt she must know before she went any further if the girl was emotionally unstable she should be disposed of now yasmin clapped her hands and said to the answering slave girl fetch my new eunuch ali then turning to skye she said there are two ways to geld a male if it is done when they are young all is removed but the mortality rate is high the other way is to remove the males seed sac but leave the rod we buy only that kind of eunuch for they are betternatured they are also invaluable in teaching our girls the things they must learn about a mans body ah ali come in come in skye this is ali is he not beautiful the young man flushed skye let her eyes slide over him he was indeed goodlooking tall with softly golden skin dark curly hair and liquid brown eyes he is gorgeous yasmin you are indeed fortunate yasmin smiled smugly then said sharply to the man ali dis robe she looked quickly to see the effect this would have on skye would she faint was she fearful the eunuch undid his long robe and removing it laid it carefully on a chair then he stood straight awaiting further instruction yasmin glanced toward skye what do you think of him the younger woman looked puzzled as i have said yasmin he is gorgeous his nakedness does not offend you or frighten you no should it no but some women are fearful nonetheless now skye i want you to go to ali put your arms about him and press your body to his skye did as yasmin commanded sliding her arms around the eunuchs neck rubbing instinctively in a very provocative way against the young mans soft body he shuddered nuzzled her ear squeezed one of her buttocks then cupped a breast in his hand her eyes grew dark with desire and she swayed slightly mistress alis voice was pleading and yasmin laughed she had learned what she needed to know skye might dislike a womans touch but she enjoyed a mans the lessons could continue without giving ali another thought she dismissed him he fled gathering his robe what a funny creature skye observed didnt he like me yasmin laughed again he liked you very much and had you been alone he might have made love to you i will allow him to do so when you have more knowledge we use these young eunuchs for that purpose as we can hardly practice technique on our gentlemen she looked candidly at skye youre a good student but that is all we will do today i will come tomorrow at the same time after yasmin had dressed and gone skye sat quietly for a few minutes then her hands crept upward to cup her own breasts gently she caressed her body and was amazed to see her nipples harden she thought about what it would be like to have a man stroke her and felt a tingling between her legs it was all so pleasurable what other lovely things had her cursed memory wiped away sighing she stretched naked on the cushions and fell asleep that evening khalid el bey sent for skye she was fresh from the baths and had just finished perfuming herself sliding a lightweight wisteriacolored silk caftan over her body she ran barefoot through the short carpeted hallway that separated her room from his apartments how lovely you are he said as she entered the room he noted the sheen of her skin and the way her midnightcolored hair curled in damp tendrils about her face yasmin tells me your lessons went well she feels you have a talent and will progress quickly she is pleased with you and therefore i am pleased her face became radiant i want to please you my lord khalid without you i should be nothing his big hand cupped her chin and his dark eyes looked into her blue ones i do not think so my little lost bird i do not think so then smiling he asked gently what have you learned just perfuming and the proper way to disrobe before a gentle man disrobe for me he commanded sitting crosslegged amid the colorful cushions pretend i am to be your gentleman she stood very still before him her fingers hardly seemed to touch the tiny pearl buttons of her robe before it opened he had not but the barest glimpse of her breasts when she twirled gracefully the silken robe slid with agonizing slowness down the long line of her back and over the perfect twin moons of her buttocks she turned to face him her eyes modestly lowered sinking to the floor she said softly but clearly as my lord commands for a moment he stared at the gleaming dark head that touched his slipper he was amazed not only by her easy skill but by his own reaction to it beneath his brocaded robe he was swollen and aching and he couldnt quite believe it he had always maintained a perfect control over his body she raised her head and their eyes met do i please you my lord she asked innocently very much he murmured huskily dont dont his saner self warned him but he heard himself saying sit next to me skye and when she nestled in the curve of his arm he bent over her and touched her lips they parted easily beneath his and he drew her scented breath into his own mouth his tongue sought for hers found it and they caressed one another with burning softness until he be came aware of her hands seeking his and placing them on her naked body touch me my lord khalid she whispered urgently please please touch me fighting to control himself he allowed his hands to slide over her body he had never felt such a desire in himself for any woman her skin was softer than anything he had ever known and when she moaned with undisguised pleasure he trembled he slipped his own robe off you must not she is unschooled you will ruin everything warned his saner self but his lips slid down the pure pillar of her throat and his hungry mouth captured a taut nipple sucking pas sionately on it until with an angry halfcry of desperation he yielded to his own desires swinging himself over her burning body he impatiently parted her thighs and thrust himself into the welcoming warmth of her she sighed and with a deeply rooted feminine instinct she wrapped herself about him and moved her lush body to match his frantic rhythm her slender fingers slid down his long smooth back knead ing his muscled buttocks until he whimpered with pleasure within her own body she felt a tingling tenseness that built with unbelievable intensity until cresting it burst over her like a giant wave lifting her high and then dashing her down into a swirling darkness skye skye ah my beautiful beloved he murmured against her ear he caressed her gently i did not remember until now how beautiful making love could be she whispered do you remember anything else he questioned hastily no only that i have done before what we just did and that it was good i should not have taken you he said what if i had frightened you you did not frighten me my lord khalid but perhaps i dis pleased you with my lack of skill he laughed weakly no skye you did not displease me it is true you lack the skill of a trained courtesan but this same lack of skills has given me a very pleasurable time must i continue my lessons with yasmin my lord yes your innocence has charm my beloved but there is no harm in your learning our ways you will learn to pleasure your gentlemen in a variety of ways it is your duty as a woman to be knowledgeable in the arts of love and as yasmin teaches you you will show me she lay on her back breathing quietly and evenly he lay on his side so he might gaze down at her his fingers traced a delicate pattern down her breasts and torso shivering she raised her blue eyes to him bending down he kissed her mouth with great tender ness then her eyelids go to sleep skye and sleep in the knowl edge that i will watch over you her eyes closed he again wondered who she was and where she had come from a noblewoman without a doubt but from where her coloring ruled out the far north and he did not believe her to be either spanish or french when she had first regained conscious ness he had spoken to her in french and she had answered him but he knew her accent was not native to france could she be english or one of the celtic races unless she regained her memory they were unlikely ever to know khalid el bey was not sure he wanted to know somehow this beautiful creature had insinuated herself into his heart it had been a long long time since he had felt more than just sexual satisfaction with a woman but with skye he suddenly felt something he had long believed himself immune to that feeling was a longing for a real home and it took a wife and children to make such a home he smiled at his fantasies surely he was getting old for the first sign of age in a man like him was the longing for rest he gazed again at the woman by his side was it possible did he really love her what if he married her and she later regained her memory but that was unlikely she would not regain her memory or so his physician said unless faced with the very thing that had shocked her in the first place still he would not move swiftly he would allow skye to continue her lessons it could do no harm and later he would make a decision about their future he closed his eyes sighed and fell asleep chapter yasmin was shocked you took an unskilled woman to your bed what on earth possessed you my lord khalid he turned on her you presume on our long association yasmin skye belongs to me and i will do with her as i choose i do not need your approval i only meant you are an insolent slave he said cuttingly i have rarely found it necessary to use the whip but you tempt me now yasmin you tempt me greatly she had gone very white flinging herself to the floor she im plored his forgiveness get up came the cold reply you will continue skyes lessons yasmin and if i should ever hear of your mistreating her in any way i will sell you go now the circassian scrambled to her feet and fled the room her heart was thundering in all their years together he had never spoken to her that way yasmin was deeply frightened was he in love allah forbid the worm of jealousy gnawed at her heart and yasmin began to hate the woman called skye with an impotent fury she dared not act openly against her yet but once khalid sent skye into the house of felicity she would be at yasmins mercy yasmin thought with pleasure of a syrian merchant who visited them twice yearly and whose delight was in watching two women perform before he took them both knowing skyes revulsion at another womans touch yasmin intended to punish her by forcing her to participate in such a show for now however yasmin would bide her time she smiled at skye as she entered her room and bid her good day today she said we will review yesterdays lessons and go on to the study of anatomy both male and female skye nodded annoyed by her poise yasmin sought to shock her tomorrow i will bring a girl from the house of felicity with me and she and ali will begin to demonstrate to you the various positions of love she stared hard at the younger woman that should be very interesting replied skye with infuriating calm i would learn quickly and well so i may please my lord khalid yasmin had to bite her lip to keep from shrieking skyes lack of emotion was totally unnerving would she be one of those cold creatures who felt nothing at the height of passion if that was the case then she would have to be taught to simulate emotion for nothing frustrated or angered a man more than an unresponsive female yasmin realized that it might be harder to train skye than she had previously thought but train her she would and when she was through skye would be the most magnificent creature ever to grace the house of felicity then khalid would realize yasmins great value to him and finally make her his first wife she had waited so long for an opportunity like this doing his bidding unquestioningly all these years seeing to his interests catching herself she ceased daydreaming called for her eunuch ali and threw off her silken robe a thorough knowledge of both the male and female body is essential skye said the naked yasmin with smallbreasted women such as yourself the breasts are usually very sensitive and most women are highly sensitive on the little button that lies hidden beneath the venus mound demonstrate ali yasmin lay among the pillows the young eunuch propped on his side next to her fascinated skye watched as he caressed the soft globes of yasmins breasts using both his hands and his mouth he worked slowly and as yasmins breasts became harder and firmer a small moan escaped her ali shot skye a small triumphant smile which his partner missed one hand moved lower to yasmins venus mound a finger probed delicately rubbing gently and another soft cry escaped the writhing woman ali bent his head to touch with his tongue where his finger had lately been the woman beneath him cried aloud her passion and suddenly skye closed her eyes and shuddered in her minds eye she saw a blond man and a blond woman intertwined together on a bed it was evil her mind strained to remember but she could not quite do so and then a shriek of pleasure from yasmin brought her back to the scene before her the older woman lay panting her lush body covered with a fine sheen of perspiration the eunuch lay on his back his eyes closed gradually yasmin regained her composure finally she spoke you have now seen one way in which a womans body can give pleasure and be pleasured though of course it is more important that you give pleasure i will demonstrate mat shortly but first i want ali to caress you as he has just caressed me it is necessary that i see how you react in such a situation exchange places with me for the second time skye felt uncomfortable when khalid el bey had made love to her the other night it had been right but she didnt want the sly ali with his obviously knowing hands and mouth touching her and with sudden defiance she said so startled at first yasrhin was speechless but she quickly regained her voice i did not ask you whether you wished to do this thing i have commanded you to obey me how dare you even contemplate dis obeying me our lord khalid has put you in my charge and if you disobey me i shall have you beaten you do not dare to mark me shot back skye you are a slave as i am and my lord khalid would punish you greatly should you destroy my value yasmin smiled nastily it will not destroy your beauty should i have ali beat the soles of your feet the bastinado is an extremely painful but effective punishment for fractious slaves skye paled but said evenly i will not allow that creature of yours to touch me and if you hurt me i shall tell my lord khalid of your cruelty what cruelty do you speak of my lovely skye khalid el bey stood in the door a moment before entering it with inborn instinct skye flung herself into his arms i wont do it my lord please dont make me please his eyes softened his arms tightened pro tectively about her and he dropped a kiss on the top of her dark head yasmin made an exasperated noise you tell me to train her in the arts of love and when she will not obey me you condone it i will not allow ali to touch me in that way i cannot gauge your sensuality if i cannot see it khalid el bey hid a smile and said to skye will you allow me to caress you so yasmin may learn what she needs to know yes it was said softly without another word he slid her caftan from her body and drew her down amid the cushions his hands were incredibly gentle as they cupped and caressed her sweetly rounded little breasts and she sighed with delight as he teasingly skimmed the soft smooth skin with his skilled fingers a warm hand fondled her belly and slid downward to touch that most sensitive of spots she cried out her pleasure and his mouth quickly covered hers in a burning kiss as the pleasure faded slowly away she opened her eyes to find him staring down at her a strangely tender expression lighting his amber eyes then he turned his head and she was struck by the hawklike beauty of his profile do you know now what you must yasmin the older woman was very still her green eyes huge and almost black in her pale face she responds well to a mans touch does she not yasmin to your touch my lord khalid came the reply from this moment on yasmin you will not force skye to any thing she chooses not to do you will teach her all you know and she will practice her skills on me alone only i will correct or chastise her do you understand yes my lord the woman shot skye a look of pure hatred then that will be all for today yasmin and ali were dismissed khalid stood up and holding out his hand to skye said dress yourself my sweet in the garden there is a rose called loves delight that has just come into bloom today i would show it to you they were alone skye drew on her caftan slowly she slipped on her sandals his deep voice cut the silence surrounding them what was it about your lessons today that disturbed you my skye when i saw ali making love to yasmin she said i became uncomfortable my lord it was as if i had seen something like that before and it was evil yet i could not really remember it frightened me the eunuch despite his state was so sure of his power over yasmin he smiled at me in such an arrogant way and i knew then that i could not bear it if he touched me have i displeased you my lord khalid he put an arm about her no skye you have not displeased me whatever you may have been in your former life you were certainly not a wanton and that pleases me i think perhaps that i shall have to change my plans for you come now and see the roses you will not send me away her voice was frightened no he held her by the shoulders and looked down into her upturned face i shall not send you away my little lost love and again she was puzzled by the tender look in his eyes alone in the night khalid el bey paced the rooftop terrace of his house the sky above was black silk relieved only by the crystal blue stars the air was still yet it was perfumed by the sweet scent of nightblooming nicotiana it had become obvious to him that he couldnt make skye a courtesan though her memory was buried a strong moral sense remained he would send a note to yasmin tomorrow morning stopping skyes lessons whatever he felt she needed to learn he would teach her himself he had to admit to himself now that he was in love with skye her revulsion toward ali today was only a part of it the truth was that khalid el bey did not want her in the house of felicity pleasuring a different lover every night he wanted her in his own house loving him and bearing his children yes he loved her enough to honor her by making her his wife he felt like a boy again and for the first time since his love for noor he felt hope perhaps he thought wryly there was a god in the heavens after all at peace with himself he descended the steps to his own quarters to his surprise skye was asleep on the cushions by his couch for a brief moment he watched her then he bent and dropped a kiss on her cheek she stirred opened her magnificent sapphire eyes and sat up i am afraid she said in a rush i have angered you and if you send me away she stopped trying to gather her thoughts you are all i have my lord khalid i remember nothing before you and if you send me away i shall die tenderly he gathered her into his arms i have spent many hours alone with the night my sweet skye and i have realized something i have decided that there is only one fate for you she trembled against him and he stroked her reassuringly your fate is to be my wife beloved i will love you care for you and protect you my skye i have never before wanted a wife and it has been many years since i really loved a woman it has been my custom to make love but not give my heart do you understand the difference yes she whispered you enjoyed their bodies but not nec essarily the women themselves he smiled in the semidarkness of the room you are wise my skye now love tell me if you are still afraid no and are you pleased with my plans for your future will you be happy to be my wife yes sweet skye i i love you and i want you to be happy if the thought of marriage to me displeases you you must tell me so for i would not have you be unhappy you do me great honor she said softly but i am not certain i love you my lord surely you deserve a wife who loves you the love will come sweetness i want you safe she raised her face to him then gladly shall i be your wife my lord her blue eyes were shining with trust and even he thought a little happiness i promise to make you happy she told him shyly you already make me happy he told her and then his mouth sought hers tasting and giving the sweet sensual delights she seemed to crave from him his hands caressed the small globes of her breasts and then his tongue was torturing the pink nipples to a peak of excitement circling round and round the sweetly sensitive flesh until her breathing became ragged he lowered her to the cushions and his hands gently spread her thighs tenderly he entered her taking her there on the floor delighting in her sigh of pleasure as his pulsing shaft thrust deep her soft hands began stroking his back sliding slowly down its length to cup and fondle his round buttocks khalid oh my khalid she whispered with a hot little breath against his ear he shivered love me my lord oh love me well my lord she exhorted him and catching his rhythm she moved with him until both of them were lost in the wildly spinning vortex of their shared passion so great was the desire they aroused in each other that skye fainted and khalid to his amazement came close to losing con sciousness himself as his seed thundered into her hidden valley he shook fiercely with the intensity of his passion drained he rolled from her and gathered her into his arms raining kisses on her beau tiful face oh god i adore you i adore you he murmured over and over again and as she slowly climbed from the darkness she heard someones voice worshiping her niall she murmured softly niall khalid stiffened skye sweetness he said gently skye open your eyes and when she obeyed he said who is niall my beloved immediately her eyes became clouded and confused niall she asked puzzled i know no niall he sighed whoever niall was khalid envied him very much skye must have loved niall stillit was he khalid who now possessed her and he would not lose her as mis niall had done sleep my love he said cradling her against his chest and slowly her breathing became even and regular he lay awake most of the night struggling with himself was it possible that she was regaining her memory or was the outcry just a fluke never to be repeated the doctor had said that skye would not find herself again unless faced with the identical situation that had caused her trauma and the chances of that happening were so remote as to be impossible there was no danger of her recovering he would marry her was he not entitled to some happiness he wanted her and he wanted the children of her loins he rose with the first light and left her sleeping in his dayroom his body servant lay sleeping before the door gently khalid nudged him with a slippered foot when the slaves eyes flew open khalid said fetch my secretary immediately i will be in the library stumbling to his feet the slave hurried off drawing his white robe about him khalid el bey went to his library to await the secretary he arrived a few minutes later rubbing the sleep from his eyes i am sorry to bring you from your bed so early jean but there are some urgent matters the secretary nodded sat and took up his pen a french captive jean gave thanks for his monastery ed ucation because it made him useful as a secretary otherwise he would now be in the mines like so many others khalid el bey spoke draw up manumission papers for the slave girl known as skye i want her legally free then draw up a marriage contract between the freedwoman known as skye and myself her brides price shall be this house the estate and twentyfive thousand gold dinars consult the mullah for the exact wording then he continued send for the astrologer osman i wish a consultation today wait before anything you must send a message to the lady yasmin telling her that all lessons are postponed until further notice say nothing else that should get you started i will return later as khalid el bey left jean heard him order a waiting slave see that jean is sent breakfast immediately and the little frenchman marveled that his master was so thoughtful this was not the first time either the beys good manners had won his secretarys loyalty from the very first jean wondered what was in his masters mind he could have any woman without marriage why marriage and yasmin would be very angry but jeans gallic logic was on the side of his lords decision it was time he settled down and had children and besides the lady skye was the fairest woman jean had seen in years khalid el bey returned to his bedchamber skye was gone and he knew she had returned to her own chambers following her there he heard giggles coming from the bathing room and found skye and the pretty twin ethiopian slave girls all splashing about the scented pool he watched for a moment struck by the vivid contrast of their wet bodiesivory and ebony sleek and shining skye saw him first and swimming over to the shallow end of the pool came partway up the steps and held out her hand in invitation she was like a goddess standing there in her nude young beauty and he could feel his desire rising he held his arms out and the two slave girls scrambled from the pool to remove his robe nude his desire became visible to all skyes blue eyes twinkled and throwing him a saucy look she dove back into the pool giving him a delicious view of her sleek flanks leave us he growled to the two girls and dove after skye he was amazed to find what a strong swimmer she was she laughed mischievously at him and dove beneath the water to emerge in midpool his own laughter sounded now where in the name of the seven djins did you learn to swim like that you vixen her bluegreen eyes widened innocently and she shrugged alas my lord khalid i know not are you not afraid to take such a wife to your bosom who knows what else i may know he swam over to her and gently with a restrained passion that she instantly sensed he took her face between his thumb and fore finger his golden amber eyes regarded her gravely i am not afraid to take such a wife to my bosom skye whatever surprises are in store for us will only serve to make our life more piquant i love you my little lost one i love you slim white arms slid up around him her small round breasts pressed against the dark furred mat of his chest as she offered him her lips khalid be sure i would not hurt so good a man you are all i know and i should be lost without you but is that enough for you i can offer only myself and i do not even know very much about who i am what is between us is good skye your lovely body responds well to mine we like each other and more couples than not have started life together with less do not fear my love you do not cheat me it is a good bargain we make between us your concern for me does you credit but now my beautiful one he swept her up in his arms i want to make love to you again she wiggled wet and protesting against him it is morning a most delightful time he agreed laying her on the sun warmed tiles that surrounded the pool he straddled her someone will see us khalid she protested no one would dare to disturb us he growled his staff was hard and seeking against her thighs i want you skye i want your tempting little body i want you hot and sweet and yielding beneath me he whispered against her ear she shivered deliciously as his tongue explored her ear and shivered again as he moved downward along the scented length of her neck biting gently at her silken shoulder skye soon forgot the bright sunshine khalids hands were on her hips stroking and stroking the fires of her passions he suckled at her breasts drawing a cry of pleasure open your legs for me now my love he murmured thats it my darling take me into your fiery sweetness ahh skye your little honeyoven is made for me hold me tightly my love ahhh his words aroused her greatly his hands never stopped loving her body and when his great rod entered into her she felt filled to overflowing with him his body movement was strong and rhythmic each stroke bringing her nearer and nearer to sweet oblivion she climbed higher and higher then she was caught in a jeweled whirl pool and she heard a long soft womans cry mingled with a great masculine sob her next conscious thought was that the sun was hot on her face and she heard water lapping against the tiled sides of the pool she opened her eyes and looked about he lay on his back eyes closed but his voice brought a furious blush to her cheeks you were made to pleasure a man he said and i am grateful that that man is me after we have breakfast i shall see osman the astrologer and he will tell me what day this week is most favorable for our marriage i am having jean draw up papers freeing you skye she pressed herself into the curve of his arm oh my khalid you are so kind to me i swear i shall make you a good wife he smiled and caressed her i know you will my love he answered her they breakfasted on yogurt green figs and boilinghot turkish coffee afterward skye returned to her own apartments and khalid el bey welcomed osman who greeted him by saying so my old friend you have finally fallen in love again khalid laughed i have no secrets from you do i osman the stars tell me all my lord and they tell me some things about your love that you might be interested in knowing she comes from a green and misty land to the north a land peopled by strong spirits and great psychic forces she was born beneath the sign of the ram which like all fire signs is a strong and passionate one khalid el bey leaned forward eagerly how can you know all this osman because my lord such a woman has recently appeared in your own chart i want to marry her i cannot stop you my lord you do not sound enthusiastic osman what is it you are not telling me she will not remain with you khalid it is not her fate her fate is back among her own people and so it is written in the stars there are many men in her life but she will always steer her own course rule her own destiny one man in particular stands out in her life their paths have crossed before and will most assuredly cross again it is with this man that she shares her soul my friend not with you can you not just enjoy her while she is with you why must it be marriage he was shaken the astrologer had always been accurate will it make any difference if i marry her no my lord it will not then i shall marry her for i love her above all women and would place her above all women and when she leaves you will you let her go she will not leave me osman she will not leave me because of the children she will give me she is not a woman who would abandon her babes she will give me children wont she i cannot be sure my lord she will be mother to several children but without a comparison of her exact birthday and yours i cannot tell you for certain she will bear me sons he said positively and osman smiled faintly still he was concerned for his friend the woman brought a confusion into khalid el beys chart there was a dark area now that osman could not fathom and it worried him still if his friend insisted on marrying her then at least he would pick the best day he scanned his charts carefully made swift new calculations and finally pronounced saturday at moonrise you will take her as your wife thank you my friend you will come of course and celebrate with us yes i shall come is it to be a large celebration khalid no osman just a halfdozen or so are to be invitedmy banker the head of the merchants guild the mullah the turkish comman dant and my secretary jean what of yasmin i think not yasmin loves you khalid yasmin thinks she loves me osman and therefore she will accept my plans because of her belief in me besides she will have no further contact with skye i cannot allow my wife to associate with a whore osman had to laugh there my friend khalid speaks both the spaniard and the moslem in you he stood up until saturday my lord bey and i wish you luck with yasmin khalid el bey sat pondering for a few moments after osman had left the astrologer was right yasmin would have to be dealt with and the sooner the better rising he called for his horses and in the silent midafternoon heat he rode down to the heart of the city to the house of felicity the building in which this famous brothel was housed was built around a planted courtyard that had a spraying fountain at its center the side of the house facing the streets was white and devoid of windows or any decoration save the doubledoored entry of black ened oak with polished brass studs guarding the doors were two huge black giants in scarlet satin pantaloons with clothofgold sashes turbans and ridiculously turnedup shoes their large bare chests and muscular arms were oiled so that they gleamed in either sun or torchlight they smiled broadly with flashing white teeth as their master rode past them into the courtyard khalid el bey dismounted tossing the reins to a pretty young girl of ten who smiled at him in an adult and provocative fashion both her feet and her budding breasts were bare and she wore only white gauze pantaloons that revealed her round little buttocks a clever innovation he thought for many of his berber clients liked prepubescent girls best of all for a minute he stood and looked about the courtyard with a proprietary air everything was in perfect order he was pleased the brick walks were well swept the shrubs well trimmed the flower beds colorful and fragrant my lord khalid you honor us yasmin swept down the steps to greet him her blackandgold silk caftan billowing an odor of musk was strong about her and he could see her vermiliontinted nipples through the sheer silk her golden hair was plaited with black pearls and behind one ear was a creamy gardenia it contin ually amazed him that she always knew of the arrival of an important guest and was instantly there to greet him my dear yasmin you are as lovely as ever he chuckled in wardly as she bridled with pleasure come i wish to talk with you he led the way to her apartments waiting patiently as she served him coffee and small honeyed almond cakes at length she asked how is skye that is what i have come to discuss with you he answered i have decided she is quite unsuited for this sort of life praise allah you have come to your senses he smiled faintly you do not like skye do you no then you shall not be burdened with her any longer yasmin you have sold her no i am taking her to wife the chief mullah of algiers will join us on saturday evening at moonrise yasmins face crumbled then recovering herself as quickly as she could she laughed weakly you jest my lord gracioushow you startled me ha ha i do not jest he said quietly skye is to be my wife she is a slaver no she is not i have freed her she was never meant to be a slave yasmin and i was you were bom a slave of slave parents of slave ancestors it is your fate i love you does she love you how can she she barely knows you but i know you khalid and i know what pleases you let me and she fell groveling at his feet he looked down at her with genuine pity poor yasmin with all her clever mideastern sexual arts for pleasing a man yes he had enjoyed them once but they had also bored him to death the mideastern mode of loving was debasing to the woman she was taught to please her master who lay there a nonparticipant except for the automatic ejaculation of his seed it was up to the woman to please the responsibility for his pleasure rested with her and if she failed the bastinado awaited how much better he thought the european way where the man was in charge his masculinity ruling and subduing his woman her climax the most marvelous act of submission it delighted the senses and soothed the male pride i love skye he said the decision was mine and you my most beautiful and valued slave have no right to question me what will happen to me she whimpered nothing you will continue your duties as before after a pause he asked would you like your freedom yasmin then i should pay you for the duties you now perform for me yasmin was horrified her very slavery bound her to khalid el bey without it he could cast her off at any time and now he probably would oh no no no my lord i do not want my freedom very well then my dear it shall be as you decree now get up yasmin and see me out he rose taking her arm he raised her up you really are invaluable to me my dear he said in a kindly fashion and though she knew it to be a tossed bone she was somewhat soothed when may i come and wish the lady skye happiness i would prefer you didnt yasmin like any sensible man i would prefer to keep my wife away from my business and you my dear are a part of that business i understand my lord khalid she said smoothly and thought bitterly to herself yes i understand completely you do not want your precious wife associating with a whore and i am a whore they walked out into the sunlit courtyard and the little girl brought khalids horse to him the whoremaster of algiers chucked the child underneath the chin then slipped her a silver piece a nice touch yasmin he complimented her then mounting the prancing animal khalid el bey rode away chapter in the next few days the preparations for khalid el beys wedding were made the few invitations were issued the feast and entertainment were planned and the bridal chamber was decorated since skyes memory loss prevented her from having any religious preference and since she had been a practicing moslem since coming under khalid el beys protection the chief mullah of algiers found no impediment to the marriage on the afternoon of the nuptials six virgins from the house of felicity arrived at khalid el beys estate and were housed in the womens quarters unlike the turks who separated the sexes at a wedding the inhabitants of algiers were less formal although it was not necessary for the bride to be in attendance at the religious ceremony which would be performed at the neighborhood mosque she and other women were invited to the feast for what was a celebration without soft and fragrant femininity the little french secretary jean had been given his freedom in honor of his masters wedding jean had however elected to remain in khalids employ rather than return to his native land he and the other guests were to be gifted with feminine companionship for the evening khalid and skye looked over the girls and decided the pairing i think he said the pretty plump little provencale with the blackcherry eyes will do quite nicely for the mullah he is yet a young man but inclined to be overserious and weighed down by the importance of his position has he no wife to ease his travail no skye he has not although i know he is not a celibate then the choice is an excellent one my lord for should she insinuate herself into his affections she will make him supremely happy i see beneath the youth and sensuality a proper housewife and mother khalid chuckled bravo my skye i see that also and should god will that it be so think how grateful the mullah will be to me when his first son is bom now for the head of the merchants guild and for my banker the delicious blondes each of these gentlemen is well into middle life each has a carping wife and a houseful of greedy brawling children and relatives what is needed here is simple and quite physical maidens whose lightcolored eyes with admiration easily with big soft breasts and feather heads ho have only one desire to please the master skye examined the two girls they were fluffy creatures who would amply fill the bill what of osman and jean she asked the petite creature with the soft hazel eyes and thick chestnut lored hair comes from his own brittany they will be quite a surprise for each other oh khalid how kind of you the girl looks frightened but tan will reassure her nicely and i will be delighted to have a friend the house yes she will be a friend for you i hadnt thought of that let me guess the others khalid the sweetfaced gravelooking girl is for osman yes his eyes were amused then that leaves that rather fiercelooking creature for the turkish commandant god khalid she looks like she could devour a ian is that a wise choice my love there are many things you dont remember about human nature the commandant of the casbah fortress is a regular patron of the house of felicity his taste in women is ah somewhat sophisticated easy conquest bores him he enjoys a woman who fights him the girl i have chosen for him is halfmoorish half berber she is a wild little savage and should delight him greatly now my love see that these maidens are bathed and clothed in time for the feast the next time i see you my sweet skye you will be my wife his golden amber eyes warmed her his mouth brushed hers tenderly and quickly he turned and was gone she sighed he was so good to her and she still worried that she should not be marrying him something deep inside her nagged her yet try as she might she could not understand what it was sometimes in her dreams there was a man always the same man butt she could never see him clearly she could only sense him crying out to her it made no sense sighing she clapped her hands and the slaves came running she gave orders for the six girls to be bathed and perfumed then she went about choosing their garments from the vast wardrobe in the rem quarters for the mullahs goldenskinned darkhaired provengale it would apricot silk pantaloons a goldembroidered sash and a boleronged in little gold beads because of the heat and the lateness of thefeast she could forego the gauze blouses the choice for the two blondes was simple baby pink for both for the breton girl with her chestnut hair and hazel eyes apple green was perfect for the girl chosen for osman a sky blue would set off her darkblond hair lastly she chose flamecolored silks for the turks maiden handing the clothing to the servants she gave orders for their distribution and returned to her own quarters to bathe and change into her own wedding garments at moonrise exactly the chief mullah of algiers performed the simple ceremony uniting khalid el bey in marriage with skye who became known from that moment as skye muna el khalidskye the desired of khalid then the groom and his guests returned to his house through the winding lanternlit streets of the upper city led by dancing cavorting musicians whose reedy pipes and thumping drums pierced the dark velvet of the night the groom wore white silk pantaloons with silveranddeepblue embroidered bands that stopped at the knee his feet were shod in silvercolored leather boots his shirt was also of white silk open at the neck with full sleeves and tight cuffs over which he wore a white vest embroidered in silver and blue it was all topped by a long white satin cape lined in dark blue his dark head was bare his short black beard had been well barbered behind the closed shutters along his route maidens and matrons alike peeped out and sighed with longing the legendary whore master of algiers was a fairytale prince behind khalid el bey walked the turkish commandant of the casbah fortress capitan jamil as tall as the bey he was heavier set and to the spying female eyes that watched as sinisterly handsome as the bey was kindly his face was long as washis nose his eyes were black and unfathomable his mouth thin and cruel below a slim mustache he was known to be cruel even brutal in his handling of fractious prisoners now however he strode along with his host and the other guests chatting amiably i understand your bride is a captive was came the reply i bought her now she is legally free and my wife i had heard you were training her for the house of felicity she must be quite good at whatever she does if you have decided to marry her khalid el bey laughed lightly but he burned inwardly skye has no memory of her past he said at first i thought that to train a women such as she might prove amusing but she is actually far too innocent for such a life i had been considering marrying and siring sons for some time now but what respectable father would allow his daughter to wed the great whoremaster skye is obviously of the upper class wherever she comes from and she is beautiful is that not an ideal choice for my purposes i am eager to meet your bride khalid they had reached the house now and entered through the wide doors into the square hall where the beys majordomo awaited felicitations my lord long life and many sons he cried ushering hem through into the banquet hall waiting slaves took the mens cloaks and brought silverchased basins of rose water and soft linen towels so they might bathe their hands and faces refreshed they at down upon the large plump cushions strewn about the table gentlemen said khalid el bey sitting at the head of the table it gives me great pleasure that you are here to share this moment with me i would share my happiness with you and so i present to each of you for your many nights of pleasure a virgin who has been trained in my own house of felicity he clapped his hands and the six girls all dressed in their butterfly colors entered and moved swiftly to the gentlemen for whom they were intended by allah swore capitan jamil you do things with style khalid even in constantinople i never saw such a display of elegant manners i shall write the sultan tomorrow telling him many thanks said khalid carelessly he was more pleased by he reactions of his other guests the head of the merchants guild and the banker were pleasantly overcome by the two little blondes and jean was rendered momentarily speechless by the pretty girl who shyly greeted him not only in his own tongue but in the dialect peculiar to brittany alone the chief mullah actually had a smile on lis facethe first time khalid had ever seen that phenomenon and osman was obviously quite taken by his maiden capitan jamil paused in his careful inspection of his gift to unquire and your bride khalid where is she as if in answer the banquethall doors opened and four black laves in red silk breechcloths entered bearing a litter they carefully set it down and the majordomo handed out the veiled occupant and ledher forward to sit by the bey her fine silk pantaloons were the soft lavender of early wisteria but low a wide band of deep violet flowers on a gold background rose to just below her navel she wore gold slippers embroidered with pearl violets her sleeveless bodice was violet velvet trimmed in gold braid with floral embroidery done in gold and seed pearls he wore thin gold bracelets a single long rope of pearls dangled from her neck and great matching pearl tears bobbed in her ears her midnightblack hair was loose and spinkled with gold dust a small mauve veil obscured her face below those marvelous eyes shadowed in blue kohl gentlemen my wife the lady skye muna el khalid said khalid bey as he reached up and undid her veil they were momentarily stunned into silence everything about herher flawless skin her dark blue eyes the full red lips the delicate slightly upturned noseeverything was exquisite finally the banker found his voice khalid my friend i have four wives if you put all of their beauty together it would not equal half of your wifes loveliness you are a most damnably fortunate man khalid el bey laughed happily thank you memhet your praise is received with joy now the servants began bringing in steaming dishes the gold goblets were filled with icy juices musicians played discreetly from behind a carved screen a whole baby lamb had been roasted and was served now on a mixture of saffroned rice with onions green peppers and tomatoes there were bowls of yogurt purple green and black olives and shelled pistachio nuts the slaves passed hot loaves of bread and placed upon each guests plate a small whole roasted pigeon in a nest of watercress as the fermented fruit juices began to relax the guests they became a bit noisier and freer the men feeding choice morsels from their lips to the lips of their giggling companions the mullah sat on khalids right skye on her husbands left next to her sat capitan jamil who had been unable to take his eyes off the bride what a pity he murmured softly so that only she might hear him that khalid decided to keep you for himself my lovely he could have made a fortune selling your charms i would have paid a kings ransom to possess you first still it is good to know the great whoremaster of algiers has a weakness a hot flush stole up her neck and cheeks but she said nothing he laughed low you are the most beautiful woman i have ever seen bride of khalid el bey your skin glows like motherofpearl i shall dream for many nights of your long legs and perfect little breasts which are like tender fruits how i hunger to taste of those sweet young fruits he leaned close to her as he reached for a handful of olives and his upper arm deliberately rubbed against her how dare you accost me in such a manner she hissed angrily have you no respect for my husband who is your host or are turks totally without honor he drew his breath in sharply someday my beauty i shall have you completely at my mercy and when i do you will pay dearly for that insult to his annoyance skye did not appear frightened she merely signaled the servants to clear the table and serve the next course the coffeemaker kneeling at his little table began to grind the beans and boil the water the slaves placed upon the board colored crystal bowls filled with figs raisins oranges green grapes candied dates and rose petals silver plates of small honeyed cakes with matching tiny bowls of sugared almonds were put before each guest goblets rere refilled with sweet liquid fruit sherbet chilled by snow brought from the nearby atlas mountains the bey leaned over to kiss his rife you have planned everything perfectly my skye it is as if you had been born to the duties of the chatelaine perhaps i was she answered him softly the entertainment began there were wrestlers then jugglers then an egyptian fakir who made things appear and disappear lastly came the dancers there were at least half a dozen of them to begin nth but in time only one very voluptuous creature remained her senuous body writhing passionately and more suggestively with each moveraent skye became aware of the silence that had overtaken her guests their chatter was gone and the only sound in the room was the musicthe insistent whine of the pipes the heavy beat of the rums the brass tals upon the dancers fingers teasing their challenge the musicians skye glanced about her and saw that some of the redding guests had gone into the garden still others had begun to rake love right there on the cushions blushing she turned to her husband with twinkling eyes he stood and drew her up beside him i believe he said the time is ripe for us to make our escape tome my love where are we to go khalid to a secret little villa that i own along the seacoast we shall send our honeymoon there free of friends and business he hurried her out into the cool night stopping only to retrieve his cloak and place one of mauve silk lined in rabbit fur about her before the house stood a great white stallion khalid el bey leapt onto its back and reaching down lifted his bride and placed her before him on the saddle they rode down into the city and then to the sea where they followed the beach for several miles the moon dappled the water looking up into the velvety heavens skye caught her breath the stars seemed so big so near and she was tempted to reach out and asp a handful nestling in khalids arms her head against his heart she felt its sure and steady beat as they rode she became aware of a familiarity about the roar of the sea and the salty smell the cool damp air for some reason these sensations soothed her though she had no idea why they did khalid was silent and she dared not speak lest she break the spell finally he turned the white stallion from the beach and she could see the black outline of a building on one of the bills overlooking the sea as they came closer skye saw that it was a large round kiosk there was a pleasant air about it large brass lanterns with handblown venetian globes their beeswax candles twinking a welcome hung on either side of the silkdraped entrance khalid el bey drew rein on his horse gently deposited his wife on the lawn and dismounted welcome my beloved welcome to the pearl kiosk there are three rooms withinour bedchamber a bath and a dayroom it belongs to you now skye for it is my wedding gift to you she was astounded his brides price to her had been over generous and now he gifted her with even more she felt quite humble in the light of such great love skye suddenly felt her heart contract painfully looking up at him she said khalid i do care for you you know were you a poor man i should still feel this way for it is your love for me that warms my heart and soothes my spirit not the gifts you give me though i am grateful for them it is for just mat reason that i enjoy giving you things he answered her you are not a greedy little creature come now sweetness let us go in for the night grows cool are you not the least bit curious to see your new gift the doorway of the pearl kiosk was hung with multicolored diaphanous silks and in the entry hall was a long narrow reflecting pool looking up skye caught her breath for in the roof above the pool was a glass ceiling that matched the pool in size and shape therefore the still surface of the pool now appeared to be filled with twinkling stars the foyer was lit by gold and crystal lamps similar to those on the front of the building they first moved through a doorway on their left where skye found a beautiful dayroom with a fireplace that blazed merrily taking the dampness from the air the floor was lush with thick rugs colored glass lamps hung on thin chains from the gilded and beamed ceiling overstuffed furniture and pillows were covered in the finest silks and velvets the colors like jewelsruby sapphire emerald amethyst and topaz the windows that faced the landside were small handblown rounds of paleamber glass there were low tables of inlaid mosaic tile and great brass bowls filled with red and yellow tulips one small wall had a builtin bookcase filled with leather bound volumes the sight of which brought a glad cry to her lips so chuckled khalid el bey my good secretary jean was not wrong you can read in what languages my beloved she looked a trifle shamefaced jean seemed so horrified that i could read that i did not wish you to know i wandered into your library one day and seeing the books i picked one up and opened it it was french i find that i am also able to read spanish italian latin and the language jean calls english she hung her head and said hesitantly i appear to possess another rather unfeminine trait it seems i also write khalid el bey burst into laughter marvelous my skye simply marvelous it seems that you are a very intelligent woman and while most men might be shocked to find themselves with such a wife i am not the ways of allah are indeed mysterious i originally intended to make you my most famous whore but now i find you are educated so beloved i shall instead make you my partner when we return to the city i shall teach you myself and jean will aid me should anything ever happen to me no one will ever be able to cheat you he swept her into his arms and kissed her soundly what a delight you are skye he chuckled and she felt warm and safe and very much loved his ambergold eyes twinkled we have yet to see our nuptial chamber he murmured carrying her from the richly appointed dayroom across the foyer he pushed open the carved and gilded double doors the room into which they now entered had walls painted to resemble an oasis with graceful palms the mysterious desert dunes beyond and above on the ceiling the wonderful black velvet north african sky had been recreated complete with twinkling stars done in gold luminescent paint skye would discover that in the sunlight the false night sky was actually bright blue and that the stars were not visible at all to continue the illusion the rugs were of thick gold and cream wool large potted green palms were placed stra tegically around the room and the bed was partially draped to re semble a tent canopy the room was very softly lit by tall lamps that resembled lotus flowers and burned scented oils without a word he slid the sleeveless violet bodice from her then his hands pushed the pantaloons over her hips and when she had stepped from mem and pushed the little mass of silk away with her foot he slid to his knees she stood still while his elegant hands fondled her breasts then moving to grasp her by the waist he covered her torso in hot kisses she caught at his head and pressed it against her wildly fluttering belly the time for words was long past for a moment he simply knelt there enjoying the silken feel of her wonderful skin then swiftly standing he stripped off his own clothes and they walked to the bed it was the beginning of an incredible week skye had never been loved so tenderly so passionately so expertly so completely there was not a part of her he did not explore and worship and he en couraged her to do the same with his body gradually she lost her shyness became bold and caressed him in subtle ways that left him moaning they made love in the early hours of the dawn in the heat of the afternoon in the dark of night they swam naked in the foaming azure sea they hunted antelope from horseback with their hunting cats beautifully trained panthers loping by their sides another discovery had been made by thenskye could ride astride quite expertly once again he gifted her this time with an exquisite golden arab mare in the time they spent at the pearl kiosk they were provided for and waited on by an army of invisible servants who saw to every need delicious meals magically appeared as did fresh clothes when they desired to hunt their horses and cats awaited them at the kiosk front hot scented baths were ready upon their return every thing was done to make this time together perfect on the night before their return she lay half awake exhausted by their lovemaking content to listen to khalids even breathing sud denly she was aware that she had never been so happy he surrounded her with love security everything she could want why was it then that she could still not give him her heart they rode back into the city of algiers on the following morning they were dressed identically in white the sleek black panthers were by their sides leashed but nonetheless causing a stir as they moved through the crowded streets of the lower city that same day when they had resettled themselves khalid el bey took his wife into the library where jean sat working ho jean i bring you a pupil the little frenchman looked up with a smile welcome home my lord khalid welcome home my lady skye who is to be my pupil and in what i want you to teach the lady skye the intricacies of my business should something ever happen to me she would be helpless without a thorough knowledge of it since she can already read write and speak in four languages it should not prove difficult as long as she can grasp simple mathematics what are mathematics asked skye here mistress jean wrote a simple sum on a parchment if you take one hundred dinars and add to them another fifty dinars you have one hundred and fifty dinars replied skye and by the same token if you have one hundred and fifty dinars and take or subtract from them seventyfive dinars you will have remaining seventy five the two men looked at each other in complete surprise and skye said is that not correct khalid have i made an error no my skye you have not made an error you are quick and quite correct is she not jean indeed my lord indeed the bey laughed i think i leave you in good hands my love do not be too hard on my good jean for he is invaluable to me khalid walked from the room laughing softly to himself skye seated herself demurely at the library table looked expec tantly at jean who was suddenly a little fearful that he had that rarest of creatures on his handsan intelligent woman drawing a deep breath he plunged into the business at hand for the next few weeks skye spent most of her days with khalid and jean closeted in the library and she suddenly understood the true nature of her husbands business she was shocked for a while then realizing that khalid had not invented prostitution she ac cepted it she quickly understood that each house khalid owned had to be treated as a separate entity those located on the waterfront serving sailors of all nations were provisioned far differently from the house of felicity the waterfront brothels served only beer but in the house of felicity and its two sister houses the menu was quite varied even the women varied with the different establishments on the waterfront pretty but sturdy peasant girls were the choice girls who might easily service two dozen men a day without ill effect young women bought for khalids more elegant brothels were all beauties carefully schooled in proper arabic and french so they might converse well they were also taught good manners hygiene and elegant ways of dressing their sexual skills were excellent the men who bought their company bought it for an entire evening all of khalid el beys waterfront brothels worked their women five days a week and allowed them rest for two days this neces sitated keeping records on who was working and who was not each of these women received a hundredth portion of the fee collected for her services each night and at the end of five years was given her freedom and the monies accrued most married and settled down some however took to the streets and were quickly lost others hired themselves out to lesser brothels and quickly found themselves overworked and diseaseridden most brothel keepers were not as careful with their women as khalid el bey who kept two moorish doctors on his staff and had his women checked weekly for the pox all of this meant voluminous records and skye found herself becoming very interested in her husbands business dealings his brothels involved not only the care and wellbeing of people and property but the provisioning of those people and the upkeep of the oroperty problems were tripled in the more elegant brothels for the women here had to be exquisitely clothed and jeweled they needed oil baths and wore only the finest perfumes but despite his vast outlay khalid el bey was a rich man profits far exceeded expenses and these profits had to be invested this was the thing that interested skye the most the investment of her husbands funds some of the money was placed with a goldsmith judah ben simon some of it had been put into portable wealth such as loose gem stones the rest was invested with the adventure ships belonging to an englishman called robert small it was shortly after their return from the pearl kiosk that skye met this bluff sea captain one night as she and khalid sat listening to love songs sung by a sweetvoiced slave girl an uproar ensued from the courtyard of the house her husband leaped to his feet laughing and skye could hear a booming voice saying now laddie your master may be alayingwith one qf his fancy pieces but believe me hell stop to see me out of my way damme khalid you old moor where are you the door to the chamber flew open and a tinylegged man strode into the room he was a most fantastic sight his colorful clothes included puffed and slashed red velvet breeches black silk stockings a red velvet doublet embroidered in gold and silver thread a long cape and a flat hat with an egret plume on a tall man the clothing might not have been so fantastic but robert small stood only five feet tall powerfully built he had sandybrown hair and his eyes were a snapping blue his round weathered face was mischievous and kindly while also being the homeliest skye had ever seen the little man was as freckled as a thrushs egg ha there you be khalid and as usual youve got some rare beauty by your side robbie youre a wicked old man and so ive no compunction in springing this surprise on you the rare beauty is my wife god assoil my soul khalid el bey true the bey nodded and the englishman bowed low to skye my humblest apologies madam i hope youll not think ill of me then realizing hed spoken english he said khalid i know not what language your lady speaks youll tell her for me there is no need sir said skye sweetly i fully comprehend you and am not in the least offended its quite natural you should think me a whore considering the nature of my husbands business now however you will excuse me for i imagine youve much to talk about with my lord she rose gracefully and smiling mis chievously left the room the little englishman chuckled how he asked did a renegade spaniardtumedarab end up with an irish wife irish skye is irish god almighty man didnt she tell you she doesnt know my old friend several months ago i bought myself a rather bedraggled and frightened waif from a corsair captain he had gotten her from an outbound captain who claimed to have captured her in a skirmish he knew nothing of her history when skye regained her full senses she had no memory excepting her name and so you married her lord man youre a romantic at heart wrong khalid el bey poured the englishman a tiny cup of sweet turkish coffee i had intended to make her the finest and most expensive whore the world had ever seen robert small sucked his breath in sharply did you indeed laddie and pray tell what stopped you i fell in love with her my friend not with just her face and luscious body but with the woman i began to see emerging she is without guile and generous as well she is also the least greedy female i have ever known and when she looks at me with those marvelous blue eyes of hers i am lost robbie very soon the thought of anyone other than myself touching her enraged me i found that i wanted children and a loving wife like a normal man god help you then my friend for you have a weakness now and your enemies will use it against you as long as the great whoremaster of algiers showed no vulnerability he was inviolable dont fret robbie i have no enemies even my women respect me dont be a fool khalid it was said sharply all wealthy and powerful men have enemies look closely to yourself and to that beauty youve married for a few minutes the two men sat silently sipping their coffee then robert small spoke ive made you richer again khalid the ships we sent to the new world have returned laden with precious metals jewels and furs the ones that traveled south returned with spices slaves and gemstones i have as usual saved the cream of the female slaves for you to see khalid el bey was all business now did we lose any ships or men no ships but three men were lost on the swan off the horn it was a particularly bad storm the captain tells me but he didnt lose one slave good and you robbie how was your voyage the captain chuckled and stretched his short frame out on the pillows his hands behind his head ah khalid i wish youd been with me how often youve warned me of mens greed and the vulnerability that greed brings in and you were right i found us a mine manager in the spanish americas who is a younger son with no hope other than to end his days a rumsoaked wreck his oldest brother their fathers heir married the girl he loved and then ar ranged for him to be sent from spain he burns for vengeance and so he has agreed to help us obtain six shiploads of gold for a per centage and passage back to europe it was a cheap price to pay khalid we filled three ships this trip and ive already sent three other ships and how did this young don cover the theft and how can we be sure hell not betray us the first theft was covered by causing a mine to cave in itll take months to clear it out by which time well have returned for the second load from the other mine it will not matter if the spaniards learn then that they have been robbed for well be all long gone by that time the young don has a halfspanish halfindian mistress he intends to marry and take to paris with him he can live quite well on what we pay him the mines he oversees give up the purest gold ive ever seen khalid the other ships in our fleet have carried back the finest furs imaginable along with basketsful of turquoise coral jade ame thyst emeralds and topaz i have as usual saved a choice selection of furs and gems for you along with some excellent indian pearls and spices from the southern fleet everything else has been disposed of through our regular channels and your monies are already with your banker you are generous robbie and quite thorough as always per haps you will allow me to do a little something for you now your ship was sighted by friends of mine this morning and i knew you would be with me by evening go to the house of felicity and you will find a surprise waiting for you the englishman grinned delightedly ah khalid you didnt have to go to any trouble the whoremaster of algiers grinned back shes quite to your liking robbie go along now so i may rejoin my own lady the captain scrambled to his feet if my surprise is that good ill not be seeing you for several days khalid and he was quickly gone khalid el bey stretched his long body in a catlike movement and called skye she appeared immediately from behind a wall hang ing and sat down next to him you heard said her husband yes my lord if this story is true then you are indeed fortunate to have such a partner you can trust robert small with your life my skye he is the most honest man i know he has never cheated me it is simply not in his nature what awaits him at the house of felicity have you found him some petite creature to soothe and comfort him khalid laughed no though robbie is a bit of a man he likes big tall women the maiden awaiting him stands six feet and has breasts like summer melons ive been given to understand that robbies rod is as big as any mans so they will both enjoy them selves they laughed together imagining the little man and his amazon mistress locked in sweet combat then as easily as they had begun to laugh they stopped and she was in his arms again he kissed her until she ached for him his hands slid beneath her sheer paleblue silk caftan his long fingers teasing her nipples until she whimpered look at me skye he commanded softly and she struggled to raise her heavylidded eyes to him you are my wife beloved and i love you now for the first time she looked deep into his warm amber eyes and realized mat she felt deeply toward khalid with this startling realization the heartache that had assailed her continually ever since shed awakened to her new life in algiers seemed to dissolve leaving her feeling as light as a feather she loved this was what love was and she could remember it her eyes filled with happy tears and she said wonderingly oh khalid i love you too i do i know that now and pulling his dark head down to hers she kissed him deeply he feeling her certain unwavering love found his passion bursting into an unquenchable flame beneath his eager touch the silk of her robe tore away and bis hands and mouth began their worshipful adoration of her he loos ened her lovely dark hair and spread it over the apricot velvet pillows then his long fingers gently traced her high cheekbones moving down the fine line of her jaw to capture her small chin tell me again skye he said softly her sapphire eyes caught his ambergold ones and held them unwaveringly i love you my lord khalid she said firmly i love you then she kissed him again her little tongue teasing his mouth he could feel her small round breasts rubbing against his chest and unable to refuse the invitation he lowered his head and nibbled on the hard quivering nipples his tongue pushed into her little navel and she eagerly thrust her torso toward him he moved lower yet his mouth seeking that most secret core tasting her seashelllike fragrance his tongue darted like wildfire over the moist dark pink flesh she whimpered half in agony half in ecstasy her fingers catching at the dark hair of his head as he relentlessly pushed her beyond endurance amazingly she did not shatter into a thousand pieces she soared higher than she had ever done before then with great tenderness he kissed the soft inside of her thighs pulled himself up over her and gently took her skye was frantic with unfulfilled passion she had never known such love as this or had she her mind whirled in confusion but khalids warm body soon overcame that what difference did it make if she had loved before khalid was her husband he loved her and she loved him why should she torture herself with vague flickering memories all that mattered was now skye skye come with me my darling now now she met his ardor with her own soaring as he did afterward as she lay sated she said quietly i want a child khalid he smiled in the darkness this was further proof of her love i shall endeavor my love to give you everything you want especially children suddenly she laughed happily and propping herself up on an elbow looked down into his golden eyes i love you and am loved in return she said whatever has been before in my life can matter little in the light of this love if it were important then surely i should have remembered it all by now i know who i am i am skye the beloved wife of khalid el bey the great whoremaster of algiers chapter niall burke lay weakly back upon the scented linen pillows and focusing his silvery eyes clearly for the first time in weeks gazed out at the distant blue mountains the landscape outside his window was a riot of lush vegetation pink and red hibiscus cloyingly sweet gardenias spicy roses and crisp lav ender were all growing in a wild mass that spread upward from the gardens to the flowering vines that clung to the villa wall it was all so vibrant now totally immersed in the sights and smells the shrieking of the darting parrots niall knew he would live and fervently he wished he were dead the carved oak door of his room opened then admitting a young girl whose big eyes lit up at the sight of him ah senor niall at last you are fully awake i am constanza maria alcudia cuidadela my papa is the governor of this island and you are in his house she put a tray on the nearby table feeling like a fool niall was forced to ask what island is this the girl blushed in pretty pink confusion oh senor forgive me you are on the island of mallorca how did i come to be here you were brought to us from the fleet in which you traveled by a captain macguire he explained you are a great lord niall forced back a small smile is macguire still here senorita constanza si senor niall although the rest of your fleet sailed weeks ago he refused to leave you he said his mistress would not forgive him if he did would you like to see him niall nodded and the girl pulled the embroidered bellpull by his bed fetch the irish captain at once ana she instructed the an swering servant then moved to straighten nialls pillows she wore a rose fragrance which caused a sharp pain to tear through niall constanza poured something from the frosty majollica pitcher into a silver goblet it is the juice of the oranges from our garden she said drink it it will give you strength she gracefully handed the goblet to him then sat and drew a small embroidery frame from a hidden pocket in her gown and began to stitch he drank and was pleasantly surprised by the cool tart sweetness that slid down his parched throat he studied the seated girl over the goblet she was he decided about fifteen and very lovely she was quite petite with a tiny waist and generous breasts her skin was a pale golden shade her hair a darker gold and her eyes were the color of purple pansies he let his eyes wander about the room it was spacious and pleasant with white walls and a red tile floor on one wall was a large dark wood armoire with intricately carved doors and a long walnut table stood before the french doors opposite his silkdraped bed there were two chairs by the table and an embroidered chaise iongue by the bed is the juice good senor niall may i pour you more thank you he answered politely dammit to hell where was macguire as if in answer to his silent summons the door flew open to admit the captain and inis with a joyous bark the dog leaped onto the bed and lay down beside niall his tail thumping happily so lad youve decided to remain among the living praise be to god skye where is she macguire looked most uncomfortable sighing he admitted we dont know where the omalley is my lord when the infidels shot you down our first concern was to get you safely aboard we knew they couldnt outrun us but no sooner had we gotten you back to the ship man a damned rain squall hit and we lost the bastards in a fog bank we were nearer mallorca and so we brought you here the rest went on to algiers but alas sir no trace has been found yet of the omalley for a moment all was silence then niall said fiercely and simply ill find her ill find her and he swung his legs over the edge of the bed trying to rise inis whined constanza alcudia cuidadela rose swiftly and sped to his side no no senor niall you will reopen your wound it is still not totally healed she slipped an arm about his back and gently forced him back to the bed fetch my papa immediately she hissed angrily at the stricken captain ana help me get the senor back into bed she fussed about him like a little mother hen puffing the pillows and smoothing the coverlet and despite his anxiety he was amused by this little creature whose concern for him was so touching for shame senor she scolded ana and i have worked so hard to make you well why do you allow your captain to agitate you if you cannot remain calm then i will not let him in to see you again he realized then that although he was speaking spanish with her he had spoken gaelic with macguire she hadntunderstood he felt suddenly weak but wanted her to understand my betrothed wife was kidnapped when i was injured he said macguire tells me she has not yet been found it was several moments before she spoke you love her very much senor niall yes senorita constanza he replied gently i love her very much then i shall make a novena to the holy virgin that she is found soon the girl said gravely and niall thought again how sweet the child was macguire quickly returned bringing an older gentleman with him the man was of medium height with a short dark tailored beard dark hair and the coldest black eyes niall had ever seen he was dressed richly but soberly his short velvet cape edged in a wide band of deep brown fur lord burke the voice was as cold as the eyes i am the conde francisco cuidadela and i am happy to see you conscious at last captain macguire tells me however that you are agitated about your betrothed it is best that you hear the truth now papa the girls voice was pleading senor niall is not yet strong enough silence constanza how dare you presume to advise me you will come to me after vespers for punishment and then you are to spend the night in the chapel meditating on filial respect and obe dience the girl hung her head beaten yes papa she whispered your betrothed wife is lost to you forever lord burke and the sooner you are able to accept this the better off you will be should she be found you could not possibly want her back if she is alive she has by now been defiled by the infidel and no decent catholic could live with that no be reasonable lord burke captain macguire tells me the lady was a widow without the protection of virginityfor purity brings a very high price among the infidelsshe was probably raped by at least the captain and officers of the ship that kidnapped her if she survived that and was beautiful then rest assured that she was sold into slavery if she is still alive she now graces some pashas bed it is not possible mat you could want a woman like that back even if she could be found under these circumstances the holy church would not hold you to your betrothal the lady is as lost to you as if she were dead and in all likelihood she is dead get out the conde bowed from the waist your grief is understandable lord burke i shall leave you to it you will soon see the wisdom of my words come constanza and he swept from the room his daughter meekly behind him niall burke watched the door close behind the conde and his daughter for a moment the silence hung heavy in the room then he said grimly all right macguire talk im no child to be whee dled and if ive lived this long you can bloody well be sure im going to survive where is the omalley fleet and whats this non sense about skye being lost forever and how the hell long have i been here anyway speak up man or ill tear the tongue from your head youve been ill six weeks my lord jesu swore niall the fleet went directly to algiers and we were able to obtain an immediate audience with the dey he was most sympathetic and sent to every slave merchant in the city offering a kings ransom for the omalleys return or at least information leading to her return it was like hollering down a rabbit hole my lordnot even an echo the dey came to the same conclusion the conde has she never reached algiers alive what other answer is there here his voice broke and he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand in truth macguire was more distressed by something he dared not tell the seriously ill lord burke it seemed that there was one other possibility about the omalleys fate the dey had told him that skye might have reached algiers alive and then been sold pri vately private sale of captives was strictly illegal because it cheated several people including the dey himself of their shares in the purchase price but private sales were managed especially sales of beautiful women macguire reasoned that if this had happened to skye then the dey would not be able to trace her i dont want to believe it my lord but if mistress skye is alive then where is she niall burke was stunned skye dead no not skye not his vibrant skye with her kerryblue eyes and her proud spirit no his shoulders began to shake as the dry sobs took hold and racked him mercilessly stumbling from the bed he lurched across the room through the french doors and out onto the terrace all around him everything throbbed with life and they said his skye was dead clutching the cool marble balustrade he howled his frustration and anger at the unfairness of it all howled and shouted until his voice was so hoarse that he made no sounds at all he felt an arm about him heard a soft voice making soothing sounds he could not comprehend allowed himself to be led back inside where he barely reached the bed before he collapsed uncon scious constanza cuidadela shook her head as she drew the covers over him she felt his forehead the fever is back captain macguire you must sit with him tonight for my father will not excuse me from my punishment i will tell you what to do macguire nodded hes not an easy man your father the girl did not reply she went quietly about her business caring for the unconscious niall smoothing the pillows first she next tucked the sheets about her patient and finally placed the frosted pitcher on the bedside table you can do very little captain except to keep him as quiet and as comfortable as possible ana will bring a basin of scented water shortly and shell come again during the night the vespers bells began to toll and constanza said i must go when the fever breaks change his nightshirt and the sheets ana will help and then she was gone macguire tended niall throughout the night strangely niall was not restless but lay ominously quiet as the burning fever consumed his big body diligently the omalley captain cared for his charge bathing his forehead regularly with the cool scented water gently forcing the sweet juice down his throat during the night the servant woman ana appeared regularly bringing fresh water and juice for the sick man once she brought a tray for macguire with a small cold chicken bread fruit and a carafe of sweet golden wine as she silently placed his tray on the long walnut table macguire asked how is the lass anas black eyes blazed she prays in the chapel for your master senor she said tersely then she left macguire ate hungrily drank half the carafe and returned to nialls bedside toward dawn he dozed in his chair only to be startled awake by a great cry of anguish lord burke sat straight up in the bed his eyes tightly shut the tears pouring down his face he sobbed bitterly skye skye dont leave me beloved come back come back macguire was immobilized for a moment by the terrible anguish then he reached out and shook the weeping man gently my lord my lord its only a bad dream gradually niall quieted and finally he lay back his forehead was cool to the touch relieved macguire struggled to change his sleeping friends damp nightshirt after the first mass of the new day constanza appeared to check on her patient ana was with her constanza praised the worn cap tain you have done well captain macguire go and rest i will tend to senor niall now but you had no rest either lass protested macguire you must sleep hes out of danger now a servant can keep watch he put a fatherly arm about her to lead her toward the door and was shocked when she winced a thin red line began to show through the sleeve of her gown and the captains eyes widened aye snapped ana the conde beat my sweet constanza last night ana the girl was flushed with shame he is my father and it is a fathers duty to chastise an erring child i challenged his authority i was wrong she is a saint my nina the conde enjoys hurting her ana please if you are overheard he will send you away and you are all i have the serving woman compressed her lips tightly sighed and nod ded macguire spoke again has the conde gone to his duties as the islands governor the women nodded then senorita constanza i shall strike a bargain with you i shall keep watch over lord burke until the afternoon siesta while you sleep upon the chaise longue when afternoon comes i shall go to my own rooms ana smiled broadly the captain was muy simpatico to her constanza therefore to ana he was a good man a man to be trusted a few minutes later she left the young girl sleeping comfortably macguire guarding both constanza and niall in the late afternoon when the long mauve shadows were begin ning to form and the midday heat to abate niall burke opened his silvery eyes again he instantly remembered where he was and the circumstances that had brought him here a great burst of sadness washed through him and he sighed deeply how do you feel senor niall he looked to the slim girl like the very devil nina but i seem to be alive so id best get on with this business of living was she very beautiful your betrothed the directness of the question was like salt in an open wound and he winced drawing a deep breath he replied she was the loveliest creature imaginable nina her hair was like a black storm cloud her skin was like a gardenia flower in texture and color and her eyes were the wonderful deep blue of the seas off ireland she was kind yet proud and not only was she my dearest love she was also my best friend and i shall miss her for all the days of my life constanzas eyes were bright with tears i can only hope she said softly that someday a man will love me like that i can see no reason why one wouldnt nina i cannot understand why you are not already married how old are you fifteen senor niall and have not half the eligible young dons on this island already sued your father for your hand or are they all blind she smiled shyly then blushed there will be no offer for me senor niall she said sadly my father long ago destroyed any chances of marrying i might have had last night when he told you about your betrothed you undoubtedly thought him harsh but your plight brought back to him something he would much rather forget almost sixteen years ago the moorish pirates raided this island and when they left they took my mother as one of their captives my father had been deeply in love with her and he was frantic he was able to ransom her six weeks later i was born six months later though she swore before the priest and on every saint in the calendar even on the holy mothers name that the pirates had not touched her my father could not bring himself to really believe her not ever as she grew bigger with her preg nancy he grew more distant toward her she adored him and it broke her heart she lived just long enough to give me life and then she died like a snuffedout candle the irony is that i look like her every day of my life i have been a living reproach to my father in turn he has held me responsible for my mothers death and he has cast enough doubt on my paternity that no decent family on mallorca would allow their son to offer for me i am his child though that is certain ana was my mothers servant before she was my nurse she came with my mother from castile when mother was married to father she was with her the entire time mother was kidnapped and she swears to me that my mother knew no man but my father suddenly constanza stopped she blushed beetred realizing the cause of her embarrassment niall burke said quietly dont regret your words nina i have always been the kind of man to whom women talk i understand now your fathers words he is a harsh man but he meant to tell me the truth the girl knelt by his bedside her lovely oval face turned up to him i am so sorry senor niall i know how sad the loss of your betrothed wife is to you but god has willed that you live we will both pray for your skyes immortal soul but you must also promise me that you will now get well niall burke was touched by her honest concern he put his big hand over her small one very well constanzita i promise but you must promise to help me will you the hand beneath his trembled slightly and she flushed a most becoming pink as her darkgold lashes brushed her cheeks if you wish it she said low i wish it he answered releasing her hand in the next few weeks he grew stronger the fever finally left his body and his appetite increased eventually he was able to leave his bed and walk about his room then came the day that he ventured into the gardens that afternoon was the happiest time he could remember in many weeks he and constanza chaperoned by ana sat on the grass and picnicked on small meat pastries juicy green grapes and a delicate rose wine niall told them stories of his boyhood in ireland and for the first time he heard constanza laugh a sweet trill of genuine mirth as he told them a particularly amusing story about his youthful hijinks he began to sleep again at night and the nightmares of seeing skye struggling in the grasp of the barbary pirates began to fade away the omalleys fleet put into mallorcas capital city of palma again they had spent several months in algiers seeking their mis tress but in the end they had had to leave without even any information the dey however had given the omalley family rich concessions in hopes of placating them it seemed there was no hope of finding the omalley alive the irish ships would sail home shortly under the leadership of captain macguire niall however was still not considered strong enough for the voyage niall entrusted inis to macguire and gave the captain a lengthy letter to his father pouring out his grief and closing with the ad monition make no contracts for me i will in time do my duty by the family then with a strange sense of loss niall burke bid the omalley fleet farewell watching from the terrace of the condes garden as the ships sailed out to sea niall saw little of his host and was glad for the cold spanish don was not a man whose company niall enjoyed one day constanza suggested that he might feel up to riding and he delightedly agreed that afternoon he found himself upon a spir ited roan red arabian stallion cantering through a field of colorful windflowers and anemones constanza rode with him mounted on an elegant little white arabian mare she was a fine horsewoman with a good sure seat and gentle but firm hands in the heat of the afternoon they stopped in a meadow above the sea to rest their horses and eat the light luncheon ana had packed constanza lay a little white cloth over the grass and set out their luncheon of crusty bread soft ripe cheese peaches pears and white wine niall unsaddled the horses so that they could rest a tall leafy tree shaded them all and the air was heavy with the scent of wild thyme they ate in silence after the meal constanza spoke soon you will leave us where will you go back to your ireland a small shadow flitted across his face not right away nina i shall travel for a bit before i go back but go back i must for i am my fathers only heir my first marriage was annulled my second never made you will find happiness senor niall i pray every night to the blessed mother for you he cupped her face with a warm hand what a sweet creature you are my constanzita she blushed and pressed her cheek against his hand suddenly he wanted to kiss her and he did pulling the girl into his arms he bent his head downfound her mouth she was trembling wildly but she did not struggle emboldened he gently parted her lips and plunged into the sweet cavern seeking finding stroking the girls satiny tongue with his own one arm held her fast as a hand sought her full young breasts constanza tore her head away gasping for air frantically she sought his hands but it wasnt niall she feared it was herself niall burke was a gentleman and one word from her would halt him yet she could not bring herself to say the word no man had ever before kissed or touched her as he was doing her heart was pounding and she feared it might burst yet she did not stop him his mouth was again on hers tenderly searing her soul with a passion she had never even suspected she could feel his fingers were undoing the laces of her bodice gently pulling down her chemise niall was amazed by the girls easy acquiescence he was positive she was innocent yet she seemed to welcome his advances he felt a momentary guilt but pushed it away skye was dead he was alive and constanza cuidadela was fresh and sweet his eyes feasted on her young breasts beautiful golden orbs their proud darkcoral nipples tight like unopened rosebuds almost reverently he caressed and kissed them delighting in her soft cry constanza felt an unfamiliar tightness building within her it frightened her a little she did not want him to stop but suddenly he did you are a virgin arent you nina her blush gave him his answer i will not dishonor you constanza he told her gravely it would not be right if i spoiled you for your future husband especially after your kindness to me i had no right to do what i have just done for that i ask your forgiveness and your understand ing constanza sat very still making no attempt to cover herself in the meadow the roan stallion screamed defiantly and brutally mounted the white mare biting her silken neck and thrusting his great organ into her constanza rose and deftly shed the rest of her clothes they lay in a colorful heap about her trim ankles she looked at niall proudly i want you to do to me what your stallion does to my mare she said softly niall burke felt the aching hardness in his groin it would take a saint to refuse such an invitation and he was no saint still he was no rake either then the idea was bom in him why not he thought i will have to sooner or later and so he said will you be my wife constanzita yes she answered he stood up towering over her and slowly pulled off his own clothes she watched him curious having no brothers she had no certain knowledge of male anatomy before her amazed eyes his masculinity rose proudly like a battle flag he took her hand saying tenderly touch it nina i promise it wont bite you though it will love you well her small hand closed about him gently virginally curious he held his breath afraid of frightening her her warm little hand cradled him fondling him with innocent expertise and he could not restrain an intense groan startled she let go i have hurt you nay lovey you pleasure me beyond all and he drew her into his arms and kissed her again her round breasts hard now with her mounting passion rubbed against his dark furred chest until the little nipples were raw with desire her torso pressed tightly against him like burning silk trembling weakly as her legs began to give way but her voice was low and strong take me my niall take me like the stallion took my mare he lowered her to the ground then knelt beside her her violet eyes were wide with wonder as he bent his head to catch a little nipple in his mouth slowly he sucked on it watching with narrowed silver eyes as her breath came in short little gasps and her hips began to twitch a caressing hand moved down her fevered body and she jumped as he touched that most secret of places his finger pushed through the soft defensive folds rubbing insistently and constanza thought she was going to faint her heart was leaping about wildly and she was being buffeted by a great storm of new feelings the like of which shed never known her belly ached and between her legs where his hand teased she ached in a different way when he gently put his long finger into her she was relieved but when he withdrew the ache was worse and she whimpered all right lovey he said softly i will make it better now and he mounted her parting her trembling thighs and slowly entered her she opened herself to him like a flower her eyes never left his face even when he reached her tight little virgin shield and pierced it swiftly so as to give her less hurt constanza felt the slow burning pain spread quickly up her and she cried out his lips covered her protest his tongue probing her mouth matching the rhythm of his throbbing spear something won derful was happening to her and she eagerly thrust her hips upward to meet his fierce downward thrusts the pain was gone and she was soaring like a bird in flight her little hands grasped his tight buttocks to bring him closer and at the moment of her climax she tore her head away from him shrieking her joy then she fainted niall burke lay panting in astounded exhaustion never had he experienced such passion in a virgin and she had certainly been a virgin as the blood on her thighs attested now she lay drained and unconscious he studied her for a moment this girl who would be his wife she was certainly lovely and although he wasnt entirely sure he liked her excessive passion she would certainly be a better bedsport than poor darragh had been the macwilliam might be angered momentarily by a surprise bride but if niall was lucky he would bring her home to ireland with a babe in her belly or at her breast in that case all would be forgiven she was barely breathing and he pulled her into his arms to warm her to awaken her her eyelids fluttered as she began her slow return to consciousness he held her close murmuring soft little words of endearment and as her eyes opened to focus on his face she blushed furiously oh niall what must you think of me but oh it was won derful he laughed what i think nina is that i am a very lucky man you were quite magnificent how do you feel lovey i flew niall i really flew i feel so happy now and i want to do it again he chuckled we shall fly together again lovey but i think perhaps it would be best now if we returned to palma i must ask your fathers permission to marry you he stood up and began to pull his clothes on but it was not easy to concentrate when constanza lay naked at his feet on her bed of meadow flowers and soft green grass he finally managed to return some measure of order to his garb and holding out his hand he said come madam and i will maid you she stood and he was again enchanted by the perfection of her slim body slowly she pulled on her undergarments then the dress skirt and lastly the dress top which he laced for her first cupping the sweet round breasts and fondling them leaning back against him she murmured contently he spanked her bottom fondly pack the luncheon basket nina while i catch the horses and saddle them up they returned to palma in the late afternoon one look at con stanzas face brought a cry of joy from ana as niall dismounted his horse the older woman grasped his hands and kissed them gracias senor niall my constanza will make you a good wife i swear it then you think the conde will give his consent ana a crafty look came into the womans eyes he will at first refuse you for he has never forgiven my ninas birth if however you tell him that you have dishonored his daughter then he will quickly consent for he fears scandal more than anything else in that case ana i shall speak to him at once smiled niall he is in his library now my lord niall bent down and brushed constanzas lips for luck constanzita he said and was gone aiiieee my nina you have at last found a man and what a man he will keep your belly filled for years to come it is what i have prayed for nina someone to take you from the conde and his bitterness now you will have a good life a normal life she hugged the girl hard then catching herself she gasped in my happiness i have forgotten you my constanza you are all right he was gentle he was gentle nurse but i am sore and could use a bath at once nina at once and while constanza bathed herself in a warm scented tub niall burke sprawled his long frame in a rather uncomfortable chair in the condes library in his big hand he twirled the stem of a small wine glass the conde stared coldly at his guest you are vastly improved in health lord burke it was more a statement than a question i expect you will soon leave jus niall nodded soon my lord and when i go there is something i would take with me from mallorca a souvenir of sorts lord burke niall could not resist a chuckle of sorts he said i wish to marry constanza i am formally applying to you for her hand the condes facial expression never wavered it is impossible lord burke she is previously contracted no she is ill with some fatal sickness no then why do you refuse me i am the only son and heir of a wealthy and noble man in my country my lineage is equal to your own you would have grandchildren and as my wife your daugh ter would lack for nothing i do not have to explain myself to you lord burke i am con stanzas father and i have refused your suit my word is all that counts niall drew a deep breath is the reason for your refusal the fact that you doubt your daughters paternity francisco cuidadela grew white you are impertinent lord burke leave me i do not choose to discuss it nialls silvery eyes narrowed let me tell you how i spent my afternoon conde i spent it enjoying your daughters favors she gave herself to me quite willingly and i am pleased to say that she was a virgin at this very moment my seed could be rooting in her fertile womb you deliberately destroyed her chances of marriage here on mallorca now not even a convent will have her how will you face your friends when she grows big with my child you are the last of your line conde and your late wifes family is also long gone there is no place you can send constanza to hide her shame already i hear the laughter of your friends and if king philip should hear of this scandal you might find yourself rapidly replaced as governor here on the other hand if you accept my suit you will be envied your cleverness for catching such a fine prize as myself but of course the decision is yours francisco cuidadela had gone from white to red and back to white again as niall talked now the conde made a strangled sound does that mean you accept my lord asked niall politely the older man nodded weakly and niall smiled satisfied tomorrow he said we shall see the bishop and arrange for the first of the banns to be posted have your secretary bring me a copy of the marriage contract in the morning i trust that constanzas dowry will be quite ample as she is your only child not that i care he said but my father will expect it the conde sent him a black look chuckling softly niall left the library it was done once again he was betrothed and he hoped mat this time the union would produce children constanza was not skye nor would she ever take skyes place in his heart he laughed ruefully he had never loved anyone but skye why had fate been so cruel as to separate them just when they were so near to marriage skye he whispered her name softly skye omalley my love he tasted the words on his tongue no she couldnt be dead would not her spirit have come to him and wouldnt he have felt it if she were must he accept that she was dead when he truly could not believe it was so no he would never love constanza as he had loved skye but constanza was sweet and good and deserved his full attention she would have it too he vowed but when he closed his eyes to conjure up her oval face with its violet eyes and halo of golden curls he instead saw a cloud of black hair framing a heartshaped face with laughing blue eyes and a soft red mouth dammit skye omalley he swore i cannot help it that i am alive and you are are leave me in peace my darling to find some kind of happiness he found constanza and announced your father has consented to our marriage lovey tomorrow we shall have the bishop read the first banns at mass and the contracts shall be signed i cannot believe it she breathed her eyes shining how did you convince him i told him how we spent the afternoon said niall drily constanza swayed oh he will beat me seeing her white face left no doubt in his mind that she did not exaggerate has he beaten you before lovey of course he is my papa he is never an easy man niall but knowing that i gave myself to you willingly will infuriate him i am truly afraid dont be frightened constanzita i will not allow anyone even your father to harm you with a contented sigh she nestled into his arms and he felt better than he had in a long time she loved him she needed him and it would be good between them the marriage contracts were signed the following morning and the first banns were read at the palma cathedrals noon mass by nightfall felicitations were pouring into the governors villa from all the best families on the island the conde was particularly pleased when one of his friends who had spent time in london and dublin congratulated him on obtaining such a fine catch for constanza lord burkes father is quite wealthy my dear francisco and dotes on his only son as you have doted on constanza what a fine match but then you were always a shrewd devil eh the two men chuckled conspiratorially and the conde began to feel that perhaps he had the upper hand after all this tempered his unfriendly feelings toward niall the banns were read twice again within the month and then on a bright winters morning several days after the twelfth night feast had ended constanza maria theresa floreal alcudia cuidadela was joined in holy matrimony to lord niall sean burke the bishop of mallorca performed the ceremony the sun streamed through the stainedglass windows of the ca thedral making beautiful wavy patterns on the palegray stone floors the bride was preceded by six little girls in palepink silk dresses over miniature farthingales with short puffed sleeves wreaths of rosebuds in their unbound hair the children carried gilt baskets of flower petals which they strewed about lavishly constanza clung to her fathers arm a vision so exquisitely ethe real that an audible sigh rose collectively from the guests her gown was a heavy white silk brocade overskirt on a clothofsilver un derskirt the upper sleeves of the gown were large puffs of white brocade slashed to show the silver interior the sleeves were edged in lace just below the elbow the lower sleeves were thin white silk that clung tightly to the arm and ended in cuffs of lace the white brocade bodice was tight and began just above the swell of the brides ample bosom modesty was preserved by a transparent silk chiffon insert that had a dainty virginal round lace collar constanzas golden hair was unbound and topped by a wreath of white rosebuds attached by small pearl pins to a sheer cloud of lace that floated about her in one hand she carried a bouquet of gardenias and about her slender neck was a single strand of pearls the groom awaiting her at the altar was equally elegant his silk hose were redandgoldstriped his upper legs covered by puffed and slashed breeches of claretred velvet his short highcollared doublet was of matching silk and open at the front to show an embroidered white silk undershirt ruffled at the wrists covering his doublet was an embroidered overjerkin of claretred velvet studded with freshwater pearls and gold beads his rakish velvet cap was tilted to show its heavily jeweled underside and a pink plume drooped from it his shoes tanned from the hide of an unborn calf were gilded a pale gold sword and dagger were de rigueur and both of nialls blades were of the finest toledo steel the hilts however were gold and heavily jeweled in diamonds and rubies encircling his neck and spilling down onto his chest was a heavy gold chain with a large gold diamond and ruby medallion depicting a raised winged grif fon the women eyed his broad chest and wellturned legs and sighed behind their fans how on earth they wondered did that meek little milksop catch such a man it was said that the couple would remain on mallorca for several months before journeying to london and the court of the young new english queen elizabeth perhaps in that time they might have the opportunity to offer their charms to the handsome lord burke they would show him what an error it was to wed in haste the ceremony ended and with the bishops permission niall tenderly brushed the lips of his bride her shining eyes and sweet blush told him how happy she was smiling he tucked her small hand in his arm and swept her down the aisle of the cathedral back across the square and into the governors villa soon they were greeting their guests the conde had spared no expense in the preparation of his only childs bridal feast the tables groaned with sides of beef whole young roasted lambs and kids larded ducks whole swans in aspic lemoned and gingered capons there were pigeon and lark pies with their flaky crusts steaming and huge bowls of paella red lobster bits and green olives showing brilliantly against the saffroned yellow rice there were platters of boiled shrimp in white wine and herbs a tub of raw oysters platters of new green scallions and tiny red love apples great loaves of white bread both lean and long and fat and round had been placed at intervals down the board one whole table had been set aside for sweets there were plates of molded jellies in red green and gold dishes of sugared almonds cakes marzipan fruit tarts and silver bowls of black raisins purple figs green and white grapes and seville oranges deepred and golden wines and heady beer flowed from the villa fountains the musicians played lively tunes as they moved among the guests at the head table niall and constanza sat in the place of honor receiving congratulations neither missed the admiring looks cast the grooms way by many of the ladies and the brides purple pansy eyes darkened jealously you look like an outraged kitten he observed in an amused tone i was thinking she replied that the marquesa for all her low decolletage and painted face is at least ten years your senior niall gave a whoop of laughter and kissed her soundly oh nina what a sharp little tongue you have then his eyes caressed her and he said soon i shall teach you to use that naughty tongue in a sweeter pursuit and constanza felt a strong warmth sweep over her since that afternoon in the meadow he had not known her intimately his behavior had been that of any proper gentleman with his betrothed it had made her a little afraid especially after her monthly show of blood had arrived on time perhaps he regretted his proposal but was too well mannered to withdraw it now how ever his eyes told her that she had been foolish to be afraid as the relief flooded through her she felt quite giddy the afternoon lengthened and became evening finally ana was at her elbow whispering and constanza rose discreetly and left the courtyard come in an hour my lord said the servant woman softly and niall acknowledged the message with a faint nod shortly afterward the conde slipped into the seat nearest him i did not mention it before but constanzas maternal grand mother was english part of her dowry was a house on the strand in london it is not large nor elegant but it has been kept in good repair it came to me through constanzas mother and i have made it a part of your wifes dowry my london agent has already informed the tenants that they must leave the house will be staffed and ready for you when you reach london my thanks don francisco the burkes have long considered the value of a london house and the strand is an excellent location he glanced about the festive courtyard my gratitude also for this day it has made constanza so happy she is my daughter don niall oh i know that old gypsy witch ana has convinced constanza that i doubt her paternity and believe she killed her mother but it is not so constanza was born with a heartshaped mole on her right buttock i have the identical mole as do my brother jamie our father and our late grandfather so did my two sisters any doubts i might have entertained were erad icated the moment i first saw my daughter as to contanzas mother maria theresa was as frail as she was proud the agony of being held all those weeks in the licentious clutches of the moors shamed her as greatly as it shamed me she died because she could not bear to be whispered about for the rest of her life how could a simple peasant like ana understand some thing like that he sighed be good to my constanza don niall she is so much like her mother when you take her away it will be like losing maria theresa again he then rose quickly and joined a group of his friends on the other side of the courtyard niall was astounded by these revelations and the brief glimpse he had just had into the condes soul no wonder he had been so generous with constanzas dowry it included an estate in spain the villa here on mallorca an enormous settlement in gold with the promise of more to come when the conde died and now a london house he smiled to himself the macwilliam would be quite pleased for niall was certainly bringing home an heiress a servant refilled his goblet and he watched the gypsy dancers with a growing feeling of peace quaffing down the cup he rose and went to his room where he found his manservant waiting with a steaming tub silently he bathed sniffing appreciatively at the sandalwood soap standing up he sluiced water down his body and was carefully dried where is my lady she awaits my lord in the bedchamber next to his own tell ana i am coming tell her to leave my wife you are dismissed for the night si my lord niall examined his naked body in the pier glass and was pleased by what he saw his illness and idleness hadnt put any flab on him he turned picked up a small object from out of a drawer and entered the scented candlelit chamber where constanza lay beneath the cov erlet of their bed her eyes widened at the sight of him i sleep this way he said by way of explanation so do i but ana made me put on a nightdress she said it was expected tonight shall we shock mallorcan society nina he asked mischie vously stand up quickly he commanded and when she obeyed he tore the dainty lawn gown from her body and tossed the pieces across the room and now to assure my honor and proclaim your purity to all he held his hand over the bed and tightly closed his fist blood splattered the sheets in the center constanza shrieked and niall laughed perfect my love now the wedding guests will believe your maidenhead successfully breeched he wiped his hand clean of blood and tossed the linen towel in the fire it was a piglets bladder filled with chicken blood he explained your ana gave it to me this morning oh she answered wideeyed i never thought her voice trailed off he laughed neither did i but your ana bless her did i am glad shes coming with us now you tempting little piece come here to me this last month ive gone half mad remembering our afternoon in the meadow oh i have too she confessed he picked her up and put her gently on the bed then he joined her is that very shocking niall hell no lovey id rather you were eager for me than cold and retiring he pulled her into his arms almost roughly and her belly fluttered in anticipation how many times had she dreamed of that afternoon seeing the red stallion thrusting his big penis into the quivering little white mare and then seeing niall looming above her lowering his body onto hers thrusting his own great penis into her there had been days when she had writhed on her bed with the memory half a dozen times now as he buried his face in her warm breasts she sighed her golden orbs grew hard as his mouth drank first from one and then from the other his tongue circled the nipples again and again until she begged him to take her he laughed niall had recognized the wanton in her and now he was curious to see how far he might drive her his warm tongue licked her soft fragrant skin moving downward from her navel stopping then moving up each leg from the knee stopping again she thrashed wildly her blond hair tangling fascinated niall let his lips and eyes wander to the soft defenses of her womanhood with gentle fingers he parted the plump folds to stare in fascination as her tender little button grew stiff and throbbing his mouth fastened about it and tasted its sweetness ohhh dear god dont stop please dont stop twice she climaxed under the ministrations of his demanding mouth at last unable to bear much more himself he drove his root into her warm and fertile body she cried out her pleasure wrapping her legs tightly around him moving fiercely with his rhythm claw ing at his back in her passion as he emptied himself into her rolling off her he saw that she was in a semiconscious state he gathered her into his arms gently so that her return would be a warm and safe one he was delighted with this marvelous passionate creature to whom he was wed it was almost too good to be true and yet it was true he had found the perfect mate the woman from whose loins the next generation of burkes would spring constanza stirred faintly in his arms goodbye skye my dear true love niall whispered softly and turned to face his new young wife chapter the wife of khalid el bey was the most famous woman in the city of algiers three nights each week she presided unveiled over her husbands banquet table the allmale guests were shocked at first but they quickly recovered for he lady skye was charming witty and gently spoken it was said hat she knew as much about running her husbands businesses as he did but no man gave that rumor serious consideration for it was too absurd allah had fashioned women for mans pleasure and for birth but nothing else all envied khalid el bey his beautiful wife but none envied him more than jamil the captain of the casbah fort the turkish soldier had quite a respectable harem for be was known to be sexually insatiable favors from captain jamil were easily bought simply by resenting him with a beautiful skilled slave still jamil lusted after skye desperate to possess her she had intrigued him greatly by refusing his overtures he bribed the women of skyes household to smuggle in gifts of jewels flowers and comfits all were returned their wrapping not even opened furious he managed to separate her from her guests on two occasions only to be rebuffed even insulted never in his life had jamil been refused so strongly and the insult rankled he was determined to possess skye tonight he lay sprawled on a couch in the house of felicity watching with yasmin through a twoway mirror on the other side of the mirror was one of the citys most respected merchants who lay naked and tied while two lovely young girls serviced him one crouched over his head her plump little pussy rubbing against his open mouth while the other sucked frantically on the merchants mall flaccid manhood finally as their simultaneous efforts resulted in success the girl at the lower end mounted the man and ode him to glory jamil laughed heartily poor darlings hes not worth their effort send them both to me later and ill reward them with a real workout i thought you intended spending the night with me she pouted i do not give my favors to just anyone would you deny me an appetizer before a gourmet meal he flattered her yasmin almost purred she enjoyed jamil he was the best lover shed ever hadnext to khalid khalid damn him had ceased his visits since falling in love with skye a look of anger flashed across her beautiful face jamil caught it instantly what is it my pet he queried you have been increasingly irritable of late tell jamil and he will make it better she hesitated before admitting it is my lord khalid he is so changed i do not know him anymore and it is all the fault of his wife she is quite beautiful he said wickedly but of course i do not know her i wish to allah she were dead then my lord khalid would come to me again perhaps he mused it could be arranged my dear he con tinued smoothly despite her startled look of course i should expect certain remunerations from you for my help but what difference should the death of one woman make to anyone especially a woman with no memory no powerful connections yasmin was fascinated in spite of herself but how she asked if i wanted someone dead i should chose the time and place carefully and then i should wield the blade myself the fewer people involved the better would you not say who would suspect you if we were seen to enter your chambers together on the night in ques tion when jamil when he smiled tomorrow night my dear yasmin the sooner the better i shall send a message to khalid el bey asking that he meet me at the casbah fort afterward i shall simply deny that i sent any message you and i shall be seen entering your rooms i shall stay the night you will slip out and walk to khalid el beys house enter through the garden the lady skye should be alone possibly even sleeping strike quickly check to be sure you have succeeded then leave why are you so willing to help me she asked suddenly sus picious we are friends yasmin khalids woman means nothing to me but you do if my plan seems harsh my dear you need not act on it the choice is yours no you are as always jamil direct and to the point i will do it the captain smiled toothily as yasmin rose she said i will send the two girls you desire to the baths and then to you from this night on anything you want in the house of felicity is yours jamil could not believe either his luck or yasmins gullibility hewould have to work quickly now the slavespy he had placed in khalid el beys house would have to be informed and instructed in two tasks the first would be to give the bey a sleeping draught in his wine so that he would retire early then the slave would tell skye that a man claiming to know something of her past was at the front gate asking to see her this would keep skye out of the house while yasmin entered the darkened sleeping chamber she would kill the bey believing it was skye he chuckled wickedly well pleased with himself his spy would be a tongueless mute soon after the murder and could not implicate him in fact he would see the hapless creature sold off as to yasmin well the penalty for murder was rather severe a killer was tortured first and then thrown from the city walls onto the iron spikes that studded the walls sometimes a prisoner could linger for several days strangely the women were the longestlived it would be interesting to see how long yasmin would last naturally jamil would offer his strong arm and protection to the grieving widow the grieving rich and beautiful young widow he amended his thoughts an idea struck him perhaps he would marry skye he need not remain the sultans captaingovernor of the casbah fort forever he could as easily retire here in algiers as anywhere else besides skye would need someone to run khalid el beys various business interests jamil had never had a wife but with the beys wealth in his pocket he could afford four wives as well as a fine harem with unlimited money a man might have anything he desired jamil sighed musing on the pleasure and wealth khalid el beys death would bring him to be sure he would be losing a good and interesting friend but that could not be helped his thoughts were interrupted by the entry of the two girls who had earlier entertained the merchant giggling nervously for they knew his reputation they knelt submissively at his feet how may we serve you lord they chorused he viewed them through cruelly narrowed eyes let us begin with the same exercise you performed earlier on your merchant client he said we will progress slowly and inventively from there and across the city skye lay awake hugging her happy secret to herself there was no doubt now she was with child and oh how happy khalid would be when she cold him they had entertained earlier and then he had gone off on his customary nighttime rounds of his houses when he came back she would surprise him with the news smiling she imagined the look on his face she folded her hands protectively across her belly it was much too early to feel any life but she tried to imagine what the son of khalid el bey would look like hearing his step she rose and ran to greet him his strong arms wrapped about her and he kissed her very thoroughly his mouth inflamed her and when his hands slipped beneath her gauze gown to caress her trembling body she almost forgot what she had waited to tell him khalid stop i have news yes my love he murmured pulling her robe open to nuzzle at her pretty breasts his mouth closed over a pointed nipple he sucked hard on it and she almost fainted it was no use she wanted him as much as he wanted her her news would wait she swayed against him and he picked her up and carried her to the bed some where along the way their garments were shed he put her down on the middle of the mattress positioning her body carefully then he straddled her just as deliberately his hairy wellmuscled legs lying outside her smooth ones sitting back on his haunches his heels against his tight buttocks he reached out his hands to play with her one moved forward to pinch gently at her sensitive little nipples the other moved behind him to tickle the soft throbbing flesh of her sweet cleft skyes eyes narrowed like a cats and she murmured her pleasure so my lord husband you would tease me two can play at the same game and she cupped the sac of his manhood in her right hand rolling his balls with a provocative rhythm while her left hand stroked his rod with equal expertise she elicited a groan of delight from him for several minutes they continued to caress each other until both had reached a peak of excitement that offered only one satisfaction skye enjoyed pleasuring khalid as much as he enjoyed pleasuring her as always she felt a thrill of excitement as she watched him grow big and hard for her the bey watched his wifes growing passion with delight she was so beautifully natural so unlike all the skilled whores he owned to have such a wife was a blessing for which he was deeply grateful he swung off her body now and said let me play the great desert stallion tonight my skye roll over and be my little wild mare she knelt her head resting on her arms her white bottom facing him ready kneeling he gently inserted himself into her then one hand moved to squeeze and fondle her hanging breasts while with the other he did something hed never done with her before as she approached her climax he pushed a finger into her anal orifice and sent her into such a frenzied climax that for one brief and terrifying moment he thought hed done her some awful damage then realizing that she had only fainted he took his own release it was a greater climax than usual because of his relief afterward she lay relaxed in his arms and sighed with pleasure i was worrying she said that our lovemaking would not be as much fun now but i see that it can continue to be just as delicious why should anything be different my love because my lord and husband you are to be a father next spring is that not wonderful the bedchamber was plunged into deep silence slowly then awareness began to grow and his face took on a brilliant glow he caught her to him youre sure he cried tearfully hugging her to him fiercely yes yes she gasped laughing and crying at the same time oh my skye no one has ever given me a greater gift than you have given me in yourself and now you will give me a child too it is too much my love far too much thank you thank you and he wept still holding tightly to her skye cradled khalid to her breasts crooning to him this won derful man who had rescued her from god only knew what horrors who loved her had made her his wife and given her a wonderful life was thanking her she wept with him and her heart swelled with joy i love you khalid whoever i might have been i cannot re member but i rejoice in the woman i am now for i am your woman it is i who should thank you silence again descended upon the room as the two lovers joined once more tenderly and khalid bent to kiss skyes faintly rounded belly then they slept entwined together on the bed until long after dawn it was skye who rose first to greet the new day looking down upon the sleeping khalid she let the great love she felt for him sweep over her leaving her teary she noted every inch of him the light sprinkling of silver gray that had begun to touch his dark wavy hair the faint scar on his left shoulder left by a wild bedouin girls dagger the almost boyish look he had when he was asleep her bluegreen eyes traveled the length of him then shivering she began to feel as if she were committing his face and body to memory shrugging the feeling away she went to her bath skye would always remember that the day progressed with an easy familiarity that offered no hint of the things to come she worked with master jean on the books of the trading vessels amazed that captain small had done so well he was due again in algiers any day now they had recently received word of his arrival in london where he had disposed of the last of the spanish gold she was looking forward to seeing captain small again knowing how delighted he would be at her happy news after the midafternoon prayers jeans marie brought them a light repast and the news that the bey had gone on his daily inspection rounds early as he wished to spend the entire evening with his wife skye blushed happily then said my good jean you and your marie have been true friends to my lord khalid and me i shall therefore share with you a secret known only to my husband i am to have a child in the spring marie cried oh madam so am i is it not wonderful delighted the two women sat together and chatted happily while jean chuckled with amusement following his exmasters lead he had soon after acquiring marie legally freed her and then married her he had learned that she came from a seacoast village located in southern brittany near poitou it was only rarely that barbary pirates attacked the region but on one of those infrequent raids the fourteenyearold marie a postulant at a local convent was carried off the pirate captain had stripped her habit off himself but when he saw how attractive and how young she was he locked her in a small cabin with several straw pallets a bucket and a tiny barred porthole two other pretty young girls quickly joined her one her own cousin celestine the three naked girls clung to each other terrified through a long night on the deck above their little prison the anguished screams pleadings and sobbings continued throughout the night as the village women who were unfortunate enough to be married and older or virgin but not pretty enough were repeatedly raped and sodomized at least two girls committed suicide by leaping over board several died of abuse including a tenyearold girl whose mother was strangled when she tried to knife one of the men attacking her daughter finally toward dawn the weeping survivors were all herded into an open pen on deck where they stayed for the remainder of the voyageburned by the sun during the day cold and wet in the night and easily accessible to any sailor seeking sport in their tiny cabin marie and her two companions were little better off the heat during the day made the room an unbearable oven and the damp night air chilled them to the bone this coupled with the stink of the one bucket they had for relieving themselves left them weak and listless the bucket was emptied every other day food was shoved through the grate in the door twice daily they often had a steaming bowl of a surprisingly tasty concoction of peppercom and herbflavored gravy with tomatoes onions eggplant and a tough stringy meat that marie suspected was goat they had no utensils but ate with their fingers and the small piece of bread allotted each a pitcher of water went with the meal and they quickly learned to conserve it when their ship reached algiers the girls crowded together by the tiny porthole watching as their female relatives and friends were taken off the ship then from the bowels of the ship the village men were brought up filthy their newly grown beards matted and liceridden they too were quickly driven off the ship as the three wondered what was to become of them the cabin door opened and the captain entered carrying something over his arm carelessly he flung them each a garment put em on he commanded in roughaccented french and when they obeyed he handed them each a heavy veil pin it to your hoods and follow me he said open your yaps once and ill turn the lot of you over to my crew theyd like that frightened they scurried after him up to the deck and down the gangway on the dock was a large closed litter get in snarled their captor and they quickly obeyed youre going to the baths to be cleaned and prettied up he explained do whatever they tell you to do youll be sold at auction tonight be thankful allah gave you beauty with your purity or you could have ended up like the others in your village he yanked the curtains shut and the litter began to move celestine looked to her cousin marie shall we kill ourselves she whispered fearfully non non cherie scolded marie we will pretend to meekly accept our fates and perhaps later we can escape but if we are sold we shall be separated wailed renee she had been the village innkeepers only child and was terribly spoiled having been raised knowing that her dowry was the largest of any girls for fifty miles around how could you a nun suggest we yield to the infidel i am not a nun renee i was a postulant for one short month i do know however that god has forbidden us to suicide whatever i must endure in his name i shall we are not in tour de la mer any longer and it is unlikely well ever see it again at the baths the girls were scrubbed massaged bathed denuded of body hair creamed and perfumed their long beautiful hair was washed dried and brushed until it shone maries rich chestnut curls were appreciated but the blond locks of renee and celestine made them far more valuable they were garbed in transparent silks and fed a light meal of capon breast and sweet fruit sherbet promptly at moonrise the auction began as they watched marie felt a soft languor steal over her and realized they had been drugged to insure their cooperation helplessly she watched as renee was sold to a fat black sudanese merchant whose delight as he bore her off was evident renee opened her mouth to scream but no sound came forth only her terrified blue eyes told of her fear girl after girl was sold and then it was maries turn khalid el bey quickly bought her and because he looked kind she begged him to buy celestine too the bey was agreeable but the eunuch who ran the harem of the captaingovernor had marked celestine for his master khalid el bey was forced by etiquette to withdraw from the bidding for celestine marie was placed in the house of felicity and trained as a cour tesan but when the time came for her to make her debut khalid el bey chose her to be a gift to jean celestine was not as fortunate her initial resistance to jamil assured her immediate success with him but the naive young girl fell in love with the cruel captaingovernor which made his interest wane when he instructed his eunuch to sell the french girl off celestine committed suicide by leaping from the roof of one of the casbah towers marie had been devastated by her cousins tragic death it seemed especially sad in light of her own good fortune jeans strong love had supported marie through the worst of it but the captaingovernor had made a bitter enemy in the young breton girl marie did not know how but she was determined to have her revenge thoughts of vendetta however were far from maries mind on this day she was delighted to know that her mistress was also pregnant i can deliver both our babies she told skye proudly my mother was the finest midwife in three villages and i helped her many times the doctor tells me said skye that i have borne more than one child but of course i do not remember she sighed i wonder about those children are they alive are they boys or girls how old are they madam must not fret chided marie skye smiled sadly at the girl who though several years younger than she still attempted to mother her i cannot help but wonder if my children miss and mourn their mother she said tears filled maries hazel eyes and skye felt guilty and hugged the girl now ive made you sad and i did not mean to do so i have heard that pregnant women are subject to emotional vagaries is it not true i grow morbid and you weep she made a face at herself and marie laughed through her tears skye smiled back then asked master jean are we through for the day if so marie and i shall spend the rest of the afternoon luxuriating in the bath the beys secretary nodded as khalid el bey was a good kind and gentle man so was his wife a great lady and jean was grateful that she extended her friendship to his wife go along my lady you have gotten so far ahead of me with the accounts that it will take me at least two days to catch up he smiled with contentment as the two women left him life was good here in the beys house hold in the early evening before the meal was served captain robert small arrived at the beys home laden with gifts for skye shouting lusty greetings khalid delighted in the bluff seamans thoughtfulness but skye was truly touched by the care that had so obviously gone into smalls choice of gifts there were several bolts of fine china silk rare spices and a long strand of pearls from the east indies from the new world captain small had brought an intri cately carved box of solid gold lined in white velvet containing the most magnificent necklace bracelet and earrings of colombian emeralds that khalid el bey had ever seen the emeralds set in gold glittered with a blue fire found in only the finest stones they reminded me of your eyes muttered the captain flushing with the words why robbie smiled skye how observant you are and how very very generous she bent and kissed his ruddy cheek my thanks youll eat with us said khalid it was not a question skye left to inform the cook the seaman settled himself on a comfortable divan i need not ask khalid for i see the married life suits you well very well robbie do you think fatherhood will suit me also she isnt a look of sheer delight crossed the englishmans face as the bey nodded she is by god khalid you dog my next trip back ill have a fine gift for your son or my daughter nay man a brace of lads first then a lass to spoil is always best do it that way khalid laughed heartily the deed is already done my friend we must take what allah offers and be grateful the dinner arrived quickly and robert small lowered himself to the table amid the pillows skye sat at one end directing the servants there was a whole leg of baby lamb rubbed with garlic and stuck with sprigs of rosemary set upon a nest of greens and surrounded by tiny roasted white onions a white bowl held small green artichokes in olive oil and red wine vinegar another bowl was filled with fluffy white rice mixed with sesame seeds sliced black olives green peppers and sauteed onions there were flat dishes of boiled eggs purple and brown olives strips of red pimiento and tender green scallions a basket of round flat loaves of warm bread and a silver dish of sweet butter completed the main course of this simple family meal discreetly attentive slaves kept the three crystal goblets filled with subtly spiced fresh pomegranate juice the main course finished the slaves removed the plates and brought in silver bowls of warm scented water and tiny linen towels desert consisted of a huge platter of fresh fruits golden brown dates round seville oranges great black figs bunches of purple and green grapes sweet red cherries and both green and golden pears a filigreed basket was passed containing tiny pastry horns filled with a mixture of chopped almonds and honey skye brewed the dark rich turkish coffee afterward hot steaming towels were offered to cleanse sticky fingers and water pipes were brought to the gentlemen two pretty young girls played and sang softly in the background while the men smoked and talked skye noticed that khalid seemed sleepier than usual and she teased him it is i who should be tired now my lord not you stifling a yawn he chuckled impending fatherhood is exhaust ing my love i cannot keep my eyes open i am going to retire now before i fall asleep here robbie stay skye has many questions to ask you i know and i have not given her a chance he rose skye rose and stood within the curve of his arm you do not mind if i remain for a bit no my skye fill your lovely head with all the things you need to know he kissed her tenderly allah how fair you are the white silk caftan and gold embroidery sets off robbies emeralds very well the blue flame in their centers does indeed match your beautiful eyes he kissed her again dont wake me when you come to bed my love ill sleep through the night she kissed him back sleep well my darling i love you he smiled happily at her touching her cheek in a tender and familiar gesture bidding robert small a good night khalid left the room youve been good for him remarked the englishman he is good for me she answered youve had no return of memory lass not even a glimpse no robbie nothing sometimes a sound or sight has a familiar ring to it but it is never anything i can put my finger on and now i dont really care i am happy as khalid el beys wife i love him dearly they sat talking for some time at the back of the garden the little wicket gate creaked open to admit a dark hooded figure slowly carefully yasmin made her way across the garden keeping well into the shadows she saw two figures talking in the salon one was garbed in white it had to be khalid he had worn white that afternoon while making his rounds she heard a hearty laugh and recognized it as captain smalls the captain and khalid were talking and would probably visit for some time yasmin wondered if she should wait until khalid had gone to bed the idea of disposing of skye under khalids very nose was tempting yasmin wanted her master back but she hadnt forgiven him for marrying skye she crept on past the salon keeping far enough away to avoid the lights she heard the low murmur of voices but could make out nothing of the conversation no matter she thought slipping into the villa through a long french window she made her way up the darkened back staircase of the house to the main bedchamber the door was open and she stood still for a moment letting her eyes adjust to the dark room yasmin knew the room well looking toward the bed she ob served the sheetswathed figure she hesitated no longer than a second moving purposely across the room she plunged her dagger again and again into the sleeping figure who groaned once then lay still unbridled joy surged through yasmin dead dead her rival her enemy skye was dead she wanted to scream her happiness then behind her someone did scream a long piercing wail of terror whirling yasmin faced a slave woman who was clutching at a crystal carafe of water the carafe slid from the womans hands yasmin stood stock still watching the crystal shatter on the tiles the water mixing with it spewing a rainbow of shattered droplets across the floor and rugs yasmin could not move she stood frozen as the womans screams echoed throughout the house at the sound of running feet yasmin shook herself back into action moving to the door she shoved the slave woman aside and tried to flee but the servant clung to her arm screaming murder murder she has killed the master allah what was the woman screaming about yasmin wondered khalid was downstairs she had killed skye yasmin yanked her arm free and turned to run bumping into another body she tried to push by but her shocked eyes locked onto skyes allah no yasmin gasped she killed the master wailed the slave woman again yasmin what has happened asked skye fearfully yasmin turned from skye and stumbled back across the room to the figure on the bed with icy fingers she pulled the sheet back seeing the cold stiffening form of khalid el bey yasmin moaned with a pain so great she couldnt truly feel it all her fingers tightened again about the dagger she whispered her anguish forgive me skye and swiftly drove the dagger between her own breasts yas min crumpled to the floor skye knelt on one side of the woman while captain small knelt on the other yasmins ragged breathing was the only sound why whispered skye why yasmin you loved him the dying womans eyes were glazing already forgive me skye swallowed the bitter hatred rising in her throat this woman had just stolen her very life from her and now begged forgiveness she wanted to shout no but then she heard robert small say quietly come lass knowing what he wanted she said softly i forgive you yasmin yasmin sighed gathering the last of her strength she said i thought it was you jamil pplanned it but it was all for him wasnt it jamil wants you beware of him then as if a candle had been blown out the life fled from her eyes and yasmin was gone skye stood the room was bright now lit by the lamps held by all the household slaves who stood clustered in tight little groups some of the women beginning to sob skye stared at them fighting to retain her control she must not go to pieces now as she had obviously done when she lost her memory she owed khalid mat much for he must be revenged the turkish captaingovernor could not kill her husband and escape judgment who had heard yasmins confession only she and captain small had been close enough to hear the painfully whispered words the next nearest people had been jean and marie the slaves had all been afraid of coming too close stepping over yasmins body skye moved to the bed and sat next to the still form of her husband there was virtually no blood to be seen by some twist of fate the dagger had pierced only vital organs but no arteries i would be with my lord she said quietly and she heard the shuffle of feet and men the closing door alone she wept her terrible grief in silent pain rocking back and forth holding herself as if that would prevent her from shattering her head ached and waves of pain and nausea began to rack her suddenly she heard robert small commanding voice it lass voice your pain or else it will kill both you and his babe is that what you want if so take yasmins escape for its quicker she saw the englishman standing by the door he had never left her now crossing the room in three strides he grasped her by the shoulders and shook her damn it lass cry scream curse the heavens but in gods name get it out she sobbed softly once then stopped he hit her hard several times and suddenly her resistance broke opening her mouth skye wailed her grief with such loud and terrible cries that they echoed throughout the house the slave women grieving softly until then joined in their mistresss tragic lamentation and soon the whole house rang with grief shortly the sounds echoed through the entire neigh borhood people began to gather and it was not long before everyone knew that khalid el bey had been murdered by his jealous slave woman yasmin slowly skyes grief eased looking a final time on her beloved husband she bent and kissed his cold lips then supported by robert small she left the room and walked downstairs to the beys library get jean and marie for me robbie i must be revenged and i will need help when the four of them were gathered together in private skye quietly repeated yasmins dying words to jean and marie the frenchman was shocked but his wife sniffed i would put nothing past that evil turk look how he killed my little cousine celestine he has no real heart that one she began to weep he claimed to be the masters best friend and yet he killed him without a second thought because he wished to possess madam jean comforted his wife as best he could we will both be revenged marie said skye but before we can be we must lull jamil into a sense of security he must not even suspect that we know he is responsible for my lords murder let him feel safeand then we will strike you cannot revenge yourself on the sultans governor and re main safely in algiers said robert small firmly the dey would be forced to punish you in the sultans name i cannot remain here under any circumstances robbie the memories i have of khalid and our life together would break my heart and though i am capable of running the house of felicity who would do business with a woman sell everything here in algiers but do it secretly have the money transported to our lon don goldsmith the house also asked jean the house the seaside kiosk sell all what of the slaves prepare papers of manumission for them all i shall give each of them the price he or she is worth in order that they may all get started in another life those who wish to come with me may do so but no one is to be told until we are ready to leave i hope jean that you and marie will come with me but if you choose to return to brittany i will understand there is nothing for us in brittany my lady our families are gone maries entire village is gone we would rather stay with you for we love you as we loved the bey thank you said skye i would have been lost without you both there was a scratching at the door and when skye called out enter a slave came in to announce that the captaingovernor was on his way up the driveway hold him off for a few minutes she told jean he left the room immediately robbie you go too i shall go upstairs through the secret passage here in the library marie quickly skye drew two leatherbound volumes from a shelf and reaching into that former space pulled at a hidden lever the bookcase swung open to reveal an interior staircase shut it behind us robbie she said handing him the books then the two women were gone they hurried up the stairs which opened out into skyes old room i cannot ever go back in there she told marie referring to the bedchamber she had shared with khalid she quickly stripped off her white silk caftan get me the azure gauze chamber robe marie marie fetched the gown smiled with appreciation of skyes strategy the captaingovernor will be so blinded by lust she remarked as skye dressed that he will believe whatever you tell him madam skye nodded i must not rouse his suspicions she said and i need time send my women to me marie the captaingovernor will expect to find the grieving widow surrounded by her weeping handmaidens and i must not disappoint him a look of physical pain crossed her face and suddenly she began to weep uncontrol lably her sobs interspersed with bursts of hysterical laughter oh god marie it is too macabre how khalid would appreciate the role i play marie looked stricken and the tears spilled from her eyes as she fled the room to do her mistresss bidding skye flung herself on the divan weeping soundlessly now khalid oh khalid she thought desperately please god please let me wake and find him sleeping safely next to me but she knew in her heart that her prayers were useless he was dead and lost to her she heard the door open softly and then her women were clustering about her like bright little butterflies sobbing and clucking with sympathy skye didnt even look up she wept harder and soon she heard maries cry of protest my lord jamil you cannot enter my ladys chamber her grief is too terrible to behold i was khalid el beys best friend boomed the captaingover nors deep voice allah curse him thought skye fiercely it is my duty to comfort his widow step aside khalid would have done the same for me allah strike him down this instant for i do not think i can face him without betraying my feelings skye silently shrieked but she breathed deeply and calmed herself khalid would be avenged the door opened again and she knew jamil had entered there was a flutter and she realized that her maidens had gone leaving her alone with him she sobbed piteously skye my dear i am so sorry she sobbed louder fighting not to wince when she felt his arms about her one hand imperiously forced her head up and he stared into her eyes he was somewhat taken aback by the depth of her grief but he spoke nonetheless dont fear beautiful skye i will take care of you as did khalid allah the emeralds she was wearing were worth a kings ransom i am sso alone now jamil i will take care of you he repeated his eyes straying to her breasts they seemed fuller than he had noticed before damn he wished he could take her now but it would hardly do to fuck the widow when her husbands corpse lay still warm in the next room there would be plenty of time for that later on if he acted too soon he chanced losing the juicy plum of her wealth she pressed against him weeping afresh soaking his silken shirt half swooning into his arms by the teats of fatima she was a rare beauty he could hear the ragged sound of his own breathing as his hot eyes devoured her lush body he didnt want to release her but he could hardly go on holding a halfconscious woman standing up he carried her back to the sleeping couch and gently deposited her there look your fill you murdering bastard she thought as she watched him through slitted eyes dream your lustfilled dreams for dreams are all youll ever have of me finally jamil sighed reluctantly and left the room she lay quietly until marie joined her saying drily the household has been threat ened with severe punishment unless you are properly cared for madam skye sat up the presumption of the man he says he will care for me as did my lord khalid when he touched me it was all i could do not to vomit oh marie where is the justice in this world why should a man as kind and good as my lord khalid die and one as evil as jamil live the frenchwomans eyes again filled with tears helas madam would i could answer you but i cannot faithful marie remained by skyes side all night neither really slept arrangements for the beys funeral were completed in the morning for the day was thursday and unless he was buried by the sabbath sundown there could be no funeral until saturday the body was first washed then wrapped in a seamless white shroud the shroud had been dipped in meccas sacred zamzam well when khalid el bey made his pilgrimage to the holy city led by the captaingovernor and the beys beautiful tragic widow who was garbed entirely in white a thin mourning band around her head the funeral procession made its way from the villa through the city to the cemetery following a careful ritual of lamentations by the women and readings from the koran by the men the beys tomb a small domed white marble building over looked the harbor carefully the body was laid to rest on its side facing the holy city and final prayers for his safe arrival in paradise were said by the young mullah who had married them skye had allowed yasmin to be buried honorably and her shrouded body was placed at her masters feet in hopes mat she would serve him better in paradise in her grief skye attempted to remain in the tomb with her husband and had to be carried out with sundown skye was safe from jamil for twentyfour hours and in those twentyfour hours jean worked feverishly with robert small and simon ben judah to put the beys affairs in order the goldsmith whose own sabbath followed the moslem one knew of several prospective buyers for the beys business they could not be approached however until sunday the first day of the week on saturday morning a slave was dispatched to the casbah fort bearing a message for the captaingovernor jamil read the neatly written words twice as if seeking a hidden meaning my lord jamil i am deeply appreciative of your kindness to me for the next thirty days i shall be secluded in deepest mourning and will receive no visitors i know you will honor my grief it was signed the lady skye widow to khalid el bey jamil gritted his teem with annoyed frustration he was aware mat he could hardly propose marriage to a newly widowed woman but he had hoped to sweep her off her feet thus preventing any other suitors from courting her then a thought struck him and he smiled the thirty days could easily work to his advantage skye was young and used to regular lovemaking after a month of abstinence she should succumb quickly he smilingly dictated a proper reply to her letter lady skye your period of mourning will be honored though reluctantly i shall call upon you thirtyone days from this date it was signed jamil captaingovernor of the casbah fortress skye read the message and chuckled with delight she could sense the pentup frustration and was pleased to hurt him even in this small way within a month khalid el beys affairs in algiers would be settled and she would have made good her escape and as if khalids spirit watched over her the days sped smoothly by and everything proceeded toward the sale of the beys interests simon ben judah explained smoothly to prospective buyers that there were those less reputable than they who might wish to cheat a young widow so it was best that negotiations remain strictly secret since none of those involved wished others to know of the bidding the secret was kept when a bargain was finally struck skye found herself twice as rich as khalid el bey had left her the monies all in gold coin were transferred to london both the villa and the seaside kiosk were sold to osman the astrologer osman was one of the few people she saw during her mourning he had come one afternoon to tell her that he wanted the house and kiosk for himself and his beautiful slave woman the same girl khalid el bey had given him she sold to him readily happy that someone she knew and liked would live in happiness in the places where she had been so happy she and osman sat in the villa garden and she served him turkish coffee and small honey cakes you are with child he said quietly yes she answered not in the least surprised i had told khalid the night before he he was very happy you made him very happy skye you were his joy i warned him however that your fate was not with him it is back among your own people and you will soon begin that journey back oh osman did i cause khalids death no my dear you did not and you must never blame yourself khalid el bey played out his fate as it had been planned since the beginning of time now you must play out yours who am i osman i do not know skye but i will tell you what i do know what i told your husband before he married you you were born under the sign of the ram your homeland is a green and misty place peopled by strong spirits and psychic forces you will always control your own destiny skye and you will eventually be reunited with your true mate khalid el bey was my true mate she snapped angrily no skye he was not he loved you deeply never doubt it and i know that you loved him but there is another man a stronger force in your life he was with you before and will return to you in time follow your instincts my dear they will never fail you and my child will be born safely skye and live to a ripe old age as will you thank you osman i will always have my memories of khalid el bey but to have his child is a far dearer thing thank you for the reassurance the astrologer stood up i will go now my dear and i shall bid you a final farewell now since i was away from the city when khalid died it is understandable that i pay my condolences now if however the man who watches this villa so carefully for the captaingovernor should see me here again it will certainly seem curious and it will arouse suspicions so i will not return jamil has set men to watch my house she exclaimed how dare he the arrogance of the man osman laughed my dear he fancies himself in khalid el beys place and wishes to discourage any other suitors i would sooner wed a snake that will not be necessary replied the astrologer drily you will easily escape him he suspects nothing when do you leave in two nights it will be the dark of the moon good but be careful what of your slaves i have freed them and will give them money to start a new life jean and marie will come with me tell the others that i will employ any who choose to stay ask those who prefer to go to remain here until i come to take possession of the house in six days if they go about their business as usual the captaingovernors spies will suspect nothing that will give you a fourday start it should be enough to get you out into the western sea and pursuit is virtually impossible then oh osman how can i thank you he smiled at her by playing out your part as allah has foretold it my dear she walked with him back into the house bidding him a final farewell in the atrium taking his hand she pressed it to her lips and forehead saalam osman my friend saalam skye my daughter allah go with you during the next few days skyes emotions fluctuated wildly she was frightened by the unknown awaiting her in the foreignsounding town of london she was elated by the fact she was outwitting jamil though frustrated that she could not inflict a terrible injury on him in retaliation for khalids murder she was happy and relieved that jean marie and captain small would be with her but sad to leave such good friends as osman then the night of her departure arrived and she stood with marie making a final inventory of the few things she would take with her most of her clothing would of course remain this wardrobe was hardly suitable to a life in england she would however take some caftans with her to be worn in the privacy of her bedchamber the flowing loose robes would be comfortable as her pregnancy went on the loose gemstones khalid had kept as well as her marvelous jewelry were all sewn into the garments for safe transportation she would take her wonderful gold brushes and combs her crystal per fume bottles filled with rare and costly essences and other things of a sentimental and personal nature they were all packed carefully in carved cedarwood chests and passed quietly from servant to ser vant and finally to the silent english seaman who waited in the dark outside the villas garden gate unaware of the little wicket gate jamil had no one watching it skye climbed to the roof of the house and gazed for one final time over the city of algiers below her the night lights twinkled and she heard faintly the murmur of life as it brawled and sobbed and laughed above her the velvet heavens gleamed black and she stared deeply into them as if trying to pierce through the darkness oh khalid she sighed then jumped startled by the sound of her own voice she had not cried since the day they had buried him but now she wept without restraint she stood in the center of the roof terrace her face upturned to the skies letting her grief pour over her and when she had finished she said softly i shall never grieve so deeply for you again khalid my love i have my mem ories and i have our child whom i regret will never know you now khalid i must leave our home and i hope you will wish me godspeed i wish you the same she stood quietly and a great peace flooded through her and she knew that he approved of what she was doing thank you my love she said glancing around the terrace a final time she descended to the ground floor of the house where the servants all waited to bid her goodbye she spoke quietly to each in turn and they thanked her for their freedom and the money she had given them for now they had all deckled to remain in osmans employ her farewells over she joined jean and marie and walked through the gardens and then through the little back gate by prearrangement a closed litter awaited them entering it they sat wordless each wrapped in his own thoughts the bearers made their way down into the city and to the docks captain small awaited them and no sooner were they aboard his vessel the mermaid than the gangway and anchor were raised while the first mate saw the ship underway robert small escorted his passengers to their quar ters skye could not remember her arrival in algiers but she would always remember her departure on a hill overlooking the harbor she could pick out the spot where her husbands tomb stood loom ing above the city she saw the sinister towers of the casbah marie smiled grimly we are well revenged madam this morning i sent the captain governor a plate of sweetmeats in your name i made them myself one of the ingredients was an herb that will render the evil jamil impotent for all time he will never hurt another woman with his lust again marie it is perfect imagine his shock and then his shame oh how i wish i might be there to see his agony the two women stood watching in silence as the lights of the city disappeared in the distance then marie put an arm about skye and led her to her cabin where for the first time in weeks she slept soundly with the tension gone from her life skye suddenly began to behave like the pregnant woman she was she developed peculiari ties of appetite and was frequently sleepy she became queasy and then seasick when the ship hit rough weather off the bay of biscay marie and jean sat with captain small one evening discussing skyes welfare they all agreed that london was not the place for a delicate expectant mother it is your country said marie to the little englishman where would be a good place for madam to have her accouchement there are many pleasant places near london replied captain small but i would prefer she was someplace far from the city its not just the child we must worry about the lady skye has had the severe shock of her husbands murder she ought to be in a quiet place i have set course for my own home port the town of bideford in devon i own a fine big house several miles outside the town my sister cecily lives there she will welcome you all and adore taking care of the lady skye after the babe is born your mistress may continue on to london but perhaps by then she will not wish to go thus it was that the mermaid rounded hartland point on a fine october morning to sail into barnstable bay and then a little way up the river torridge to bideford as skye stood at the ships rail watching the undulating woodland scenery that sloped down to the riverbank she saw with sure instinct that this was a safe haven robert small had been right it was here that she would have her baby in safety whatever else came afterward she would find the courage to face it as osman had said skye was following her destiny part iii england chapter the little town of bideford small though it was was one of the most prosperous seaports in england under the personal protection of the great de grenville family bideford was just entering the period of its greatest prosperity when skye arrived there set on the side of a long hill backed by a vast woodland it sloped downward to the river torridge bideford surrounded by rolling hills woodlands fertile meadows and orchards full of ripening apples was a most charming colorful english town although it was a seaport town it was not situated directly on barnstable bay in order to reach bideford one had to cross the estuary avoiding the dangerous bar that stretched across its mouth the estuary was situated almost midway between hartland point and the rock of death facing the bar estuary some twenty miles away was lundy island its rocky cloudcapped hills made lundy island a favorite haunt of devon pirates and smugglers and their counter parts from all over the world safely across the bar and into the estuary which flowed upland was the village of appledore at appledore the estuary forked becoming the taw river to the left and the torridge river to the right now the countryside became lush with rich meadowland and fruit orchards a few miles up from appledore the river reached fertile green bideford it was here in the bideford hills that robert small had his house wren court captain small had made arrangements to be met at the dock when he and skye and the french couple disembarked and the four rode through the town and up the hills on two chestnut and two gray mounts the little party made a delightful picture riding against the trees trotting up the bright green hills as they approached wren court skye cried oh robbie why have you never told me what a beautiful estate you owned she reined in her chestnut mare at the crest of a hill and sat gazing rapturously at the red brick manse jean and marie pulled up beside her and robbie was forced to stop with them he blushed its been in the familythe land at leastsince the time of henry v wren court itself was built during the reign of henry vii thats why the house is shaped like an h skye turned her brilliant blue eyes on him laughingly youre far too modest robbie i wasnt expecting anything so lovely the family is landed gentry skye theres always one or more of us standing for parliament unfortunately i never married and got myself an heir and my sister cecily was widowed before she could have children i suppose ill leave wren court to a family of distant cousins he sighed then shook his reins and the gray gelding bolted for home the other three mounts racing close behind the house was exquisite a small and perfect jewel of mellowed red brick covered in places with shining dark ivy and surrounded by green lawn the crossbar of the h was two stories high the sides were each three stories high skye would later find that this twostory section contained a long and light entry foyer on the ground floor this foyer had two sweeping staircases on either side both of which led to the secondfloor open picture gallery as the entire second floor was open the first and second stories together made a huge twotiered room the wings of the main floor to either side of the entry were the kitchens and dining rooms the second floor beyond the gallery was given over to the library and salons and the entire third floor to bedrooms as they rode up the gravel drive skye was further enchanted by the streams of sunlight catching the many leaded windows and the profusion of late roses perfuming the air above the circled doorway was the familys redandgold coat of arms as they reached the house four grooms came running to take the horses and robert small carefully lifted skye down from her saddle a small plump woman with snapping blue eyes silver hair and rosy cheeks appeared in the doorway so youre finally back robbie is this mistress goya del fuentes and without waiting for an answer she held out her arms to skye you poor dear well youre safe now and well take good care of you and the child come inside now dame cecily swept skye and jean and marie into the house to a small receiving room where a cheerful fire blazed sit down all of you why robert made a lass in your condition ride from town ill never know a cart would have been slower but safer no matter youre here and well robert see whats keeping that shiftless martha there should be wine and biscuits ready for four tired travelers oh please dame cecily you must call me skye mistress goya del fuentes is such a large mouthful thank you child now i am a plainspoken woman so i am going to say what i have to now and then we will know where we stand with each other dame cecily nodded to jean and marie who were seated on a couch to the right of the fireplace listening attentively i know i may speak before your servants as they are also your friends and robbie has written to me about them skye nodded dame cecily took a deep bream my brother has told me something of your history poor lamb how terrible to remember nothing of your life until a year ago i do not approve of your late husbands business but i can see you are a lady bom thats plain and robert has always spoken highly of khalid el bey that my dear is good enough for me i welcome you to england with all my heart our home is yours as long as you wish it forever if you like skye felt tears prick her eyelids thank you dame cecily thank you with all my heart not just for myself but for my servants too lord bless me child i almost forgot robert i had the old cottage at the end of the garden cleaned and refurbished for you she said nodding to the french couple i thought you might prefer your privacy jean and marie were deeply touched the cottage given them sent marie into joyful delirium it too was of soft red brick with a newly thatched roof and small leaded windows there were two rooms in the cottage the first was a large chamber with a big stone fireplace the other a small bedchamber with a fine varnished oak bedstead the entire cottage was furnished in sturdy carved oak furniture the stone floors had been scrubbed and swept there were late hollyhocks and michaelmas daisies growing outside by the door dame cecily it appeared had thought of everything a small book lined room off the library was set aside for jean to work in it had an entry into the garden skye was thrilled to see her two servants so well provided for she could not thank dame cecily enough but the englishwoman brushed her gratitude aside her blue eyes twinkling no need child what are friends for may i ask and she then led skye back to the main house and upstairs skyes apartments took up the southwest comer of the second floor the sitting room had a large gray stone fireplace with a carved mantel the two large windows dia mondshaped and leadpaned were hung with deepblue velvet draperies a deep bay window looked south over a rose garden now in late bloom the wide polished oak floorboards were laid with thick redandblue turkey carpets at the far end of the room on either side of the fireplace were arched and paneled doors both of which led to the bedchamber here were windows facing both south and west which made the room sunny and bright all year long particularly in the winter the fireplace here which backed up to the one in the sitting room had a pretty tiled border the draperies here were of rose velvet and matched the bed hangings and bedspread here again was a fine turkey carpet this one in blues and golds off the bedchamber was a small dressing room the furniture everywhere was of fine carved oak there were bowls of fresh flowers in all three rooms skye was sure she would be happy here dame cecily drew forward an applecheeked young girl this is daisy my dear ive chosen her to look after you the girl smiled a friendly gaptoothed smile and bobbed skye a curtsey im glad to serve you mum skye smiled back thank you daisy ive been at sea for several weeks now and more than anything i long for a bath could that be arranged yes mum let me get your boots off and while you rest a bit ill see to setting up the bam dame cecily smiled approvingly i leave you in good hands skye daisy will show you to the hall in time for dinner less than an hour later skye luxuriated in a hot tub set before her bedroom fireplace a pretty curved screen had been drawn about the bathing area the oak tub was deep and she sank gratefully into the warmth feeling the weeks at sea ease away the air was fragrant with the scent of damask rose soap daisy moved quietly around the room unpacking skyes trunks setting out fresh clothes skye had been amazed to find in her cabin aboard the mermaid two trunks filled with the latest english fashions robbie had laughed saying algiers is an international port one can find anything in algiers daisy came behind the screen and chatting cheerfully picked up the soap and began to wash skyes hair ah now mum well soon have your crowning glory free of that sticky sea salt lord what a fine color it is she scrubbed the dark thick mass working up a good lather then rinsed it free and pinned the damp curls on top of skyes head skye stepped from the tub and daisy wrapped her in a warm towel once dried she stood before the pier glass examining her figure her breasts were certainly fuller than before and she was beginning to notice a slight rounding of her belly khalids child what would he look like would he have his fathers dark hair and golden eyes oh khalid i miss you so silently she stepped into her undergarments and let the little maid slip a darkblue silk gown over her it was a simple but elegant gown befitting her station as a wealthy merchants widow the only jewelry she wore were the rings given her by khalid a sapphire and her gold wedding band her hair was brushed dry carefully plaited and then wound about her head in a crown effect upon it she wore a soft white lawn cap the household was small consisting only of skye and robert and cecily small so the evening meal was a simple one jean and marie preferred to remain in their cottage skye couldnt blame them for this was the first time in their married lives that they would actually be alone how she envied them she shook herself khalid el bey was dead and she would have to go on with her life robert small had created an identity for her mat would satisfy curiosities she would admit to being irishborn and the absence of a maiden name and past would be explained in this fashion she had been brought as a child to a small french christian convent in algiers by a sea captain who claimed that her parents passengers on his ship had died on board since they had paid for their passage in advance in gold the sea captain did not know their names the child who seemed to be about five and who called herself skye was raised by nuns in the algiers convent when the young orphan was sixteen she had been seen by senor goya del fuentes while praying in the church he had applied to the nuns for her hand and his suit had been accepted he had been a wealthy merchant and a respected man when he had died suddenly the young widow could not bear to remain in algiers since her late husband owned a house in london she decided to settle in england robert small as her late husbands partner had taken the lady under his protection of course dame cecily knew skyes real story but she agreed with her brother that the less spectacular history he had invented was a better one skyes arrival with her two servants and her resettlement at wren court was accepted easily by the smalls friends and their few relations the servants gossiping from house to house were sym pathetic to the beautiful pregnant widow skye was modest and kind a true lady even if she was a papist the memory of mary tudor was still too fresh for the people of england to be very tolerant toward catholicism it was almost christmas before the first frost arrived and that caused the people of devon to mutter about a hard winter to come skye had confided the secret of her memory loss to the local priest elderly kindly father paul retaught her the tenets of her religion though it evoked no memories it was strangely comforting skye did this because she knew that never to attend church in a christian land would promote suspicion it seemed that everyone needed a label and even a papist label was more respectable than none shortly after candlemas in february marie gave birth to a fine big boy who was baptized henri skye had embroidered some little gowns for the child she loved sitting in maries cottage near the fire watching while marie nursed her son her own babe was strong and kicked vigorously to her discomfort and her joy she had de cided to call him james which was the english equivalent of khalid el beys spanish name diego as her time drew near she was eager for the babys birth on the fifth of april dame cecily hadnt even time to summon a midwife before skyes child was bom marie handled everything and the birth was a quick and easy one no sooner had the child slid from between its mothers legs and given its first cry than skye slipped into unconsciousness handing the squalling infant to dame cecily marie whispered my poor mistress ah well its gods will when skye opened her eyes she found herself in a clean night gown her long hair freshly brushed and braided give me my son she whispered to dame cecily its a wee girlie youve birthed my dear and never have i seen a prettier child she placed the sleeping infant in skyes arms skye looked down at her baby it was a lovely little creature with a mop of damp dark hair long dark eyelashes pinktinted cheeks and a red bow of a mouth the skin was as fair as skyes own a daughter she said softly i didnt expect a daughter what will you name her my dear inquired dame cecily gently skye gazed out the windows opposite her bed in the garden beyond the spring flowers were all in bloom and a willow tree drooped its newly sprouted yellow green leaves by a small pond i shall call her willow she said it is fitting that khalid el beys daughter be named after the tree of mourning willow though she had been born in sorrow was a child of gladness everyone in the house adored the infant from her mother to the lowliest little maid all tried to make her smile when willow was five months old skye decided it was time to go to london robert small had made only one brief trip away down the coast of africa in the ten months since he had brought skye to his home though it had pleased his sister to have him home he itched to take the mermaid off on a good long voyage first however he had to go to london and see if lord de grenville could obtain letters giving him royal patronage skye was prepared to invest in this latest venture and she too desired to go to london the mermaid was berthed in plymouth on the channel side of devon jean would go to london with skye but marie would remain at wren court caring for both babies she had already taken over the nursing of willow her large peasant breasts producing more than enough milk for the two children to dame cecilys relief skye considered the mild air of devon more salubrious for her daughter than the climate of london dame cecily could not have been happier skye had become the daughter she had never had and willow her grandchild it pained her to part with one but to part with both would have broken her heart skye was feeling the pain of separation as well oh i wish you would come with me dame cecily i have so much to do and your help would be invaluable heaven only knows what condition the house is in and i shall probably have to refurnish it promise me that when it is done youll come up to london with marie and the children of course i will my child lord bless me ive not been to londontown since i was a girl and thats thirty years past i believe ive a hankering to go again and ill come when youve got your house in order they rode out from wren court on a bright early autumn morning skye had lingered with willow loam to leave the baby finally robbie had shouted at her in exasperation dammit lass the sooner you get to london the sooner she can be with you again skye kissed her daughter and mounting her horse rode off the countryside through which they traveled was hilly they rode by grain fields ready for harvesting meadows of sheep and devon cattle and thriving orchards ahead of them the flat granite tableland of dartmoor thrust up from the rolling hills and it was there in an inn called the rose and anchor that they spent the night when they had arrived the inn was empty so robbie decided they could eat in the taproom but as the meal was served a party of riders arrived and trooped noisily into the inn damn muttered robbie irritably i wish id asked for a private room theyre noblemen and if they get rowdy were in for it suddenly a voice boomed across the room and a man detached himself from the crowd robert small is that you you old sea trout robbies eyes lit up and he quickly stood my lord de grenville it is good to see you join us in a cup of wine de grenville had reached the table your manners robbie he chided youve not introduced the lady to me yet the sea captain flushed your pardon skye may i present lord richard de grenville my lord this is senora goya del fuentes the widow of my late algerian business associate i am escorting her and her secretary jean morlaix to her house in london skye slowly extended her hand and de grenville kissed it my lord madam a pleasure i assure you i find it most reprehensible of robbie to have such extraordinary luck luck my lord to be escorting quite the loveliest woman ive ever seen to london skye laughed as she blushed my lord de grenville i fear youll quite overwhelm me with your flattery please do sit down and join us youre not spanish he observed as he seated himself no i am irish de grenville poured himself a goblet of wine i thought so most outrageously beautiful women in the world tell me madam how do you find england is this your first trip here yes it is and i find england a joy sir i have been living at robbies home for close to a year now skye was enciente with her husbands child when we first ar rived robbie explained hastily lest de grenville misunderstand a son or a daughter madam a daughter her name is willow i have left her at wren court with dame cecily and her wet nurse i know not in what condition i will find my husbands house so until i have time to refurbish it she is best left in devon across the room where de grenvilles party of friends were sprawled about a table one man lean blond and arrogantly handsome stared boldly at skye she was incensed when he caught her eye and then raised an elegant eyebrow in a manner that could have but one meaning it was as plain a request as though he had spoken aloud and just as insulting angrily she turned away tossing her head and listened once more to what de grenville was saying very wise madam london is not a town for tender creatures so i have heard my lord replied skye then tell me sir who is the gentleman in your party who stares at me so rudely the one with the face of an angel de grenville didnt even bother turning around her description was enough lord southwood madam the earl of lynmouth robbie please escort me to my room and arrange to have a tray sent up the earl makes me exceedingly uncomfortable he gazes at me as he would a tray of sweetmeats she stood casually brushing her long riding skirt free of crumbs my lord de grenville i bid you good night she held out her slim hand and he kissed it madam i hope we will meet in london now allow me to escort both you and robbie past your ardent admirer but it wasnt to be that easy as they neared the taproom door the earl of lynmouth moved to block their way de grenville grinned give over southwood the lady is leav ing not before were introduced my dear dickon you simply can not hoard all the beauties to yourself de grenville shrugged senora goya del fuentes lord geoffrey southwood now geoff let us pass senora will you share a goblet of wine with me no sir i will not snapped skye she pushed past him and left the taproom robbie in her wake de grenville laughed softly geoff youve been quite properly bested i do believe lord southwood went white about the corners of his mouth who is she dickon the widow of captain smalls business partner shes not spanish her husband was shes irish shes magnificent i intend having her said southwood i have heard that your taste runs to women unable to protect themselves geoff senora goya del fuentes is a very wealthy woman you wont be able to bully her and shell not be bowled over by a few baubles or a cheap gown i wager shell send you packing how much will you wager richard de grenville let a slow smile spread over his face southwood had a magnificent stud stallion that de grenville coveted one years time geoff at the end of that time youll turn over your stud dragons fire to me six months dickon at which time youll turn over to me your magnificently outfitted river barge de grenville winced his barge was the most elegant on the river and even the queen coveted it still he reasoned the beautiful senora goya del fuentes was no lightskirt and she had obviously detested southwood on sight it was unlikely that she would suc cumb and besides he wanted that stallion very much done he said decisively your stallion against my barge the time period to be six months from this day he held out his hand and southwood shook it firmly try not to damage my barge this autumn dickon southwood said mockingly come spring i shall want to take my new mistress cruising on the river i wont geoff and you see that my stallion is well cared for and not overbred the two men parted then each secure in the knowledge that he would soon possess a coveted new toy geoffrey southwood did not know what intrigued him the most the lovely widows beauty her air of breeding or her dislike of him he would enjoy the challenge of seducing and taming her and he would be the envy of london for owning such a fine mistress by fair means or foul southwood vowed he would have her chapter skyes house was located on the strand on the green in the village of chiswick outside of the city of london the last building in the row it was much less pretentious than its neighbors farther down the line were the palaces of such great lords as salisbury and worcester and the bishop of durham they had sailed from plymouth up the coast into the mouth of the thames there the mermaid had anchored in the pool awaiting her chance to dock in london skye jean morlaix and robert small had disembarked and ridden ahead it would be several weeks before the mermaid was assigned a wharf space and robert small trusted his reliable first mate to oversee the ship in his absence skirtingthe main portion of the city they soon arrived at chis wick it was a small and charming village with an excellent inn the swan on the far side of its green here they stopped to refresh themselves with cups of freshly pressed cider warm newly baked bread covered with pink ham and a sharp pale golden cheese skye was ravenous and ate eagerly much to the beaming approval of the fat innkeeper he poured her another foaming goblet of cider be you passing through he queried skye sent him a blinding smile that quite stunned him no she said i own a house here master innkeeper and ive come to live in it which ouse is that madam i thought i knew all the great lords and their families i grew up here you see ever since theres been an inn in chiswick there ave been monypennys in chiswick in fact and here he chuckled his fat belly heaving with mirth no one as ever been quite sure which came first the swan or the monypennys aha ha ha jean and captain small looked askance but skye giggled thus increasing the innkeepers approval of her i am senora goya del fuentes master monypenny the house i own is greenwood the last one on the strand it belonged to my late husband youre spanish his voice was now edged in disapproval my husband was i am irish almost as bad came the reply mon dieuf quel cochon muttered jean master monypenny i will thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head senora goya del fuentes is a good and gentle lady and not to be abused while under my protection robert smalls hand was on his sword the big innkeeper looked down at the little sea captain lord bless me he began to chuckle she must be a fine lady that the ant would challenge the sparrow my apologies maam its just that the memory of bloody mary and her spanish husband dies hard bloody mary the late queen her that was married to philip of spain young queen besss halfsister oh yes of course master monypenny now i understand said skye she had heard the story of the sad daughter of catherine of aragon from dame cecily well i promise you i am nothing like bloody mary my daughter and i have no family left anywhere that we know of and so we have come to england to make a new life english hospitality is famous worldwide the innkeeper ruffled with pride and so it should be maam so it should be youll be quite happy here upon the strand now if i may involve myself in your business for a moment you say your house is the last one in the row tsk the last tenants left it in shameful condition and if youll allow me maam ill have rooms for you and your party set aside the plain fact is that your house is not habitable robbie was the agent not notified to prepare the house for me he was skye the innkeeper shook his head dolefully that would be mr taylor wouldnt it hes a bad un but how were you to know that bad in what way master monypenny asked robert small hes been renting the house out to youngbloods for theiroh dalliances you might say charges em twice what you asks for the house pockets the overage and then collects his commission too and how do you know that hes in the habit of taking a drink here now and then but he cant hold his liquor more than two pints and he begins to talk one night during the late queens reign he bragged about how he was cheating the spaniard who owned the house we had best go and check the house robbie the sea captain nodded i should be grateful master monypenny if you would set aside rooms for us as well as a private dining room i shall require a bath upon our return at once maam remounting their horses they rode across the green and down riversedge street skye was impressed by the great houses that lined the waterside as they neared the end of the street the buildings became less grand however the last three being an elegant mansion a small palace and finally a charming house of mellowed pink brick it was set within a private green park the gates showed rust and hung loosely open robert small pursed his lips pushing open the gates he led the way into the grounds the park was overgrown and unkempt the woodland filled with brambles the lawns waisthigh in weeds when they reached the house they found several windows broken and the front door hanging open on broken hinges master taylor is going to have a lot to answer for growled robbie where the hell is the gatekeeper he should be guarding the premises jean didnt you pay wages last year for a years gatekeeping service oui captain i did but the monies were forwarded to master taylor the agent its neither here nor there now said skye the damage is done let us see if the inside has fared as badly the three entered the house and gasped with shock as they moved from room to room on the main floor then robert small ran quickly upstairs inspecting the second and third floors his face was a thun dercloud when he descended again stripped he roared there isnt a stick of furniture in the entire house nor draperies rugs linens or plate youve been robbed the dirty bastard has taken everything master monypenny knew whereof he spoke observed skye drily i wont be played for a fool robbie master taylor must be caught and prosecuted i imagine however that the furnishings are long gone you were in the house several times robbie do you recall seeing anything of great value just the usual household furnishings then theyre easily replaced thank heavens marie and the children remained in devon come jean robbie back to the swan i am tired and want a bath and nothing can be done here until tomorrow on the following morning skye rode into the city of london she visited the cabinetmaker the draper the silversmith the brass and iron mongers at each stop she said the same thing deliver my order within the week and ill pay you a handsome bonus then she paid in full for the work contracted or items chosen at the swan she interviewed applicants for her household staff and with master monypennys aid employed a mistress burnside as her housekeeper half a dozen housemaids and footmen a master walters for her majordomo and his wife for her cook there were four kitchen girls hired as well as a pot boy mistress burnside had a widowed sister who with her two plain daughters would be the household laundresses the outofhouse staff consisted of a head gardener and head groom each who had two assistants and a gate keeper skye would soon need a nursery staff to look after willow and this would consist of a laundress a nursemaid and one assistant compared to the great houses on the strand hers would be a very modest household skye had inspected her house thoroughly by her second day in london below the main level of the house was a large kitchen that opened out into a small vegetable patch and herb garden there were two fireplaces in the kitchen both with brick ovens one would take a whole side of beef the other smaller one was well suited to pots and breadbaking off to one side of the kitchen was a cool stone buttery and off to the other was a scullery there was a long servants hall with a fireplace and quarters for some of the servants the housekeeper had a private bedchamber as did the majordomo and his wife the cook the four kitchen maids shared a room and the laundress and her two daughters shared one a small alcove set into the chimney wall was padded with a plump pallet and assigned to the little pot boy who was considered too young to be housed with the other male servants the six housemaids would sleep in attic rooms set aside for them the six footmen three grooms and two undergardeners were housed in the stable loft the head garden er and his wife would live in a tiny cottage hidden in the little garden and the gatekeeper and his wife in the little gatehouse jean and marie were given an apartment of their own in one wing of the house marie would continue in her duties as skyes chief tiring woman while the nursery staff watched over both willow and henri the nursery staff would of course sleep in the nursery on the main floor of the house there was a large formal dining hall a small family dining room a reception room and the apartment set aside for jean and his wife the second floor consisted of a library a smaller room for jeans work and two big reception rooms that could be opened into one large room for dancing the third floor of the house held skyes bedchamber dayroom and dressing room besides two guest chambers and the nursery apartments the house was built near the rivers edge but set back enough to allow for a rear garden the walls of which rose up from the water skye had her own private quai this was a distinct advantage for it allowed skye her own barge she immediately commissioned one built and shortly thereafter a bargeman was added to the staff everyone in the house was delighted by this for river travel was often preferable to land especially so in times of unrest the tradesmen with whom skye did business were eager for the bonuses promised within the week the house was filled with all the things she had ordered everything was of the best quality skye had warned the tradesmen that she would not accept shoddy goods she was not aware that many of the goods had been made for others merchants had sent her things that other customers would now have to wait several months for she hurried from room to room directing the hanging of drap eries tapestries and pictures the placement of furniture the rooms began to take on life and finally contented skye walked slowly throughout her house it was well after midnight and the exhausted servants had long since sought their beds she entered each room and looked about with satisfaction the oak furniture gleamed with a polish that only hand rubbing and pure beeswax could give it upon the dark wide floorboards were thick turkey carpets the use of carpets was unusual many homes even those of the wealthy still used rushes mixed with herbs upon the floors there were colorful tapestries and paintings through out the house for captain small was clever at ferreting out those noble but impoverished families who were willing to discreetly sell such items heavy draperies in velvet and silk hung from the leaded casement windows brass sconces adorned the paneled walls silver twinkled on the sideboards the scene was one of elegance and wealth as skye departed each room she snuffed out the beeswax candles carefully she would not allow fat or tallow in the house even in the servants quarters for she disliked the smell there were porce lain bowls of potpourri in all the rooms the river was known after all to stink occasionally she entered her apartment and found daisy who had arrived several days ago dozing by the fire the girl jumped when she saw her mistress daisy you didnt have to wait up but since youre here unlace me and then off to bed with you i dont mind mistress said daisy as she undid skyes gown and helped her out of her petticoats she wisked the clothing into the dressing room and soon was back dipping water from the fireplace kettle into an earthenware pitcher are you sure you dont need me further maam no daisy go to bed the little maid was quickly gone skye sat down wearily and carefully rolled off her gossamer stockings naked she walked across her room and had a leisurely wash with her favorite damask rose soap sliding into an embroidered paleblue silk caftan she extinguished the candles and went to sit in her bedroom window seat facing the river the moon silvered the water she could see a barge pull into the quai two houses down two figures a man and a woman climbed out of the boat and went slowly up the steps to the garden at the top of the stairway they kissed for a long moment then the gentle man picked up the lady and they were lost to view sighing she sought her bed and slept badly the memory of the romantic scene she had watched bumed into her and made her ache skye was twenty years old and for the first time since khalids death over a year ago she deeply wanted a man to love her she rose weeping softly and took a bottle of blackberry brandy from her dayroom sideboard she then crawled back into the window seat and drank herself to sleep next door the owner of the small riverside palace was also wake ful the earl of lynmouth paced his bedroom floor excitedly scarcely able to believe his good fortune not only was his new neighbor the beautiful senora goya del fuentes but he had found a way to victory over de grenville he chuckled he would pay his respects to the lady but if she had not willingly succumbed by twelfth night then he would blackmail her into submission the earl of lynmouth entertained lavishly and his parties were famous he had recently come up to london to see that his house was properly prepared for christmas and twelfth night the queen herself would be attending several seasonal festivities including his twelfth night masque geoffrey had been quite astounded to find mat the beautiful mistress goya del fuentes was the owner of the little jewel of a house at the end of the strand and had watched with interest as the house was refurbished a connoisseur he noted her choices with an approving eye as the tradesmen lugged their merchandise into her house now the time had come for him to make his first move to capture the lady he would woo her gently at first and then if necessary he would threaten her with exposure through a fantastic piece of luck he had discovered her true history he owned a onethird share in a ship that traded in the mideast and when it had returned recently to london he had gone aboard to see to his interests through the bow window of the masters cabin he had seen robert small he asked his captain browne do you know who that man is on the next ship aye my lord that be captain robert small of bideford in devon the mermaid is his ship captain browne drew in on his pipe then gently puffed out a curl of blue smoke robbie small is a lucky devil my lord he neednt go off to sea at all for hes a wealthy man and was born of gentry too but the seas a wanton bitch and when she gets in your blood its hard to rid yourself of her was he born to wealth prodded the earl gently no the family fortunes were pretty low until he went into partnership with the great whoremaster of algiers khalid el bey how they met i dont know but they somehow became friends and the bey backed robbie in several ventures finally when he was on his feet they became equal partners and so they remained for over ten years what happened then the bey was killed a year and a half ago murdered by one of his women bless me he ran the finest cathouses in the east he did the most famous of them was called the house of felicity and the woman who ran it for him finally did him in they say she was jealous of his young wife and thought it was the wife she was stabbing at any rate the young widow soon disappeared and it was discovered that she had sold everything her husband owned the captaingovernor of the casbah fortress went wild with rage hed had his eye on the young widow god help robbie small if he ever sets foot in algiers again for the casbah captain knows small helped the lady skye leave algiers geoffrey southwood felt his heart lurch wildly skye he asked the beys wife her name was skye muna el khalid she herself is another wild tale more wine sir tell me and so captain browne told him all he had heard about skye which was a great deal indeed and when geoffrey left the ship he was elated his coach clattered back through the noisy city streets and he began to plot it was her there could be no mistake and he had her for there was a child the beys child probably robert small did not act like her lover she would probably do anything to protect her child for the childs future would be determined by its familys reputation as long as she was the respectable young widow all would be well she would not want her true story known for her own sake and for the childs yes geoffrey had her geoffrey southwood was a wealthy man although he seldom discussed it his paternal grandmother had been a rich merchants daughter over the past few centuries many noble families had mar ried into the monied middle class to increase their finances the southwood family understood that money was power they were not an important family but their title was an ancient one earned on the field at the battle of hastings the first earl of lynmouth had been geoffroi de sudbois the third son of a noble norman family he had joined duke williams invasion of england in hopes of winning a place for himself and his descendants for there was nothing for him in his native france his oldest brother was his fathers undisputed heir and had three sons of his own the next de sudbois brother had opted for the religious life and was already the valued right hand of his prior the duke of normandys invasion of england was a godsend to geoffroi de sudbois for it offered him a chance to make a place for himself his father gave him warhorses and their equipage along with a small velvet bag of gold when geoffrois oldest brother protested his father said as long as i live what is mine shall be disposed of as i choose when i am gone and it is yours you may dispose of it your way do not be greedy gilles your brother cannot succeed unless he is properly equipped and mounted do you want him to always have nothing to be constantly coming back here coveting your position his mere presence a threat to your boys it will be better for all if he makes a place for himself in england the eldest de sudbois son understood his fathers point and even pressed upon his surprised brother a fat purse of silver marks this purse proved the means by which he recruited himself a small troop of cavalry those who joined him supplied their own horses mail and weapons he paid them one silver mark upon debarkation for england what booty they could take in battle was theirs to keep and there was always a chance to win oneself land and even a title the young seigneur de sudbois and his thirtyfive men made an impressive addition to duke williams invading army even more impressive was the soldier that de sudbois proved himself to be he managed to fight near his duke twice once even preventing a direct attack upon his overlord toward the end of one day he found himself inon the kill of the english king harold duke william of normandy had seen enough of the young lord ling to be both amused and impressed hes a valuable man observed the duke and god knows hes worked hard enough to win a bit of this land for himself ill give him something down in the south toward the west if he can take the land and hold it its his geoffroi de sudbois took and held the little earldom of lynmouth he ruthlessly slew the saxon lord of the holding and all his kin with the exception of the saxons thirteenyearold daughter gwyneth he raped her upon the halls long table and when the girl was proved a virgin he sent for a priest and wed her instantly the practical gwyneth cleaved to her new lord and dutifully sired the next generation within a hundred years de sudbois was anglecized to southwood but through the many generations the ruthlessness of the original norman geoffroi de sudbois and the determination of his saxon wife remained strong traits even down to the sixteenth century geoffrey southwood this earl of lynmouth was twentyeight years old six feet tall he had darkblond hair limegreen eyes and as skye had observed the face of an angel it was a beautiful face yet an entirely masculine one oval the forehead was broad the cheekbones high the nose long and slim the mouth sensuous the chin slightly pointed his fair skin was tanned and because his face had no flaws he kept it smoothshaven his wavy hair was cut short his body was the lean one of a man used to regular exercise he had been married twice at twelve he had wed a neighboring eightyearold heiress she died two years later of smallpox along with her parents this left him considerably richer having inherited money lands and the barony of lynton sexually active he had mourned his wife for the shortest time possible and then wed again the second wife was five years his senior painfully plain but very wealthy an orphaned heiress her guardians had thought themselves stuck with the poor girl until geoffrey southwoods father offered for her for his son mary bowen was of an old and noble family more important her lands adjoined those of the earl of lynmouths on her wedding day the poor plain bride showed herself enam ored of her handsome bridegroom and grateful to have been rescued from the shame of spinsterhood on her wedding night however her opinion changed her shrieks could be heard all over the castle as geoffrey southwood battered his way through her maidenhead and impregnated her during the next six years she delivered a child every ten months all but the first were daughters and each was as plain as her mother in disgust geoffrey finally stopped visiting his wifes bed his seven plain daughters were more than enough for one man to dower mary bowen southwood was more than content to remain in devon she feared her husband after the horror of her wedding night she had learned to lay quietly during their mating occasionally even simulating the response expected of her when it was first apparent that she was pregnant he had treated her in a kindly fashion she was glad to have pleased him especially when henry was born but then had come mary elizabeth and catherine the week after little phillipas birth he had been so furious that he slapped her shouting that she had done it deliberately that shed give him a son next time or he would know the reason why she had learned fear in her subsequent pregnancies susan was born next geoffrey was in london frightened but dutiful she sent him word a six months silence followed when he finally arrived home he handed down one final ultimatum produce another son madam or youll spend the rest of your life here in devon with your brood of daughters what of henry she dared to ask henry goes to the shrewsburys household he said flatly when the twins gwyneth and joan were bom the countess found herself and all of her daughters moved from lynmouth castle to lynton court geoffrey southwood had had enough from that time on he saw his wife and family once yearly at michaelmas when he arrived to hand over the money needed to run their little household for the following year he refused to make matches for his daughters on the premise that they were all like their mother and he would not be responsible for other mens dis appointment when the girls produced a string of daughters as their mother had done mary southwood was frankly relieved to be rid of her husband but she worried over her girls through personal sacrifice and great frugality she managed to save half of what he gave her each year added to a small secret hoard left her by her late guardians she slowly built up small dowries for her daughters she taught them the arts of housewifery there would be no grand matches but she would get them all settled eventually fate helped her out when geoffrey southwood stopped even his yearly visit delegating that chore to his majordomo the angel earl as he was known spent his time following the court the young queen elizabeth enjoyed his elegant beauty and sharp wit even more she appreciated his astute knowledge of business and overseas trade trade was where englands future lay and the educated queen needed all the advice about it she could obtain elizabeth had already demonstrated herself to be a working monarch and nothing escaped her sharp eyes or ears geoffrey southwood might have an appetite for the ladies but he deliberately went out of his way to avoid her maidsofhonor and his respect for her was much appreciated by the vain young queen best of all geoffrey came to court without the encumbrance of a wife and was therefore free to play one of elizabeths gallants the next day dawned bright and blue as perfect an october day as one could wish for skye spent the morning indoors overseeing her household which was finally beginning to run smoothly then working with jean and robert small in setting up a new trading company later she eagerly snatched up her flower basket and garden shears and escaped to the beckoning outdoors the gardener and his assistants had done miracles in a few short weeks gone were the waisthigh weeds and brambles brick walks had been discovered beneath the overgrowth as well as small re flecting pools and rose bushes pruning had brought forth an abun dance of late blooms which skye now clipped damn she swore suddenly jabbing her thumb on a thorn then popping it into her mouth to soothe it a deep amused masculine chuckle sent her whirling about to her anger and embarrassment the handsome earl of lynmouth was sitting on the mediumhigh wall separating her house from the next he leaped down gracefully and took her hand just a prick my pet he said skye snatched back her hand furiously what were you doing on my wall she demanded i live on the other side of it he answered smoothly in fact my pet you and i own the wall in common the building next to yours is lynmouth house it was built by my grandfather who also built this charming little house for his mistress a goldsmiths daugh ter oh said skye coldly shocked how very interesting my lord now if you will please leave she managed geoffrey southwood smiled ruefully and skye noticed that the corners of his strangely green eyes were crinkled with laugh lines now mistress goya del fuentes he said i realize that we got off on the wrong foot and i will apologize now for having stared so rudely at you at the rose and anchor surely however you will not be too hard on me i cannot be the first man who has ever been stunned by your extravagant beauty now can i skye flushed damn the man he really was charming and if they were neighbors she could hardly continue to snub him the corners of her mouth turned up in a small smile very well my lord i accept your apology and you will join me for a late supper skye laughed you are really incorrigible lord southwood geoffrey he corrected you are still incorrigible geoffrey she sighed and my name is skye a most unusual name how did you come by it i dont know my parents both died when i was young and the nuns who raised me could never tell me it was said so naturally that he was thrown perhaps she wasnt the whoremaster of algiers widow after all and was geoffrey your fathers name she was asking no he was robert geoffrey was the first of the southwoods he came from normandy with duke william almost five hundred years ago how wonderful to know the history of ones family she said wistfully you havent yet told me you will dine with me tonight he said skye bit her lip i dont know she murmured i really dont think i should i realize its a bit unorthodox asking you to dine late but i must attend the queen at greenwich and shell not let me go till late then perhaps we should dine on another day when you have more time she replied have pity on me fair skye i dance constant attendance on her majesty and it is only rarely that i have any time my chef is an artist but cooking for one is little challenge unless i provide him with a guest soon i shall lose him and how can i give my famous twelfth night revel without a chef so you really cant refuse me can you she had to laugh he seemed so boyish and so very handsome in the opennecked cream silk shirt he was not at all the arrogant nobleman who had accosted her several weeks before i should not she said but i will i would not like to be held responsible by all of london for the defection of your chef i will come for you myself he replied then he caught her hand to his lips and brushed it lightly youve made me the happiest of men tonight grasping at a heavy vine growing against the wall he pulled himself up and quickly disappeared over the top shrugging skye picked up her flower basket and returned to the house if she was to be ready when he came this evening she had a great deal to do she stopped and told herself that this was just a simple dinner not a romantic liaison robert small emerged just then from the library well lass were done now may i treat you to dinner at the swan tavern up the river oh robbie im having dinner with lord southwood he is it seems my neighbor that knave christs toenail skye are you mad now robbie he has apologized for his rudeness i have no friends here in london and youll soon be off again i must start somewhere he has a wife stated robert small flatly i suspected so but i do not seek a romantic entanglement with geoffrey robert smalls bushy grayblack eyebrows shot up geoffrey is it well my lass so youll know a bit about the man attend me his first wife died when she was a child his second wife is a woman of no beauty but much wealth shes borne him one son and seven daughters and for her perfidy she and her daughters are exiled to lynton court her childhood home he sends his steward each mi chaelmas to pay the servants there for the year cold bastard id say hes rich though at least we dont have to worry about him being after your money his dour concern over fortunehunting men made her laugh she ruffled his thinning hair dear robbie youre a good watchdog and i thank you you and dame cecily and willow are my entire family i promise to be very careful in my relationship with lord southwood but its only a late supper ill stay the night skye its best you have a man in the house thank you robbie now id best prepare myself and giving him a quick kiss on the cheek she ran upstairs to her own apartment daisy she called have a footman set up my bath and lay out the peacockblue velvet gown with the gold thread flowered under skirt as the footmen lugged the buckets of steaming water up the back stairs from the kitchen skye sat at her dressing table sliding neck laces through her slender fingers she decided upon a double strand of perfectly matched palepink pearls from which hung a teardrop diamond of slightly deeper pink the necklace had been khalids gift it no longer hurt quite so much to think about khalid the footmen departed and she undressed slowly daisy took each garment and skye reached for some tortoiseshell hairpins and se cured her dark hair it would not be necessary to wash it tonight as she had done so yesterday in a mixture of fresh rainwater and essence of roses now she walked naked across the room and poured some of the same rose essence into her tub daisy averted her brown eyes she could simply not get used to her mistresss habit of bathing regularly let alone bathing naked the young woman liked her mistress however and so she bore with her eccentricities skye chuckled you can open your eyes now daisy im safely in the tub oh mum i dont think ill ever get used to it havent you ever looked at yourself daisy women have very lovely bodies but men are never quite so pretty oh mum how you talk look at myself indeed if me mother had ever caught me doing such a thing shed have beat me black and blue skye smiled to herself and wondered why the englishno she amendedwhy the europeans were so afraid of their bodies then she laughed at herself for though she could not remember it she too was european but she couldnt imagine herself bathing only a few times a year and then in a cotton shift she picked up the damask rose soap built up a rich lather and washed her face she lathered the rest of her lithe body slowly and thoroughly summoning an almost unbearably sensuous feeling good lord she thought as she watched the nipples of her breasts harden im alive again and i want a man to love she blushed with the memory of how geoffrey southwood had looked at her this afternoon stepping hastily from the tub she took the big warmed towel from daisy and began to dry herself bring me a light wool caftan she said its too early to dress yet ill sleep for a bit slipping on the caftan she added leave the tub till later ill rest now and ring when i want you go get your dinner the little maid curtseyed and left the room skye lay upon her bed drawing a fur robe over herself geoffrey southwood had a finely turned leg she thought and those lime green eyes had undoubtedly melted many a heart she was much too vulnerable to be having dinner with him oh why had she accepted the invitation she was lonely perhaps that was why khalid had been dead almost two years and suddenly she was again aware of the fact that she was a woman a woman who up until her husbands death had been well loved she would have to be very careful lest she present the earl of lynmouth with the wrong impres sion of herself she drifted into a light sleep and awakened at daisys touch the earl of lynmouths footman is below mum his lordship will be here in half an hour skye stretched languidly fetch me a basin of rose water daisy is my gown ready yes mum skye bathed her face hands and neck having shed the caftan with averted eyes daisy handed her mistress her silk undergarments lacing the little boned busk up tightly smoothing down the several petticoats the last one threaded through with blue ribbons as was her silk underblouse skye slipped on her new knitted silk stockings which were of the palest blue with a tiny silver thread vine pattern her garters were also blue with deep pink rosettes daisy carefully slipped the goldthreaded underskirt over skyes head and laced it up lastly came the beautiful peacockblue velvet gown split to show the embroidered underskirt the puffed sleeves were slashed to reveal a soft creamy sheer silk underblouse skye slipped on her blue satin slippers and stood before the pier glass a faint smile on her lips she slid the pearls around her neck watch ing with fascination as the pink diamond nestled in the deep valley between her breasts yes it was perfect daisy held up a tray of rings but skye selected only a large baroque pearl and placed it on her right hand she held out her hands and was pleased with the simple effect the single ring created her hands were especially beautiful slender with long wellshaped fin gers the nails delicately rounded and buffed to a healthy pink she gazed at her image again i am beautiful she thought then she laughed softly his lordship is here mum said daisy the footman has just come up with word have the footman tell his lordship i shall be down directly and escort him into the small receiving room have walter pour him some wine daisy curtseyed yes mum skye moved slowly to her dressing table and reached for her scent bottle she daubed the rose fragrance on all the available pulse points remembering yasmin as she did dear god she thought if there is a paradise please dont let yasmin be khalids houri i forgave her for the sake of both our immortal souls but i couldnt bear it if she was with him when i cant be the tears sprang to her eyes and she quickly snatched up a laceedged handkerchief then fixing a little smile on her lips she left to join the earl of lynmouth geoffrey southwood had declined both a seat in the receiving room and the wine with undisguised admiration he now watched as skye descended the staircase reaching the bottom she swept him an elegant curtsey good evening my lord southwood he admired her lovely breasts which momentarily swelled over her seemingly modest square neckline and a good even to you senora goya del fuentes i hope you dont mind but ive arranged for the door in our garden wall to be opened i assume you wont object to a stroll in the gardens no i dont mind a stroll he offered her his arm and they moved through the house and out into the evening the air was mild and the night sky clear his slim hand covered hers and as they walked he said quietly are you aware of how beautiful you are there isnt a woman at court who compares with you even the queen she teased her majesty is in a class by herself my pet no one compares with elizabeth tudor bravo my lord earl the perfect courtiers reply she mocked mischievously i am the perfect courtier skye for only by the queens favor can an ambitious man progress you are titled intelligent and wealthy she said why should it matter to you if the queen favors you the question pleased him for it showed she had intelligence oddly enough he liked intelligent women the southwoods have never been important in the history of england skye we won our lands with william the conqueror and our title with richard coeur de lion in the holy land that particular southwood upon re turning to england advised his family to remain in devon and not go gadding about weve taken his advice nevertheless probably thanks to my merchant antecedents i seem to be an ambitious sort and court is the place for ambitious men the queen has need of them and what of ambitious women geoffrey he smiled as they walked through the wall gate into his garden what are your ambitions my pet if you seek a titled lover then im your man she ignored the remark ive just formed a trading company with robert small it would help if i had a royal charter help me get it and ill give you a twopercent interest in it the earl of lynmouth was astounded by god sweetheart you are ambitious he laughed im not sure if im shocked or simply amazed skye was as surprised at herself as was southwood where in heavens name had that idea come from and where had she gotten the nerve to suggest such a thing having ventured it however she decided to follow it through well my lord she said coolly what say you she was serious thought southwood amused they had reached lynmouth house by now and he escorted her up the steps of the marble terrace into a small room with a lovely bow window that overlooked the river and the gardens a candlelit table had been set up in the bow let us have some wine he said pouring a burgundy and hand ing her a goblet now mistress what guarantee do you give me that ill see a return on my investment captain small was my husbands partner in algiers kha diego financed him and our secretary jean morlaix kept the rec ords it was up to robert to handle the rest of it and he did he was my husbands partner for ten years nothing has changed the goya del fuentes money will finance him jean morlaix remained in my employ after diegos death i do not need a royal charter but it would help enormously what do you risk my lord neither gold nor prestige you waste more money gambling if you would prefer set a price upon your aid and i will pay you then you risk nothing she finished scornfully ah vixen he chuckled so you would shame me into it eh youre a damned hard bargainer but ill see what i can do after all a twopercent share in a good trading company is not to be overlooked inwardly she heaved a sigh of relief and with a casual air sipped at her wine his mouth twitched with suppressed amusement for geoffrey southwood could appreciate a jest on himself better than most men she had outbluffed him the little devil what a woman she was he thought to himself the thought of her in his bed sent shivers down his spine for now however he would be a gentleman for to move too quickly with this lady could cost him de grenvilles barge as well as the beauty herself the footmen began serving the meal which began with a silver bowl of cold raw oysters skye happily cracked open the shells and swallowed half a dozen luscious icy oysters southwood ate two to her every one the next course was bright yellow mussels in white wine with a dijon mustard sauce thin slices of dover sole on a bed of crisp watercress accompanied by very thin slices of lemons imported from the south of france and tiny pink shrimp broiled in herb butter skye ate sparingly but tasted of everything the earl had been quite righthis chef was a mqwter the second course cleared away the third was set on the side board three ribs of juicy beef with horseradish sauce and a large plump pink ham vied for attention alongside a platter of small quail roasted golden and stuffed with fruit salad of new lettuces venison slices in red wine and a rabbit pastry rounded out the third course skye directed a footman to serve her one of the quail some ham a slice of rabbit pie and a dish of salad the earl who sampled everything looked on approvingly i like a woman who enjoys her food he grinned his green eyes bright but keeps her figure she shot back aye a pretty woman is far more pleasant to gaze upon sweet heart is your wife a pretty woman mary not really shes too tiny like a spanish dwarf her hair is no real color her eyes a pale brown her complexion sallow was your husband handsome aye she said softly he was very handsome but more im portant he was kind and good how long have you been widowed two years now you should think of remarrying skye youre far too lovely to remain alone i know few people here my lord and besides there is no one who could take my lords place if you dont have friends in england he ventured why did you leave algiers the turkish governor decided i should make him an admirable wife since i did not choose to marry him it became necessary to leave none of my lords real friends would have dared to protect me i was helpless against that powerful beast but he got nothing of my lords neither his widow nor his wealth i shall build that wealth and make it even greater my little willow will be very wealthy he smiled slowly at her you are an ambitious wench sweet heart but damme if i dont approve the queen is ambitious too and though some men may be fearful of such women im not the last course was offered then ripe pears covered with me ringue and baked to a faint golden brown thin sugar wafers and a clear sweet wine the earl apologized for the simplicity of the dessert as there were only two diners he had suggested to his chef that he limit the sweets when she had spooned up the last of her dessert skye sat back in her chair her sapphire eyes half closed and smiled southwood laughed you look like a wellfed cat i am my lord and i must have the recipe for the quail stuffing it was delicious its yours but come sweetheart up with you well walk in the gardens by the river to settle our meal he escorted her outside after first dropping his black velvet cloak about her the night had turned chilly the full moon silvered every thing and a faint mist was beginning to rise from the thames they walked in silence watching as a brightly lit barge went by hearing laughter drift across the water a steady measured beat of oars and a single lantern announced the approach of the enterprising waterman who offered taxi service to those who wanted to go up or downriver they stood watching the moonlit water and after a while geoffrey said softly i would not offend you but i would kiss you no one but my husband has ever kissed me she whispered hes gone sweetheart was the hoarse reply and tipping her pale face firmly toward him he touched his warm mouth to hers he kissed her gently but she could sense the desire that he held firmly in check the tip of his tongue licked at the edges of her mouth sending a shiver through her awakening the long unsatisfied passions he held her tightly his masculine scent assaulting her senses she began to relax within the circle of his arms he was as big and tall as khalid had been and very male then gently as suddenly as he had kissed her he released her and whispered softly i will take you home sweetheart lest i do something that would lose me your friendship and without another word he took her arm and walked with her back through the wall gate across her gardens and into her house in the moonlit library she gazed openly at him and her musical voice said firmly but softly kiss me just once more geoffrey a quick smile touched his mouth and then he bent to meet her lips again this time he allowed his passions a looser rein and the pres sure of his mouth forced her lips apart his tongue ran swiftly along her teeth pushing through finding her silken tongue and caressing it with his own to skyes shock her own passions rose swiftly fiercely from deep within her her tongue fenced skillfully with his and she quivered at the fire and ice racing through her veins his big hands caught her face and he kissed her again this time very tenderly then his smooth fingers trailed down her slender neck to drift along the swelling tops of her breasts and she moaned softly no sweetheart he said quietly theres no honor in taking a vulnerable woman and you are very vulnerable right now and silently he disappeared through the french doors and she was alone skye stood very still rigid with shock she had nearly thrown herself at him and had he not been the gentleman he wasshivering she made her way upstairs once within the safety of her room she stood for a bit clutching geoffreys cloak about her it carried the scent of orris root and she buried her face within the sable collar trying to quiet her pounding heart are you all right mum she started daisy you neednt have waited up for me and who would help you with your gown i should like to know daisy drew the cloak from skye his lordships skye nodded ha aint he the gallant one yes he is said skye a little regretfully daisy prattled on as she helped her mistress disrobe they say hes left a trail of broken hearts from here to devon highborn or low they all loves the angel earl she looked slyly at her mis tresss flushed cheeks they say hes a grand lover and lord knows you have no husband to answer to mum shame daisy skye broke away from her reverie long enough to remember how young her maid was you take on london man ners and morals too quickly i think it not wise of you beware lest i send you back to devon oh mum i meant no harm but with him so handsome and ye so bonny she trailed off her head hanging lower and lower with such a woebegone expression that skye almost laughed she sent daisy off to her bed cautioning her to think on her sins grateful to be alone skye slowly washed her face and hands and cleaned her teeth sliding a simple mauve silk nightgown over her naked form she climbed into bed dear god how she had responded to the earls kisses and he had known it she trembled what kind of a woman was she to respond so fervently she began to weep softly ashamed of her wantonness ashamed of her inability to re main faithful to the memory of her beloved husband when at last she fell asleep it was an exhausted and restless sleep the next day as skye sat holloweyed sipping turkish coffee in the library with robert small there arrived a messenger in the greenandwhite livery of the earl of lynmouth he flourished a bow and presented her with an exquisitely carved rectangular ebony box the captain raised an inquisitive eyebrow as skye accepted the box and lifted the lid on the red velvet lining lay one perfect carved ivory rose its stem and leaves wrought from green gold beneath it was a folded sheet of vellum it read in memory of a perfect evening geoffrey a pink flush rose in her cheeks but she said merely convey my deepest thanks to lord southwood the footman bowed himself from the library so remarked the captain when they were alone again the evening went well i would not have believed it judging by your woebegone expression skye perhaps the gift is by way of an apology you neednt worry robbie she handed him the earls note perusing it he looked back up at her then what is it lass why are you so troubled oh robbie he asked if he might kiss me andi let him and you found it distasteful nooo she wailed oh robbie i liked it thats whats wrong and worse i wanted him to make love to me how could i whatkind of wanton am i christs blessed nightshirt roared the little man he thought a moment his head in his hands and then he began listen to meskye i sometimes forget that damned memory of yours still hasgaps in it khalid has been dead for two years and it is time you found yourself another man youre not expected to remain true to his memory forever there is nothing wrong in what you felt god almighty youre a beautiful young woman lass and its natural you responded to the earl hes a handsome devil try your wings with him if he attracts you but remember thishes a married man dont get hurt oh robbie how could you even suggest such a thing my lord khalid khalid is dead skye he would be the first one to tell you to go on with your life he wouldnt want you to bury yourself along with him but robbie i dont love lord southwood lord lass i should hope not hes married but i still want him to make love to me he began to laugh what you feel for the earl is desire lust passion sometimes those feelings go along with love but more often not the churches would like us to feel guilty about such emotions but dont you do it those feelings are human nature you wont have them with every man you meet so dont fret he put a friendly arm about her skye lass i know im many years older but if having the protection of marriage and my name would make you feel safe id gladly marry you id ask nothing of you it would be in name only she was stunned why robbie how kind you are you always have been since our first meeting what a good man you are thank you but i must stand on my own two feet i somehow feel that khalid would want me to be strong and independent aye lass i think he would but should you ever change your mind the offer stands open remember that she bent and kissed his cheek i do love you robbie but not the way a woman loves a man i could not marry you even for safetys sake but never stop being my friend i wont lass i wont he said quietly thinking i owe kha lid more than i can ever repay and watching over you is such a small thing lord god let her find happiness the fierce man prayed chapter ever since elizabeth tudor had ascended the throne of england the earl of lynmouth had held a masqued ball on twelfth night not the first year however for queen mary had died on the morning of november and twelfth night had been only seven weeks later the court was still in mourning for her this year would be the third time the earls fete would be held and invitations were eagerly sought skye received her invitation on the morning of new years day geoffrey southwood came calling and planned to deliver it himself she had not seen him since that midnovember night but she had dreamed of his kisses ever since she hurried from her own apartments where she had dressed to the secondfloor receiving room her burgundy velvet gown was offset by exquisite delicate ecru lace along the sleeves the square neckline was low and bordered by the same lace a little above it dangled a necklace of small rubies and pearls her midnight hair was parted in the center and fell in soft curls italian fashion about her shoulders it gave her a charmingly youthful appearance my lord earl a happy new year to you she cried gaily sweeping into the richly furnished receiving room dear heaven he was so incredibly handsome dressed all in black velvet trimmed with sable wearing a great heavy gold pendant about his neck mistress goya del fuentes a happy year to you also his gleaming green eyes swept over her christs bones she was beautiful i have brought you a small gift he said she colored becomingly my lord it is not necessary and i have nothing for you i will take a kiss sweetheart for one of your kisses is worth more than anything else oh before she could protest he swept her masterfully into his arms and took possession of her lips the blood sang roared and pounded in her ears and she matched him kiss for kiss until they were both breathless her breasts began to swell with longing the nipples chafing against her silk chemise his mouth scorched down the side of her neck to her shoulder then across the tops of her breasts which threatened to burst the confines of the burgundy gown i want to make love to you he said softly i know she answered breathlessly but i need more time i have known no man but my late husband and i am confused and afraid i wont force you sweetheart rape holds no charm for me he led her to the brocade settle and they sat together he drew a small jewelers box from his left pocket i have been on constant call to her majesty he explained we kept christmas at hampton court but the queen is now at whitehall and i was able to get away for a while i have bought these because i thought they matched your eyes skye took the proffered box she opened it without taking her eyes from him inside the box were a pair of round sapphire earrings that dangled from two tiny gold beads she lifted one up to the bright morning sunlight and like a prism it caught the light and twinkled a rainbow back at her the sapphires were among the finest shed ever seen and certainly indian my lord i cannot they are far too valuable she sighed regretfully geoffrey sweetheart and i beg you not to be silly what harm is there in two friends exchanging gifts on new years day but i have nothing for you she protested again nothing have you not given me the hope that someday we might share love between us and your sweet kisses are far more precious to me than jewels come love let me fasten the sapphires into your little ears his hands brushed her curls back making her shiver and he carefully set the earrings in their places perfection he said skye faced the pier glass turning this way and that to admire the sparkling richly blue stones damn you she said softly theyre beautifuland i love them he chuckled im happy to see you exhibit even the tiniest bit of greed sweet skye now love ive something else for you before i go an invitation to my twelfth night masque will you come perhaps captain small will escort you the queen will be there i have not yet broached the subject of a royal charter for your trading company but i shall do so before the ball and i will endeavor to present you to her majesty that evening oh geoffrey how lovely of course i shall come and robbie shall be my escort though i doubt i can get him into anything overly elegant robbie takes no pleasure in lavish dressing he nodded satisfied i must get back to whitehall now sweet heart he rose and she moved toward him he towered over her making skye feel very small as she gazed up at him his long fingers trailed smoothly over her upturned face im a patient man as long as the prize is worth the wait my pet i could disappoint you geoffrey she frowned up at him her face intent i think not skye i think not he brushed her lips lightly with his what would you like for twelfth night my lord you must not spoil me sweetheart ive not even begun to but i shall until twelfth night she hadnt time to reply before he nodded and turning left the room without another word geoffrey southwood strode down to the river bank and hailed a waterman to take him the short distance back to the palace white hall he said climbing into the little boat and seating himself aye me lord the waterman said as he pushed off into the stream im going to enjoy de grenvilles barge very much the earl said softly to himself then he grew somber it was no longer a game to his surprise his heart had become deeply involved he had not been entirely truthful in letting skye believe that the queen had kept him at hampton court there had been several occasions over the past few weeks when he might have returned home but he had chosen not to because he had wanted time to think she had been so very vulnerable that november night and he could have taken her easily she was young she had known a great love widowed two years she was now obviously ready for a man his bet with de grenville might have been won then and there but she had trembled faintly in his arms and somehow he couldnt dishonor her geoffrey was amazed at himself for he had never been soft or overly concerned with the feelings of others when he had returned to his house that night he had found a plump little maid bringing wood to his bedchamber his green eyes narrowed speculatively for desire rode him fiercely he slid an arm about her little waist and she giggled whats your name lass poll mlud how old are you thirteen st thomass day past mlud are you willing aye sir are you a virgin nay sir she said as she shed her blouse revealing breasts generous for one so young her skirts and petticoats rapidly fol lowed and she was naked there were no preliminaries he loosened his codpiece and pull ing her to the bed pushed her down and fell on her he pumped into her methodically until she cried her pleasure the ache in his manhood was finally soothed rolling off her he lay quietly for a moment and then rose from the bed drawing a gold piece from his purse he gave it to her run along now poll the girl gathered up her garments and giving him a saucy smile ran from the bedroom he sighed now with the memory he had been physically ap peased but by no means satisfied it was skye he had wanted there was an innocence about her though she had been married widowed and was a mother that innocence made him want to love skye not betray her there was no doubt about it the earl of lynmouth was feeling the pangs of real love for the first time in his life robert small was not thrilled by the invitation to the masque dammit skye im no gallant to be escorting you now robbie stop grumbling geoffrey suggested it himself though i warned him youd fuss the queen will be there and he has promised to present us his weathered face softened a little well id like to meet young bess i would what must i wear nothing overly ornate i promise i have decided to go as night your costume will match mine ill have them done so you need go only for one or two fittings with the tailor very well poppet i cant let you go alone else those elegant court popinjays overwhelm you she kept her word and on the night of the masque robert small found himself dressed quite simply though very elegantly indeed in a black velvet doublet sewn with tiny silver brilliants and edged in silver lace at the neck and sleeves the short round black breeches were lined in stiff horsehair to puff them out he wore black silk stockings and thicksoled black leather shoes with silver rosettes his short cape was also of black velvet lined in cloth of silver and trimmed in sable skye presented him with a beautiful golden sword its handle sprinkled with small sapphires rubies and diamonds to her vast amusement he swaggered before the receivingroom pier glass a little smile playing across his lips do you think you might crow she teased he reddened ah give over skye but damned if i dont look as good as any dandy you do i only wish dame cecily could see you thank god she cant id never hear the end of it shes always trying to rig me out for some party or other but ive avoided her so far now dont you tell on me skye laughed all right robbie ill keep this a secret he sighed turned from the mirror then eyed her critically isnt your neckline a bit low no robbie it isnt she said softly its the height of fashion now let me have the mirror if you can tear yourself away he sniffed in mock offense and she stuck her tongue out at him ill see the coach is ready mistress peacock he said striding grandly from the room skye stood quietly gazing at her image her black velvet dress was magnificent and she knew she should eclipse every woman at the masque the low square neckline was unrelieved by any lace at all but offered a very daring show of white breasts instead the sleeves full to just below the elbow were slashed to show silver lace inserts the silver lace was repeated at her wrists the black velvet bellshaped skirt parted to reveal a black brocade underskirt which had moons stars planets and comets embroidered on it in silver pearls and diamonds her black silk stockings with their silver lace rosette garters were sewn with tiny diamond brilliants as were her narrow pointed highheeled black silk shoes her hair parted in the center was arranged in a soft chignon at the nape of her neck this new french fashion would also set her apart from the other women at the masque they would still be wearing their hair puffed out at each side her pearlanddiamond hair ornaments were shaped like stars and tiny crescent moons her necklace was a magnificently opulent display of bluewhite diamonds there was a matching bracelet and in her ears were pearshaped diamonds that fell from baroque pearls on the fingers of her left hand she wore rings set with a great flashing round diamond a heartshaped ruby and a sapphire on her right hand was a large irregularly shaped baroque pearl and a squarecut em erald her eyes were highlighted with just a touch of blue kohl but her cheeks were pink with excitement and needed no artifice her perfume had been made this past summer from the damask roses at wren court and sent up to london by dame cecily at christmas her mirror told her she was perfection and for the first time in months skye felt completely confident despite the fact that tonight when she arrived at the earls house she would be entering a new and alien world ready lass she whirled around and picking up her silver mask said brightly im ready robbie he carefully draped a sablelined and trimmed long cape about her shoulders and descending the stairs together they walked swiftly from the house to the coach how silly re marked skye when i live so nearby to have to take my coach you could hardly walk that wouldnt make a grand entrance at all now would it the beautiful mysterious senora goya del fuentes should make a good first impression i can guarantee that within the next halfhour every noble popinjay at court will be falling over himself to meet you oh robbie she laughed you sound like a suspicious father the coach quickly reached the gates of lynmouth house and drove up the drive to the brightly lit palace arriving at the front door skye became aware for the first time of the grandeur of the building the darkred brick palace stood four stories high towering over the river and its own beautiful carefully designed gardens built early in the reign of henry viii it had all the sprawling boisterous magnificence of the monarch himself it was considered a perfect example of tudor architecture footmen in the azure and gold colors of the southwood family ran to open the carriage door and help the occupants out skye took robbies arm and entered the big marble foyer where a footman hurried forward to take skyes cloak several women guests were standing nearby and as her gown was revealed they gasped the corners of her mouth twitched but she feigned indifference slipping her hand through robbies arm again they began to ascend the wide staircase well done lass he murmured softly and she winked mis chievously at him they gained the landing and stood in the wide arch to the ballroom waiting until the majordomo asked names please sir robert small and senora goya del fuentes skyes dark feathery eyebrows shot up sir robert indeed once again robbie had managed to surprise her sir robert small and senora goya del fuentes called out the majordomo and suddenly the room became quiet and they faced a sea of upturned faces slowly the two blackclad figures descended the three wide steps geoffrey southwood resplendent in white and gold came forward to take skyes hands and kiss them she felt a delicious tingle race through her damme madam you outshine every woman here good evening sir robert i see you decided to use your title tonight i would do honor to your revels mlord i thank you for including me may i steal skye from you sir but of course mlord i see de grenville across the room and ive been wanting to talk to him robbie bowed and walked away from them his carriage erect and proud the dancing wont begin until the queen arrives he said walk with me now and ill show you some of my house but your guests are far too busy eating drinking and gossiping to notice my absence besides if another man stares at you im apt to find myself involved in a duel come madam i want you to myself and allowing her no further protest he led her from the ballroom and through a small door the picture gallery he announced com plete with a full complement of southwood portraits i would have expected them to hang at your seat in devon she remarked they do when im there these family paintings have traveled between london and devon as often as i have an eccentricity of mine for a moment they walked in silence and then they stopped he said simply skye and there was such longing in his voice that she thrilled looking shyly up at him she wondered at the intense passion in his limegreen eyes her palms flattened against his broad chest as though she would hold him off say nothing my darling he commanded her and brushed her lips with his geoffrey she whispered frantically his mouth moved gently over her face down the side of her neck across the tops of her breasts he buried his face in the deep scented valley and felt her heart jumping erratically beneath his mouth let me love you skye dear god how i ache for wanting you sweet heart they stood together like that the black figure and the gold andwhite one not moving there was a discreet scratching at the door and southwood in stantly stepped back enter the door swung open my lord the queens barge has been sighted but a few minutes from here announced the footman very good the footman discreetly withdrew i must go to welcome her majesty ill take you back to robbie my darling and well talk again later with robbie on one side of her and richard de grenville on the other skye joined the other guests in the garden near the dock awaiting the arrival of the queen damme if youre not a succulent sight said de grenville thank you mlord getting mighty close with old geoff arent you remarked de grenville from the way he behaved at the rose and anchor id have thought youd have not spoken to him again geoffrey apologized very prettily for his behavior mlord de grenville you know of course that hes married de grenville pressed my lord what exactly is it you seek to tell me skye asked firmly de grenville was discomfited it would hardly be gentlemanly or sporting to tell her of the wager he and southwood had entered into i simply do not wish you to be hurt my dear and geoff is known to be a bit of a rake he said innocently youre most kind mlord she said coolly trying to regain the lost ground he changed the subject ah young bess herself look my dear skye the queen comes they stood looking out over the garden across the colorful sea of guests the queens barge had docked and now the earl of lynmouth was handing his royal guest out for a brief moment elizabeth stood viewing her subjects then a small cheer rippled across the garden the young queen was just twentyseven and even from a distance skye could see that she was lovely tall for a woman and with an angular slenderness she like skye had chosen to wear her hair differently than current fashion dictated parted in the center it fell in long redgold waves down her back it was dressed with many strings of pearls the queen had chosen to rep resent springtime and was gowned in applegreen brocade heavily encrusted with gold embroidery and diamonds her beautyful long aristocratic fingers sparkled with rings her almondshaped eyes glittered like the finest jet and her smile was merry lord southwood led his honored guest through the garden through the lines of bowing and curtseying courtiers and into the ballroom the ballroom like the gallery across the hall extended the length of the house the queen seated herself on a small throne set upon a raised dais and one by one the guests approached her to present themselves southwood stood near her throne escorted by both robbie and de grenville skye was brought before the queen de grenville you rogue tis good to see you smiled eliza beth i was not aware you were up from devon just today majesty said de grenville kissing her hand would i miss southwoods fete and a chance to gaze upon en glands fairest elizabeth dimpled prettily and who would you present to me dickon first majesty an old friend and devon neighbor sir robert small captain of the mermaid robert small knelt reverently and kissed the queens hand madam he began but his eyes filled with tears and he could not go on why sir what honor you do me said elizabeth kindly all england thanks god for your majesty said robert small somewhat recovered all england should thank god for stout seamen like yourself sir robert replied the queen you are our future elizabeths grayblack eyes then flitted over skye mistress goya del fuentes majesty said geoffrey from the queens left skyes curtsey was graceful the lady from algiers yes majesty answered skye her eyes modestly lowered i understand your late husband was a merchant prince there yes majesty skye looked up gazing directly at the queen you and sir robert are business partners a bit unusual for a woman is it not as unusual as it is for a woman to be queen in her own right majesty but i have never believed that being a woman meant one lacked intelligence certainly your majesty has disproven that no tion the deepblue eyes held the grayish black ones elizabeth tudors eyes narrowed a moment as she studied skye then she laughed you desire a charter of me she said we will talk on it soon turning to southwood she said girlishly my feet itch mlord let us begin dancing dismissed skye swept the queen another curtsey and moved away swiftly on the arms of her two gallants her black skirts bil lowing by god said de grenville admiringly the queen likes you she likes damn few women skye whats this about a charter robbie and i have formed our own trading company mlord and lord southwood is aiding us in obtaining a royal charter damn the man thought de grenville so thats how he got to her i must think hard on this or i may yet lose my barge he was about to ask her to dance when lord southwood having opened the ball with the queen approached them and claimed her eyes sparkling skye gave him her hand and they moved off into the figure leaving robert and de grenville by the door he seems quite taken with her robbie de grenville murmured pensively aye replied the captain and im afraid she with him lord and lady burke intoned the majordomo who are they dickon asked robbie southwoods neighbors on the other side hes some irish chief tains heir i suppose geoffrey felt bound to ask them the earl slid an arm tightly about her as they danced the intricate figure if one more of those fops leers at you he muttered between gritted teeth i shall resort to my sword her laughter bubbled up soft warm and rich la geoffrey she teased surely youre not jealous yes im jealous and well discuss it later sweetheart rest assured skye laughed delighted she was having the most wonderful time of her life the handsome earl was outrageously attentive and there wasnt a man here who hadnt complimented her she danced every dance ate supper sur rounded by half a dozen gentlemen besides de grenville and robbie and drank just enough sweet wine to add to her gaiety at midnight everyone unmasked to delighted shouts though most had long ago identified their friends beneath the ornate masks across the ballroom niall burke stared in rigid shock at the beautiful woman in the magnificent diamonds and black velvet who stood directly across the room from him laughing up at the earl of lynmouth it couldnt be it simply could not be skye was dead they had all explained that she was dead told him and told him until hed had no choice but to accept it by god he heard the man next to him saying southwood was always a lucky devil if senora goya del fuentes isnt already his mistress then she soon will be judging by the looks passing between them shes lived in the east another man chimed in and i imagine she knows some of the things those harem girls know god i wonder dont be a young fool hugh southwood has marked her for himself as plainly as if hed put a brand on her forehead if he catches you sniffing around her hell skewer you without a second thought the two men moved away leaving niall burke to his whirling thoughts how could two women look so alike somehow he must meet this senora goya del fuentes but who did he know who could introduce mem will you dance with me niall what constanzita lovewhat is it constanza laughed shaking her dark gold curls how can any one daydream in the midst of all this revelry she asked im sorry my dear i was admiring the lady across the room in the black velvet costume she looks quite familiar senora goya del fuentes perhaps you do know her though her husband was a spaniard she is irish he thought he might be sick but he gripped his emotions how do you know that constanza she owns greenwood the house on the other side of this one the last one in the row our bargeman and hers are brothers the maids and the bargemen gossip and i hear things from my tiring woman they say the earl is mad for her a lady does not listen to servants gossip he cut her off curtly i wish to go home now she was hurt and protested but its just after midnight even the queen is still here it would be rude to leave before the queen herself leaves i am not well constanza he said sharply and i wish to leave instantly contrite she reached up to feel his forehead you do feel warm my love we will make our apologies to lord south wood but say that i am ill he will understand that better they moved across the room and approached the earl of lyn mouth who was gazing down at skye his white velvetclad arm around her midnight velvet shoulders they made an extraordinarily handsome couple southwood smiled as they approached my lord burke i hope you and your lovely lady are enjoying yourselves geoffrey smiled graciously allow me to present our new neighbor senora goya del fuentes skye sweetheart lord and lady burke own the house on the other side of me also built by your grandfather for a belle amie she teased him the earl laughed he was so intent on skye that he did not notice niall burkes stunned look her voice it was her voice her name and her voice lord and lady burke i am delighted to meet you she looked straight at niall without a flicker of recognition her voice reflected only politeness niall burke thought he was surely going mad mas tering his fear and anguish he said youll forgive us my lord if we leave early constanza complains of one of her violent head aches i am sorry replied the earl immediately sympathetic have you tried infusing witchhazel bark in warm water then soaking a soft linen cloth in it and putting it on your forehead lady burke why thank you senora goya del fuentes i have not heard of that but i shall try it murmured constanza feeling nialls grip on her arm becoming insistent she curtseyed and turned away what a strange man said skye watching the burkes retreating backs he stared so intently at me geoffrey laughed i wonder why could it be because youre the most beautiful woman here he lowered his voice sweetheart you know what i want to say to you yes she replied softly her cheeks growing hot if i come to you tonight my darling i know im behaving like a damned coy maid she answered him but no man had ever loved me but my dearest lord i dont know if i could let you geoffrey i want you but im afraid can you understand when the queen leaves he said quietly go home and wait for me we will talk skye i love you and what is between us must be resolved you feel that too dont you she nodded at him her eyes huge and deepest blue he smiled reassuringly at her and the icy fear she had felt deep inside her dissolved in a quick warm glow he loved her he had said so plainly her soaring thoughts were interrupted as de grenville arrived the queen would speak with you mistress skye allow me to escort you he offered we shall both escort you my love said the earl firmly as they reached elizabeth the queen ordered her page to bring a stool for skye then she waved the two gallants away without a word her beautiful hands gesturing imperiously youre popular with the gentlemen mistress elizabeth commented as the two men moved away skye laughed my lord de grenville is an old friend of my business partner sir robert small like robbie he feels he must protect me and that rogue southwood the earl does not feel protective toward me skye twinkled and elizabeth laughed the deep gray eyes bright an understatement mistress she chuckled a woman of wit i see i like that tell me of yourself now how did you come to be sir robert smalls partner of myself there is little to tell majesty i am irish or so i have been told i was left in a convent in algiers at a very young age and i know nothing about my background several years ago i was wed to a wealthy spanish merchant of that city robbie

marlaix and his wife marie she and i were both with child when we fled my daughter was born here in england for which i thank god so you arrived here a poor widow and sir robert small took you in poor

very well mistress i am impressed with what i see and hear cecil will arrange an appointment with you and sir robert we will all talk i think perhaps a royal charter will be forthcoming skye rose and curtseyed deeply majesty i am most grateful elizabeth stood instantly the earl of lynmouth appeared by her side southwood i am weary it has been a busy holiday season escort me to my barge the queen and her escort moved between the bowing and curt seying guests a path to the door opening before them robert and de grenville took possession of skye once more will you stay skye lass no robbie i am tired i have already bid geoffrey good night please escort me to my coach but you remain if you like ill go im longing for a good pint and a warm wench the atmosphere here is too rarefied to suit me de grenville will you join me aye came the smiling reply take my coach offered skye ah lass bless your generosity they left her safe inside her house and drove off skye handed her cloak to walters her majordomo lock up she said captain small will not be back tonight very well madam skye hurried up the stairs to her apartment where daisy awaited her oh mum did you see her did you see young bess we watched her barge from the top of the house yes daisy i met the queen we spoke twice this evening and i shall see her again daisys eyes were round with excitement is she pretty close up yes daisy she is very pretty with lovely fair skin and redgold hair and bright gray eyes oh mum when i tell me mother back in devon that i saw the queens barge and that my mistress even spoke to her shell be so proud skye smiled tomorrow i shall tell you what the queen wore tonight but for now help me get ready for bed obediently daisy went to work unlacing her mistresss gown helping her disrobe the beautiful velvet gown was brushed carefully and hung back in the wardrobe silken undergarments were gathered up to be given to the laundress skye slipped into a palepink silk gown with a deep v neckline secured by tiny pearl buttons the long full sleeves floated the skirt clung daisy brought a silver basin of warmed rose water and skye washed her face and hands and cleaned her teeth shall i brush your hair mum nay daisy ill do it its late go to bed daisy curtseyed good night then mum good night daisy the door closed behind the little maid and skye sat down at her dressing table slowly she removed the diamond and pearl ornaments and drew the gold and tortoiseshell pins from her hair it tumbled down a nightdark cloud picking up her brush she vigorously brushed the tangles out all the while wondering if geoffrey would come and if she really wanted him to what would happen if he did come she laughed what would happen indeed she would become his mistress of course she frowned was that what she wanted to become some noblemans mistress oh damn she was burning for a mans caress the hardness of a mans body on hers might she not have a discreet affair and let it go at that surely he would understand her desire for privacy if he did not then she would stop the affair the sound of something scraping against her window startled her she ran to the window and looked out then quickly jumped back pebbles were being thrown at the window she laughed and flung the casements wide below stood the earl of lynmouth still in his white and gold costume grinning impudently up at her im coming up he whispered loudly enough for her to hear leave the win dows open skye but how she began and gasped as he reached out and grasped at a thick vine growing up the bricked side of the house he swung himself up and began climbing she watched holding her breath until he was safely on the sill good evening sweetheart he drawled lazily vaulting lightly into the room in one fluid motion he drew the casements shut behind him and pulled her into his arms skye his voice was husky with emotion his hands reached up to tangle themselves in her hair her deep blue eyes grew wide and her breath caught in her throat she could not speak sweet sweet skye he whispered and then his mouth took full and complete possession of hers geoffrey kissed her passionately deeply the kiss vibrating through her thrill after thrill rippled through her as his lips gently persuaded hers to open allowing his silken tongue to rove unchecked to meet and subdue hers skye sweet sweet skye he murmured against the softness of her neck her final defenses weakening she shivered deliciously his fingers undid the little pearl buttons at the deep v of her gown one arm held tightly about her slender waist his other hand sought one firm and perfect breast cupping it fondling it his eager mouth seeking the tightly closed flower of her nipple the warm mouth closed over its quivering prisoner his tongue expertly encir cling it again and again until she thought she could stand no more and whimpered a small protest in response he lifted his swooning treasure up and carried her to the bed there he resumed delightful loveplay concentrating mis time on her other breast her body was now helpless to the passion he was igniting in her yet her mind rebelled at the thought of seduction desperate she tried to stop him finally finding her voice geoffrey no oh please no for a moment he didnt hear her and she cried out softly again this time twining her slender fingers in his hair and pulling geoffrey oh geoffrey please no slowly reluctantly he raised his head from the warm bounty of her breasts his limegreen eyes were glazed and heavy with passion tell me skye he said quietly tell me she gazed at him helplessly all the logical reasons for stopping now whirling out of her reach their eyes locked and he said quietly youre shy of this for youve always been a virtuous woman i know that i cannot wish away my wife if i could i would do so i love you and i sense beneath the respectable widow a naughty little sensualist who hungers for me as much as i hunger for her she flushed what is so wrong in our pleasuring each other she sighed still trying to find words he was so damnably persuasive then geoffrey southwood reached out and taking her hand drew it to his codpiece beneath her fingers she felt the hard throb of him oh geoffrey i wont beg skye he had the weapon to force her but some how he couldnt bring himself to use it he wanted to win her fairly for the victory would be so much sweeter i do love her he thought exultantly oh my love let me have the precious gift of you and as if she had heard his silent plea she sobbed oh geoffrey yes yes yes yes he pulled her from the bed and gently drew her gown away to his surprised delight she reached out and with trembling fingers undid his ruffled shirt together they drew his breeches and hose off and then fell back upon the bed he wanted to take her then and there but getting a mighty hold on himself he held back she was not to be used quickly her surrender would be so much better for the waiting she lay shyly half afraid and confused almost as though she were a maid once more the earl moved downward upon the bed and grasping her right foot began kissing itthe top each toe the arch and the heel his lips moved oh so slowly to her ankle and up her leg to the shapely calf her dimpled knee her long silken thigh moving downward again he performed his tender ministra tions on her left foot and leg returning to her lips he nibbled at them briefly leaving her gasping before finding again the sensual warmth of her breasts once more he sucked eagerly on the ripe fruit tempting them to tiny aching peaks making them tingle with anticipation her beautiful body was an unexplored land and he didnt want to miss a single inch of it how firm her waist was he nuzzled the curves of it feeling the warm smoothness against his cheek his hands held her firmly about the hips as his lips slipped across the silken flesh of her belly his tongue probed teasingly into her little navel then slid lower seeking the very core of her gently he parted the lips of her vulva it was already half open the coralred flower of womanhood wet and pout ing with desire bending his head he kissed it tasting the sweetsalt taste of her she gasped her shock her fingers twined tightly in his darkblond hair and her body arced to meet his mouth smiling his pleasure he lifted his head up and said quietly not yet sweetheart its much too soon yet please she pleaded her excitement was so great that she thought she would die if it werent satisfied not yet skye he repeated i will teach you to enjoy the anticipation to prolong the pleasures he turned her over gently and she felt him licking her back her shoulders her buttocks her legs slowly rhythmically his knowing tongue stroked her smooth skin increasing her fever her arms lay above her head and she clawed at the sheets digging fiercely into the mattress then sud denly he laid his naked body on top of her and rubbed his great organ between the cheeks of her bottom now she fought him catching him unawares and throwing him off her rolling onto her back hissing angrily bastard youre no angel but a devil no more laughing he pinned her down and kissed her until she couldnt breathe then he raised her legs and drawing them over his shoul ders buried his face between them his tongue found her honey and he used her furiously until she came his mouth forcing her climax damn you damn you she cried weeping in frustration for she still was not satisfied look at me my hot little bitch she squeezed her eyes tightly closed no look at me skye at the cruel sharp note in his voice she opened her sapphire eyes and looked into his green ones ive fallen in love with you bitch and ill not take you like a whore he rubbed his big blueveined organ against her belly this is what you want isnt it yes youll have it in good time skye in fact ill give it to you now he spread her wide all of it sweetheart he drove deeply enjoying her gasp the incredulous look on her face he was huge and he filled her to overflowing pushing upward to touch at her very womb as he moved his great shaft skillfully drawing it nearly all the way out then thrusting home again for a moment skye thought she would be torn asunder but her body stretched to receive him almost devouring him in her desperate hunger she clawed at his back and he caught her arms and pinioned them above her head she bit into his shoulder drawing blood then licked furiously at the wound he slapped her very lightly cursing softly at her sharp little teeth the pleasure and the pain mingled about and within her she had known great love but never had she known such passion it con sumed her leaving room for nothing else onward he drove her and she reached peak after peak believing each time that it was not possible to go any further yet cresting higher and higher behind her closed eyelids the world exploded into a rainbow of shattered glass she felt the contractions of an orgasm so great that she be lieved death was about to overtake her over and over and over again her body shuddered with the force of her passion he had joined her in ecstasy climax for climax then slowly he regained his senses and managed to roll off her body for a moment he could but stare at her she was white and barely breathing sitting up he tenderly gathered her into his arms she was cold and he strove to warm her no woman had ever driven him as far as she had done no woman had ever satisfied him as much as she and no woman had ever given of herself as fully as she yes he loved her and de grenville could keep his damned barge he had no intention of jeopardizing his love over an insane bet why had he made the damned bet if dickon dared breathe a word of their foolishness hed call him out she stirred in his arms and slowly her beautiful blue eyes flut tered open again she searched his face fearfully for a sign of reassurance he gently smoothed her tangled dark hair from her forehead and said simply dont ever leave me skye i wont geoffrey for geoffrey southwood this was the first love he had felt since his pretty young mother had died in another futile attempt at child bearing when geoffrey was still quite young his fathers only son geoffrey had been born just ten months after his parents wedding day his mother next produced a daughter geoffreys only full sister catherine who was married now and living in cornwall his stepmother had birthed his two halfsisters one of whom was now wed to a worcestershire baron the other to a wealthy devon squire she had died along with a stillborn son his father had not married again his father had been proud of geoffrey but had forbidden what he considered soft treatment for his son at seven geoffrey had left his own home to grow up in the household of the earl of shrewsbury as his own son was now doing he lived with half a dozen other young nobles learning manners morals politics and the business of being a great lord but there was no room for love in that life it was three years before he saw his home again and then he was allowed but a single months visit only his youngest halfsister elizabeth was still at home the two older girls already having been settled in other noble households to learn the business of becoming successful wives and mothers though beth had admired the elegant and polished tenyearold boy young geoffrey was far too puffed up by his own importance to pay the little girl much attention the following year when he returned for his month beth was gone the next year he was twelve and married the little heiress whose life had meant so little to geoffrey and whose untimely death left him wealthy in his own right both his mother and stepmother had died he scarcely knew his sisters his father had flatly dis couraged affection and his mousy unimaginative wife was not to his taste and never had been this mysterious and beautiful woman who lay by his side had given him more than any other person it was perhaps not so surprising then that he was falling in love with her with an innocence extraordinary in a worldly man he wrapped an arm about her and she nestled close her thoughts beginning to reassemble her beloved khalid had given her much joy but she admitted to herself that she had never known such passion as this it was frightening yet it was magnificent their bodies seemed to have been created expressly for one another that geoffrey had wanted more than a onenight affair with her had been obvious from the first he said he loved her and she was beginning to believe it too skye was not foolish she knew she was a stranger in a country foreign to all she had known in algiers and when robbie left as he soon would she would be without a mans protection her business had to be run here not from devon if she intended staying in london then she must have a protector she should marry again but after khalid el bey who would suit her she was too exotic and she believed too wellborn to wed with a mere london merchant on the other hand she was not sufficiently high bom for a lord since geoffrey was married there seemed only one course open to her though she shrank from it she knew she must take it to cap the argument there was also willow to think of it would not be so awful geoffrey was handsome and in love with her he would treat her well and since she need not rely on him for financial support she would retain a great measure of in dependence this would set her above other mens mistresses and as his acknowledged mistress she would be safe from other men for no man in his right mind would dare approach the earl of lyn mouths woman geoffreys breathing had become quite regular how handsome he was in sleep very much the angel earl of his nickname once sleep took the cynical and faintly arrogant look from his face there was an almost vulnerable look though he was indeed a strong personality she let her eyes wander from his face to his wide shoulders and broad chest down to his narrow waist and slim hips his legs were long shapely and covered with a fine pale golden down his feet were slender higharched the nails neatly pared her eyes wandered upward again to his sex limp now and settled cozily in its nest of soft blond hair it looked so sweet and harmless now yet a short while ago it had been a great blueveined beast driving her to pleasures she hadnt known existed she wanted to reach out and touch him i trust it all meets with your approval sweetheart she started and color flooded her face she gasped he chuckled then opened his limecolored eyes and reaching up pulled her down into his arms so witch you were taking inventory of me i ask does it meet with your approval kissing her ear he ran his tongue around it then thrust in and tickled her she squirmed shivering deliciously stop it geoffrey yes yes your assets certainly do meet with my approval he cupped a breast in his hand rubbing the nipple the queen will be resting for the next few days so i am free i want to take you away somewhere and spend all my time making love to you yes she replied slightly surprised at herself he chuckled again how flattering you are and how honest i approve sweetheart i know of an inn about half a days ride up the river its small and elegant and the food is excellent i am well known to the landlord do you take all your mistresses there she said more sharply than she would have wished i have never taken any woman there he said softly understanding her it is my own special place when i wish to escape the trials of being who i am i thought we would go there and see if after spending several days with me you would like to become my mistress that way if you decide against it our liaison will remain our secret though it would please me to shout our love to the world i would not embarrass you publicly geoffrey i am so sorry i spoke in haste and i thank you for being so considerate sweetheart i have had several mistresses in my day but youve been a wife its hard for you i know to reconcile yourself to this position he took her face in one hand and kissed her tenderly god youve got the sweetest mouth she felt herself growing languid again and she leaned back sigh ing happily her deep blue eyes warm she said damn you geof frey what is it you do to me that one kiss renders me weakand wanton besides what do you do to me skye that renders me insatiable quickly they were in each others arms again their mouths and tongues and hands devouring each other bodies entwined they kissed until their mouths were bruised and both were breathless already aroused his manhood beat against her thigh reaching down she caressed him with teasing fingers reaching out to cup the soft pouch beneath his shaft running a sure finger firmly beneath it hearing his gasp of surprised pleasure there was no excruciating waiting this time she parted her thighs easily and he slid into her warmth confident now she tightened her vaginal muscles about him as yasmin had taught her jesus he cried out softly as the wave of pleasure overpowered him he drew back to thrust deeper yet and again she tightened around him stop witch he begged its the most delightful torture ive en dured but stop before i die i want to pleasure you too her arms were tight about him and as she loosened her grip on him he began to murmur softly to her little witch i knew that beneath the ladylike demeanor there was a passionate wanton open yourself to me my darling god how warm and sweet you are how your little honey oven burns for mepleasures meloves me he moved rhythmically with long smooth strokes each thrust seem ing to go deeper than the one before she could feel herself opening wide to receive him taking him all wanting even more oh god she wanted more sobbing she felt her climax bearing down on her like a great wind slamming into her with such force that she fainted hearing as she slid away into the dark warmth his cry of pleasure her first awareness was the kisses he was covering her face with dear god she thought that he can rouse me to such heights she opened her eyes and smiled tremulously at him her eyes brilliant with tears he smiled back and ran a slim finger tenderly down her nose youve bewitched me my blueeyed love tomorrow after noon we shall ride upriver to the ducks and drake for several days we shall do nothing other than make love in a beautiful room that overlooks the river and eat and drink sweet wine i shall bind you to me so youll never want to leave me sweetheart never his mouth closed over hers again kissing her deeply then he loosed her and rose from the bed he drew on his clothing quickly and smiled down at her we had best keep our liaison a secret for now sweetheart his green eyes glittered though youve probably not made up your mind about me yet ive made up my mind about you i mean to have you sweetheart he bent again and placed a firm light kiss on her forehead sleep well my darling ive no doubt ive fair worn you out he walked across the room lifted a tapestry hanging on the wall and pressed a panel a door swung open skye gasped where she demanded does that passage lead to my house he replied a hint of laughter in his voice re membermy grandfather built this house for his mistress then there was no need to climb up to my window no sweetheart but i did think it was most romantic didnt you she began to laugh geoffrey im not so sure youre not a madman he grinned then blowing her a kiss he disappeared through the passage and the door swung shut behind him what manner of man have i involved myself with she said softly aloud a damned interesting one the voice in her head an swered and she laughed into the darkness chapter the following morning skye sent daisy to find robert small the little captain had rolled in a good hour past dawn much the worse for wear when he finally made an appearance rumpled and redeyed skye winced oh robbie how many pints did you drink he gave her a weak grin it wasnt the pints so much as the wenches they were twins and just sixteen ah youth did your friend de grenville survive barely thank god we had your carriage i left him in the care of his majordomo for a devon sailor though he has a mighty weak stomach skye bit back the laughter bubbling in her throat it would have been unkind im going away for a few days she said quietly though this is a secret i will be upriver at an inn called the ducks and drake should there be an emergency youll know where to find me youll not be alone it was a statement no ill not be alone robbie robbie sighed skye lass ill not have you hurt southwood is such a cold bastard not with me robbie besides though this will sound terrible do not love him i doubt i shall ever love anyone again khalid is too strong in my memory but i do like lord southwood and rlobbie you know that i must have a powerful protector come spring youll be off again and be gone for months i am a woman done i have no family but my daughter my whole life began with khalid i have no past with the queens charter our business should flourish and with the earls protection i will be free to run it and free from the bothersome advances of other men but the price skye being southwoods acknowledged mistress she laughed what else is there for me marriage with whom and you know that i need wealth to give me the power and respectability that will secure willows future i loved khalid and i was proud of him but what future would my daughter have if it were known here that her father was the great whoremaster of algiers no robbie the price is not greater than the rewards the earl of lynmouth has never had an acknowledged mistress of my stature and i dont expect him to replace me soon when willow is grown she will be an heiress with a powerful uncle i shall be able to make a good match for her robbie shrugged youve thought it all out i see as usual theres no arguing with a logical woman should i wish you hap piness then he loves me robbie its not just that hes said it he means it a woman knows when shes being lied to robbie and i hope im not easy to fool ah lass i only want you happy i know robbie dont fret im not unhappy he patted her hand awkwardly and she bent and kissed his ruddy cheek oh robbie what would i do without you youre my best friend in the early afternoon robbie stood in the doorway and watched sadly as she rode off down the drive of greenwood keeping her red horse to a slow trot earlier he had gone down to the thames and arranged for a waterman to take her little trunk upriver to the ducks and drakes he sighed he wished he were happier about the liaison skye had been radiant when she departed she wasnt worried and enjoyed herself very much dressed quite elegantly in a black velvet riding habit ecru lace at the sleeves and a froth of lace bubbling up at the neckline as well she cut a superb figure her cloak was made up of alternating bands of sable fur and black velvet with heavy carved gold frog closings the attached hood was edged in the same dark sable and made a perfect contrast to her creamy complexion her black boots were of the finest spanish leather her creamcolored scented gloves of french kid her big red gelding adored her with a singular devotion as skye had explained to robbie she and the earl would meet a mile or so from the strand on the river road they were less likely to be seen together at that point the afternoon was cold and clear and skye fought the urge to set her horse acantering since noon was the dinner hour few people were out she had ridden for some minutes when she heard the steady beat of hooves behind her and turned to see a tall man riding a large black stallion senora goya del fuentes i bid you a good day sir niall lord burke we met last night at the earl of lynmouths gala her gaze swept over the tall dark man with the silvery eyes he was really quite attractive she thought but he looked disapproving of her and skye found herself growing annoyed oh yes of course how is your wifes headache my lord gone thank you he moved his horse next to hers do you generally ride unescorted madam a dangerous practice i would say i am meeting someone just a short ways away my lord i scarce ly thought a groom necessary she dismissed his question how dared he criticize her but lord burke was not easily dismissed i understand you were raised in algiers the silvery eyes looked at her searchingly yes my lord i was your parents were irish so i was told my lord didnt you know them he was incredulous i do not remember them my lord i was brought by a sea captain to the convent of st mary and placed in the care of the nuns there your name is unusual he noted after a moment it was what i called myself when i arrived there though the nuns added mary to it thinking skye not quite christian now why dad she embroidered her tale what did it matter if her name was skye damn the man why didnt he go about his business she was almost sure that geoffrey was around the next bend in the road she flashed burke a sweet smile i must go now sir my friend will be waiting and before he could protest she put spurs to her horse and was gone he could not make a display by following her so he was forced to continue at a sedate trot as he rounded the curve in the road he saw her moving away accompanied by a man on a big chestnut stallion it was likely lord southwood thought niall bitterly re membering the gossip he had overheard last night now niall was more confused than ever she looked and spoke like skye omalley even her name was the same it had to be his skye and yet he shook his head she gave no sign of recognizing him then it struck him that perhaps she had survived after all but had been despoiled by her captors incarcerated in a harem and was ashamed to face him maybe she was putting on an act for his benefit ah then said his saner self how pray tell did she escape captivity and there was a child too and captain sir robert small a most reputable man not only supported her story but appeared to be her protector then another thought struck him a sea captain had left her in algiers had it been dubhdara himself was it possible she was one of the old mans bastards god knows hed had enough of them the old satyr had never denied his urges but if dubhdara had done that the question was why sighing niall turned his horse back toward the strand he had been on his way home when he saw her riding out from her house and he followed her in order to speak with her he was being foolish it was just a coincidence of names and looks he had a wife who loved him and his skye was dead he had to believe that otherwise he might well go mad the earl of lynmouth and skye rode happily together geoffrey southwood was wildly in love for the only time in his life and he was now to have three lovely days alone with his beloved youre beautiful he growled and she laughed happily throw ing back her head so that her hood fell off exposing her face and the pure white pillar of her neck he wanted to stop pull her from her horse and cover that smooth creamy throat with his kisses how is it he continued that you are as fair in sunlight as in moonlight do you know youve bewitched me senora goya del fuentes she colored becomingly her lashes making charcoal smudges against her pink cheeks my lord you make me feel shy of you why skye didnt anyone ever pay you outrageous compli ments my husband it was stated simply sweetheart sweetheart i am sorry would you rather we went back no geoffrey i dont want to go back he breathed a sigh of relief and cursed himself for a fool this was only her first adventure and she was hesitant reaching out he took her hand and silently they rode on together all about them the english january day was magnificentthe sky a cloudless bright blue the sun a sharp piercing yellow the air cold crisp and in vigorating their own warm breath and the horses heaving breaths made tiny clouds the thames river valley rolled gently on and on the lovers seemed entirely alone in the world like adam and eve skye rode quietly with her thoughts she liked this man though she doubted she would ever love him or any other man again love was both a passion and a pain she didnt think she could bear another loss like the loss of khalid if she simply enjoyed geoffreys company and his lovemaking she would be safe from hurt as the january sun began to sink away they came to a charming small inn set upon the river bank it was separated from the road by a low stone wall that opened into a brick courtyard upon either side of the entry hung an oval sign depicting a drake surrounded by several ducks the building was whitewashed and halftimbered with a thatched roof and leadpaned bow windows that had win dow boxes filled with holly and ivy from the great brick center chimney rose a curl of grayblue smoke as they clattered up to the inn door an ostler ran out from the stable to take their horses geoffreys hands lingered on skyes waist as he lifted her from her horse and she felt her skin tingling against her silk undergarments taking her hand firmly in his he led her into the inn my lord southwood a tall moonfaced man came forward welcome my lord my lady we received your message this morn ing my lord and your room is ready there will be no other guests for the duration of your stay my thanks master parker i think we will have dinner as soon as it can be made ready its been a cold ride very good my lord rose where is that lass rose here dad escort my lord southwood and his lady to their room girl rose a very buxom young lady whose ample bosom threatened to overflow its blouse bobbed a curtsey and smiled saucily at the earl this way mlord madam she said leading them not up stairs but down a short sunlit hallway and into a small wing off the main inn building the door swung open to reveal a charming white room with a bowed window large fireplace and big carved oak bed with heavy green and white linen hangings dark beams timbered the walls and ceiling on one side of the fireplace was a round polished table holding a brown glazed earthenware bowl filled with pine boughs there were two matching chairs at the foot of the bed was a blanket chest there was a seat built into the window with plump cushions of the same homespun green and white linen as the bed hangings rose touched a brand to the perfectly laid fire and it blazed up instantly your trunks are on either side of the bed mlord she said can i bring you anything geoffrey looked to skye sweetheart the little maid almost sighed her envy of the beautiful lady a bath pleaded skye i can smell nothing but horses he smiled down on her then turned to rose will you see to it love his big hand cupped the girls face and he looked down into her bovine brown eyes rose nearly fainted aaye mlord a bbath at once he dropped his hand and she spun about and fled he laughed softly and skye chided him oh geoffrey what a wicked man you are he grinned at her i suppose i am he admitted then ill bathe with you i stink of horses too reaching out he pulled her into his arms pushed her hood off and loosened her hair so that it tumbled down her back in a shining black mass one strong arm pressed her tightly against him the other hand caressed her silken hair she could feel herself growing weak with his touch and fought to control her emotions his green eyes mocked her efforts and for a moment she became angry and struggled to escape him he released her instantly ill never force you skye he said aloud the thought lay between them because i dont have to there was a scratching at the door and then a sturdy boy lugged in a small round oak tub several other boys carried in buckets of water rose ordered the tub placed before the fire and set a carved screen about it when the tub was filled and the male servants gone she asked shall i stay and help you madam thank you rose i should appreciate it her blue eyes twinkled wickedly sorry geoffrey but the tub is much too small for us both as you can see you will have to bathe after me it was a small but delicious revenge and she was hard pressed not to laugh she slipped behind the modesty of the screen and slowly removed each garment sitting on the bed he watched through narrowed eyes as first her velvet riding habit and then her perfumed silken undergarments were handed over the screen to the solicitous rose soon he heard the water splashing gently as she lowered herself into the tub will you need help madam no rose i can wash myself ill take your riding habit and cloak to be brushed maam and your underclothing to be washed then ill come back dont bother i will care for my lady said the earl as he escorted the servant girl to the door and firmly thrust her out to sweeten the rebuff he slipped a gold piece down her front and patting her backside sent her on her way the door was shut the bolt slammed home and now madam he strode across the room and yanked the carved screen aside she sat covered by suds her dark hair loosely pinned on top of her head she looked up at him mockingly my lord he stripped off his clothes letting them lie where they fell and strode purposefully toward the tub no she shrieked youll flood the room he grinned wickedly then get out and let me bathe i am not through but i am ready oh damn you southwood hand me a towel he held it just out of her reach so that she was forced to stand in order to get it the suds sluiced down her lush form and geoffrey southwood drew in his breath sharply the beast in him stirred clinging to an end of the towel as she grabbed it he pulled her over and kissed her her small full breasts wet and warm pushed de mandingly at his chest skye oh sweet skye his voice was rough with longing then suddenly he felt the ground give way beneath him and he landed rudely in the warm scented tub she was laughing uproariously the red mouth wide and luscious there master lecher cool your heels and wash the stink of the road from your handsome body geoffrey geoffrey how ac customed you must be to getting your way with women shame my lord fie we barely arrive and you ogle the maidservant then you kiss me ogle the wench again and pat her backside yes i saw it then attempt to climb into my tub for another kiss and a cuddle no my lord if you would have me as your own then i will demand fidelity are you capable of fidelity geoffrey southwood for the briefest instant he was angry angry with this nameless female the whoremaster of algiers woman how dare she impose conditions on him but as he gazed at her he felt the anger dissolve she was right she wasnt some common trull to love or ignore as the spirit moved him touche sweetheart he admitted ruefully ill teach you manners yet southwood she said mischievously scrub my back he shot back and laughing she complied she had decided in the early hours of the dawn that if she was to become his mistress it must be on her terms she would not be one of many she must be his only love she would give to him affection and respect but in return he must give her the same and as she would be loyal and faithful to him so must he be to her she had just now won their first battle they ate in their room by the fireplace it was a simple but very tasty meal of boiled lobsters artichokes in oil and vinegar newly baked bread with sweet butter whole apples baked in pastry with colored sugar sprinkled over them accompanied by clotted cream sharp cheese and a pitcher of white wine afterward they lay back against the plump goosedown pillows on the lavenderscented bed and holding hands fell asleep skye woke to watch the firelight dancing against the wall instinctively she knew he was awake too turning she lay her head against his heart what a wench you are he said softly and stroked her hair ive fallen in love with you skye you know that dont you ive never loved before sweetheart but as god as my witness i do love you they made love tenderly lingeringly then slept awakened and made love twice more as geoffrey had promised her the next three days were spent in an orgy of love making eating and drinking and even if they had wished to change the program they would not have been able to do so for they awoke that first morning to find a january snowstorm swirling about them as gleeful as children they piled wood upon the fire and then snuggled naked beneath the down coverlets just before rose arrived with a breakfast of hardcooked eggs thick slices of country ham bread cheese and nutbrown ale it snowed all that day and they never stirred from their bed except to feed either the fire or them selves skye could not believe how often and easily he aroused her fulfilled her loved her each time she thought surely it could not happen again and yet it did on the second day the snow stopped and the sun shone again they dressed and played outdoors in the snow like youngsters much to the amusement of master parker and his wife but rose was outraged it was unthinkable for the gentry to behave in such a fashion especially such a handsome romantic gentleman as the earl skyes cheeks were red with the cold and she shrieked with mock terror as the earl pelted her with snowballs she got back at him by teasing him into position beneath the roof and then sending a well aimed snowball into the piledup snow on the edge it tumbled down over him like an avalanche leaving him sputtering his surprise that night they sat before the fire skye in her simple white caftan and geoffrey in a green velvet robe they roasted chestnuts in the coals of their fire picking the sweet hot meats from the shells burning their fingers in the process he found a lute in the common room of the inn and brought it back to their little room to her surprise he played and sang quite well he sang her several naughty ditties that left her weak with laughter and when he saw that she was helpless he put the lute down and pounced on her giggling she fought him off tickling him mercilessly until he too was helpless with mirth they lay panting upon the bed and then suddenly he was kissing her frantically skye skye dammit woman love me a little but geoffrey she protested i do no sweetheart you love what i do to your passions but you feel nothing for me youre so fair so charming so intelligent i thought it was enough but it isnt enough i want you to care as i care oh geoffrey there was genuine regret in her voice i dont know if i shall ever love again it hurts so damned much to love i like you and i had thought we would be friends its more than most men have with their mistresses youre not just any woman my love i want more of you skye than most men have of their mistresses you have no right she shouted at him you do not take me i give myself freely because i want to and only because i do want to she was kneeling on the bed her hair swirling about her sleek beautiful shoulders i will be no mans toy understand that my lord earl her sapphire eyes flashed blue fire her creamy skin was rosy with emotion at that moment she was the most beautiful thing hed ever seen still he was furious at her he was geoffrey reginald michael arthur henry southwood the seventh earl of lynmouth and she was only a nameless woman without a past he was the angel earl the man for whom all women pined she was the first to have the gift of his true love and he would have hers his voice was dangerously low and tinged with scorn ill not beg you skye but if you cannot learn to love again and yet you still give your body then youre no better than a common whore she went white with shock her eyes huge lashing out she hit a blow to his cheek which left the red imprint of her fingers instantly he struck back matching her blow then flinging himself on her he pinned her beneath him your husband is dead cant you understand struggling wildly she screamed at him dont speak of him dont you dare to speak of him he was kind and wise and good and i loved him do you hear i loved him i loved him as i shall never love anyone else instead he raged at her youll make a mockery of his love by behaving like a whore youll lock your heart away while sat isfying the lusts of your body very well sweetheart if you wish to be a whore ill show you how his hands went to the neck of her caftan and with several quick motions he tore the silk garment from her easily he squeezed her breasts his knee jammed brutally between her thighs no geoffrey his limegreen eyes glittered in the firelight and he bent to capture her mouth she turned her head aside quickly and he lost his balance he fell into the pillows she scrambled from beneath him her feet finding the floor she fled across the room but reaching the door she realized the hopelessness of her situation she was stark naked and could hardly escape she faced him as he lazily stalked her across the room geoffrey please she held out her hands in supplication his eyes were pitiless as his body pressed hard into hers she felt the wall behind her whores he said tonelessly are often taken in alleys standing up their backs to the wall forcing her thighs open he ordered put your arms about me whore wrap your legs about my waist and see how the other members of your sisterhood behave she fought him wildly now trying to twist her body away from him struggling clawing at his eyes he slapped her and she burst into tears tears of shame tears of fright please she whimpered please not like this her tears stopped him and he suddenly stepped away she crum bled toward the floor and he caught her and carried her to the bed cradling her against his chest as he sat down damn you skye damn you for the heartless blueeyed bitch you are i only want you to love me it hurts to love she sobbed i dont want to be hurt again sweetheart living hurts and loving is part of living as is death his anger had disappeared in the face of her obvious pain skye my darling love me as i love you she began to cry harder she wept for the woman she could not remember for khalid el bey that tender and noble man she was so very tired love me my darling he whispered tenderly let your heart soften again oh skye i would set you above all women even my wife love me sweetheart she had built a wall about her heart and now she felt that wall being breached piece by piece youre no wanton to lie with me simply for pleasure you do feel though you wont admit it dont you my darling she looked up at him her eyes streaming yes she whispered so low that he had to bend to hear her you will not betray the love you felt for your husband if you love me skye that you canand mustlove again is a tribute to the love you shared with your husband now share your love with me my darling there was a long silence at last he heard her say softly yes geoffrey with infinite care he lay her upon their bed and gently kissed the tears on her cheeks moving down her throat her chest her exquisite breasts he worshiped at the shrine of their perfection nursing on each nipple protectively she enfolded him in her embrace cradling him and exhausted they fell asleep in the graywhite light of the january dawn she awoke to find that he had thrust gently into her the hardness within her seemed natural and good i do love you she said quietly and slowly he began the primitive rhythm that would culminate in searing passion for them both she moved with him savoring the sweetness of him and suddenly she knew that all the barriers had crumbled away she loved this tender and arrogant lord who sought to possess her so completely she loved him he would never know of course for men never did that though she loved him there would always be a secret part of her that belonged to her alone but she loved him of that she was sure their rhythm quickened and then the blazing white light of the dawn blended with the pulsing golden light in her mind as he brought her twice to perfect fulfillment she cried his name and felt his strong arms about her heard his voice soothing her his lips kissing away the salty tears she hadnt even been aware of shedding you are mine and i am yours she said finally easily aye sweetheart he answered we belong together and we will be together in the spring i shall beg leave from the queen and take you down into devon to my home but your wife mary and her daughters do not live at lynmouth he said it is you who shall be its mistress that afternoon they left their secret sanctuary at the ducks and drake and rode back to london the day was cold and windy and overcast and threatened snow again but they were happy i want you to move into my house he said as they rode the apartment next to mine is for the countess of lynmouth and we will redo it for you i dont know geoffrey i have my own home and i plan to bring my daughter up from devon soon i havent seen her in several months she should be in her own house not in yours then keep greenwood darling but let me redo those rooms for you you can travel easily between the two houses using the un derground passage beneath the garden you can be with your little girl during the day and with me in the evenings very well geoffrey as long as i may keep my own home but until the rooms are redone i will remain at greenwood will you dine with me this evening i will sweetheart but first i must return to court and pay my respects to her majesty soon they turned their horses into greenwoods driveway welcome home maam called the gatekeeper skye threw him a smile and waved approaching the house skye was pleased to see a groom hurry from her stables as they reined in their horses the earl dismounted and lifted her down from her horse his arms remained wrapped around her and flushing prettily she looked up at him do you love me skye he demanded softly i love you geoffrey she answered her bright blue eyes never wavering from his and will you be my lady fair sweetheart yes oh yes he bent and kissed her lingeringly lovingly ill send word when i can come this evening he said mounting his stallion again he cantered off down the drive she entered the house dreamily so youre back and looking as dewyeyed as any foolish maid good day to you robbie she smiled sweetly at him come have a glass of wine with me wine is it he grumbled following her upstairs to the little salon yes wine wine to celebrate the fact that im in love oh robbie im in love again i never thought i would be able to love after i lost khalid but i love geoffrey lord have mercy thought the sea captain as skye humming a tuneless ditty poured out generous portions of rubyred wine for the two of them robbie sat slumped in a chair his gaze on the floor how can i tell her what de grenville told me while in his cups last night he thought how can i tell her that southwood seeks to make her his mistress in order to satisfy a bet now the bastards gone and captured her heart damn id rather be in the middle of a south atlantic hurricane he raised his eyes slowly she raised her goblet high to my lord southwood long life she toasted robbie raised his goblet lifelessly aye he answered tone lessly christ shes so happy i havent seen her happy since khalid died ah hell its too late for me to save her from him let her find out on her own let her be happy for now he gulped down his wine and sat back against the velvet cushions ive news too he said were to see the queen and cecil the day after candlemas wed best have that first voyage mapped out by then she was suddenly all business have you decided where and what jewels and spices in case of shipwreck he crossed himself at least we can save half the cargo well go down and around the horn into the indian ocean across to the spice islands for a cargo of pepper clove nutmeg mace and ginger then on to burma for rubies for the best rubies come down to rangoon from mogok in the central part of the country in india well take on cardamom diamonds from the golconda and pearls in ceylon theres cinna mon and sapphires to be had be sure said skye to buy only the kashmir blue sapphires khalid always believed their color was the best i know its going to be a long voyage lass i may not be back for a year or even two depending on conditions she smiled at him affectionately you look forward to it robbie dont deny it youve been landlocked for almost two years now and your feet itch to walk a deck its all right my dear i understand and its time for you to go i am so grateful to you for your friendship but i am myself again at last and i must build my own life i know lass but i dont want you hurt or taken advantage of by anyone that damned trick memory of yours worries me in many ways youre still an innocent i have geoffrey now robbie rely only on yourself skye love southwood if you must but put your trust in no man robbie how cynical you are not cynical truthful there was a scratching at the door and skye called out enter a footman brought in a piece of paper on a small silver tray skye took the folded parchment and opened it damn she said what is it geoffrey has been called away she turned to the footman how was this delivered one of the earls grooms mistress you may go the servant turned and left what does he say skye very little she said frowning just that theres a problem in devon you could probably use a good nights sleep remarked robbie wryly and she laughed at his irreverence considering your reputation as a swordsman this is surely a case of the pot calling the saucepan black she teased he guffawed heartily the days sped by she heard nothing from geoffrey and then came the day of her appointment with cecil and the queen she dressed elegantly but soberly william cecil lord burghley her majestys chief advisor was not a man to be swayed by a show of bosom her gown was darkblue velvet its severity relieved by a small white lace ruff at the neck the sleeves were slashed and edged with gold her white silk underblouse showing through the openings she wore a gold chain interspersed at intervals with small flat plaques of carved white coral roses her shining hair was parted in the center and drawn into an elegant chignon at the nape of her neck the river was frozen solid so they went to greenwich in skyes coach cecil awaited them in a booklined room he wasted no time but came directly to the point if we grant you a royal charter what does her majesty gain a quarter share in the cargo an accurate map of the areafor were carrying two cartographers on each vesseland of course were available to do any errands her majesty may require along our route replied robert small how many ships eight that will be the number going how many will you bring back six at the minimum you overestimate i think captain small snapped cecil no my lord i dont barring a typhoon i will actually return with all eight but a serious storm could lose me one or two what of pirates or mutiny my lord every captain in my fleet has been with me for several years as have all my ships crews these men are used to working together under both good and bad conditions they are a loyal and disciplined lot unlike most crews theyll bring their ships through hell if necessary but theyll bring them home to england cecil smiled thinly your confidence is commendable sir i shall look forward to being amazed he turned to skye and where madam do you come into this i finance it said skye quietly you must have great confidence in captain small said cecil drily i do sir he was my husbands partner for some years and never failed him once and your husband was don diego indio goya del fuentes a spanish merchant of al giers the spanish ambassador claims never to have heard of him madam i would hardly think the spanish ambassador to the english court would be well acquainted with the residents of algiers my lord said skye coolly perhaps not madam i merely mention it in passing it is my duty to protect my queen if you feel my lord cecil that this venture is a danger to your queen or would bring some discredit upon her then i shall withdraw my request for a charter and you must rule against us with her majesty however to do so casts doubt upon not only my hon or but on sir roberts as well i am but newly come from algiers but captain small has always been a loyal and good servant of en gland madam you misunderstand me i merely said that king phillips man knew not of your late husbands family why should he my husbands family came to algiers several generations back the original goya del fuentes was i believe a younger son there is still a branch of the family in spainnear granada or seville i can never remember which cecil sighed exasperated and robbie hid a smile skye was doing a fine job of confusing the chancellor it relieved him to see her fast thinking now he need not fear leaving her when he went back to sea really my lord skye allowed a slightly annoyed tone to creep into her voice what it is that bothers you i cannot imagine i ask for nothing other than her majestys sponsorship in return i offer her a quarter share of the profits the latest mapping of the area and my ships will be bringing to the peoples of the east word of our queens greatness this hardly seems to me a suspicious undertak ing dammit madam you deliberately twist my words roared cecil do i indeed sir pray then enlighten me as to exactly what it is you do mean a burst of tinkling laughter interrupted them and from a shadowy recess in the room the queen quickly appeared do not mind cecil mistress goya del fuentes he is overcau tious of our welfare and we are appreciative of his efforts although we might do without any other of our servants we could not do without him come my friend you need not know the ladys pedi gree in order to do business with her our treasury is not so full that we cannot use the profits from this voyage and it costs us nothing more than our goodwill captain smalls record speaks for itself very well my lady queen i will see the charter is granted if you so desire i do my lord cecil work out the pertinent details with captain small mistress goya del fuentes will come and have a glass of wine with us the queen strode from the room and skye after curtseying to cecil followed her as the door closed upon the women the chancellor remarked shes a beautiful woman sir robert and she has a brain her majesty approves of intelligent women she is the daughter i never had replied robbie indeed murmured cecil then are you aware that she spent several days and nights in midjanuary with lord southwood at the thameside inn called the ducks and drake i am said robbie his anger beginning to rise you seem to be keeping a rather close watch on an unimportant and harmless young woman my lord a woman of irish descent who was wed to a spaniard both traditional enemies of england cecil observed drily and is lord southwood also under suspicion snapped the captain only to the extent that a valuable servant of the queen might be subverted robert small was on his feet by god sir ill hear no further slander against skye she has suffered greatly and yet remains a sweet and good lady there is not a devious or disloyal tendency in her i assure you sit down sit down captain small our own investigations have borne out your words i would however like your personal thoughts about her relationship with lord southwood you need divulge no confidence of course but the earl is a valuable man to the queen he claims to be in love with her answered robbie and god help her for shes in love with him curious said cecil it is not the earls custom to take women seriously then perhaps he really is in love with her far away at that very moment the gentleman in question was raging violently at his pale and cowering wife geoffrey southwood had rarely felt such overpowering fury bitch bitch he shouted at her youve killed my only legitimate son christs body how could you be so stupid you knew there was smallpox about and yet you wrote to the countess of shrewsbury and asked to have henry sent home for twelfth night without my permission as god is my witness mary i could kill you then why dont you geoffrey she baited him you hate me and our daughters why not kill us all her hysterical outburst calmed him somewhat he eyed her coldly i am going to divorce you mary i should have done so years ago you have no grounds to do such a thing i have all the grounds i need mary you produce nothing but daughters the one son you bore me you wantonly killed you refused to hostess my friends yet you hoard the household monies i send you to dower your daughters despite the fact i have forbidden them to wed i have grounds mary but if needs be ill produce half a dozen men wholl claim intimate knowledge of you she went white with shock you truly are a bastard geoffrey she whispered horrified he hit her a blow that sent her to her knees a bastard she repeated he turned and left they were the last words she ever spoke to her husband by nightfall mary southwood lay ill of smallpox herself as did every one of her daughters she died several days later mary elizabeth catherine and phillipa joined her only the three youngest girls susan and twins gwyneth and joan survived the earl was saved because he had had a light case of smallpox as a child the countess and her daughters were buried with a bare minimum of ceremony the bell in lynmouth church dutifully tolling their passing as the carts carried their coffins to the family cemetery geoffrey told his three daughters of their mothers and sisters deaths they were so young only four and five that he was not sure they really understood him looking at them closely for the first time he decided that they were really somewhat comely leaving detailed instructions as to their convalescence he departed devon for court he had been in devon for over two months and spring had come to england the court had left greenwich and was now at nonesuch the earl of lynmouth was welcomed back warmly particularly by the ladies for news of his loss had preceded him anxious to see skye he fretted until he could get to london he could not go until the queen gave her permission he waited for the right moment to beg that permission in london robbie prepared to take his leave of skye the mer maid and her fellow ships waited now fully provisioned in the pool he had put off his departure until the last possible moment for skye was quite easily upset of late the least little thing sending her into tears he had sent to devon for his sister marie and the two children the sight of willow now almost two had cheered her somewhat he knew what distressed her it was southwoods apparent de sertion since the earl had returned with her from their tryst in january there had been no word from him other than the cryptic message that he was needed in devon robert small told himself once more that the man was a bastard plain and simple seeing skye grow so pale and listless he silently cursed the earl and be moaned the fact that there was nothing he could do to cheer her finally robert small could delay no longer on the night before he sailed skye arranged a small dinner party for him at her house de grenville was their guest dining with skye robbie dame cecily jean and marie de grenville intended to sail with robbie as far as the channel the meal was delicious but skye only picked at the food her merriment was forced at least she thought sourly southwood had done her one good turn by arranging an introduction to the queen thereby helping them obtain a royal charter as to love it was all either passion or pain de grenville was soon in his cups and he leered at skye in a friendly fashion for a learned and modest woman you cost me dearly mistress skye now that the earl of lynmouth is back at court i suppose hell be taking my barge he was back and hed never even sent her word why should he take your barge dickon she asked absently robert small suddenly came to life thats no story for skyes ears dickon he protested kicking his friend beneath the table but de grenville paid him no heed his hostesss rich wine had fuzzed his wits why shouldnt she know robbie when i turn my barge over to geoff it will be all over court dont know why i bet him anyway but i did want that stallion skye felt a premonition of disaster run through her what bet is this dickon enough de grenville cried robert small desperately glancing toward his sister and marie no robbie snapped skye i believe i should hear what dickon has to say pray sir enlighten me as to what you and my lord earl wagered i bet my barge against his prize stud stallion that he couldnt make you his mistress within a sixmonth period looked like such a sure thing you certainly cut him dead at the inn in dartmour didnt think he was your type at all but then my father always said women were a fickle lot and not to be trusted cecily and marie both gasped the gallic jean shrugged philo sophically but robbie who knew her best of all held his breath in anticipation of the explosion that immediately followed the bastard she raged the damned bastard i could kill him i will kill him no i wonti shall do to him what marie did to captain jamil bursting into tears she picked up her skirts and fled the room marie and cecily rose to follow her but robbie stayed them with a gesture and went after her himself he saw her running across the terrace down into the garden his short legs pumping hard he ran after her calling skye lass wait for me skye she stopped but her back remained toward him as he reached her he could see her shoulders shaking he walked around her and gathered her into his arms she wept wildly oh lass i am so sorry but dont waste your tears on him hes not worth it skye hes not worth any grief i lllove him robbie she sobbed i lllove the bastard he sighed he was going to have to hurt her further but there was no help for it best she know the worst from him than have some ass like de grenville tell her he drew her over to a carved stone bench and they sat down i want you to hear this from me skye southwoods only son and his wife and four of his daughters are dead of the smallpox thats what sent him down into devon in january de grenville tells me the rumors at court are that the queen has already picked out an heiress for him and geoffrey southwood would never say no to a wealthy match and now that he no longer has a son it is imperative that he remarry the sooner the better i would say for with a new wife hell have little time for you lass she raised her face to him and he thought as he had thought a hundred times or more that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever known tonight when he left her he would visit a sweet young whore of his acquaintance but on the long nights at sea it would be skye he thought of not little sally it would be skyes face that he would easily recall to mind the young prostitutes fading from memory within an hour of their parting you understand what im saying to you skye he looked anxiously into her wet sapphire eyes you understand that in all likelihood its finished with southwood she sighed i am carrying his child robbie in six months time more or less i shall present the seventh earl of lynmouth with a child and i pray god its a son and i also pray that his rich new wife does precisely what his last rich wife diddeliver girls marry me skye you are prejudiced robbie she smiled wanly take me back inside and ill bid de grenville goodnight what time do you sail tomorrow we catch the midday tide ill come in the morning to bid you farewell they walked back through the garden and into the house de grenville had fallen asleep in his chair il est un cochon muttered marie no said skye he hurt you mignon skye shrugged better i heard it from him than from a stranger marie alas our good wine does not agree with him suddenly the small diningroom door was flung open and skyes bargeman stumbled into the room beside her majordomo walters who gasped madam the queen comes what the bargeman spoke up the queen mistress shes almost here she sent a messenger ahead of her on the river my god im not dressed properly to receive her quick marie and she raced upstairs to her own apartment calling to daisy as she ran fetch the burgundycolored silk with the goldandcream stripped underskirt the rubies my gold ribbons marie go back downstairs and have walters clear the dining room ill want ham cheeses fruits thin sugar wafers and wines have them set on the sideboards in the banquet room wake de grenville and have robbie sober him marie turned and ran from the room while the maids fluttered about skye she quickly changed her clothes hawise watch the window sing out the second you see the queens barge a few minutes later as skye smoothed the wrinkles from the elegant silk gown hawise called the queens barge is rounding the bend maam skye flew from the room and down the stairs catching robbie and de grenville by the hands the trio sped across the terrace down another garden and reached the barge landing moments before the queens boat bumped it the two men stepped forward to aid elizabeth as she disembarked while skye swept the monarch a magnificent curtsey her winecolored skirts billowing gracefully her dark head lowered in perfect submission the young queen eyed her hostess approvingly rise mistress goya del fuentes ton my soul you make the most elegant and graceful curtsey ive ever seen standing skye thanked the queen with a smile and elizabeth said we hope youll forgive us this unorthodox visit but it was brought to our attention that sir robert sails tomorrow we could not allow him to leave on such a lengthy voyage without giving him our good wishes robbie flushed with obvious pleasure majesty i am over whelmed by your kindness madam said skye will you take refreshment thank you mistress sir robert de grenville you may escort me southwood take mistress goya del fuentes and mistress knol lys the queen moved off leaving skye stricken here was geoffrey stepping up from the queens barge handing out a ravishing lovely redheaded girl skye may i present the queens cousin lettice this is mistress goya del fuentes lettice knollys smiled in a friendly fashion her pale skin glowing and youthful were of an age she said may i call you skye and you call me lettice but of course skye answered god in heaven was this girl the rich match the queen proposed for geoffrey its good to see you skye the earl of lynmouth murmured softly as he escorted both women up the garden to the house behind them the other halfdozen barges that had escorted the queen were unloading their passengers what a charming house you have remarked lettice i have always wanted a small house on the strand you do not come to court do you there is no need and besides i am not of the nobility if the queen invited me however i would of course obey they had reached the house now and as they entered southwood said quietly lettice i must speak with skye keep the queen occupied for me before skye had time to protest he had whisked her into the library and shut the door firmly i cannot leave my guests the queen will notice she protested madam i have been parted from you for three months now have you no warmer welcome for me sir you presume a great deal i do however offer you my deepest sympathy on the loss of your wife and children you knew how de grenville told me earlier this evening she turned and walked a little ways from him i understand i am also to wish you felicitations on an upcoming marriage is it mistress knollys and will you honeymoon on your barge i dont own a barge why sir she said scathingly did you not win de grenvilles barge i understood the wager was his barge against your stallion he is quite distressed by the loss of the animal damn de grenville for a fool swore the earl sweetheart listen to me the bet was made when you snubbed me on the first day we ever met i had no intention of collecting on it it had nothing to do with our falling in love later on i intended to tell dickon so but i forgot it when i was summoned to devon that worthless bitch i married had brought my son henry home when there was smallpox in the village he came home only to die that she and four of her girls perished as well is only gods judgment then it was touch and go with the three youngest i stayed on until they were well i am not entirely heartless skye theyre but four and five you might have written mefrankly it did not occur to me i am not a man of words skye the pox swept through my estates like wildfire and i was kept damned busy my bailiff died among others and until i could replace him i did his work youve been back at court for a while my lord you might have sent me a message a posy of flowers something but you were too busy finding an heiress to replace your dead wife i hate you geoffrey i will never forgive you you used me like a common trollop you lied to me angrily she turned away so he might not see the tears springing into her eyes i was warned that you were the biggest bastard in london but god help me i would not believe it youre right he admitted i have spent the time since my return to court arranging my next marriage her shoulders shook and his ears caught a muffled sob the lady i wish to make the next countess of lynmouth is one of the most beautiful women in london she is wealthy so i need not fear that she seeks my money her manners are flawless and she is an excellent hostess able to deal graciously with those of high and low estate she is the perfect mate for me his voice was filled with such love and admiration that each word he spoke was like a great knife thrust in to her heart there was only one problem that might have prevented the match he continued so it was necessary that i convince the queen that despite this impediment i would have no other woman to wife iii am not interested my lord earl turning she tried to push past him but he held her fast her face was pressed against the velvet of his doublet i must return to my guests she pleaded he ignored her the lady in question is not english she claims to be an irish orphan who wed a spanish merchant and was then widowed so i have represented her to the queen i know however that the story is not true she was a captive slave of unknown background who was fortunate enough to catch the eye of the great whoremaster of algiers he took her under his protection and when he was murdered she fled algiers with his wealth but i love her and i want her for my wife i have convinced the queen of the wisdom of my choice she has given me her permission for us to wed skye pulled away from the earl and when she looked up at him her eyes were blazing blue fire i do not know how you have obtained your information though your facts are correct you know nothing at all yes i was brought as a captive to khalid el beythat was his name my lord earl i had no memory of who i was or where i had come from but he didnt care he might have made me a whore in one of his houses or he might have made me his concubine he did neither i was indeed under his protection but my lord earl i was also his wife are you so narrowminded that you believe a marriage doesnt exist unless it is celebrated by a christian priest the chief mullah of algiers wed me to my lord khalid i was well and truly married she was pacing back and forth now her burgundy silk skirts swishing angrily her hair had come loose and as she turned to face him again it swung fiercely with her my daughter sir bears her fathers christian surname for he was a spaniard by birth driven from that cursed land by the cruelty of the inquisition i expect my lord that even you can understand that you will find in the baptis mal registry of st marys church in bideford the name of mary willow goya del fuentes i could not wed with you my lord it would be grossly unfair to mingle my unknown blood and tainted body with such as yours i fully understand the great honor you do me but no and pushing past him she fled the room geoffrey southwood stood stunned and disbelieving as robert small entered the room and closed the door behind him what the hell did you do to her growled the little captain i asked her to marry me why because i love her shouted the earl i told her i knew the truth of her past and it mattered not i even have the queens permission laddie laddie youre a fool did she tell you that she has no memory prior to her life in algiers yes listen to me my lord i am old enough to be your father and ill speak to you as one her husband was my best friend in all this world he was bom the second son of an old and noble family but fate decreed that he live a life far different than that for which he believed himself intended whatever his profession he was a true gentleman in every sense you love skye so did he with all his heart she was his joy his pride and he wanted nothing more than to spend his life with her and the children they wanted to have he had just learned before he was murdered that he was to be a father and his happiness came j close to making me weep robbie breathed deeply and turned to sit southwood sat across from him i invented skyes background in order to protect her and the child now geoffrey lad i will help you to bring skye around for the stubborn wench loves you and has sighed and wept enough over you these last few months i dont suppose she told you shes with child oh my god the earl whispered no said robbie drily well she is angry with you well we must be firm then i have just the way to settle this but you must go along with me in all i say agreed southwood slowly nodded come along then lad and ill show you how to neatly trap a vixen they came back out to the large salon where skye and the queen were holding court together surrounded by a laughing group of courtiers they worked their way forward carefully until they were next to the young queen elizabeth was looking especially lovely her glorious redgold hair a mass of long loose ringlets her smoky eyes sparkling her gown was of applegreen silk embroidered heav ily with gold small pearls and topaz is the guest of honor finally among us said the queen laugh ing pray sir where have you and my lord southwood been settling the details of the match thats so dear to your kind majestys heart as mistress goya del fuentes parentis in absentia it was my duty now madam with your gracious permission i shall delay my departure by one day in order to give the bride away can your majesty persuade the archbishop to waive the banns and wed the happy couple tomorrow stunned skye began to speak but the queen clapped her hands with delight sir robert its an excellent idea yes yes the wedding shall be tomorrow at greenwich you shall give the bride away and i shall hostess the wedding party majesty we are honored said the earl placing a firm arm about skye are we not sweetheart aye my lord said skye loudly and sweetly then while every one chattered excitedly about them she hissed id sooner have the pox than marry you come everyone cried the queen if mistress goya del fuentes is to be ready to wed at one oclock tomorrow then we must leave her now away to greenwich she turned to skye my dear youre a delightful hostess we have enjoyed ourselves so much you shall be a credit to the southwood family i know lynmouth will escort me home hie yourself to bed and rest i should imagine youll get little sleep tomorrow night if your betrotheds reputation is fairly earned chuckling the queen departed for her barge skye rounded on robbie furiously ill not marry him do you hear ill not marry him indeed you will skye lass said robert small with infuriating calm be sensible my dear he knows the truth of your past and yet he loves you and wants to marry you think skye youll be the countess of lynmouth and think of the child youre carrying refuse lynmouth and no one will believe the baby is his for what woman in her right mind would not marry her childs father then the question will be asked whose child is it and since you have not socialized with anyone it will be aasumed that you coupled with a groom or a footman the child is lowborn people will say then what will happen to willow with every word he uttered she felt more and more trapped ill go happily off to sea now knowing youre safe loved and cared for skye he finished damn you robbie if khalid knew what youd done hed fully approve skye and you know it snapped the gruff little man come along now the queen is right and you need your sleep tonight tell daisy what gown youd wear tomorrow so the maids may freshen it i will chose nothing she said stubbornly then i will my dear come along now lass he took her hand and walked her upstairs to her apartment daisy girl to me he called and the buxom maid appeared sir your mistress is to be wed at one tomorrow to the earl of lynmouth what in her wardrobe is suitable for a wedding gown daisys brown eyes grew round with awe and delight oh sir oh maam how wonderful skye turned away sulkily and stamped into her bedchamber where she threw herself on the bed daisy looked questioningly at robert small dont fret girl the captain reassured her your mistress is simply in a mood lets have a look at her wardrobe daisy led the way to skyes dressing room robert smalls mouth fell open sweet jesus he exclaimed ive never seen so many fine feathers in my entire life daisy giggled these are only the ones suitable for a wedding sir the simpler things are hung in another room robert small shook his head then began to study the gowns white was ruled out for skye was a widow and somehow a bright color seemed inappropriate then his eye was caught by a rich heavy candlelightcolored satin lets see that one daisy drew the gown forth and held it out for his inspection the simple bodice was cut low and embroidered in seed pearls the puffed sleeves which ended just below the elbow were slashed and the openings filled in with a fine creamcolored lace below the elbow the sleeves hugged the arm in alternating bands of satin and lace the wrists were ruffled by a wide band of lace the underskirt was embroidered with delicate seed pearls and tiny diamond flowers the dress had a small starched heartshaped lace collar edged in tiny diamonds that rose up behind the neck the underskirt was a graceful bell shape aye daisy my girl this will more than do see its pressed and ready by ten in the morning your mistress is being married in the queens own chapel at greenwich and the queen is giving the bridal feast afterward theyll also be spending the night there oh sweet mary sir will i be allowed to go my mistress will be needing me im sure aye girl youll go the little maid nearly swooned in her ecstasy lord sir wait till me old mother hears that im maid to the countess of lynmouth shell be so proud oh sir you dont think mistress skye will want someone else do you im nothing but a simple devon girl your mistress will want you daisy never fear see to the dress now and have a scented bath ready for your lady at dawn wash her hair too yes sir gathering up the beautiful gown daisy left robert alone he walked back to the bedroom are you finished sulking lass he asked i never sulk she snapped sitting up i simply dislike having my life settled for me by other people do i have no choice in this no lass not this time youre angry with southwood and so you seek to spite him by making his son a bastard yes i do believe its a boy you carry but the earl has suffered enough being caught in a loveless marriage having his heir die without even knowing that his potent seed has already taken root in your fertile womb he offers you marriage its hardly an insult my dear and what of my wealth is it to be poured into the lynmouth coffers along with that of his first two wives no no i wont be left helpless and dependent like poor mary robert small smiled a slow smile so thats whats bothering you lass part of it she admitted dont fret skye lass im not about to leave you helpless the earl directed me to have a marriage contract drawn up tonight which hell sign in the morning youll have to give him a good dowry skye but the bulk of your wealth will remain in your hands this house will remain in your hands and ive made you my heiress providing that if anything happens to me youll care for cecily that way youll have plenty for willow robbie oh robbie she began to weep softly embarrassed he clumsily put his arms about her give over lass he muttered gruffly for pitys sake dont cry all over me i like it better when you scream who else could i leave wren court to skye youre the daughter i never had lass and youre as dear to me as if you were my own thank you robbie youre the best friend ive ever had she wiped her eyes and robbie tried to muffle a sniff now listen to me skye were giving southwood twentyfive thousand gold crowns for dowry and of course you come with your clothing plate and jewelry all the rest of your wealth the money khalid left the shares in our partnership this house and wren court remain exclusively yours he cant take them so you are free and independent will he sign such a contract robbie hell sign lass the queen would have his head if he refused for young bess is very much her own woman like you he patted her shoulder its very late skye well past midnight rest now my dear i will see you in the morning which gown did you choose robbie the creamy satin with the pearl and diamond embroidery he answered smiling its the one id choose were i interested in this marriage he chuckled sleep well mistress goya del fuentes tomorrow night youll be lady southwood countess of lynmouth not bad for such an ugly wench he ducked the pillow she threw at him as he strode from the room laughing merrily chapter skyes wedding morning was a rainy spring day she stretched in a leisurely fashion dimly aware of activity about her then suddenly sat straight up in bed she was being married in a few hours and there was so much to be done a steaming tub was already waiting before the fireplace good morning mlady chorused daisy and the two undermaids bobbing not my lady yet daisy said skye sharply the two maidservants giggled then gasped their faces reddening as skye rose from her bed drew off her gown and walked naked across the room daisy who was used to her mistresss eccentricities with regard to nudity in the bath smirked smugly at the redfaced underlings and helped skye up the two steps and into the big tub skye sunk gratefully into the bath the sweetsmelling oily water caressed her skin and lapped about her shoulders daisy drew a screen about the tub leaving her mistress to a few moments of privacy while she guided the undermaids in the laying out of the brides clothing so thought skye today is my wedding day how different it is from the joyous day that i wed you khalid oh my dearest lord how i loved you but you are gone khalid and this strange english lord has caught at my heart i may be wealthy dear khalid but the honest truth is that the widow of an algerian merchant is scarcely on a social footing with a belted earl yet he would make me his countess its not simply to get me in his bed for i have already been there he claims to love me yet he left me without a word for weeks dare i trust him or will he break my heart oh god i wish i could know i want to be loved but even more i want to be safe again mistress scolded daisy youve not yet begun to wash daisy took up the soft cloth herself and began to scrub her mistress skye continued to muse silently as daisy moved on to wash her mistresss hair daisys chatter caused skye to lose her train of thought and she exploded relenting at the hurt look on daisys face skye confided ive wakened with a terrible headache daisy and i dont want it later on at greenwich daisy became concerned ah mlady ill have an herbal draught made up at once hawise she turned to one of the serving maids ask dame cecily to please make up an herbal tea for mladys headache skye left her tub wrapped in a large warmed bathsheet and seated by the fire endured daisys further ministrations her hair was rubbed free of excess water brushed and brushed and brushed again until it was dry then rubbed with a piece of silk until it shone with deep bluegold lights meanwhile the second of the undermaids knelt paring her mistresss toenails what i really need is something to eat declared skye bring me bread meat and wine im starving see to it daisy jane either the earl will like my feet or he wont she stood up and the bathsheet dropped daisy wrapped her mistress in a loose pink silk robe then hurried off to see to the food picking up her pedicure equipment jane departed as well skye sighed with open relief it was so lovely to be alone but the sound of chuckling spun her around geoffrey good morrow wife he stood before the tapestry that hid the secret passage door not quite yet my lord she answered sharply how long have you been standing there long enough to be reminded what a magnificent creature you are madam he drawled lazily his green eyes sweeping boldly over her a flush stained her entire body and she shook her cloud of hair did he really love her or was it only lust to possess her she determined to try and find out now he could cry off when she had finished but that was better than being owned by a man who had no real feelings for her walking deliberately to the door she locked it and then said firmly sit down my lord will you take some wine he nodded and she poured him a small goblet from her sideboard supply well madam he demanded after accepting the goblet and leaning back what is it she drew a deep breath how brave you are to wed with me my lord but are you sure you really want to take to wife the widow of one of the most notorious men in the history of algiers i remind you that i recall nothing whatever prior to my life with khalid el bey he made me what i am god only knows what tainted blood flows in my veins my mother might have been mad and my father a murderer think carefully my lord is this the sort of woman you would take to wife why skye he drawled are you trying to discourage me she shook her head he continued did khalid el bey teach you to read and write no she answered i already knew what else did you know my love different languages mathematics she said slowly the knowledge was just there though i dont remember acquiring it youve hardly a peasants look he observed and youve been damnably well educated for a man astoundingly for a woman from the moment we first met i knew that we should be more to each other than simply friends i wanted to know more about you and i inquired of a sea captain of my acquaintance one who knew robert small and of his association with khalid el bey the captain left algiers several days after you and small did the story of your flight from the turk was on every tongue in the city particularly because your loss was said to have rendered the unfortunate man impotent skye choked back her laughter with the confirmation of her revenge on jamil but she didnt know whether to be angry at geoffrey southwood for this invasion of her privacy or flattered that he had been so deeply interested in her she was above all pleased to know that geoffrey wanted her even though he knew of her past youve signed the marriage contract she asked him coolly aye your dowry is most generous my love with your permission i shall put it in trust for our first son i dont need it he countered it was her move one winged dark eyebrow raised slightly you read the contract didnt you my wealth remains mine of course my dear i will dower any children we have i know youll want to provide for willow but if you had not a pennypiece skye id have gladly dowered your daughter yet it was said that you refused to dower your own they were marys brats he replied bitterly little brown wrens like their mother obviously capable of bearing only daughters the three who survived the pox however seem to have something of me in them theyll be good company for willow and since i can see from the mutinous expression in your eyes that youll give me trouble unless i dower my daughters i promise to do so i shall be a good mother to your children geoffrey i know that skye he rose and moved toward her the longing in his eyes almost too painful to behold but she held him at arms length not yet geoffrey please not yet you have not forgiven me then it was a statement i can understand your not writing to me from devon it must have been terrible for you there yet when you returned you sent no word and i had to learn from de grenville of your misfortunes and he said the queen was arranging a match for you with an heiress what was i to think you might have trusted me skye how could you expect my trust after i learned of the infamous wager that you made with dickon damn skye i never meant to collect from him surely you see that the wager happened before you and i truly met your reputation preceded you my lord geoffrey southwood the angel earl the great cocksman and breaker of hearts enough dammit woman you argue with too much logic i love you skye i will always love you in a few short hours we are to be wed let us forget what is past and begin afresh we are well matched madam he held out his hand to her then slowly after a long agonized wait she took it one question he said and i shall never ask this question again did you love him yes she replied gravely i loved him i awoke from some unremembered horror to find safety with him he gave me a name an identity a reason for living he was my husband he was my lover he was my best friend i will never forget him she continued after a silence i find it strange to say this but though khalid el bey will always hold a claim on a part of my heart i love you also geoffrey why else would i have been so angry and so hurt the limegreen eyes regarded her now with hope as well as longing then i am forgiven skye the smile she offered was tremulous perhaps my lord she said mischievously madam you try my patience he growled but his lips twitched at the corners and his eyes were bright with both relief and mirth you had best cultivate patience my lord for i will be no meek wife geoffrey i will be an equal partner with you in this marriage equal in all things she was more trusting now and immediately he took advantage pulling her toward him he wrapped both his arms about her then bent to find her lips a delicious tremor shot through her and she sighed deeply madam he said kissing the comers of her mouth her eyelids the tip of her nose its a cool wet day and were we not to be wed in just a few hours i should take you to bed right now do you require several hours my lord her face was a study in innocence vixen he murmured huskily burying his face in the scented tangle of her hair she felt his kisses burning into the satiny skin of her neck with a low moan she threw her head back and his lips devoured her throat setting her pulse to racing beware madam tonight i shall seek revenge for your sharp tongue but today when you enter the queens chapel you will look chaste not newly tumbled he loosed her slowly and she swayed unsteadily he laughed softly and turning departed through the secret door behind the tapestry skye stood trembling dear god how he could arouse her and he knew it she became aware of pounding at the door mistress skye mistress skye are you all right she flew to the door and opened it to find daisy hawise and jane standing there with anxious faces i wanted to be alone she conjured as best she could they gave her funny looks then continued into the room bearing a breakfast which was placed on a small table two footmen followed and removed the tub jane folded the screen and put it away while daisy and hawise drew the breakfast table and a chair up near the fire cook says you are to eat everything knowing how youve picked at your food lately and youll not eat much later said daisy also it will be hours before the bridal feast skye sat down and lifting the cover on the largest dish found two perfectly poached eggs in a light cream sauce of sherry and dill a small platter held several thin slices of pink ham and wrapped inside a napkin set in a basket were several slices of steaming hot bread two crocks held butter and honey and there was a carafe of deep red wine she was suddenly ravenous tell cook she is to be commended on the menu hawise i shall eat it all daisy my jewel case please i must pick out my jewelry while eating jane find the gown i had made up for dame cecily and bring it to her then fetch willow and her nurse the two undermaids hurried off and daisy brought skyes huge jewel box skye pursed her red lips considering simple pearls were too dull diamonds too harsh what was needed was some color her fingers sifted impatiently through the many necklaces until she located what she sought she smiled quite satisfied with the turquoise necklace each polished oval turquoise was surrounded by alternating translucent pearls and fiery diamonds there were matching earbobs and two hair ornaments shaped like butterflies these she said handing them to daisy now for rings a turquoise for luck a pink pearl for constancy and a sapphire to match my bonnie blue eyes daisy giggled setting aside the chosen pieces she removed the large case ive a message for you from captain small mlady he says though the rivers calm it would be best to go to greenwich in the carriage the rain is quite heavy very well daisy ah heres my little love cried skye happily as her bedchamber door opened to admit willow and her nurse mama mama the child cried running into skyes open arms smell good willow likes she said burying her little face in her mothers neck skye swept the baby up and cuddled her in her lap today my poppet she said i have a fine present for you i shall bring you home a papa would you like that willow no said the baby stoutly no new papa want uncle robbie skye chuckled so its uncle robbie who has captured your heart my darling youve good taste but youll soon love your new papa too and hell love you willow pouted her little rosebud mouth set in disapproval the thick dark lashes that fringed her golden eyeseyes like her fathersswept down to brush her pink cheeks then swept upward in such a flirtatious adult manner that skye caught her breath with surprise will my new papa bring willow presents she asked slyly indeed he will greedy one replied her mother amused what the question was an imperious demand i dont know my pet perhaps a new gown or a necklace or a wee basket of sweetmeats maybe ill like my new papa said willow thoughtfully do you like him mama skye laughed yes poppet i like him very much now give mama a kiss and run off to play with maudie if you are very good ill bring you something from greenwich palace willow kissed her mother and then trotted happily off with her nurse skye finished up the last of her meal as the mantel clock struck half past eleven oh lord you must leave here by noon if youre to reach greenwich on time exclaimed daisy you jane hawise bring the mistresss clothes she handed skye a pair of creamcolored stockings so finely knitted they seemed spun of cobwebs skye slid them on carefully beaming daisy handed her the garters with silver lace rosettes each flower center a tiny freshwater pearl skyes undergarments were pure silk a smallboned corset made her small waist even tinier her farthingale was a modified one for skye had no wish to look like a merchant ship under sail before putting it on she sat quietly while daisy did her hair it was brushed once again then parted in the center and drawn back over her ears daisy fashioned the thick silken mass into an elegant and graceful chignon that centered on the nape of skyes neck the butterfly ornaments were secured one in the front one on the right side of her head as a finishing touch daisy carefully set two perfect pink rosebuds into the chignon skye sat and stared at her image a flawlessfaced woman stared back at her is that me she thought and for the first time in many months she began to wonder who she really was who had she been before khalid el bey had found her suddenly she desperately wanted her own identity back madam daisys voice interrupted her thoughts we must hurry skye nodded and stood on went the farthingale and then it was time for the gown chattering excitedly jane and hawise fastened it up skye smoothed the skirt and stepped in front of her pier glass a slow smile lit her features she was well satisfied she looked every inch the countess of lynmouth geoffrey would have every reason to be proud of her oh my lady breathed daisy reverently youre beautiful thank you daisy now my cloak lest the rain spoil my gown a deepblue velvet cape was draped about her shoulders and skye left her apartments to descend the staircase robbie and dame cecily awaited her and she swept them both a low curtsey how magnificent you both look truly shed never seen either of them looking better dame cecilys gown was of elegant black silk with an underskirt of cloth of silver she had a white lace ruff at her neck and lace ruffles at her wrists on her silver hair she wore a peaked cap of stiff black silk edged in silver lace upon her ample bosom rested a silver chain with a heartshaped pendant cut from turquoise dame cecilys lightblue eyes twinkled with pleasure my dear skye how can i thank you for this beautiful gown and an ermine cloak i was despairing over what to wear to greenwich and on such short of notice too skye was pleased by the older womans evident delight i had the ensemble made for your birthday next month she confessed now i must find you another gift dear child this is more than enough and what matter that youve presented it to me a wee bit early this is the perfect occasion to wear such a fine gown nevertheless youll have a gift on your birthday too vowed skye is there no compliment for me then lass complained the little captain why robbie you know youre the prettiest of us all teased skye hummph said robbie but a small smile played about his mouth and he preened without knowing he did so skye hadnt seen him so magnificently attired since the night she had first met him like his sister he was garbed in black but where she wore silk he wore velvet the doublet heavily embroidered with gold thread aquamarines pearls and rubies the sword at his side had a goldfiligreed hilt with a large ruby knob let us go lass said robbie as he heard the coach draw up before the house when the front door was opened the wind blew their capes wildly about them and rain thrust its way into the house wetting the marble floor without a word the tallest of the footmen swept skye up and carried her out through the tempest to the safety of her carriage a flustered dame cecily and blushing daisy were also deposited carefully robert small climbed in under his own steam the trip to greenwich was a relatively easy one for the roads had been emptied by the ferocity of the storm the rain drove against the brightly painted coach pouring down the windows in sheets it was impossible to see out skye felt a surge of pity for her coachman high up on the box muffled against the weather but still prey to it even worse off were the footmen who clung behind the vehicle the rain pouring down over them inside the coach skye clung to robert smalls hand she had not been frightened when she married khalid el bey but now she was a little afraid added to her trepidation was the realization that she would soon have to tell geoffrey of the child she could well imagine his joy but then what if it was not a son would he one day attempt to banish her as he had poor mary bowen she felt her spine stiffen she would never allow him to treat her in such a fashion and if he ever tried she would appeal to the queen the coach slowed to a clattering halt at greenwich and the ladies were carried into the palace by the queens own guards greenwich palace much beloved of henry viii was built along the river for a seemingly endless distance and stood three stories tall a palace official escorted them to a small room next to the chapel where they might freshen themselves and repair any damage to their clothing daisy helped skye and dame cecily off with their cloaks the hood of skyes cloak had protected her head so there was little to do dame cecily drew a small laceedged square from a hidden pocket in her gown and pressed it upon skye for luck my dear and i wish you great happiness she said tearfully kissing the younger woman then dame cecily disappeared into the chapel daisy following behind suddenly everything was moving too quickly robbie was there leading her through the door into the chapel and up the aisle the room was packed skye didnt know most of them although she spied de grenville lettice knollys the queen and lord dudley who was rumored to be her lover even lord and lady burke were there geoffrey stood waiting before the altar resplendent in huntergreen velvet matthew parker the archbishop of canterbury waited behind geoffrey slowly she and her beloved robbie moved up the aisle skye felt as if her legs were encased in glue ahead of her geoffrey southwood radiated approval of her attire his eyes smiled encouragingly they stopped and robbie firmly placed skyes hand into geoffreys large paw geoffreys warmth transmitted itself to her he gently squeezed her hand and she drew a deep breath of relief it was going to be all right the archbishop droned through the service and as they knelt their heads close together geoffrey whispered softly to her courage my love she felt a stab of love for him race through her the unease she had felt at the sight of the hot crowded candlelit chapel was slowly being dispelled by his love matthew parker pronounced them man and wife and turning them about presented the newly wedded couple to the assembled congregation they smiled happily into the sea of faces mat all smiled back at them all but one why was lord burkes face so dark with anger he was such a strange man and why was he here at all she turned away and curtseyed low to queen elizabeth who was magnificently attired in purest white silk sewn with gold thread diamonds and palest blue aquamarine her majesty spoke graciously rise my lady southwood countess of lynmouth we are pleased to have you at court and welcome you right heartily majesty how can i thank you for your kindness it is all so much you may show your gratitude my dear skye by being a good and faithful wife to your lord and by cleaving to him only replied the young queen primly i shall majesty replied skye fervently kissing the hand elizabeth extended that will be a terrible blow to all the eager gallants murmured lord dudley softly to lettice knollys she swallowed back her laughter with much effort and now cried the queen gaily let us away to the bridal feast let the earl and countess of lynmouth lead the way to the great hall skye sent geoffrey a startled look taking her arm he reassured her i know the way my love accompanied by capering musicians who played on reedy pipes lutes and drums the couple led the queen and her court into the great hall of greenwich palace outside the rain beat fiercely against the tall ornate windows but inside the great hearths burned cheerfully with enormous oak logs the head table accommodated the bridal couple the queen lord dudley and captain sir robert small and his sister who had acted as the orphaned brides parents the rest of the court knew their places many from habit and found them now either along the length of the tshaped head table or at smaller tables set up along the walls the servants placed an enormous salt cellar upon the main table two standing winged silver griffons and two standing gold lions together held up a carved coral seashell filled with salt the goblets were palepink blown venetian glass the queens crest carved upon an oval piece of garnet and affixed to each golden plates were placed before those at the head table the other guests seated above the salt had to be satisfied with silver and those below the salt with simple crockery a parade of liveried servants began the circulation of an enormous feast the first course consisted of the usual bowls of icy cold raw oysters mussels and scallops broiled with herbs and butter tiny prawns in white wine thinly sliced salmon on a bed of young watercress whole sea trout and great loaves of both brown and white bread the next course offered sides of beef whole roast red roe deer legs of lamb a whole great boar with wicked curved tusks rested upon a huge silver platter which had to be carried in by four footmen there were small sweet roast suckling pigs with apples in their mouths gingered capons big pink hams swans stuffed with fruit geese roast pheasants and peacocks served with their full colorful plumage larded ducks steaming pies made with lark pigeon dove sparrow and rabbit there were bowls of new lettuce scallions radishes and artichokes the servants kept everyones goblets full to the brim with a deep red heady burgundy skye ate little disliking huge feasts where the menus were far too heavy a few oysters a capon wing a thin slice of suckling pig and some lettuce satisfied her she noted thankfully that geoffrey was as abstemious as she choosing oysters a small slice each of the beef and the goose an artichoke and some bread and butter the last course of sweets and subtleties arrived with a profusion of colorful molded jellies fruit pies plum cakes early strawberries with bowls of clotted cream early cherries from france oranges from spain and wheels of cheshire cheese there was of course an enormous sugariced wedding cake to skyes great relief the cake did not have the usual marzipan bride and groom figures with their overly endowed sexual organs and breasts instead the cake top was decorated by a small bouquet of tiny white roses and blue forgetmenots all tied with silver ribbons somehow skye knew this was the queens touch and she leaned across lord dudley and thanked her the queen smiled quietly he loves you very much skye i have not seen such true love and devotion in all my life how i wish i might have such a love to help me sustain my great burdens why surely you can madam said skye there are any number of gentlemen willing to lay their hearts at your feet the queen smiled again sadly this time how innocent the new countess of lynmouth was how sheltered she must have been before coming to england there are many men willing to lay their hearts at my feet skye but none really loves me they seek my crown or a part of it they do not want elizabeth a queen who rules in her own right has no true love she is wed to her country that is the harshest to serve of all lords oh madam skyes eyes filled with tears the young queen gently brushed a tear from the brides cheek why my lady southwood what a soft heart you have but weep not for me i knew my fate a long time ago i accepted it and i wanted it then thoughtfully she said i think my kindhearted little countess that i shall call upon you to serve as one of my ladies an honest open heart is a rare thing at court skye shortly found out how right the queen was after the tiny cordial glasses of spiced hippocras wine and thin sugar wafers that officially ended a banquet were served the dancing began at the other end of the hall the bride danced first with her new husband then with lord dudley after that she was prey to all the gentlemen several were forward enough to suggest assignations while staring boldly down her dress skye was shocked the morals of the islamic world she remembered had been quite strict here at greenwich they appeared to be lax indeed she soon found herself partnered by the scowling lord burke did the man never smile my felicitations madam you have done quite well for yourself his tone was most insulting and she found herself once again infuriated by the man she fixed him with a level gaze and asked why my lord are you so hostile to me have i done you some injury of which i am not aware pray speak sir that i may correct whatever fault it is that offends you wordlessly he drew her from the dance floor and led her to the table where refreshments were being served his silver eyes probed her face never looking away suddenly he asked have you ever heard of the omalleys of innisfana island madam she thought a moment then replied i am sorry lord burke but i have not is it important to you no he said roughly it is of no account madam but he appeared almost distraught why she asked herself dame cecily bustled up just then its time you got ready for bed my dear here are mistress lettice and some of the queens ladies to help you lady southwood lord burke bowed curtly over her hand then he turned and walked away skye and her female companions left the hall discreetly her majesty confided lettice knollys has given you an apartment in a quiet part of the palace youll be quite private how i envy you this night southwood is said to be a magnificent lover lettice scolded another of the queens ladies if her majesty should hear such loose talk youll be sent down to the country the queens redhaired cousin tossed her beautiful head the queen would sell her soul to be the bride this night if lord dudley were the groom lettice cried several scandalized voices you speak treason but lettice knollys simply laughed ah here we are skye she announced as she paused before a door the guards flung open the door and the chattering women entered into a prettily furnished bedchamber where daisy awaited her mistress along with two palace maids the large oak bedstead held up ornately twisted bedposts which were hung with pink velvet hangings to the left of the bed casement windows looked out toward the rainswept river to the right of the bed was a large stone fireplace now blazing with enough warmth to have removed all dampness from the room and rendered it cozy daisy and her two assistants set to work immediately disrobing the bride wearing only a single petticoat and her underblouse skye bathed in rosewater from a silver basin then her hair was taken down and brushed until it gleamed the bluegold lights were the envy of most of the women in the room now daisy brought forth the nightgown the two undermaids removed the last of the brides clothing and the nightgown slid down and over her the queens ladies gasped in shock and envy for the nightgown clung to skye as if it had been painted on her it was made of pure white silk the bodice forming a deep v the sleeves wide like butterfly wings the skirt a mass of tiny pleats gods blood lettice knollys voiced all their thoughts that gown will not be long on you my dear skye but will he leave it in one piece murmured one woman the rest of the ladies giggled skye blushed and then laughed nervously it is said to be a copy of one worn by the popes mistress hurry called one of the women i can hear them coming they helped her into bed plumping the fat laceedged pillows behind her back and smoothing the downfilled satin coverlet she felt very foolish the center of all this attention in what should have been a private moment she remembered how she and khalid el bey had slipped away from their guests on their wedding night to ride down the moonlit beach to the pearl kiosk but she was not in algeria she was in england it was not khalid el bey she eagerly awaited but geoffrey southwood the door burst open admitting a laughing crowd of men and women geoffrey southwood was pushed forward he was barechested weve half undressed him madam said lord dudley with a drunken grin his arm was around the queen in a proprietary manner and elizabeth was flushed and looking very pretty i shall finish the job myself said lord southwood firmly for the countess and myself i bid you all a good night come everyone the queen called throwing the newlyweds a sympathetic look i have not yet tired of dancing the courtiers and servants all filed out and the earl shut the door behind them and threw the bolt hard wordlessly he stripped off the rest of his clothing and blew out the candles the firelight played on his lean frame and golden hair he turned and held out a hand to her come to me skye she rose from the bed and walked toward him a slow smile lit his face he took in the full effect of her gown and the grin grew the tiny skirt pleats undulated to show her long legs and when she stood before him he quietly hooked his hands on either side of the neckline and tore the gown away laughing she flung her arms about him he could feel his passion flame and taking her face in his hands he pressed a kiss upon her halfopened lips i love you skye he murmured huskily and i love you my lord she answered her deep blue eyes shining his hands slid slowly from her perfect shoulders down her smooth long fair back until he could cup and gently squeeze each sweetly rounded buttock i have missed you so he sighed softly bending his head to capture a taut nipple in his warm mouth teasingly his tongue encircled it again and again until he felt her quiver sliding to his knees his mouth moved with maddening slowness downward until at last his probing tongue slipped between the pouting lips of her womans center she whimpered please he raised his head and gazed at her please what skye please she repeated and pulling away from him fled to the bed and flung herself upon it laughing softly he joined her pinioning her beneath him do you want me my wanton little wife he teased no skye dont turn your head away from me i want to see your lovely face when i take you ah sweetheart theres nothing wrong in wanting this tell me love tell me yes yes yes she half sobbed and he filled her full his own excitement mounting as her beautiful eyes told him all the things she was even now too shy to say aloud he was incredibly gentle and this very gentleness roused her wildly her passion again acted as a spur to his own desire until it exploded within her as hers exploded they lay exhausted and then he pulled her into his arms caressing her soft hair her trembling body ah love he murmured low now we have officially sealed the bargain we made today before the archbishop i love you skye and i shall always make you happy i swear it she turned in his arms so that she faced him and said quietly your child already grows in my womb thank you my darling he answered puzzled by his lack of surprise she realized that he must have guessed her secret geoffreyyou knew is that why you asked me to marry you he could see the hurt mounting in her eyes i am no bitch to be bred she cried furiously i did not know until after i had asked you he said quickly robbie told you she accused damn him for a meddling old woman aye he told me i was close to either strangling you or beating you black and blue you are the most stubborn wayward witch ive ever met skye southwood the child you carry is both yours and mine and i want it youve no right to deny it me simply because your pride fears i might love our child more than i love you i will love the babe but i shall never love anyone or anything as i love you skye whatever i had to do to get you to marry me i would do again she was stunned by the intensity of his voice and unable to find the words of reply she heard him begin to chuckle softly and the chuckle grew until the chamber was filled by the sound of his laughter so he crowed ive finally rendered you speechless you overproud overtalkative irish wench mayhap now you will finally admit to my mastery over you surely no one has ever rendered you speechless before now the angry reply died on her lips at the sight of his bright limegreen eyes which were tender and full with love i have a terrible temper she said in a small voice aye he agreed gravely you do i do not like injustice of any kind nor do i my love nevertheless it is not a perfect world we live in as you well know and there are no perfect humans living in it as you also know i will not be chattel geoffrey i have guided my own destiny too long were you so independent with khalid el bey my darling i cannot imagine the wife of a moorish gentleman being given such great freedom what a strange conversation to be having on my wedding night she thought here i am lying naked in my second husbands arms calmly discussing my previous lord khalid she said slowly respected my intelligence it was he along with his secretary who taught me how to run his business and handle his investments he used to jest that if anything happened to him i should surprise everyone by being able to take care of his interests geoffrey southwood mused on his wifes words he had since meeting skye thoroughly investigated the reputation of khalid el bey it had not been easy for the distance between algiers and england was great but his curiosity had been piqued by this man of notorious repute who had taken in and then lost his heart to a nameless lost waif what he had learned had surprised geoffrey despite his rather unsavory business khalid el bey was considered a gentleman he was noted for his honesty his charitable nature and his charm it was this last that gave geoffrey southwood the most difficulty it had never mattered to him whether his woman of the moment had had other men but skye was differentand she was his wife was she already comparing her two husbands it fretted him and unwittingly he crushed her to him geoffrey his mouth savaged hers blazing a burning trail down her neck and across her breasts do you compare me to khalid el bey skye he asked fiercely she understood instantly he had never really been secure in a womans love her heart went out to him oh geoffrey she said softly wrapping her arms around him there is no comparison khalid was khalid and you are you i loved him for what he was as i love you for what you are she raised his head and kissed his mouth sweetly i love you my lord southwood but sometimes you play the fool and he did feel very foolish is this how you would spend our wedding night my lord she asked teasingly now that we have discussed my first husband shall we speak of the many ladies who have graced your bed sir madam he growled trying to gather the remaining shreds of his dignity and then he heard her muffled giggles oh witch he laughed would anyone believe such a conversation between two lovers who are newly married then he covered her face with kisses and she sighed happily which only made him laugh again i shall not be able to hide my condition much longer geoffrey she said thoughtfully and the queen has asked that i join her ladies when is the babe due my love in early autumn after the harvest do you feel all right he asked anxiously sometimes in the evenings i feel queasy she admitted its the smell of roasting meat that does it to me though tonight thank god i was not so distressed i want you in devon as soon as possible he said we will hide your condition a month and then you must go it would be better if i went in two or three she said to admit my pregnancy in less than two months time would be to bring the queens anger down upon us she is a very moral lady geoffrey besides it will be safer for me to travel later than now we can avoid following the court for a month or so for her majesty will not deny us a honeymoon then when we do return to the queens service i shall feign sickness everyone will be praising your virility long before we make our joyful announcement then if you wish to escort me to devon it will be permitted and we will offend no one i begin to see said the earl of lynmouth why khalid el bey trusted your judgment to find such a clever mind lodged in such a beautiful body is astounding i trust you mean to flatter me my lord she said drily yes witch i mean to flatter you and tumbling her back amid the plump feather pillows of their bed he kissed and tickled her until her happy laughter could be heard as far away as the ballroom chapter niall burke slouched deep in a large chair in the study of his london house staring out as the gray dawn rose over the dark and rainy river a fire crackled merrily in the large fireplace but the big irishman scowled blackly ignoring its warmth he clutched in his clenched fist a large goblet from which the odor of spiced red wine rose around the house the souwester that had dampened lord southwoods wedding was roaring itself out a blast rattled the windows and burke glowered again the wedding of mistress goya del fuentes and the earl of lynmouth had been hell for niall he and constanza stood with the rest of the court watching as the most beautiful bride hed ever seen was married to a very handsome groom it had been torture for in his mind he saw again the candlelit chapel of the omalley tower house and a holloweyed frightened young bride whose face was whiter than her gown he remembered how he had flung open the chapel doors only a moment too late how she had fainted upon seeing him how he had outrageously demanded the droit du seigneur most of all he remembered how sweetly she had yielded skye he whispered softly saying her name aloud for the first time in many months oh skye how i love you he was so painfully confused and the new countess of lynmouth was responsible she was his skyes identical twin he ached with longing for her yet he was ashamed upstairs slept his sweet and faithful young wife alone in their bed while he sulked downstairs lusting in his heart for another woman a dead woman and another mans wife damn the countess of lynmouth he thought bitterly reaching for the decanter what he should be thinking of was an heir not a dead woman he had been married to constanza for almost two years now and there had been no sign of a child had he not scattered his share of bastards about he might be worried about himself but obviously the fault lay with constanza he had wanted to return home to ireland with both a wife and a child the macwilliam was growing old and the reassurance of another heir would cheer the elderly man greatly they had lingered on mallorca for several months after their marriage then begun a leisurely wedding journey through mediterranean spain to provence in france and up to paris they had stayed the winter in parisa happy gay time in which he had fully initiated her into the sensual world of lovemaking and she had proved an eager pupil sometimes he wondered if perhaps she wasnt too eager had he not been certain of her virginity when they had first made love he would have had his doubts about constanzas character for her enthusiasm was he thought unseemly then he cursed himself for a fool how many men mounted cringing cold women who lay like stone beneath them doing their duty while they said the rosaries to themselves hating what was being done to them constanza enjoyed their lovemaking he ought to be glad he would go to her now he would slip into her bedchamber and she would be warm and fragrant with sleep he would kiss her awake then take her slowly savoring her passion she would whimper with pleasure and claw at his back he made to rise but a wave of dizziness overcame him and he fell back the room seemed overwarm he sipped again at his wine and suddenly he was so tired his eyes closed the heavy goblet fell from his grasp to the rug and a small snore issued from his open mouth niall burke slept a deep drunken sleep a few minutes later the library door opened softly and very slowly constanza burke and ana looked into the room a look of annoyance crossed young lady burkes face and her pansypurple eyes narrowed in anger he is drunk again she snapped he has been drinking all night in the name of all that is holy ana what manner of man is he he is unhappy nina perhaps it is the lack of child that makes him so can he sire one on me in this condition she snapped then her voice softened ana fetch my cloak nina no no not again ana i burn i must or i shall die i will soothe it nina it is not enough ana i must have a man i must if you wont fetch my cloak i shall go without it and my white nightgown will be a beacon to the entire household with a sob ana went for the dark enveloping cape constanza walked across the room and stood looking down at her husband why had he drunk himself into a stupor this had begun only recently when they first came to london all had been well but in the last few months he had changed quite suddenly and for no apparent reason now he often drank himself into a stupor perhaps if he hadnt changed she herself wouldnt have changed but constanza knew this wasnt so it had all begun so insidiously one night in an excess of passion he had taken her four times but when finally he lay contented and happy she lay awake and yearning it was not that he had not satisfied her he had each time had been better than the last but suddenly it was not enough and it never was enough anymore she had grown edgy with her constant longings then one day their head groom had been helping her to mount her mare and his hand slid up her leg farther than it should have she said nothing and the hand moved higher yet until it was stroking the soft wet place between her thighs bringing her to a swift delightful climax the hand was slowly withdrawn and without a word spoken between them constanza rode out from the stables with the head groom his face impassive riding at her side when they returned an hour later he lifted her down from her horse and carried her into the darkened stable loft constanza had been driven half mad by the friction of her saddle and the motion of her horse against her already inflamed body she offered no objections when the head groom pushed her skirts up to her waist he stared down at her for a moment so its true then he whispered wonderingly what ladies pluck their cunny hair he answered then he dropped on top of her what harry lacked in skill he made up for with vigor pumping against her until he had fulfilled her twice afterward she felt guilty and ashamed but as her needs far outweighed her guilt the interludes with harry became a regular part of her life at court she was ogled by several young bucks but instinct told her to be wary sometime later she had lost a little of that wariness and agreed to an assignation with lord basingstoke an older gentleman who seemed pleased to believe he had seduced a bride but even having two lovers was not enough for constanza any longer her lust was a sickness she could not rid herself of and soon she did not even wonder at herself anymore she was careful however that no one knew her terrible secret she was not a wicked woman and she loved her husband but she would not could not stop constanza did not hear ana return she looked up only when the heavy velvet cloak was dropped over her shoulders mlord asked ana leave him she answered quietly he is sleeping soundly and in any case i will not be long nina please i beg of you ana i cannot help myself and so saying constanza burke swept from the library and out of her house through a littleused side door in the halflight of the early morning she made her way to the stables and the room in the loft where harry slept with a proprietary air she opened the door and looking in saw a naked harry sleeping with an equally naked polly one of the kitchen maids for a few moments she watched them fascinated then polly opened her eyes and stared at her mistress horrified constanza smiled and put a warning finger to her lips shrugging off the cloak she stripped her white silk nightgown from her lush body and climbed into bed on the other side of harry polly lay stiff and frozen next to the groom suddenly her mistresss face was over hers looking down at the frightened girl suck him came the soft command together we can drive him mad what a bull hell be then polly scrambled to obey her mistress no longer afraid and while she eagerly did her part constanzas little tongue darted into and around harrys ear the sleeping man stirred polly worked feverishly while constanza blew softly into the grooms ear harry groaned as his loins were filled with a fierce burning and he opened his eyes amazed by the sight that greeted him his mighty shaft grew until polly could hold it no longer and fell back the groom was quickly atop her ramming fiercely constanza watched her slim fingers playing with herself until suddenly she felt harrys eyes upon her and looked up to meet his lascivious grin he had not spent himself yet though polly lay gasping her pleasure beneath him rolling off the girl he pulled constanza beneath him and teasingly moved himself against her engorged and throbbing sex constanza whimpered and strained her body upward but he denied her instead and with a refinement that shattered her he rubbed himself over her entire body until she was begging him to take her with a wink at polly harry jammed himself forcefully into constanza and moved swiftly back and forth until he finally wrung from her a series of cries afterward as the three of them lay side by side polly ventured shyly my friend claro would never believe thisand her a popular madam with her own place but if you wasnt the mistress id introduce you to claro she could sure use a girl like you harry laughed at the outrageous idea but later when she had returned to her own bed constanza thought the idea over perhaps it was the answer to her problem when the yearning overcame her she could sneak off to the whores house and indulge herself she would be masked but that would add a certain piquancy to her performance suddenly the horror of what she was thinking swept over her and she scrambled from her bed to kneel at her priedieu holy mother she fervently prayed let me not do this terrible thing wipe my mind clean of such thoughts i beg thee then her eyes strayed to the exquisite leatherbound book that lay on the table by her bed it had been a gift from her lover lord basingstoke and had been brought to england by a portuguese sea captain who had obtained it in india constanza rose from her knees and sitting back on the bed opened the book inside were pages and pages with beautiful and colorful illustrations of men women and animals performing a wide range of sexual acts from the most pristine to the most perverted mesmerized she slowly turned the pages her breathing had quickened and despite her recent activity she felt her need growing again ringing for her maid she ordered her bath and asked that her riding clothes be laid out by the time she approached the stables the fires of her desires were growing again she stood quietly while harry saw to the saddling of their mounts but the impatient tapping of her riding crop against her boot told him that her passions were riding high once more he sighed her fires seemed unquenchable though god knew he tried there had never been a woman he couldnt satisfy but by heaven the mistress was a rare one they rode sedately from the house along the river road to a secluded thicket where they tethered the horses he took her on the mossy ground his excitement heightened by the foul words she whispered breathily in his ear as always he was amazed by the capacity for pure lust in this madonnafaced woman later as they rode on she said in her soft slightly accented voice i want to meet pollys friend claro woman youre mad he exclaimed im amazed that your husband hasnt found out about you cuckolding him with me and lord basingstoke are you looking to get caught let me worry about niall i want to meet the whore if you wont arrange it with polly then i must do so if having a hundred cocks up your hot little cunt will help you connie then ill speak to poll tis a sickness with you i know that there was a girl in my village in hereford like you she just couldnt get enough what happened to her harry she died of the pox he answered matteroffactly what would you expect several days later with niall burke off hunting with friends for a week in hampshire constanza burke and harry rode into london she fully expected to be led into a dank slum so she was pleasantly surprised to find herself before a small wellkept house on the london bridge itself the house was whitewashed and halftimbered and each of the three stories extended out over the other making it look a bit like a cake one side of the house faced the streetthe bridge actually was a streetwhile another side looked down onto the river traffic this was a source of continuing delight to the bargemen who enjoyed ogling and joking with the scantily clad women who sat fanning themselves in their windows on hot summer afternoons ill wait for you harry said helping her dismount she drew her hood up and knocked at the door a little maidservant opened it almost immediately and constanza quickly entered and followed the girl down a short hallway to a pleasant sunny room with a bay window overlooking the river an attractive blonde with skyblue eyes awaited her and when the servant girl had left the woman spoke in a husky voice good afternoon my lady i am claro polly said you wished to see me now you do so how may i serve you constanza felt suddenly shy and turning away mumbled i have made a mistake in coming here claro laughed breathily no my dear poll has told me all about you you have an itch that needs constant scratching and you would join me on occasion please dont be embarrassed i should be delighted to have you with me youll stay masked whenever here and no one will ever know your real identity is it a bargain my dear you dont even know fully what i look like said constanza how can you be sure ill be a success my dear was the devastating reply as long as you will give the gentlemen a good jogging it matters not if youre as ugly as sin itself remember that no one will ever see your face ive half a dozen pretty lasses for those who like beauty with their play what about the money asked constanza well split your earnings fiftyfifty came the reply no i want none of it oh god why did i come here claro laughed then put a friendly arm about constanza dont be frightened lovey being a whore takes getting used to but youll do beautifully she sat constanza down gave her a small glass of a restorative cordial then sat opposite her dyou think i was born a lightskirt then my father was a nobleman with lands but i ran off with my cousin and when hed filled my belly he left me i couldnt go home what else could i do you had a baby constanzas purple eyes were wide with surprise no laughed claro i wasnt so innocent that i didnt know how to get rid of the brat constanza felt sick and swallowed hard oblivious claro continued your using a mask will certainly be enticing but i wish you also had a specialty that would set you apart a mask is not enough constanza stared at her hostess her fear suddenly gone claro was she realized with surprise simply a business woman the cordial was beginning to work and now constanza had a wicked idea i have a book she said a book a book from the east full of beautiful pictures of men and women and some with animals what if i offered each man who comes to me the opportunity to chose a page and duplicate that page claros babyblue eyes widened gods toenail youve a quick mind for this my dear its perfect now when will you come to us tonight answered constanza my lord is away for several days and the truth is that i bum do not bother returning home now my dear send your groom back for your book while you rest here purred claro she rang a small silver bell and said to the little servant girl take madam to the rose room wordlessly constanza followed the maid out the door as the door closed on the two claro spun about hugging herself with glee oh dom she said softly to the air above her oh my darling brother at last i have a means of vengeance on niall burke for you that milkfaced girl is his wife his wife and ill make the fine lord burkes wife the most infamous whore in london that added to the death of your late bitch wife skye should destroy him for good and claire oflaherty laughed wildly so it began soon gentlemen of the court were circulating stories of the book lady who occasionally entertained at the house of the nobilitys favorite whore claro the book lady performed the most unspeakable and delicious of perversions the book ladys lust was inexhaustible that she was a lady was evident but who she was was a favorite guessing game of the men who frequented claros house and elizabeth tudors court and constanza burke living her secret life had never been happier she had her husband and lord basingstoke and harry the groom and a host of noble lovers who would ever suspect that the innocentlooking lady burke of elizabeths court was the wicked book lady luck rode with her for niall burke was lost in his personal world of sad memories and was hardly aware of his wife any longer had the countess of lynmouth not looked so much like his skye he would have gone on with his life but now seeing her frequently his wounds bled again and again what a fine joke fate had played on him and he laughed bitterly and drank deeply of his wine one evening his wifes personal servant ana entered his library and curtseyed before him my lord i must speak with you ana was in a most difficult position she could not allow her beloved child to go on as she was yet to expose her sins to her husband would be worse ana believed that if she could force lord burke from his depression perhaps he would again become a loving husband constanza would then cease her wicked adventures before it was too late well ana what is it my lord my nina is not happy and it is because you are not happy his black look made her falter but summoning her courage she continued youve been neglecting constanza my lord and you know that i speak the truth why can it not be as it once was between you surely you dont love her any less he sighed the old woman was a busybody but she spoke honestly and he knew it we irish are subject to black moods ana and constanza must get used to that shes a good little lass why do you not go home to ireland my lord i will not return until i can return with my wife and my son there is little chance of that if you see my mistress so infrequently snapped ana tartly peace woman shouted niall burke for the moment the mood is upon me and i must bear it until it passes your mistress has had two years to produce an heir and ive seen no sign of a son or daughter she has not complained to me of neglect and seems well enough entertained these days christ shes in the house less than i am and dont you wonder where she goes niall burkes silver eyes narrowed what are you saying woman he asked ominously a wave of fear rushed on ana almost suffocating her nothing my lord nothing she gasped and quickly backed out of the room oh god she had almost given it away leaning against the wall she wept silently the hot salty tears stinging her eyes and swelling them ana was not young anymore going through this awful fear again was surely a curse she remembered back eighteen years ago to when she and constanzas beautiful mother had been carried off by moorish pirates when they had finally been returned she had sworn an oath that her mistresss virtue was untouched under the circumstances she hoped god would forgive her the lie the lady maria had already been pregnant with her husbands child when they were abducted and to have told the truth would have left open to question the validity of the childs heritage in the end the conde questioned it anyway still to protect the girl she had raised ana had lied since all the others who had been caught in the raid had disappeared into the slave markets of the east no one questioned her story but ana would always remember it vividly the pirates had struck after sunset using the darkness to creep up upon the condes summer villa located in a remote part of the island the entire village had been lined up for inspection the children the young girls the youths women of childbearing age and healthy stronglooking men were herded onto the pirate vessel the remaining unfortunates were quickly slaughtered at the villa the procedure was similar but the young condesa and her duenna were treated gently and locked aboard the ship in a small cabin furnished with only a turkish couch a low table and some floor pillows the ship had been underway for several hours before anyone bothered with them then the door burst open and the ships captain swaggered in the three men at his back leaped forward and tore the clothes off the shrieking young condesa ana attempted to shield her mistress from the lustful stares of the four men but the captain dealt her a fierce blow that sent her reeling to the floor stunned she could only watch in horror as the handsome moor scrutinized her naked mistress he walked about her slowly squeezed a buttock hefted a pearshaped breast as if testing its weight felt the soft texture of the silvery blond hair he made a comment to his three companions in their guttural language and they laughed the moorish captain bent and dragged ana up by her hair is your mistress a virgin he asked her in flawless spanish no gasped ana she is the wife of a wealthy and powerful lord the royal governor of these islands he will pay a fortune for her safe return the men laughed uproariously the moorish captain said some fat pasha will pay a hell of a lot more to have your mistress in his harem than her stiffnecked husband will pay for her return and since shes no virgin we may enjoy her first the two womens eyes widened and ana screamed no i beg of you captain take mebut leave my mistress untouched why wench laughed the moor did you think we wouldnt have you too hey ali this ones eager for a little loving do your duty well by her what had followed was a nightmare ana could never quite forget that she was raped several times was of no importance to anas mind for she was a peasant and such things though distasteful happened to peasants with great regularity her position on the floor however gave her a clear view of the lady maria who had been thrown on the couch above at first the condesa had struggled and screamed as the handsome moorish captain rammed himself in and out of her but her cries soon became cries of passion rather than shame as the captain inflamed by her blond beauty prolonged his performance at last he could no longer contain himself and poured himself into her his place was quickly taken by one of his men and then another and finally the last ana listened with horror as maria exhorted each man to greater efforts begging for more when one was spent and another took his place the captain and his three officers quickly left ana in peace so that they might spend the night in a long debauch with the young condesa ana could not believe either her eyes or her ears what had happened to her child to turn her from a sweet girl to this this terrible woman when at last the four men stumbled wearily from the little cabin ana crept over to where maria lay the condesas body was wet with sweat and semen the hollows beneath her purple eyes dark with exhaustion she beamed her sweet smile at ana ah sweet body of christ my dear ana i have not been so well fucked since we left castile nina you are mad you were a virgin on your wedding night i myself saw the blood on your sheets maria laughed her tinkling laughter chickens blood she said the conde would not have known a virgin if hed had one on our wedding night he was hot to possess me and i pretended to be shyly reluctant it took him two hours to get my nightgown off she laughed again and when i finally let him take me i shrieked and struggled when i pretended to shove him away i broke the small bladder of chickens blood i had secreted for the occasion then i pretended to faint there however i overdid it the conde alas is not a particularly vigorous lover and since our wedding night he handles me with such delicacy that it is like being fucked with a feather i have been wild with desire for months now but i dare not take a lover there are no secrets on mallorca my dearest begged ana what is it you tell me that you were not pure when you married the conde it is not so i myself watched over you when could you have had time to deceive me when you studied made your devotion regularly gardened and rode all decent pursuits ana ana what an innocent you are said maria my guardians left us alone in that jewel of a house though our bills were paid they never appeared from one year to the next i was easy prey for those who liked to deflower innocents who nina who our good priest for one my ana i was six when he first took me on his lap and slipped his hand up my gown to touch my sex i was eleven when he finally took my virginity in the confessional you sleep soundly my old duenna after that i chose my own lovers from among the gardeners the grooms my tutor and the gypsies who camped on our lands several times every year it was their old queen who gave me the chickens blood in the bladder i need loving ana i must have it i almost lost my mind these past months but god what lovers the moors are poor ana was overcome she had raised this girl from birth and believed she knew her well how could something so pure and freshlooking be so filled with evil dear holy mother how could she not have seen it then her great love for marie overcame her abhorrence nina she said quietly we are in grave danger these moors mean to sell you into a harem you would not like being confined or sharing one man with a hundred other women if you tried to deceive your master you would first be terribly tortured and then killed do not fear ana came the confident reply the moors will not sell me they will ransom us back to my lord husband nina how can you be sure i am with child ana i will bear the conde a child next year they cannot sell a pregnant woman i should make some lovely houri with a big belly i have told captain hamid this and have agreed to service him and his crew for the term of our stay with him maria the young condesa laughed do not scold me dear duenna ill wear them out before they wear me out besides soon i shall be too fat with my baby and once the child is born all i will have again will be my husband she sighed bleakly the beautiful condesa calmly accepted the role of ships whore and was available at any hour of the day or night ana could only watch helplessly and pray that their ransom would be paid quickly when it was and they were returned to palma ana watched with amazement as her mistress how pale and demure as befitted a young spanish matron of noble blood fell fainting into her anxious husbands arms soon under the stern eyes of the archbishop of mallorca and the conde ana swore on the holy relics kept in the palma cathedral that her mistress had remained untouched by the moors during the period of her captivity this extraordinary restraint was due to their respect for her impending motherhood but the conde was suspicious even when constanza was born six months later a fat fullterm baby he still doubted ana never knew why for maria had never given the conde any reason to doubt her ana liked to believe that maria had died of a broken heart brought on by the condes distrust in reality she died of the complications of childbirth the greatest of these complications was a massive dose of venereal disease the doctor used to his fine and elegant lady patients never even identified the pox as the true cause of marias death and the conde believed she had died of shame at having been held captive by infidels it came to ana now that her maria had been an evil creature who had passed on her devils seed to the innocent constanza now constanza was tainted too and there was nothing ana could do about it sooner or later lord burke would find out the double life his wife was leading and when that happened ana shuddered and an icy sense of disaster surrounded her anas complaints had roused niall from his black mood he saw mat he could not rest until he knew the truth about the new countess of lynmouth there was only one man who could tell him the fierce storm that had torn through england had delayed the sailing of robert smalls fleet despite careful precautions several ships had been damaged and it would take some weeks to repair them the devon captain was therefore still in london and lord burke sought him out finding him at the kings head inn the two men exchanged pleasantries and then niall seated himself opposite the captain and said straightforwardly i need your help in unraveling a mystery sir robert small sipped his ale and regarded the irishman quietly he replied if its in my power mlord several years ago began niall i fell in love with a young girl she was already betrothed and my father did not think her highborn enough for me she was wed to another man and bore her husband two sons before being widowed my own marriage had been a farce and was annulled by the church my father then agreed to a marriage between the lady and myself not only had she proven herself a good breeder but she was wealthy by then we were formally betrothed but before we could wed it was important to my ladys family interests that she make a sea voyage i joined her on that voyage robert small felt an eerie sense of premonition creep over him we had almost reached our destination when we were attacked by pirates in the last moments of the battle one of those devils kidnaped my lady robert small felt a trickle of nervous sweat roll down his back his stomach full with a rich dinner and stout english ale began to roll dear christ what was lord burke after what is it you want of me my lord he asked abruptly the truth captain you brought to england a woman known as senora goya del fuentes the widow of your dead partner allegedly raised in a convent in algiers i might have accepted that story except that the lady is the identical twin of my lost betrothed identical yet when i questioned her she seemed honestly to have no knowledge of ireland or the omalley family he paused at the bedding of the earl and countess of lynmouth lady southwoods gown slipped and i saw a tiny mole at the crest of her right breast the possibility of two women who look so alike and bear the same name i must reluctantly accept but that two unrelated coincidentally identical women should have the same mole i do not think possible i believe the countess of lynmouth is the lost skye omalley and i think you know the truth of this matter why will she not acknowledge me or her past because my lord she has no memory of anything prior to algiers said robert small calmly the only thing she was ever able to tell us was her name later on she realized she was able to speak read and write in several languages she had a strong sense of values acquired somehow but who she was and where she came from is all unknown though i of course recognized her accent as irish the doctors explained that she suffered a shock something so painful that her mind chose to blot everything out rather than face the terrible eventwhatever that was my god niall burke was whitefaced tell me captain was she truly married to a spanish merchant or is her child the result of rape robert small hid a smile north africa was hardly a safe world especially for women but it wasnt much different here why did all christian europeans think of moslems as sexcrazed fiends willow is the result of a great love he said skye was indeed wed to my algerian business partner his name was khalid el bey and it was he who rescued skye he adored her and she him when he was murdered it almost destroyed her and i brought her to england to escape the advances of the turkish governor who was behind khalids death she met lord southwood and they fell in love now my lord burke i have told you all i know and i would appreciate it if you would return the favor who is she where is her home you say she bore her first husband children are they living her name is skye omalley her first husband may his soul burn for all eternity was dom oflaherty he gave her two sons both living her father was dubhdara omalley here robert small whistled softly through his teem for what seaman had not heard of the great irish piratemerchant dubhdara omalley on his death finished niall she was made the omalley of innisfana pending the majority and aptitude of one of her halfbrothers how have they fared without her asked robert small her uncle the bishop of connaught has taken chargemuch to my fathers annoyance smiled niall when skye disappeared the macwilliam my father thought to avail himself of the omalley interests but the omalleys have always been independent for all they do owe us fealty the two men sat in companionable silence for a few moments men robert small sighed weil my lord burke what do you intend to do with this knowledge i must warn you that skye should have no shocks now she is with child but shes just w e d then niall burke flushed and finished weakly oh robbie chuckled softly shes a beautiful woman what am i to do now sir i can hardly tell the countess mat she is my lost betrothed wife why not tell southwood about her background my lord leaving out of course your personal involvement witb her suggested robert small geoffrey should know then write to the countesss uncle and explain the situation it is only decent that her family know she is alive geoffrey southwood loves skye dearly and after their child is born i am sure hell want her to know of her past perhaps knowledge of it will bring her memory back niall burke was thoughtful then said be there robert help me tell him im in a difficult position i understand robert small debated with himself for a moment men asked tell me my lord burke do you love her still yes said niall burke without hesitation i still love her i have never stopped loving her though god knows i have tried the memory of her has haunted my every hour waking and sleeping and your wife constanza is my wife robert i may have done her a great disservice by marrying her but until death parts us she is my wife as skye is lord southwoods i am relieved to know that you are a sensible man my lord you see skye is the child that neither my sister nor i ever had we love her dearly and would not see her hurt she remembers nothing before she awoke in khalids house and she obviously does not remember you i will arrange for us to see the earl immediately for the repairs to my fleet will be completed soon and i must sail when they are this storm has delayed me long enough robert small was as good as his word within the hour he sent a note to the earl of lynmouth that read imperative i see you alone without skyes knowledge immediately meet me aboard my ship tonight at ten geoffrey southwood raising an elegant blond eyebrow at the cryptic message made an excuse to his bride and rode off promising a swift return arriving at the docks he was escorted aboard the mermaid to the captains cabin where he was surprised to find the irishman burke waiting with robert small geoffrey flung his cloak to the little cabin boy and nodding to both men sprawled his long frame into a chair well robbie whats so important that you would take me from my bride on my honeymoon have some wine my lord said robbie you know lord burke weve met the burgundy robbie robert small poured wine for himself and his guests and when the cabin boy had served the goblets robbie instructed him stand watch outside my lad were not to be disturbed unless the ship is sinking do you ken the boy grinned aye sir he said and closed the door behind him robert small sat back and drew a long deep breath geoffrey ive news that should make you happy but it is of a very delicate nature for several months lord burke has been quite confused by skyes name and appearance when you were bedded at greenwich several nights ago he saw a mole on skyes um skyes skyes person he gasped as southwoods green eyes darkened the tiny star geoffrey asked softly the very same answered niall youve big eyes irishman said the earl his voice soft with warning niall bit back a hottempered reply damn the arrogant possessive english bastard robert quickly resumed when lord burke saw the mark on skye he was able to make a positive identification although he was still quite confused as to why skye did not acknowledge knowing him he has mentioned names and places to her and is convinced that she has no knowledge of them so he came to me this afternoon and geoffrey southwoods voice was icy she is skye omalley said niall burke the omalley of innisfana herself and vassal to my father who is the macwilliam skye omalley disappeared several years ago off the north african coast and was presumed dead robert small has explained her loss of memory to me i felt my lord that you should know her true identity but the captain and i were fearful of disclosing these facts to skye herself geoffrey southwoods eyes narrowed just slightly at niall burkes familiar use of his wifes name tell me of my wifes family he said pointedly both her parents are dead her father just a year before she was lost she had a stepmother and uncle of whom she is quite fond five older sisters a younger brother four younger halfbrothers and two sons by her first marriage hes dead my lord niall finished quickly seeing the earl go white about the lips did she love him certainly not he was a bastard who delighted in mistreating her he was dead before she left ireland proving that there is a god in heaven geoffrey southwoods eyes narrowed further and glittered dangerously at the impassioned tone in lord burkes voice and what my lord was your connection with my wife we grew up together said niall the lie slipped coolly off his tongue her father was the omalley of innisfana her mother margaret mcleod of the isle of skye when dubhdara omalley died he made skye his heiress until one of her brothers was old enough and showed an aptitude for the family seafaring business skye had always been her fathers favorite and had her father not finally sired some sons it probably would all have gone to her anyway after the omalley died she swore her fealty to my father as had all the omalley chiefs before her and what was she doing on a ship off the north african coast demanded the earl the omalleys have been great sea rovers for centuries her trading fleet had made inquiries of the algerian government with regard to beginning trade when the dey of algiers learned that the omalley chief was a woman he insisted on meeting her before he would continue their negotiations representing my father i accompanied her on that voyage a severe storm tore the deys protective pendant from our mast and when the storm ended we fought a sea battle with barbary pirates they didnt know mat we were under the deys protection we had almost succeeded in driving them off when one pirate swung across the gap between the ships and carried off the omalley before we could retrieve her a fog bank separated the ships i had been severely injured and was taken to the island of mallorca the rest of the omalley fleet sought for skye with the deys aid but no trace of her was found and that explained robert small was because she wasnt channeled through a regular slave market but disposed of in a private sale her family should be notified southwood with your permission i should like to write to her uncle who is the bishop of connaught captain small and i thought that perhaps after your child is born you would tell her lord burke is a gentleman geoffrey said robbie apologetically but since he was all for rushing to your house and telling skye of her past i found it necessary to explain her delicate condition to him i congratulate you on your good fortune said niall feelingly i understand you lost your only son recently thank you said geoffrey softening a little robert small heaved a sigh of relief they werent going to kill each other well gentlemen we all have skyes interests at heart he said weve agreed then that lord burke will inform the omalleys of this happy turn of events but that skye will not be told until after the birth of her child the two young men nodded their assent and robbie raised his goblet to skye and her happiness he declared geoffrey southwood smiled for the first time since entering the cabin his green eyes meeting nialls silver ones thats an easy toast he said and niall burke smiled back raising his own goblet suddenly from outside the cabin there arose a small uproar the piping voice of the little cabin boy was heard protesting in concert with a deep masculine voice southwood cocked his head sounds like de grenville he said the words had hardly left his mouth when the door burst open to admit that gentleman the little cabin boy was close to tears and clung valiantly to the noblemans doublet i told him he couldnt come in captain i told him thats all right lad said robert small in a kindly tone i can see youve done your best but in this instance youve been outgunned go back and guard my door again you did well the boy wiped tears away with his sleeve saying aye ssir he took up his post again robert small turned coolly to de grenville well dickon what is so important that you forced your way in here de grenville shook his flowing lace cuffs free of imaginary wrinkles a onceinalifetime opportunity for you robbie hello southwood burke mayhap you gentlemen will join us he turned again to the captain robbie fate smiled on you when it delayed your sailing ive been sent word that the book lady is to perform at claros tonight and ive obtained time in her bed for both of us the book lady the earl interrupted ah geoff youve been so busy in the wooing of your new wife that youve missed this delicious phenomenon shes just appeared at claros in the last few months they say shes a bored noblewoman but shes always masked so whos to know for certain her manners are flawless and she speaks like a noblewoman so the gossip may be right perhaps shes just a good actress suggested the earl i think shes well bred her bone structure and skin texture are fine replied de grenville why do they call her the book lady asked niall burke ahhh breathed de grenville again theres the fascinating part lets face it gentlemen a whores a whore but the book lady is an artist shes got a naughty book from the far east filled with the most gorgeous illustrations of people fucking if you desire you pick a page and shell duplicate it with you they say shes expert in all she does and she certainly loves her work theres been talk of her and claro having a contest to see who can fuck the most men in a twentyfourhour period by god robbie weve a good time ahead of us tonight southwood burke will you join us no dickon not i what man married to my skye would seek other entertainment a hot pain pierced niall what excuse did you use to skye when you came here asked robert small that id a surprise for her answered the earl and i do he drew forth from his doublet a large sapphire teardrop on a delicate gold chain dyou think shell like it a ceylon blue god what a beauty ejaculated de grenville aye skye will like it said robert small it matches her eyes thats just what i thought remarked the earl grinning and again niall winced geoffrey southwood stood and picked up his cloak thank you robbie and you too my lord burke robbie be sure you come to say goodbye to skye before you sail i will promised the captain then he and the other two walked to the gangplank with the earl at its foot waited a sailor holding southwoods chestnut stallion after mounting southwood waved to robert and rode off in the direction of the strand lord de grenville turned to his two companions well gentlemen are you for claros with me robert small nodded i could use an entertaining memory to warm me on the long and lonely nights of this voyage aye dickon im with you and you lord burke claro has some of the loveliest poxfree girls in london niall considered a moment aye ill join you i dont think however that im up to your book lady ill happily settle for a pretty lass who fucks well de grenville signaled his coach and the three men climbed in and were off claro will fix you up right enough prophesied de grenville and claire oflaherty seeing the three men coming through her front door panicked until she realized that although shed been a guest in the macwilliams castle shed never met niall burke as the daughter of a minor and impoverished vassal claire had not been considered important enough to merit the heirs attention so he would not know her but constanza must be warned claire ran lightly up the stairs to the beautiful room that showcased her star attraction constanza having just arrived was alone she was rouging her nipples when claire burst in your husbands here announced claire but i dont believe hes come for you hes not angry or upset at all hes with friends who lord de grenville and sir robert small constanza checked a small book open on her bedside table de grenville and one guest are scheduled with me for the entire night she said rose took the appointment de grenville said something to rose about his friend going off on a long sea voyage then it must be sir robert said claire giddy with relief but if rose got it wrong then ill send her up here and you get out fast ill make your excuses unless of course youd like your husband to know she glanced slyly at constanza and spoil my fun laughed constanza nervously never claire slipped from the room and with much show descended the staircase her blond hair was piled high her skyblue eyes sparkled with malice her skin was very white except for the cheeks which had been reddened with pomade her nipples were rouged she wore a deepblue gown so entirely transparent that her body was plainly visible she was adorned with ropes of pearls lord de grenville her feline husky voice purred welcome welcome to you and your guests i recognize you sir robert but the other gentleman is a stranger niall lord burke claro hes looking for a bouncing lass and some good bedsport i shall see to him myself smiled claro broadly the thought of bedding the man who had loved skye omalley was simply too tempting by god muttered de grenville enviously ive been trying for months to pry those plump white thighs apart and shed have none of me you merely walk through the door and shes at your feet niall eyed claro dispassionately yes she would do quite nicely in his depression over skye he had been disinclined to seek his wifes bed for several weeks and yet he needed a woman to vent his frustration upon this one would do quite nicely with her big pillowy white breasts and avid wet red mouth she was totally unlike his dainty gentle little constanza he smiled boldly at her a smile that did not reach his cold silvery eyes claire noticed she could feel the suppressed violence in niall as he slipped a hard arm about her and she shivered with delight maybe this time for the first time since that last wonderful time with dom she would feel something she smiled coyly up at him come on lovey she said in that husky voice taking him by the hand she led him up the stairs to her room the door had barely closed behind them when he was pulling her into his arms and kissing her with a brutality that left her breathless she heard the sheer gown rip and felt the cool anon her skin he picked her up tossed her on the bed pulled his own clothes off and flung himself on her he plunged into her without ceremony and she gasped with the pain he was inflicting on her in his desperate rutting he was even bigger than dom had been thrusting her hips to meet him she felt her climax building yes it was the first time since dom that she had felt any satisfaction from a coupling and to her great surprise he delayed his own pleasure until she had had hers no man had ever done that for claire the release was a purely physical one for niall the woman beneath him was a coarse creature but she served her purpose and he had to admit she moved well he had thought to take her once and leave but now he decided to spend the night as she apparently expected him to do why not youre a good tumble he grinned and laughed when she shot back so are you niall burke he hoped de grenville and robert small were having as good a time as he was they were the room in which claro showcased her most famous whore was not used by anyone else it had been decorated at great expense in an age when glass was a rare and almost prohibitively expensive thing the book ladys room had a great mirror built into its ceiling and two large standing mirrors in gilt frames on either side of the bed the bed was enormous with ruby velvet hangings large fat pillows and a red fox coverlet before the great fireplace was an oriental type of couch set low to the ground and covered with pillows next to the bed was a walnut bookstand upon which rested the famous book over the fireplace were hung dainty silver chains with gold wristlets and next to the fireplace stood a tall white vase with a supply of hazel switches heavy red velvet brocade drapes shielded the windows the floor was covered by a thick blue and red carpet from turkey the three occupants of the room were all naked poring over the book of love the woman sat between them on the large bed each man absently fondling a firm golden breast impossible muttered robert small studying the picture not at all captain came back the breathy answer it simply takes a bit of time and some patience would you like to try it robert small looked at the petite goldenskinned creature and was rather shocked by what he saw the woman was lust incarnate constanza pressed herself against him and reaching down fondled his sex such a great weapon for such a little man she murmured can you wield your sword well captain aye he growled as he kissed her open mouth come on de grenville lets teach this hot little minx a good lesson de grenvilles eyes glittered as he pressed against constanza from behind damme robbie its going to be a good evening geoff will be sorry he didnt join us at that moment the earl of lynmouth having reached his home entered his bedchamber and found his wife lying on the bed asleep his valet entered silently behind him and closed the door geoffrey southwood looked tenderly at the picture she made she was wearing a demure white silk nightgown the deeply scooped neckline offered him a generous view of her pretty breasts smiling he drew off his clothes geoffrey bathed in the warm water set out by his valet then waved away the white silk nightshirt offered him placing the sapphire on the bedside table he said pointedly good night will the valet chuckled as he left the room marriage had not paled lord southwoods appetite for a few moments geoffrey watched skye in sleep she was so outrageously lovely that his breath caught in his throat what he had learned tonight was astounding in one sense yet not truly surprising it had always been obvious that skye was a lady as well as an educated woman now that he knew her to be the mother of two sons as well as the adorable willow geoffrey was greatly encouraged surely the child she now carried beneath her heart was his son and heir and not another daughter suddenly he became aware of his great need for her and gently rolling her over on her back he kissed her mouth she murmured and stretched pulling her gown down over her shoulders he bared her to the waist then with a shrug he pulled the gown off entirely the sight of her slim body the belly just beginning to round roused him painfully the desire slamming into him sharply he buried his face in the valley between her breasts and murmured her name her arms were quickly about him geoffrey my love i fell asleep waiting for you ive been watching you sleep and god help me even in sleep you rouse me my love his mouth was closing over hers his tongue exploring the roof of her mouth then flicking downward to tease at her sensitive breasts she caught at one of his hands and pulled it downward to the sweet core of her she rubbed against him and he felt the wetness of her you see my darling what a shameless creature i am i desire you too then catching his tumescence in her hand she guided him to her and sighed with pleasure when he thrust deep witch he muttered wives are not supposed to enjoy their husbands attentions so much i shall say my prayers then she teased wriggling provocatively beneath him you must say them to venus the goddess of love he growled he redoubled his efforts and soon she was crying out satisfied that he had mastered her he took his own release niall burke might play the old family friend all he wished but geoffrey southwood knew a man in love when he saw one skye however was his alone and he would never let her go recovered she leaned over him and demanded where is my surprise muttering about greedy women he reached over to the bedside table and dangled the gift before her skye gasped oh geoffrey its magnificent she sat cross legged before him and slipped it over her neck it dangled provocatively between her small impudent breasts as he had known it would and you went out especially tonight to get it for me thank you my darling and looking at her sitting there the delight of a child on her face he vowed again that no one would ever take her from him she might be the head of a large irish family but they had managed these last few years and theyd have to continue to manage without her she was his wife his geoffrey you look so fierce have i displeased you somehow nay sweet he reassured her smilingly i was just thinking how very much i love you she crept into his arms and put her dark head against his shoulder and i love you my darling oh geoffrey i am such a terrible woman i cannot help but think how lucky we are mat mary died dyou think i would have let you go never from the moment i first saw you in dartmoor i meant you to be mine i will never let you go skye you belong to me and men his mourn was taking fierce harsh possession of hers and she was meeting his passion with her own matching him kiss for kiss caress for caress until they were again joined in the blazing union so familiar by now yet never the same it left them both weak and breathing hard afterward he gently scolded her we cannot go on like this my angel we must be careful of the baby i know she answered softly but heaven help me geoffrey i love you so and i love it when you make love to me he smiled in the dimness of the room and pulling her close sighed go to sleep my naughty little wife too soon we must return to court to serve the queen then youll have to curb your appetite for the queen allows her servants very little time to themselves she nestled next to him ill find time southwood never fear chapter hurry milady scolded daisy you know how the queen i dislikes it when her ladies are late to vespers none of the queens other ladies are about to give birth grumbled skye let any of the others become pregnant and theyre sent home to the country immediately but not i oh no the queen must have her dearest skye near her i wonder if she will allow me the time to birth my son remember milady cautioned daisy that youre not supposed to give birth for another two months keep it in your mind maam skye laughed ruefully thank god its not really that long if i dont have this child soon i think i shall burst she smoothed her gown over her protruding belly there i am finally presentable give me my pomander girl catching it up skye hurried from her apartment and through the maze of palace corridors to the chapel she could hear the sweet fluting voices of the choirboys singing therefore we before him bending this great sacrament revere avoiding geoffreys little frown she slipped into the pew beside him i couldnt wake up she whispered he took her hand and squeezed it you should be down in devon he whispered back and she nodded the service was brief the court then trooped gaily off to the dancing which would be followed by supper elizabeths sharp dark eyes scrutinized her favorite lady as they all moved through the halls and she thought so southwood tasted of forbidden fruit before his last wife died i wonder what they would have done if she hadnt died then the memory of robert dudleys dead wife amy assailed her elizabeth tried to push it away but this time as had happened before she could not banish the thoughts amy dudley haunted elizabeth tudor the queen was a person of strong and certain morals and she knew that she had coveted another womans husband now that other woman was dead dead under distinctly mysterious circumstances and the queen wondered what the truth of the matter really was it was not the first time she had wondered she did not believe as many others did that robert dudley had had his wife murdered by a hired killer elizabeth knew dudley too well his lust to be king of england was great and consuming all he had had to do was wait just a little time until amy died a natural death she had been mortally ill no purpose would have been served by killing her and thus casting suspicion upon himself no robert had not ordered amys death but there were two other possibilities one was that her dear cecil or someone else who did not want to see dudley become her husband and their king had arranged amys death well aware of the furor a suspicious death would cause the other possibility was that poor little amy in revenge against elizabeth for stealing her husbands love or else in despair over her doctors grim verdict had thrown herself down the staircase knowing that this unhallowed death would destroy robert and elizabeths chances of marriage could someone love a man as deeply as amy dudley had loved robert and one day come to hate him with equal passion elizabeth wondered whether this could be oh if only amy had died a natural death sometimes elizabeth felt actually responsible it wasnt fair angrily she managed to put the subject from her mind and looked again at the countess of lynmouth i really should let skye go home to devon she mused but there are so few women who amuse me perhaps in a week or so she considered the queen also noted how radiant the countess of lynmouth was her gown was of mulberrycolored silk cut low to reveal her very full breasts there was an attempt at modesty in the soft creamy lace tucked into the bodice the same lace overflowed the sleeves skyes dark hair was styled severely drawn into a chignon at the nape of her slender neck and tucked into a net of very thin gold wires the long double rope of pearls she wore about her throat were a source of envy to every woman in the room including elizabeth skye did not join in the dancing remaining instead on her footstool by the queens chair she watched the others dance and was content the queen loved dancing and scarcely sat at all during the entire evening when he was not partnering her majesty lord dudley stood by her throne at one point his hand dropped to skyes bare shoulder she froze dudley laughed softly ive heard southwood brag of the fineness of your skin his long elegant fingers moved slowly downward to the swell of her breasts he stroked her lightly casually he does not lie drawled dudley insolently slowly he drew his hand away you play a dangerous game my lord said skye in a low furious voice skye studied the queens favorite without bothering to conceal her scorn he was a handsome enough man if one were drawn to his type she considered he was tall and elegantly slender and always dressed himself with foppish care his long aristocratic face and slender hands enhanced h i s well elegance she had to admit it he was not an easy man to overlook even among the welldressed courtiers but dudley did have one flaw as though nature having designed him so well could not bear to endow a mere mortal with everything his dark red hair his mustache and his very short carefully clipped beard were all very sparse his dark eyes were slightly hooded and he never managed to look one directly in the eye by contrast however his words were brutally straightforward i enjoy the game i play my dear and i shall win it he said sharply his eyes now held a mocking expression youd like to slap my face wouldnt you lady southwood but you can hardly slap your king can you youre not the king yet lord dudley skye was shocked by the mans boldness but i will be my dear never fear bess must wed and produce heirs for england the council would far prefer a good solid englishman to some mincing foreigner would you like to be the kings mistress mdear youre insufferable skye raged struggling to her feet and my lord you are insulting finally standing and balancing herself she walked slowly away with as much dignity as she could muster finding an empty chair in the card room she sat down and joined the game she was very angry and played with a fierce concentration she had never liked robert dudley finding him overly ambitious and arrogant to boot given free access to the queens apartments he came and went at will particularly when the women were likely to be in states of undress his eye was bold and when the young lovebesotted queen was not looking his hands were even bolder skye was shocked that he would so lewdly approach a woman in her condition she prayed that elizabeth would not choose him for a husband she smiled the young queen was sharper and a great deal wiser than those around her gave her credit for if only love would not cloud her judgment the pile of gold coins before her grew higher and then de grenville was leaning over her asking may i escort you in to supper skye her anger cooled skye gave him a bright smile and stuffed her winnings into the little silk pouch that hung from her waist she excused herself from the card table to the relief of the other players aye dickon i am famished she said where is southwood with the queen ive news of robbie oh dickon tell me is he all right a small merchant fleet thats just put into london hailed him on the indian ocean side of cape horn his entire fleet was intactand so was robbie ive letters for you which ill bring around tomorrow they had reached the dining room courtiers in full colorful finery were milling about chatting and helping themselves from the vast buffet i shall eat nothing but colchester oysters announced skye piling her plate high the outrageous vagaries of breeding women teased de grenville i dont know how on earth you would know about that dickon skye teased in return the moment your wife shows sign of being with child you banish the poor woman to devon for her own good skye and of course the childs health as well he responded piously nonsense its so you can wench in the best brothels in london without suffering a guilty conscience skye laughed speared an oyster and swallowed it whole de grenville reddened youre too forward for a woman he muttered and far too beautiful for a lady about to give birth and if i werent pregnant would you be trying to make love to me dickon tor gods sake skye protested de grenville just asking dickon you see i love geoffrey i would like to have you for a friend as would my husband it would distress me to have to be constantly fending you off beauty does not necessarily mean a loose moral character did you know that any man attempting to toy with geoffrey southwoods wife would be suicidal muttered de grenville for my healths sake skye i think of you as i do my own dear sisters skye patted his arm in a kindly fashion i am very relieved to hear that dickon she twinkled up at him whore the outraged shout accompanied by a sharp crack brought instant silence to the room skye and de grenville turned startled in the direction of the uproar everyone was staring toward a corner of the room where lionel lord basingstoke stood towering over a beautiful goldenhaired woman who cowered on her knees clutching her bruised cheek the nobleman was in a high rage his face as red as his velvet doublet the veins on his neck bulged and his pale eyes glittered with fury raising his hand he struck the woman again and repeated whore several gentlemen dashed forward and restrained the apoplectic man my god someone hissed thats lady burke the irishmans wife the woman was weeping softly lord thought skye shes absolutely beautiful then almost before she realized what she was doing skye pushed through the crowd to the sobbing woman leaning down skye put a tender arm about her and helped her up there my dear by tomorrow there will be something else to gossip about and this will be entirely forgotten skye said gently constanza threw her a grateful look christs blood lady southwood cried lord basingstoke dont touch her she is foulness beyond measure no decent woman should even speak her name fie my lord skyes voice rang out you abuse a lady and you dare do it in the queens presence that she dares to show herself to the queen is an outrage in itself shouted basingstoke the most evil of whores in the presence of the most innocent and virtuous of women you make a great deal of noise my lord said skye wearily ive yet to hear what causes your outrage and i should be interested too sir niall burke pushed his way forward pulling one of his gloves from his doublet he struck lord basingstoke across the cheek you are challenged my lord where and when no irishman shes not worm it ill not have your death on my conscience nor will i be killed for such as she god almighty man can you really be so blind constanza has been my mistress for months yes shes been cuckolding you but far worse shes been cuckolding me also and not with just one man but with any man who had the gold to buy her basingstoke wrenched constanza from skyes protective grasp holding her hand high he declared in his booming voice gentlemen i give you the book lady madame claros most famous attraction the busiest cunt in londontown a collective gasp rose from the assembled court the women shocked yet titillated the gentlemen pressing forward for a closer view constanzas violet eyes widened in horror at the knowing leering looks trembling uncontrollably she fainted my lord basingstoke a path opened instantly through the jostling crowd and the queen moved regally forward my lord basingstoke she repeated these are appalling charges where is your proof i have proof maam but i should not like to present it publicly sir you saw fit to begin this affair publicly so that is how we will air it speak or else tender your apologies to lord burke without delay madam as you will basingstoke sighed and then began several months ago i made lady burke my mistress after a time i gave her as a token of my affection and admiration a rare book of of pictures pictures of a h lovemaking a snicker ran through the crowd but was silenced by the queens quick frown basingstoke continued i soon began to hear stories of a new attraction at madame claros a woman they called the book lady and several weeks ago i heard of a contest to be held at claros it was to be a battle between claro herself and the book lady a contest forgive me majesty for my bluntness over who could fuck the most men within a dayandnight period the wagering was great and as there was to be no charge for entry to claros that day i went with friends to observe the fun my god maam the men were coming and going out of the womens rooms so quickly it would make your head spin a tally was called as each man left observers were permitted for a gold piece to stand at the doors of each bedchamber i decided to watch imagine my shock in discovering that the infamous book lady was my own mistress and just how did you discover it lord basingstoke demanded the queen she had no choice but to hear the whole story constanza has an unusual identifying mark also my book was open on a bookstand next to the bed i have been promised that there are no two in existence elizabeth tudor pursed her lips thoughtfully this was the worse scandal to occur at her court since she had become queen i want the men who have visited the book lady to step forward she said come gentlemen ill wager you werent so shy with the whores at claros and elizabeths eyes widened at the number of men who finally stepped forward bless my soul sirs i thought you were kept well busy chasing my maids of honor she remarked sourly to the large group of shamefaced courtiers choosing ten she dismissed the rest have you all seen the ladys birthmark they nodded solemnly very well then gentlemen each of you is to step up to lord burke and whisper to him the description of that mark niall burke stood rocklike his face an icy and impenetrable mask as one by one the ten embarrassed men moved up whispered and then slipped away disappearing into the crowd as quickly as they could you also basingstoke commanded the queen when constanzas accuser had finally stepped back elizabeth asked very well lord burke do these men speak the truth aye madam they do to my everlasting shame constanza had revived and cradled in skyes arms moaned as if in terrible pain niall sent her a bitter yet pitying look do you wish to withdraw your challenge lord burke asked the queen in a softer tone than she had used during the awful interrogation no madam lord basingstoke for all his fine outrage is nevertheless responsible for being the first to debauch my wife and bring dishonor upon my name i will not withdraw my challenge very well sir we will settle this matter here and now lord dudley will you see to it the ballroom will do see to the seconds i will act as lord burkes second geoffrey southwood stepped forward skye gave a little cry of distress and the queen reached over and patted her no danger my dearest skye i promise sirs this will not be a fight to the death do you both understand what i say honor must be served but that is all lord dudley chose a reluctant second for basingstoke from among the men who had admitted to visiting the book lady birds of a feather he quipped receiving contemptuous looks in return for his humor the others knew that he had been a visitor to the lady involved but had not dared admit it before the queen the paneled ballroom was quickly cleared of chairs and tables and the musicians in the gallery above were dismissed skye helped constanza burke to her feet and led her to stand by the queen elizabeth would not even look at the distraught woman but said quietly without moving from tonight my lady burke you are banned from this court constanza bowed her head the combatants stood at either end of the room having shed their elegant and ornate doublets they stood in shirts open at the neck with an air of great selfimportance dudley bustled back and forth between the two groups whipthin rapiers made of the finest toledo steel were brought forth tested and chosen by the seconds what a pity you cant kill the pompous bastard niall geoffrey southwood murmured gods will be done said niall burke in a low voice as he very loosely attached to his sword the protective tip ordered by the queen amen answered the earl piously pretending to inspect the tip more lights commanded the queen and fresh tapers were brought the gentlemen and their seconds forward please commanded dudley now sirrahs this is a combat to satisfy honor honor will be satisfied when one of the combatants is totally disarmed and helpless is that understood the participants nodded seconds to neutral corners please gentlemen en garde so began an exquisite ballet of courtly battle technique the combatants were fairly evenly matched basingstoke was not quite as tall as niall but he was heavier they circled each other slowly engaged in a brief flurry separated quickly each was guaging the other testing for strengths seeking weaknesses the courtiers leaned avidly forward fascinated silently egging the combatants onward the young queen stood quietly only the faint quivering of her long elegant hands betraying her nervousness she was frankly disgusted by the beauteous lady burkes disgraceful behavior but at the same time thrilled by the sight of two stalwart men brought to battle by that very behavior if only men would fight over her like mat thought elizabeth constanza burke watched with a sense of growing desperation what would niall do to her probably kill her god knew she deserved it why did she have this awful sickness what drove her to these terrible acts of perversion she wept softly skye countess of lynmouth watched the battle nervously thank god the queen had ordered the protective tips if geoffrey had to fight he wouldnt be injured why had he volunteered to second lord burke she hadnt been aware of any friendship between them still he was their neighbor on the strand and she felt a deep pity for both the irishman and his unfortunate wife khalid had told her about women like constanza burke women who could not get enough loving skye knew that lady burke was not wicked but sick she suddenly felt tired when this was over she would beg the queens leave to go home for her lyingin niall burke circled his opponent parrying a vicious thrust leaping forward he executed a quick riposte his eye checked the protective tip on his sword it was loose and would soon be off he pressed his attack hard the anger burning coldly and deeply within him lionel basingstoke valiantly defending himself knew he had made a terrible mistake in allowing his pride and his temper to overrule his sense he had seen the loose tip on his opponents sword and he fully realized lord burkes intent he was going to die and over a worthless tramp why had he not simply given her the beating she deserved and left her to pursue her lusts his body grew wet with fear and anger the two men battled back and forth until older and heavier basingstoke began to tire in a moment of rashness he again allowed his temper the upper hand and yanking the protective tip from his sword snarled at niall all right you damned irish cuckold lets end this now nialls silver eyes narrowed speculatively and then he grinned savagely wolfishly the idiot englishman had made the first move and now he could kill him without any qualms flicking the tip off his own blade he replied i hope youve a legitimate heir you stinking english pig for if youve not your line ends now and he lunged forward slipping easily beneath his opponents guard to bury his blade in basingstokes chest a look of complete surprise crossed the englishmans face and then he fell forward as he fell his own blade flew upward opening a small but very bloody flesh wound on the irishmans chest it blossomed scarlet on lord burkes white silk shirtfront an unearthly shriek shattered the utter silence the court turned expecting to see constanza burkes hysteria but it was the countess of lynmouth who stood rigid her eyes staring inward at some nameless terror she screamed once again then cried ive killed him she wept piteously oh sweet christ ive killed him a spasm of pain crossed her face and suddenly her gaze returned to the scene before her clutching at her belly she fainted sliding slowly to the floor in a crumpled heap in the uproar and confusion that followed both geoffrey southwood and niall burke leaped forward to catch her but the earl was first to his wifes side shooting burke a venomous look cradling skye in his arms he pushed past the babbling courtiers and carried her through the palace and down to the river bank where his barge was docked the countess is going into labor he told his bargemen row for home and row as youve never rowed before a gold rose noble to each of you for getting us there safely the cool air revived skye as they pulled away from the river bank her eyes opened geoffrey i am here my darling how do you feel the babys coming i know you clutched at your belly and then you fainted damned provident this duel people will believe it brought on the premature birth of our son he glanced anxiously at her i remember geoffrey i remember everything she breathed he sighed i know skye he answered her quietly i saw the look on your face before you fainted what brought it all back my darling burkes injury yes the pirates shot at the jollyboat and wounded niall his shirt was so bloody i thought hed been killed when he was wounded again now it all came back to me he is all right isnt he the earl nodded she fell silent a pensive look on her face i love you skye the heartshaped face tipped up and the sapphireblue eyes looked unwaveringly into his and i love you geoffrey my darling i do he held her close of course she loved him she was in pain now in labor with his child a child conceived in a moment of love conceived when niall burke had been wiped out of her memory but when the child was birthed and she had time to think clearly would she love him then skye lay quietly in his arms her mind whirling omalley she was skye omalley the omalley of lnnisfana she had two sons ewan and murrough oh god who had looked after her boys all this time anne surely anne would have looked after them and michael and her halfbrothers too lord who had cared for the omalley shipping interests she would ask geoffrey for surely he knew it seemed he knew her identity and she would be interested in knowing how long he had known it she felt the pain beginning deep within her so deep that her toestensed she let it sweep upward breathing deeply into it took the edge off of it skye wasnt even aware that she was clutching her husband tightly but geoffrey relished the fierce grip that almost rendered his elegant hand pulp my sons she said what has happened to my sons theyre safe with your stepmother and the family your uncle took care of them and the omalley interests hes now bishop of connaught how long have you known my identity a few months lord burke went to robbie just after our wedding at the bedding ceremony he noticed that very fetching little star on your breast i was curious that having been like a brother to you all your life he would know of such a mark i am curious too said skye and though he knew she lied he loved her all the more for loving him enough to try and protect him i am more curious she continued that he was not suspicious of my identity prior to seeing my birthmark surely i have not changed so greatly senora goya del fuentes didnt react to his hints and though she looked like skye omalley her credentials were impeccable he has since told me he thought you were one of your fathers byblows another wave of pain swept over skye but she giggled despite it and geoffrey was forced to laugh too it would have been just like da to leave a bastard daughter in a convent in algiers how did he account for the name being the same the pain receded he couldnt and that almost drove him mad there was simply no explanation yes she said thoughtfully i imagine it would have driven him mad niall was always an impatient man hes in love with you skye i know geoffrey and you he knew he shouldnt ask her not now but he couldnt stop himself geoffrey my dearest husband i am yours and i want to be when i have finished this business of birthing our son i shall tell you all about niall burke and skye omalley and when i have finished my tale i shall still be yours because i choose to be it was what he wanted to hear or was it still he had to be content with it for now they both fell silent listening to the slapslap of the oars against the water as their barge knifed through the river down to lynmouth house the pains were coming more frequently now and with the knowledge that this was her fourth child the earl despaired of reaching home in time suddenly skye groaned and cried out sharply my love what is it he felt so damned helpless the child is being born geoffrey i can wait no longer you must help me birth it my god skye in the barge she managed a chuckle tell your son what do i do he was sweating but this was his child and hed manage first draw the drapes and bring in the lantern suggested skye and when he had accomplished these two simple tasks she said help push my gown up that done she inched her silken undergarments off and he stared at the swollen blueveined belly that would soon be emptied of their child suddenly a flood of water spewed forth from her body wetting the seat cushions she arched as another pain began to push the child from her body geoffrey she gasped through gritted teeth i can feel the head look look fearfully he forced his eyes downward my god he whispered awestruck as the child began to emerge from her body what do i do skye turn the child slowly as he comes forth geoffrey be very careful not to drop him for hell be slippery with the birthing blood ahhhh jesus mary another pain racked her quickly he rolled up the sleeves of his silk shirt his bejeweled doublet having been left behind at greenwich skye groaned again and her convulsion pushed the childs shoulders forth leaning forward geoffrey wiped the beads of perspiration from her forehead with his handkerchief you are magnificent madam and i love you he said admiringly then he gently turned the child and saw the babys tight little face wiping the blood from it with the same handkerchief that had wiped its mothers face the babys eyes opened looked dispassionately at its father a disturbing strangely familiar look and then slipped forth fully born into the earls waiting hands with a howl of pure outrage one swift look told the earl what he wanted to know a son he exulted youve given me a son skye of course i have she said weakly did i not promise you one the cord weve nothing to cut it with itll wait she said and then fainted the earls bargemen hearing the newly born infants cry and his lordships shout grinned at each other and put their backs into their work shortly afterward they reached their dock at lynmouth house and to their surprise found daisy dame cecily and the midwife waiting for them lord burke rode in with daisy but a few minutes ago to tell us you were coming said dame cecily is skye all right is she in labor the child is born exulted geoffrey when he heard their voices i have a son entering the barge the midwife finished the job by cutting the cord and wiping the newborn free of birthing blood she wrapped him in a clean swaddling cloth and handed him up to daisy skye had regained consciousness and she groaned as another weaker pain cut through her youve not yet borne the afterbirth my lady let me help you the midwife pressed down hard on skyes belly and with one quick pain the afterbirth slipped out onto a linen towel spread by the efficient midwife quickly the woman cleansed her patient free of all evidence of her recent travail then signaled to the litterbearers the earl carefully lifted his wife from the barge and tenderly placed her on pillows in the litter skye held out her arms give me my son geoffrey took the baby from daisy and placed him in his mothers arms alert but quiet now the child returned his mothers scrutiny his small round head was covered with soft damp blond curls his eyes were a deep sapphire blue and his features were his fathers skye smiled happily oh geoffrey i have indeed given you a son hes you in miniature ill wager his eyes turn green within the year mother and child were escorted to the house and tucked carefully into bed the midwife handed skye a goblet of wine into which shed mixed herbs this will help you sleep madam and will also help rebuild the blood youve lost skye obediently drank it down and geoffrey sitting down next to the bed took his wifes hand her beautiful blue eyes were heavy with weariness but the warmth of his strong grasp communicated to her all the love that he felt for her she sighed contented geoffrey southwood smiled tenderly at her go to sleep my love he said and when her eyelids finally closed he left her sleeping under the watchful eyes of daisy their slumbering son in his cradle by his mothers bed the earl of lynmouth walked next door to his own apartment wordlessly he stripped his bloodstained clothing off and climbed into the steaming tub his body servant had prepared he scrubbed himself down and then climbing out dried himself off his valet then wrapped him in a long warm gown and murmuring congratulations left his master alone geoffrey southwood poured himself a goblet of pale golden wine and sat before the blazing fire the child was safely born he had a healthy lusty son an heir but did he still have a loving wife she had refused to discuss niall burke with him which led geoffrey to believe that she had once loved him now that her memory had returned would she love burke again when i am finished with this business of birthing our son i will tell you of niall burke she had said i am yours because i choose to be she had also said damn her proud and independent irish spirit then he chuckled ruefully it was this very independence that made her different from other women that made her skye draining his goblet geoffrey climbed into his chilly empty bed then lay tossing restlessly he dozed then awoke with a start this was the first night since their marriage that hed been without her for even in these last weeks of her pregnancy hed slept with her in her bedchamber snoring contentedly against her warmth must be getting old he thought with a touch of humor these sheets were cold and musty with lack of use and there were lumps in his fine mattress gods blood he said suddenly leaping up i will not sleep here a minute longer and padding barefoot across the cold floor to the door that connected his room with hers he stomped in poor daisy was horrified having never seen her master in his nightshirt skye sitting propped up with pillows behind her the child at her breast bit her lip with suppressed mirth my lord have you come to see our wee robin the baby made a murmur of distinct annoyance as his mothers voice disturbed his concentration im cold announced the earl pettishly skyes eyes twinkled i have never seen the sense she said in a man sleeping apart from his wife simply because she has just borne a child with her free hand she flung the bedcovers back in invitation climb in geoffrey i am cold too without you scandalized daisy pursed her lips together but the earl and countess of lynmouth simply giggled like two naughty children and snuggled close then geoffrey turned his attention to the tiny goldenhaired infant who rooted noisily at his mothers breast his tiny fingers kneading her hes working hard enough at it observed the earl my milk wont be in for a day or two all hes getting now is a watery liquid said skye is that natural he was instantly concerned should we have a wet nurse for him she laughed with all the children you had you should know more my love my present condition is quite natural i shall get a wet nurse for robin in about a month but during the time it takes me to recover from this birth i shall have the pleasure of giving my child suck so you already decided upon his name have you all by yourself i have she replied unconcerned he is robert geoffrey james henry southwood robert for my dearest robbie geoffrey for you james for my uncle seamus and henry in honor of both the late king and robins dead halfbrother his godparents will be the queen and lord dudley he will be vain enough to believe i have named the child for him in order to please the queen he should therefore prove an excellent godfather to robin in an effort to impress the queen geoffrey southwood chuckled admiringly by god youre a wickedly clever minx my dear the queen and lord dudley i dont believe anyone has yet given them a godchild not both of mem together what a stroke of genius i most assuredly approve warmed by her ripe body he was beginning to feel expansive noting it skye smiled daisy put robin back to bed then you may watch over him the rest of the night please aye madam daisy took the child her flush went unnoticed as her mistress drew the bed draperies thus making a private little world for herself and the earl geoffrey southwoods eyes were bright with love and admiration i was so damned lonely for you he said and i for you if youd not come into my bed i should have called for you would you he was as pleased as a child his green eyes lighting up aye i would now go to sleep my darling twas a brave thing you did delivering robin thank you my love she nestled next to him and sighing happily he put a protective arm about her within a few minutes he was sleeping soundly his slow regular breathing a comforting sound now it was skye who lay awake how strange it was that this elegant assured man to whom she was married could suffer such terrible pangs of insecurity how hard it must have been for him these last few weeksknowing the truth of her identity unable to tell her yet fearful she would learn of it fearful because of niall burke for the first time since her memory had returned those few short yet somehow long hours ago she thought of him there were touches of silver at his temples that had not been mere tour years ago in the morning geoffrey would want to know about niall and what was she to tell him should she lie she knew niall still loved her now she understood those searching looks he had given her the intense questioning if she chose to lie she knew she could ask niall for his help hed not like it but hed help if she asked him to she moved restlessly and geoffreys protective arm slipped loose he sighed and turned on his other side away from her she couldnt lie to geoffrey she couldnt the truth might be softened but an outright lie could bring disaster she had no wish to hurt geoffrey she loved him but did she not also love niall hadnt her memory fled because he was the most important being in her life her mind had gone blank rather than accept nialls death four years ago four long years and in that time so much had happened khalid el bey her beloved second husband could she love him any less because her memory of niall had returned no he would always have a place in her secret heart and their daughter willow with khalids black lashes and golden lion eyes was the living proof of that love and geoffrey she loved him also as he loved her their love had grown into something wonderful could she walk away from him now and niall what of him long ago and far away in what almost seemed another life they had shared one ecstatic night of blinding passion they had tried to build a life together based on that night but fate continued to separate them he had a wife now a wife who obviously needed him desperately as she had a husband but she loved him still yet she loved geoffrey it was madness how could a woman love two men at the same time damn she swore softly to herself tell me geoffreys calm voice commanded skye gave up all thought of lying and answered simply i was betrothed to him after my first husband died i thought you were asleep how can i sleep with you tossing so my darling did you love him yes do you love him now that your memory has returned i love you she said he smiled in the darkness but do you love him geoffrey persisted no she said quickly he frowned slightly at the tooquick denial was she lying to protect his feelings or to hide something from him did he ever know you geoffrey damn did he oh lord help her not to rouse his suspicions no she said with what she hoped was just the right tinge of righteous annoyance he never knew me she felt him relax and said a quick prayer of thanks now the tension gone she was suddenly exhausted i am tired she yawned once more he enfolded her in his protective clasp go to sleep my dearest wife he said go to sleep in the house to the right of them however the master and mistress were far from sleep in the uproar that had followed the duel the queen had instructed the burkes be brought to her my lord she addressed herself to niall her dark eyes very large and angry i have already told your wife that she is no longer welcome at this court as for youyou deliberately disobeyed my orders and killed lord basingstoke for that i could have you beheaded do you realize that in her dancing costume of pale green watered silk ecru lace at the neck and sleeves elizabeth ought to have appeared young and mild but this was elizabeth at the angriest niall had ever seen her and the frivolous dancing gown was obscured by her flaming redgold hair and snapping dark eyes in this rage elizabeth flamed as hotly as her father the infamous henry the eighth she continued we understand mat you were sorely provoked lord burke nonetheless are also banished from court and from england for the period of one year your wife however is never to set foot in my realm again we give you one month in which to prepare for your departure the woman called claro niall asked in an unwavering voice i beg your majestys permission to deal personally with her we do not wish to hear of it my lord said the queen slowly and with particular meaning lest we be forced to review our clemency to you that is understood madam farewell then my lord burke said elizabeth extending him her hand he kissed it elizabeth pointedly ignored the subdued constanza as she had ignored her throughout the interview niall burke slowly released the beautiful bejeweled hand you are ever gracious majesty grasping his wifes arm he led her through a side door down a maze of corridors and out into the courtyard to their carriage he pushed her up into the coach and shouted to the liveried servant on the box home then he climbed in and sat opposite her the vehicle lurched forward niall burke sat back in his seat and looked at his wife amazing he said after a long while simply amazing despite the fact that you are obviously the biggest whore in christendom you look like an angel her violet eyes wide she cowered from his brutal appraisal whats this constanzita shyness why shy with me when you are as familiar with every man in london what are you going to do with me she asked him finding her voice and unable to bear the strain any longer what the hell can i do with you he countered you are my wife may god have mercy on me i must surely be cursed my first wife was a religious fanatic who couldnt bear any mans touch and my second turns out to be a notorious whore who encourages every mans touch the one woman in the world i ever truly wanted loses her memory and marries another constanza burke relaxed just a little for a moment she was free of his searing contempt what do you mean the only woman you ever really wanted he looked coldly at her the countess of lynmouth is skye omalley she did not die as your father assured me she must have done but she did lose her memory he gave her a brief explanation of what had happened is that why youve been so unhappy and preoccupied these last few months that is why he said and how fortuitous for you my dear it made it so much easier for you to play the whore she wondered if his own sorrow might make him receptive to her anguish please try and understand i cannot help this terrible need niall i truly cant i know it constanza and that is why i must do what i must do we are banished from england and we must go home to ireland i cannot have you running about the countryside bringing further shame upon my name youll be confined to your apartment in my fathers castle youll never leave them my dear and youll have a warder of my choosing who will never leave your side except when i bed you and ill do that often my dear for since i am forced to remain shackled to you to prevent my name from becoming a joke i must therefore breed my legitimate heirs on your wellused body especially since you cant breed them on the fine lady southwood she snapped back realizing her folly too late she was unable to escape the blow he aimed at her the sound of it echoed inside the carriage and her head swam with the force of it she felt his hand cruelly locking itself into her hair and her neck snapped back as he yanked her about to face him his silver eyes were narrowed his harsh voice ripped into her like shards of ragged glass listen well my dear to what i have to say i could take you home now and beat you to death i could strangle you and dump you in the thames and no one would care not even me nothing would be said for your actions have merited death but you are my wife and though i am forced to confine you as the only way of assuring your faithfulness i will get my sons on you and you will live in luxury but never and he yanked her hair harshly never do i want to hear her name on your lips do you understand me constanza yyes yes what yes my lord very good my dear i am pleased letting her go he pushed her back into her seat lowering the coach window he called to his driver to stop my horse is tied to the back of the coach he told constanza i am returning to the palace for the countesss tiring woman and then i am riding to lynmouth house to warn them that the countess is in labor with her child i will see you at home later she nodded dumbly but he was already gone a moment later two footmen climbed into the coach and sat opposite her master says were to guard you as youve not been yourself said the older one dourly she ignored them looking after niall as he galloped off despite the lateness of the hour and the empty streets the trip to the strand seemed to take forever the footmen had been eating onions and the already fetid air in the closed coach was unbearable quite quickly constanza was becoming paler by the moment her mind bursting with all niall had said in ireland she would be incarceratedfor the rest of her life she was to be a brood mare the thought repelled and excited her at the same time shifting nervously in her seat she boldly eyed the younger of the two footmen whose eyes were glued to her full breasts the boy flushed guiltily turning even redder as constanzas pointed little tongue swiftly licked around her pink lips the familiar longing now began imprisoned watched over constantly she would go mad somehow ana would have to help her to escape niall but right now constanza had to satisfy her hunger who knew when she would get another chance stop the coach she commanded imperiously you her accusing finger pointed at the older of the two footmen you stink of onions ride up top i am close to fainting accustomed to obeying orders the man called to the driver to stop and scrambled up the coachs side to join the driver as the vehicle began to move again constanza wordlessly fell to her knees before the remaining footman fumbled with his livery and bending her head took his organ into her mouth the boy could only gasp with surprise as his mistresss insistent lips and tongue drove him when he thought his delight could be no greater she rose and lifting her skirts impaled herself on him the footman swiftly tore her bodice open and pushed his face into her breasts he kissed sucked and bit on them prodding her to frenzy as she jogged up and down on him she spent twice then when she was weak and languid the footman became emboldened lifting her up he turned her over and shoved her face down on the opposite seat her skirts pushed above her waist her little white bottom glowed pale and he entered her from behind his beefy hands fumbled beneath her squeezing her breasts rhythmically with each stroke of his rod as he murmured the foulest of obscenities in her ear a moment before his climax he reached one hand beneath her to tweak at the little button of her sensuality and they shuddered their satisfaction in unison he had barely drained when she bucked him away from her straightened her skirts and sat calmly down to lace her bodice fix your livery she hissed and remember that one word will cost you your position she was calmer now than she had been all evening and now she was able to think when they reached the house she sought ana he knows all constanza announced without preamble that fool basingstoke provoked a duel niall killed him but weve been banished from both court and england santa maria protect us ah nina i warned you my lord will surely kill you now id rather he did but he is taking us to ireland and i am to be forever imprisoned in my apartment there while i breed his heirs get down on your knees nina and thank the holy mother the lord is merciful no no duenna i will not be locked up you must help me escape nina nina be reasonable my lord is willing to forgive you where could you go perhaps harry will help me no nina you have been fortunate be a good wife now they argued for close to an hour ana urging restraint constanza becoming more frantic then suddenly the door was flung open and lord burke strode in good you are both here ana i am pensioning you off and sending you back to mallorca no cried both women in unison ana flung herself at lord burkes feet please my lord no constanza is my baby i cannot leave her do not make me i beg you niall burke lifted up the weeping woman ana it is precisely because of you love for constanza that i must send you away you knew of her perfidy and yet you protected her you would do so again had you come to me immediately this scandalmight have been avoided please my lord ana no more his voice was stem but kindly it is because of your love for my wife and the care you have given her that i pension you rather than send you onto the streets bid your mistress farewell now youll leave in the morning and carry with you my instructions to my agent in mallorca helplessly ana hugged constanza to her the tears running down her worn old face nina do as i have bid you for the sake of the love i bore both you and your poor mother do not leave me duenna do not leave me constanza wept niall please i beg you lord burke separated the two women neither of you can be trusted he said wearily and firmly escorted ana from the room stopping to lock the door behind him before he walked ana to her room my lord she pleaded once more adios ana god go with you be kind to her my lord i have let her live to bear my sons ana yet i am not sure i am wise in doing so as ana departed the next morning she remembered the sadness in his voice from an upper floor of the house constanza waved to her calling adios ana mia vaya con dios ana was taken by coach to the london docks and escorted aboard a mallorcabound vessel on her person she carried two letters one was to the governor constanzas father it explained that the climate of england had proved detrimental to anas health and as ireland was no warmer lord burke was pensioning off his wifes loyal retainer she would be given a cottage on constanzas dowry lands and an annual stipend the second letter directed lord burkes mallorcan agent to make the proper arrangements for ana the vessel on which ana traveled was fortunate as there were few ships in the london pool it sailed within two days anas thoughts however remained behind in england with her mistress chapter a line of brightly decorated carriages extended down the strand from the entry of lynmouth house gaily caparisoned horses their elegant riders bandying the latest gossip rode past the carriages and up the driveway of the beautiful riverside mansion lady south wood two weeks past childbirth was receiving everyone sought to congratulate the queens favorite lady on the birth of the lynmouth heir the truth had been broadcast about the lovely countess of lynmouth she had not been raised in a french convent she was in fact an irish heiress who had suffered from a complete loss of memory since being kidnaped by pirates she had been betrothed to the irish lord burke at the time of her disappearance the same lord burke whose wife provoked the terrible duel that killed poor basingstoke it was all too delightfully scandalous scandal bred scandal some cousins of geoffrey southwoods the ones who stood to inherit his title and estates if he died without male issue then petitioned the archbishop of canterbury to declare the earls current marriage null and void and his new son robert a bastard their justification was skyes previous contact with lord burke the uproar that followed was monumental with geoffrey southwood calling his cousin out and badly wounding him in a duel it was still not certain whether the foolish man would live lord burke a gentleman even if he was irish had saved the situation by bringing forth a document signed by the pope and attested to as genuine by the spanish ambassador the document had dissolved lord burkes betrothal contract with skye omalley who was presumed deceased constanzas father had been a careful man the archbishop of canterbury subsequently declared that no impediment had existed at the time of the marriage between lord and lady southwood therefore their son robert was legal issue the archbishop had baptized the boy himself with the queen and lord dudley acting as the childs godparents but there was even more lord burke had invaded the house of the prostitute claro stripped her naked and whipped her through the streets of london to the edge of the city he left her there to brave a mob of lustful men and outraged goodwives returning to his own home burke discovered his wife her jewels and his head groom gone the queen had lifted his banishment until he could find constanza she seemed to have disappeared off the face of the earth the court agreed that the past halfmonth had been simply exhausting the countess of lynmouth received her guests in state propped up in her bedchamber with its goldembroidered rose velvet hangings she wore a heavy creamcolored quilted satin bedgown embroidered with pearls and turquoise in a floral design her beautiful dark curls were held back by a matching pearlandturquoise ribbon her pink cheeks and sparkling blue eyes attested to her good health and quick recovery southwood finally had a lucky marriage the lady was a good breeder whod probably give him a son every year or two plump goosedown pillows their laceedged white linen covers smelling faintly of lavender propped the countess up a pink coverlet that matched the rose velvet hangings was spread over the bed next to the canopied bed a carved and gilded walnut cradle displayed the lacecapped heir who slept oblivious through the admiring exclamations the room was a treasure trove of gifts all tastefully displayed in honor of their donors chief among the gifts was a set of twelve silver cups set with sapphires the babys birthstone they were from his godmother lord dudley had presented his godson with a leather case containing twelve silver spoons the childs crest was on the front his birthdate on the back everyone who came brought gifts young robin had a dozen silver rattles of various designs and at least that number in teething rings there were several christening cups many lengths of excellent cloth and a number of wellfilled purses there were gifts for skye too frivolous bits of lace and ribbons little jewelry and nosegays of lateseptember flowers through it all geoffrey southwood stood by his wifes side watching over her with loving pride she had been most loving since robins birth and that more than anything else she could have done reassured geoffrey but skye did not feel sure of herself niall burke had not yet come to see her and how could she know what was really in her heart until he did why did he not come and when he finally did at last she was totally unprepared autumn had been late in coming and even now at octobers end the trees were just at their golden peak geoffrey had been gone ten days down into devon to oversee the arrangements for his wife and sons arrival there the queen had finally though reluctantly agreed to let skye go at least until the spring skye sat this bright october day beneath an apple tree in her riverside garden her yellow skirts were spread about her like a flower willow now two and a half played nearby under the watchful eye of her nurse the baby slumbered on a blanket beside his mother in the warm afternoon sun skye was relaxed and content when daisy came to announce my lord burke has called to pay his respects milady he is waiting in your little library skye rose slowly with far more calm than she felt take robin to his nurse daisy she instructed then walked quietly across the lawn and into the house she stopped for a moment to check her hair in a mirror carefully tucking an errant lock into the golden net that confined her dark curls her hand was trembling which didnt surprise her for her heart was racing wildly taking a deep breath she grasped the door handle firmly straightened her shoulders and walked purposefully into the library my lord it is good to see you again her musical voice did not waver and she produced just the right note of cordiality niall turned the silvery eyes were still bold and clear and bright but now there were tiny wrinkles around mem his fair skin was clear and he stood as tall and straight as ever but there was a maturity an alluring quiet strength about him now growth marked by time and molded by suffering his dark hair was accented by a bit of gray near the temples gone was the rash young man she remembered and in that young mans place stood a mature and yes a most attractive selfassured man youve become even more beautifulif that is possible motherhood becomes you skye thank you my lord she moved to the table will you take wine how formal she sounded was he laughing at her are you uncomfortable with me skye it i s awkward niall until six weeks ago i remembered nothing beyond four years agoin algiers sit down with me skye sit down and tell me what happened i almost lost my mind when i lost you she sat across from him in a brown velvet chair and calmly began i was transferred from the ship that took me to another that same day that part is hazy they did not harm me for the moslems believe the mad to have been touched by gods hand believing you dead i had temporarily lost my mind when i became aware again i was in the house of khalid el bey he cared for me he loved me eventually we were married she told her story simply finishing with i was pregnant with khalids child when i fled algiers willow is his daughter the rest you know her eyes never left nialls during the recitation did you love the infidel skye felt a cold anger surge through her how dare he speak to her that way khalid el bey was a great gentleman she said slowly and deliberately i loved him deeply he was kind and good and beloved of all who knew him how dare you refer to him that way skye forgive me my own troubles have colored my feelings toward all women lately thank god for khalid el bey had he not rescued you god only knows what would have happened to you why have you come niall i am returning home to ireland skye i thought i might carry some messages for you and tell your family when you will return i do not know when ill return she said i am told that uncle seamus has taken excellent care of the business my life is here now all i want are my sons i would like them sent here to me but youre the omalley of innisfana skye i am also the countess of lynmouth niall but tell me have you found your poor wife i found her she is not well shell be better off in ireland he was so bitter she realized fate had not dealt kindly with him i am sorry niall she said so very sorry i neither need nor want your pity skye he snapped the words he did not say hung between them want your love he rushed on constanza nursed me back to health they all said you were dead that a lady couldnt possibly have lived through such an experience at first i wouldnt listen but even the dey of algiers couldnt find you finally i had to listen i was lonely and constanza was pretty and so innocent i had to marry for the mac williams sake for the burke name i had forgotten the difference between just a lady and a certain irish lady he sighed so sadly that she came close to weeping whatever your fate niall mine would not have changed i should still be married to geoffrey now would you his tone challenged her for the first time since she had entered the room skye looked straight at niall her sapphireblue eyes with their hint of green snapped yes i would had my memory remained whole i would have moved heaven and hell to return to you niall burke but the thought that you were dead all but destroyed me in my heart and mind i must have believed myself responsible for your death and i could not face what i thought id done my mind went blank now my memory has returned and i thank god for it for it allows me to be reunited with my sons and my family but understand this niall i cannot change what has happened during the last four years and i am not sure i would want to change how many women have known the love i have known love he shouted at her more likely you mean lovemaking thats all you damn women think about i would have thought dom oflaherty had cured you of lust and if he had she shouted back would you have been so hot to bed me no you wouldnt have wanted me then her heart went out to him niall oh my poor dear how badly youve been hurt once my lord khalid told me of women like your constanza its a sickness with her niall she cannot help what she does but he was infuriated by her pity and what is your excuse madam that lusty boy who howls in your nursery was no sevenmonth babe what a cold selfrighteous bastard youve become she said softly he snarled and catching her by surprise yanked her roughly toward him she found she could not move and his big hands tangled in her hair as his mouth crushed down on hers with brutal deliberateness he kissed her slowly over and over until she could not avoid responding his mouth seared hers he kissed her purpleshadowed eyelids her temples and again her mouth thrill after thrill slammed through skye oh dear god his mouth forced back the memories she had so long denied the girl she had been cried out soundlessly to him then as suddenly as he had grasped her he thrust her from him yes he spat you are all alike you women ready to lift your tail for any man who rouses you she slapped him as hard as she could no wonder your wife seeks other men she said and rejoiced to see his face crumble he had hurt her and she wanted to hurt him he turned on his heel and slammed from the room alone her hand tingling she wept what had happened to him in the past four years to change him so was it not she who had suffered the most she could understand his bitterness over constanza but why did he direct his hostility toward her the afternoon shadows lengthened a servant came to light the fire and still she sat with the tears running unchecked down her face the library door opened once again but she did not look up strong arms wrapped about her pulling her against the comfort of a familiar velvetclad chest ill kill the arrogant bastard for hurting you geoffreys cool voice surprised her he hates me she sobbed he truly hates me and for what what have i done to him do you hate him no she sobbed then hes a fool to scorn your love came the reply i dont love him geoffrey not now but he was once my dear friend and now he hates me i did him no hurt and mat is what i cannot bear she wept as he held her tenderly stroking her dark hair finally she managed to calm herself when did you get back she sniffed a little while ago daisy told me lord burke had called on you slammed angrily from the house shortly thereafter and that youd not come out of the library since then is all well in devonr all is well and in readiness to receive us my girls eagerly await you as well as their stepsister and halfbrother let us go tomorrow all right he agreed well go tomorrow geoffrey what my darling i love you a happy grin split his handsome face he walked to the library door and turned the key in the lock she saw the grin fade into a look of passion oh yes she breathed in answer to the unasked question yes yes yes and holding out her hand to him she drew him close for a long long moment he held her face in his hands looking down into it then his mouth touched her gently searchingy and her lips parted eagerly beneath his sending shivers of hot and cold up her spine his kisses deepened and she became aware that his hands were loosening her laces drawing her skirts off her own fingers were pulling at the bone buttons on his doublet and when they had undressed each other they slipped to the floor before the warm fire his elegant fingers stroked her long back her rounded buttocks she grew bold pushing him onto his back her small tongue lapping eagerly at his nipples damn you skye he growled through gritted teeth ahhhh god sweetheart her tongue followed the thin golden line of hair downward from his belly she breathed deeply of his warm male scent like a kitten licking lovingly at a kindly hand she loved his great manroot with her tongue he shuddered with pleasure for several months now he had been denied the delights of her body strangely he had remained faithful once having loved her no other woman could satisfy him to fall upon her would have been so easy he ached to bury himself deep within her but geoffrey southwood was that rare man who gained his greatest pleasure by giving pleasure skillfully he turned her onto her back and slowly rained burning kisses over the long pure pillar of her throat i have longed for weeks to love you again he murmured placing his lips against the jumping pulse at the base of her throat his mouth moved to the tiny star mole at the swell of her breast sweet ah my darling how sweet you are they were lost in each other hands and lips loved and loved and loved again until the line between reality and fantasy wavered and finally disappeared altogether they caressed they tasted they hungered until finally they were joined in one undying blaze of love that left them physically shaken but strangely stronger the goldorange firelight played over their entwined bodies like a jealous third lover exhausted they slept where they lay waking an hour later to cuddle to speak in hushed whispers of little things they were man and wife they were lovers and yet they sometimes felt momentarily shy of each other the harvest was good on the estates he said did you visit wren court she asked they eagerly awaited dame cecily shes as anxious to get home as we are oh geoffrey thank you for loving me really loving me i love you as you love me my darling tis love returned twill always be returned my dearest husband what niall burke would not have given to hear those words he had left lynmouth house in a high rage the meeting had not gone at all as he had planned he had dared to hope that she would fling herself into his arms and beg to be taken home to ireland he had believed she would be ashamed of what had transpired in algiers instead she had behaved totally unlike the sweet skye of his memory his memory was faulty niall had conveniently forgotten the woman who had led her men into battle with barbary pirates moving through his house he unlocked the door to his wifes bedchamber and walked into the room good evening mrs tubbs and how is your patient tonight a tall stocky woman rose from her chair by the bed and came forward she was able to take some soup this evening my lord good go and get your own meal now i will sit with lady burke until you return thank you my lord the big woman bobbed a curtsey and was gone niall burke sat down by the bed and stared at the sleeping woman who was his wife her beautiful pale golden skin had grown sallow her glorious dark golden hairbraided now in two plaitshad become a lusterless brown and lank but a few months ago she had been the loveliest girl alive and now he sighed poor constanza he could never forgive her for what she had done but they might begin again and if he could get her with child perhaps she would become once more the sweet girl he had fallen in love with back on mallorca her pansypurple eyes opened niall i am here constanzita take me home niall when you are strong enough to travel my dear we will go home to ireland constanza shuddered ireland that wet gray land the macwilliams stronghold would be cold and gray too she longed for warmth for the sun for mallorca if you take me to ireland i shall die i want to go home to mallorca we will see what the doctor says constanzita he said go to sleep now her eyes closed wearily and he was struck by how frail she was it amazed him that she had managed to withstand the rigors of the london underworld where hed found her she had fled with his head stableman knowing her nature quite well harry had set her up in two rooms and pimped for her he sold her jewelry then began to live riotously on the proceeds setting himself up in quarters in a nearby tavern lavish spending soon emptied harrys pockets but his taste for high life abated not one whit he beat his mistress cruelly accusing her of not working hard enough she could earn twice as much if shed cut down on the amount of time she spent with her customers and if she took only four hours to sleep a night polly the kitchen maid hearing of harrys whereabouts from her married sister who lived in the same slum crept above stairs to find her master niall had taken polly up on his horse ahead of him and breathless with excitement she had directed him to where constanza lived niall was hard put not to become sick when he found his wife halfdelirious with fever on the floor in a tiny room she lay on a filthy pallet the stink of the unemptied chamber pot permeating the room even little polly raised in the same degree of poverty gasped with shock er ull be no good to ye cackled the old crone who owned the house unless o course ye likes to swive em when they alf dead close your trap old hag snapped polly were taking the lady out of here lady is it lady screeched the old woman she owes me for rent that one where is the man who was with her asked niall andsome any e aint been around since she got ill got imself a newer younger doxy how much rent is owed the old woman eyed lord burke craftily a shilling she said the irishman reached for his purse but polly intervened you wouldnt get a shilling for this room in two years time old hag she declared outraged give her no more than two silver pennies my lord instead niall burke pulled a halfcrown from his purse and handed it to the woman whose eyes bugged with greed and shock this woman was never here and neither were we he said quietly the landlady snatched the coin bit it and stuffed it into her apron pocket i aint never seen any o yese she declared quickly disappearing from the room niall and polly got constanza to her feet youll ride with her lass and ill lead the horse he said thankful for the rainy dark night that would cover their return to the strandniall burke had long ago tired of feeding the gossip mills of court when they finally reached the burke house the servants had all retired excepting one sleepy stable boy who took the horse off to its stall lord burke carried his unconscious wife up to her rooms where he and polly stripped the filthy garments off her thin body niall then filled the small oak tub with warm water he and polly lugged up from the kitchens themselves they washed her including her matted liceridden hair constanza half conscious protested weakly they hauled her from the tub toweled her off put a clean gown on her and plaited her dried hair into two braids she was finally tucked into bed back down in the kitchens of the house lord burke emptied the little tub and sat down at the table polly rummaged about in the larder and found half a roasted capon she put it on a wooden trencher with some bread and placed it before her master she then poured him a goblet of brown october ale and stood back but niall motioned her into the bench opposite him tearing off part of the capon breast he shoved the meat toward her eat up lass youve worked hard this night and pour yourself some ale too shyly polly obeyed him somewhat astounded thank you my lord that was a kind thing you did lass i might never have found my wife without your help shes a very sick woman polly sick in spirit and body i never thought a lady would act that way begging your pardon my lord he smiled a curiously innocent little sparrow was polly he could have shocked her with tales of great court ladies all over europe who whored for one reason or another polly you seem a bright lass im going to offer you a chance to better yourself but it will not be easy i need someone to look after my lady she can never again be left alone if i am not with her then someone else must be she is ill now but when she gets well shell try and cozen you but you mustnt let her do you think you can do it aye my lord but theres one thing you should know harry was sometimes my lover too and once when my lady caught us she she pollys face was beet red she joined us the servant finished with a rush i know i can care for her but i wanted you to know that niall choked on his ale constanza had certainly been inventive part of caring for lady burke will be telling those who ask that she is not strong in mind polly i understand sir so he had hired mrs tubbs to keep watch by night and young polly cared for constanza during the day the first doctor engaged was told only that lady burke had been abducted and the experience had unhinged her mind he cupped and bled her which only weakened her further niall sent the physician on his way and brought in a second doctor this one recommended by lord southwood the man turned out to be a knowledgeable moor he examined constanza thoroughly stopping to make notes clucking sympathetically at last he went with lord burke to a private room my lord your wife is a very sick woman emotionally and physically she will need a special diet rest sunshine and medication he paused a moment as if weighing something then he asked do you have the pox my lord god no your wife does it was said flatly one of the worst cases ive ever seen im not surprised niall said quietly you see doctor my wife is indeed ill she is a woman for whom one lover is simply not enough do you understand what i am saying i do my lord and i am sorry i have heard of such cases i can treat her symptoms but unless you can prevent her folly she will kill herself frankly i am not sure it is not already too late niall sought his study he lit no candles but sat quietly by the dancing fire well father he thought shall not be bringing this wife home to ireland yet dr hamid returned the next day good evening doctor niall greeted him my lord come see me after you have examined constanza very well my lord niall sighed he remained in thought for some time and men became aware that he was not alone my lord oh doctor come into my study and sit down man how is constanza a bit stronger but not as well as i hoped for my lord could she travel ireland it would kill her no doctor hamid mallorca she had expressed a desire to go home if it is possible i would grant her wish the sun would be very good for her my lord but she is not yet strong enough for the trip in a few weeks it is possible yes in fact if she knows she is going it will improve her attitude greatly then i shall tell her in the meantime i will go home to ireland to see my father i have been gone over four years niall burke was on his way home within three days riding across the verdant stretch of england that brought him to its westernmost port where he quickly found a ship bound for ireland the first sight of his beloved homeland the softly undulating green hills the dramatic cloudtossed skies peculiar to ireland alone combined with his lengthy absence brought tears to nialls eyes but once the ship had docked and he was on a horse once more sentiment gave way to sheer eagerness to reach the macwilliams stronghold he was stunned to find his family expecting him and wondered how in the world theyd known of his coming as he approached his home he saw a figure riding out to meet him and his heart caught when he recognized his father the old man had grown thinner and was even frail niall noted as his father came closer but he had not lost any of his fabled authority or proud bearing so you let the omalley escape again and shes already spawned a son for her new lord was his fathers greeting it was if niall had never been away i have a wife now he reminded his father more than a little defensive another barren field upon which your seed lays fallow where is she i left her in london she is ill humph i might have guessed as much father i cannot stay i came because i wanted to see you our climate is killing constanza and because ireland is no better i am taking her home to mallorca better you bring her here to ireland to die then we can rewed you to a strong irish girl wholl give me grandsons foreign wenches transplant badly in irish soil she will probably die anyway father she misses the sun and i would have her last days be happy in that case ill see which maidens of good family are available for marriage or perhaps a young widow with sons the older man mused make me no matches father i want my grandchildren about me before i die and so it went between them for the few days of nialls visit on the day of his departure seamus omalley the bishop of connaught arrived with his two greatnephews ewan and murrough ofiaherty requesting that niall escort them to their mother in england though the children would slow him down niall agreed he was pleasantly surprised when seamus omalley offered an omalley vessel to take them directly to devon is my niece happy asked the bishop she claims to be said niall sourly but then women are apt to be fickle seamus omalley hid a smile you must learn to accept gods will my son he murmured piously niall burke bit back the urge to tell the good bishop to go to hell i shall endeavor to pray for patience he said with obvious insincerity and seamus omalley chuckled can you leave tomorrow niall skye writes that she is anxious to see these imps of hers poor skye he trailed off there were no words to express what the bishop thought about his nieces tragedy after a moment niall said i can leave tomorrow though i devoutly pray that this trip aboard an omalley vessel will not be as eventful as the last one was ewan and murrough ofiaherty proved easy to chaperone six and seven the boys were anxious to see their mother yet frightened of encountering a woman they barely remembered this trip was their first away from ireland and despite their anxieties they were very excited niall burke bid the macwilliam an affectionate farewell if you need me the governor of mallorca will know where i am he said and i promise you ill come home this time good ill not die my lad until i see the next generation niall shot his father a parting grin then rode off with his two young charges the few days voyage proved uneventful a time of clear skies and good winds on the last day they sailed past the isle of lundy across the tidal bar and up the torridge river to bideford the little oflahertys were wideeyed having never been in a town before openmouthed they gazed at the activity about them in the bustling port town niall unable to resist indulging them a little took them to a delightful riverside inn for cakes and watered wine he was able to rent two horses and as it was not quite the noon hour there was plenty of time to reach lynmouth castle before they rode off the innkeepers young wife supplied the little party with bread cheese and crisp apples boys get hungry she said with a cheerful smile niall smiled back and mischievously dropped a coin into her bodice buy some blue ribbons to match your eyes he answered ewan and murrough were silent now more nervous as each clop of the horses hooves brought them closer to their mother nialls thoughts centered on skye also they had parted so bitterly and it had been his fault entirely that constanzas behavior should have driven him to suspect skye of immorality what a fool hed made of himself of course she loved southwood it was tragic for niall that her memories of him had only returned after she had fallen in love and married but then as she had pointed out had she not been wed he was why had he taken his frustrations out on her they stopped by a clear stream to rest the horses and eat the simple luncheon that the innkeepers wife had pressed on them tis not like ireland observed ewan everything is so neat murrough said i want to go home now lads give it a chance your mother is so anxious to see you what of the englishman shes married asked ewan his scorn as barely concealed nialls amusement was great lord southwood is a fine gentleman boys youll like him were not staying here continued ewan my brother and i are oflahertys of ballyhennessey and ive my own lands to care for in ireland well only visit with our mother your mother only recently regained her memory when she did her first concern was for you both you are not to disgrace her in front of the english and let the english say were uncouth barbarians to hell with the english snapped the boy a sentiment im inclined to agree with ewan oflaherty but nevertheless you will behave yourself and not disgrace the irish replied niall cuffing the boy playfully now mount up lads if were to reach your mother before dark we must ride hard for lynmouth they had their first view of lynmouth castle just before sunset situated on a bay between two headland points the castle faced the isle of lundy the oldest part of the castle was a saxon roundtower onto which the next several generations had built the result was a small but totally charming mixture of saxon norman gothic and tudor architecture below the darkgray tower the house was pale gray stone covered in spots with deepgreen ivy just then the red lateafternoon sun colored its slateturreted towers and warmed its fields slowly the horses clopped across the wellworn oak drawbridge into the castle courtyard a stable boy hurried out to take their mounts and a servant led them inside the castle i am lord burke i have brought the countesss two sons from ireland said niall this way my lord the young masters have been expected though we knew not when you would arrive the footmen led them to the family hall as they entered the room two things struck niall the room was beautiful windowed on both sides and facing the sea and skye seemed so absolutely right at home in this room standing by a window simply gowned in mulberry velvet her magnificent blue eyes widened with surprise at the sight of him and the two children ive brought you your lads skye he said quietly good evening southwood i hope i may rely on your hospitality tonight the earl nodded and moved to place his arm tightly about bis wifes shoulders these are my sons her look was incredulous geoffrey they were still babies when i saw them last tears were rolling down her cheeks ewan murrough come to mama her arms opened wide and were filled instantly by the two young boys who clung to her unashamed sobbing their own happiness and relief oh my darlings she wept i did not realize until this moment how very very much id missed you both she hugged them again let go of me little monkeys and let me look at you she untangled them from her neck and set them back well youre nothing like your father either of youand i thank god for it youre pure omalley with your black hair and deepblue eyes ewan you are seven now and murrough is six yes mama they chorused then she said wistfully you will soon be sent to a good family as pages but first we will get to know each other again i would present you to your stepfather the earl of lynmouth the boys both turned and under nialls threatening gaze made a leg to lord southwood having seen nialls stern look geoffrey chuckled inwardly with suppressed amusement so the two little savages resented him well that was only natural he bowed back to the two children ewan and murrough oflaherty i am most pleased to have you as my stepsons and welcome you to my home and they must meet the other children geoffrey said skye you have three stepsisters boys susan is six the twins gwyneth and joan are five and you have a halfsister my daughter willow she is three and a half your new baby halfbrother is called robbie come my darlings and ill take you to the nursery to greet them she had said nothing at all to niall nothing i had forgotten that she hates as fiercely as she loves said niall softly you hurt her badly the last time you met replied geoffrey i know god only knows i never meant to but suddenly we were quarreling it was kind of you to bring skyes boys from ireland did you settle your wife there safely constanza is still in london i went to see my father i shall leave for london tomorrow my wife is very ill and i am taking her home to mallorca geoffrey nodded let me have a servant show you to your room he said politely a few minutes later niall stood alone in his room like the lovely family hall he had just left this room faced the sea the sunset was staining the waters below him a dark wine red and in the earlyevening autumn haze he could see the isle of lundy that mysterious pirate haunt skye would be happy here thought niall within the sight and smell of the sea dinner that night was simple and a restrained almost uncomfortable affair the children were not there having eaten earlier in the nursery ewan and murrough were more comfortable now their stepsisters were in total awe of them and they had instantly fallen under the spell of their halfsister willow their infant halfbrother had been dismissed as uninteresting the southwoods and lord burke sat at the high board below them were only a few retainers for the earl was not holding state the meal was simple the conversation spare finally only niall and geoffrey and skye remained sitting the others having either left the hall or gathered about the fireplace niall knew he could not leave in the morning unless he first spoke with skye she had managed to avoid speaking directly to him all evening while making it appear as if nothing was wrong niall realized he must take the direct route skye he said quietly looking directly into her eyes i would tender my apologies for our last meeting her lips turned up in a little smile you were under a great strain my lord she replied pleasantly the smile did not reach to her blue eyes which were devoid of all expression now i hope you will excuse me my lord it has been an exciting day and i am weary she didnt pause to wait for an answer bending to geoffrey her eyes warm now she said do not be long my darling he caught her hand and turning it kissed the palm lingeringly i wont my love her hand caressed his face niall felt himself painfully the intruder in witnessing this short intimate moment skye paused at the door to the hall and turning said god speed niall then she was gone she really has forgiven you niall but you hurt her and she is proud she was always proud he said proud and defiant of the entire world i think thats why her father loved her best and left the omalleys in her charge niall rubbed bis forehead wearily ah that is history now history of another time another place and im thinking of another woman well im off to bed southwood i plan to make an early start if i dont see you in the morning i thank you now for your hospitality geoffrey southwood watched his guest depart and felt sorry for him then shaking himself he went to prepare for bed when he joined his wife skye was brushing her lovely dark hair you were hard on him my love i will not be vulnerable to niall burke ever again she said grimly then switching moods she wound her arms about him and he laughed softly witch are you flirting with me yes kiss me geoffrey he pretended to consider her demand i must think on this madam he said moving away from her beast she hissed launching herself at his back he turned in time to catch and crush her against his chest pinioned she was helpless and now madam he said softly as he nibbled her lips love me geoffrey please love me with pleasure my darling and his mouth closed over hers she gave herself to him unreservedly once again surprising him by the intensity of her passion her lips were petalsoft beneath his parting to allow his tongue entry never freeing her lips he lifted her up and carried her to their bed he laid her gently amid the pillows then drew off his silken nightshirt her sapphire eyes devoured him his limegreen eyes responded in kind she quickly drew her own sheer nightgown off flinging it to the floor and then held out her arms to him he sat on the edge of the bed and took her face in his strong hands looking deep into her magnificent eyes no skye dont make love to me in order to wipe out memories of niall burke i am not afraid of those memories and neither should you be you cared deeply for the man once and i know that those feelings can never be erased completely nor should they be i know he hurt you but he was in pain himself forgive him my darling for his sake but for mine as well so that when we love i know it is because of the feelings you have for me not the deep resentment you still harbor for niall burke the tears spilled from her eyes and ran down her face damn you southwood i dont deserve you hell yes ill forgive the bastard for hes to be pitied i came to terms with the portion fate allotted me but niall did not and hated me while railing at fate as if i were responsible for what happened to us and yes i hated him for inflicting such hurt on me he made me feel guilty for being happy with you when he had such misery with constanza understand one thing though i have never made love with you in order to wipe out memories of niall burke she looked adorably indignant and he chuckled i am relieved to hear that madam he reached out and slowly fondled an impudent little breast a lazy smile turning up the corners of his mouth and lighting his eyes an elegant finger teased a pink nipple to rapt attention then trailed leisurely between her breasts and downward to the place between her legs the heel of his palm pressed firmly then rubbed her breathing was more pronounced now and her eyes glittered through halflowered lids oh sweetheart he murmured you were perfectly fashioned for loving and his head dipped down to taste the soft flesh of her breasts as often as he had done this it still wrung a passionate cry from her throat that set his heart to beating wildly he moaned his hands moved downward imprisoning her slender waist for a moment then slid lower to cup her buttocks his own long body moved over hers and skye reached out to cup and fondle his manroot her soft hands played with him skillfully teasingly rubbing the wet opening of the sensitive organ you could rouse a marble statue witch love me geoffrey she whispered urgently and spread her legs to receive him slowly with sweetly practiced skill he entered her while watching her beautiful eyes mirror what she felt he drew back and her eyes cried distress he plunged deep and the pleasure that leaped into that blue gaze added to his own joy when she finally begged him for sweet release and her dark feathery lashes lay quivering against her pale cheeks he felt her spasms break one after another like breakers crashing on the beach assured of her happiness geoffrey southwood found his own heaven reveling in the lovely body that moved so skillfully beneath his reveling in the sharp nails that dug into his back in her cry of surrender as his aching manhood burst and flooded her with his burning tribute she was his his alone chapter the earl and countess of lynmouth left devon briefly after the new year in order to host the earls famous twelfth night gala in london invitations were at a premium again this year and londons best dressmakers and tailors were overbooked overworked and overwrought in everyones mad scramble for the perfect costume the countess of lynmouths wellfilled purse assured her prior knowledge of all of her guests themes in order that she not offend any by a similar garb a discreet bribe here and there had been necessary to her amusement several of the women were copying her idea of the year before when she had come gowned in black velvet as night some of them had been clever enough to reverse that role so there would be at least half a dozen days and four afternoons as well there were to be the requisite number of springs summers winters and autumns the queen was coming garbed as the sun which was the worstkept secret in all of london the three ladies who had had the same idea had been taken by fits of hysteria when they had to change their gowns the moon and harvest were also popular themes but no one except skye had thought of coming as a jewel she was to be costumed as ruby as daisy and her mother had made the dress in devon this was the bestkept secret in all of london geoffrey would be dressed as emerald in dark green the night of the masque skye stood before her pier glass more than pleased with what she saw the deepred gown was magnificent but not gaudy the underskirt was silk sewn all over in a swirling ornate design with tiny rubies and gold thread that glittered with every movement of light the overskirt was heavy velvet the slashings in the velvet sleeves showing the matching silk of the underskirt and repeating the design of tiny rubies the neckline was daringly low causing the earl to comment i do not know if i approve of your generosity in showing to the court the sweet treasures that are mine alone to enjoy skye had laughed and replied but mink of the envy it will cause my lord he had laughed what a naughty vixen you are and suddenly placed about her neck a beautiful necklace of large rubies my twelfth nights gift to you sweetheart as she gasped he bent and fastened matching drop earrings into her ears oh geoffrey her hand touched the necklace reverently they are extraordinary turning she kissed him sweetly the heady perfume of her body assailed him and he felt a stab of desire for mercys sake my love thank me later at this moment i am seriously considering the disarrangement of both your gown and your hair she giggled happily flushed with pleasure and excitement oh i love you he forced his passion away and muttered id truly rather be home with you in devon than here now preparing to allow half of london to eat and drink me out of house and home as well as ogle my wifes breasts skye laughed delighted then sat and allowed daisy to put the finishing touches to her hair the ladies of the english court were currently frizzing their hair but skye would have none of that her own glorious tresses had been coaxed into a chignon at the nape of her neck the chignon was decorated with red silk flowers her hair was parted in the center and two small curls lately named lovelocks dangled on either side of her face skye stood up satisfied and pirouetted before her husband well milord there is nothing i can say that you dont already know my pet she smiled he asked what of me madam am i not wormy of notice mischievously she eyed him as boldly as any gallant would eye a lady of his fancy and the earls mouth twitched with amusement at her mimickry she circled him slowly looking him up and down critically and men said youve got the bestturned leg of any man at court my lord and the emeraldgreen velvet compliments those superb eyes of yours the ladies will be hard put tonight to remember youre minebut they had better he bowed elegantly acknowledging the compliment laughing arm in arm they descended the stairs to the great ballroom of lynmouth house the first carriages were beginning to arrive and skye and geoffrey stood regally at the top of the main staircase greeting their guests the ballroom filled quickly even the queen arrived early escorted by the handsome lord dudley among others we intend staying late my dear skye announced elizabeth you and southwood give the best party of the year it was to avoid disappointing your majesty that we returned to londontemporarily said geoffrey skye is not quite over your godsons birth this twill not tax you too badly my dear questioned elizabeth anxiously no madam the sight alone of your dear face strengthens me replied skye the queens eyes twinkled what a perfect courtier you are my dear skye certainly a fit mate for southwood the earl bowed at the compliment and offered his hand to elizabeth as the first dance began lord dudley partnered skye she did not really like the queens favorite a fact of which he was quite well aware unfortunately her very aloofness excited robert dudley he was a man who loved danger and the thought of seducing this beautiful woman beneath the very noses of both elizabeth and the ladys husband was deliciously tempting robert dudleys view of himself was such that it simply didnt occur to him that he the most popular man at court could be sincerely rebuffed he blandly assumed that skye was being coy though there was nothing of the coy maiden in skyes personality if he had known her well dudley would have realized this as he partnered her his eyes feasted on the pearly luminescence of her skin then plunged deep into her decolletage what sweet round little apples she hid beneath her bodice the perusal was all done quickly for though elizabeth had thus far denied him total possession of her royal body she was a very jealous woman skye ignored the greedy eyes that made her feel almost unclean what she was unable to ignore were dudleys outright suggestive comments why do you dislike me my beauty you would be wise to cultivate my favor i do not dislike you my lord said skye looking at him evenly but dudleys smirk of triumph faded when she continued but neither do i like you then why the hell did you make me your sons godfather you were my husbands choice lied skye she was thinking though i may antagonize you my lord boorishness youll not take it out on my geoffrey you see my lord dudley i always obey my husband as a good wife should she finished demurely god how your very virtue inflames me muttered dudley i do not seek to inflame you sir but nevertheless you do madam he shot a quick glance toward elizabeth but she was well occupied catching skye off guard he led her from the dance figure and guided her into a private alcove within the ballroom before she had recovered her shock robert dudleys arms wrapped quickly about her skye was outraged and she struggled fiercely against him sir loose me at once my lord she demanded his low laughter was almost a growl no my pretty skye i shall not enough of this coyness now madam i long to taste your ripe lips and he lowered his head to kiss the tops of her heaving breasts these far sweeter fruits she tried to free her arms revolted she pulled away from him but he tightened an arm about her while his other hand grasped and held her head in a firm grip desperately she tried to turn away from the lips descending on hers but she couldnt and dudleys mouth ravaged hers wetly trying to force passion where there was none she dared not scream for the enamored queen would believe her the aggressor robert dudley of course knew this his tongue pushed past her teeth thrusting deeply with obvious meaning confident his hands were boldly lifting her skirts now and knowing she had but one chance before he coolly raped her she swiftly lifted her knee to find his vulnerable groin she was rewarded by instant release and a look of acute pain on lord dudleys surprised face without a word skye fled the alcove her cheeks burning she was fortunate that dudleys chosen rendezvous place had been secluded neither their entrance nor her embarrassed flight was observed snatching a goblet of iced wine from a passing footman she forced herself to sip slowly while the beating of her heart dropped back to normal she stopped before a mirror set her wine down and smoothed her hair and her gown with shaking hands the filthy arrogant bastard how dare dudley attack her she had done everything to discourage him but he could not be put off she couldnt appeal to the queen for elizabeth was in love with him and would brook no criticism of her precious robin i dont ever want to return to court skye thought desperately we can probably beg off in the spring and perhaps by next autumn we shallhave been replaced in the queens affections by others then we canremain in devon and raise our children in peace she grew calmer with thoughts of devon and picking up her wine discreetly joined her guests in the alcove she had so hastily vacated robert lord dudley was still doubled over retching waves of pain continued to wash over him for a few minutes but gradually he began to feel better the little bitch he thought halfangry halfintrigued he rubbed his injured member ruefully still unable to quite believe she had refused him women simply did not refuse robert she would regret this one day he would have her and he vowed she would beg him for his favors straightening his garments he left the alcove skye managed to avoid dudley the rest of the evening but geoffrey ever sensitive to her moods saw that something was wrong discreetly he led her aside what is it my love dudley just tried to rape me she said angrily what lower your voice geoffrey she placed a warning hand on his arm to restrain him he has pressed his unwanted attentions on me before but you know as well as i do that the queen would not believe it if i told her he counts on that he didnt no i jammed my knee into his groin ill be surprised if he can dance again this evening geoffrey winced automatically but could find in his heart no sympathy for dudley how would you like to leave for devon immediately after the masque my darling he asked oh yes her face lit with joy well pause just long enough to change into something warm and easy well be off with the dawn i know of a marvelous inn along the road where we may spend tomorrow night he kissed the tip of her nose like the ducks and drake better he smiled down at her would you mind if we continued to stay down in devon forsaking the court and london no it would please me greatly to remain in devon i am afraid i am a country mouse at heart my lord i hope the news does not disappoint you he enfolded her in a warm and loving embrace i find my darling wife that i have no wish to share you with anybodyexcept perhaps our children only perhaps she teased skye if the shocking truth be known i dont wish to share you with anyone including the children now let us go back to our guests before were missed at the midnight supper de grenville and the recently wed lettice knollys found the tiny crowns in their pieces of twelfth night cake and were crowned lord of misrule and his queen for the rest of the evening de grenville kept the party lively ordering naughty forfeits from the guests even poor lettice could not escape her consort of the evening dickon ordered her first to be blindfolded and then to kiss the six gentlemen whom he chose one of them is your husband walter my dear and you must tell us which poor lettice was in a terrible quandary for walter was not the most inspired of lovers blindfolded her ears became sharper and she could hear amid the giggles a great deal of scuffling pursing her pretty cherry lips she received her six kissesone a peck two hearty busses two that were wet and sloppy and one very passionate kiss that sent a hot thrill racing through her well lettice demanded de grenville of the blindfolded woman lettice pretended to consider the dilemma she was quite sure that none of them had been walter but she was desirous of knowing the identity of the man whose kiss had thrilled her so the last gentleman was walter she announced firmly i am quite sure a great burst of raucous laughter greeted this statement and when the blindfold was snatched off lettice found herself facing lord dudley ohhhh she cried blushing in pretty confusion but i was so very sure he kisses me just the way walter does none of them was walter my dear chortled de grenville really dickon lettice stamped her foot in apparent outrage and there was more goodnatured laughter robert dudley smiled to himself as he put an arm about the queen lettice knollys was an outright minx when hed kissed her shed thrust her sharp little tongue into his mouth with a delightfully practiced skill he eyed her from beneath carefully lowered eyelids and saw to his amazement that she was eying him just as intently and just as discreetly well well thought dudley a possible playmate on those nights when bess drives me to distraction and then sends me on my way unfulfilled the evening progressed growing merrier and merrier finally the queen and her intimates departed and were followed shortly thereafter by the other exhausted exhilarated and drunken guests the last of them waved out the door the earl and countess of lynmouth joined hands and ran up the staircase to their apartments where their body servants awaited them ive your night things all ready mlady smiled daisy no said skye my lord and i are but stopping to change we are off for devon have the girls pack my nightgown and toilet articles now and get me the deepblue wool traveling dress and the matching velvet cloak with the sable lining and trim but mlady protested daisy weve not packed to leave you and the others may leave tomorrow or the day after my lord and i prefer to travel quickly yes mlady in his bedchamber geoffrey was issuing similar orders the large traveling coach he instructed his majordomo my lady will want to nap along the way send a rider ahead to the queens head inn to say that we will be stopping there in late afternoon i will want their best bedroom a private dining room and accommodations for the coach and the staff at once mlord within the hour a great traveling coach the crest of the southwood family emblazoned upon its side lumbered down the strand a coachman and a footman sat upon the box a groom rode behind the coach leading two horses he was followed by six men at arms this coach would not fall prey to highway thieves another six preceded the vehicle it wasfour oclock on a cold january morning and sharp little blue stars dotted the clear dark skies above them inside the coach the two occupants sat snuggled beneath an elegant red fox rug hot bricks wrapped in flannel at their feet geoffrey southwoods arm was about his wife his other hand fondled her breasts his mouth lazily explored her lips her throat his teeth nibbled on her little earlobe do you remember what we were doing just a year ago tonight he murmured she giggled happily something very similiar if memory serves my darling but not in a jouncing coach i dont believe weve ever made love in a coach he observed thoughtfully geoffrey her voice was husky with shock he chuckled i cannot help it pet youre the most damnably tempting piece and i want to bury myself deep in you she felt herself go weak with desire he had the most wicked ability to rouse her with no more than a word she tingled with hunger for him and wondered if that was wrong in a burst of outraged virtue she exclaimed my lord this is not right indeed it isnt my darling i have made love in a coach and it is wretchedly uncomfortable as well as awkward we shall wait until we reach the queens head inn but then i promise madam to show you no mercy he ceased his teasing of her already aroused person and skye tingled with delicious anticipation of their stop at the queens head inn the coach rumbled through the earlymoming countryside winter was in strong evidence upon the quiet land brown with fallow fields and dotted by frozen puddles the bare trees stood black against the lavenderandgold dawn sky here and there smoke rose from a chimney once a barking dog dashed from a farmyard to run alongside the coach for a short while snapping at its wheels but it soon fell behind inside the rolling vehicle the earl and countess of lynmouth slept fitfully the motion of their carriage jerking them back to semiconsciousness every now and then the horses were changed after several hours giving the earls party time to relieve themselves and break their fast the innkeeper mightily impressed by the crested coach its occupants and the liveried entourage offered lord southwood and his sleepy wife a private parlor almost immediately thereafter two servants arrived their trays laden with clear hot soup ham spiced apples in honey cheese bread still steaming from the oven and sweet butter the innkeeper himself brought in two pitchers a frosted one filled with brown october ale the other with sweet apple cider the smells wafting from the trays wakened skye fully and under her husbands tolerant and amused gaze she fell to the food with gusto the soup took the chill from her bones and put color back into her cheeks she smacked her lips over a piece of hot buttered bread with thin salty slices of ham and enjoyed it so much that she ate another the second with an added embellishment of cheese sighing contentment she sat back and geoffrey chuckled sometimes i find it hard to believe youre old enough to be my wife i was hungry she said simply im having the innkeeper pack us a basket for if you remember our next stop offers no such amenities as this its only a place to change the horses is there anything you fancy hardcooked eggs and winter pears she answered promptly and when he looked at her strangely she laughed and said ruefully no geoffrey i am not breeding again yet she nuzzled his cheek saying i love you so much my lord husband i want a houseful of your sons what niall burke would have given to hear those words on the island of mallorca he felt as out of place as a chicken in a foxs den by good fortune doctor hamid had a cousin on the island who was also a doctor though spain had been swept clean of the moslem moors here on its mediterranean islands located halfway between europe and north africa the tolerance was greater due in part to centuries of intermingling and intermarriage ana overjoyed to see her mistress was brought back from retirement and along with polly took over constanzas care niall knew that his wife would not dare misbehave here on mallorca as she had in england there was no reason to separate constanza and ana he bought a small house in the hills above the city the house afforded them the greatest privacy and had little room for entertaining upon seeing his child the conde turned furiously on niall what have you done to her niall sighed and led his fatherinlaw from the bedroom out onto the patio that she is ill is of her own making francisco i tell you mis not to hurt you but so you may understand her do not withdraw your love there is a very strong chance that constanza will not recover i brought her home because she may die and despite her perfidy i want her happy what has she done constanza is a woman for whom the love of one man is simply not enough at first the conde was uncomprehending but as his soninlaws words began to penetrate he grew red then white with anger just what is it you are saying to me my lord he demanded constanza is a whore you lie to what purpose francisco ana will verify all i say i sent ana home because she could not control constanza without meaning to ana aided her constanza caused such a scandal at the english court that she was exiled from england permanently i thought of taking her home to ireland but she is badly diseased cannot bear children now and will probably die soon i might have obtained an annulment of this marriage francisco that would have embarrassed you you are after all still king phillips governor on these islands i am not surprised that the licentious english court corrupted my child look at its bastard queen the daughter of the great whorewitch england is as damned as its court as an irishman francisco id like to agree with you but i cant elizabeth of england is young but i sense greatness in her she will lead her country well her court is elegant and intelligent witty and bright and not particularly licentious francisco oh there are some who play at lewd games but when you think of carnality the french court is far ahead of any other in europe the older mans stem face crumbled whom could he blame then what am i to think niall is the fault mine where did i fail constanza you didnt francisco it will take you time as it did me to understand that the fault is not in you the fault is in constanza deep within her eating outward like a maggot inside a perfect fruit to the eye the fruit is beautiful the skin firm the color exquisite inside however is rot and decay constanza herself is probably not to blame suddenly the conde was weeping ah blessed mother my poor child my poor child francisco constanza is dying and there are no other children have you ever thought of marrying again i do not understand why you never did now if you wish your line to continue you must do it you are not an old man and there is time for you to sire sons a surprised glance met nialls it is strange that you mention that he said after constanzas mother died i was left alone by the matchmakers i suspect that was meant to give me time to grieve but shortly thereafter i withdrew from society entirely appearing only when it was necessary to my duties after you married constanza and left this island i became lonely and i began to socialize again i have recently received an offer of marriage with the orphaned granddaughter of an old friend of mine who lives here on mallorca i hesitate because the girl is only fourteen could you be happy with her francisco is the match a good oner yes i should be happy with luisa she is pretty she is pious and she has indicated she could be happy with me then for gods sake man marry her and get yourself some heirs it took constanza burke two years to die and in that time her new stepmother bore the conde two sons and became pregnant with a third neither woman could abide the other luisa much resented her stepdaughter because luisas children might have to share the condes wealth someday with constanza she refused to believe that lady burke was dying constanza believed that luisa embodied criticism of her particularly when her first halfbrother arrived not even ten months after her fathers wedding day the second was born eleven months later and when he was but three months old luisa announced that she was pregnant again her fertility is a reproach to me constanza wailed to niall she delights in being the perfect spanish wife in order to show the island that i am not she is what neither my mother nor i could bea mother of sons god how i hate her though luisa was a perfect wife for the conde she was far too smug and stuffy for so young a lady she was not the beauty her stepdaughter was but she was quite pretty with creamy gardenia skin that she zealously protected from the sun smooth blueblack hair that she wore neatly netted at the nape of her neck and dark brown eyes that would have been beautiful if there had ever been any emotion to liven them niall did his best to protect bis wife from her stepmother whether luisa was deliberately cruel or simply thoughtless niall could never be sure things finally reached a head one afternoon when luisa said somethingniall never found out what it wasand constanza stumbled from her bed shrieking get out of my house you damned fecund cow then she collapsed ana ran to her mistress while polly hustled the young condesa from the room take your hands off me girl snapped luisa attempting to break pollys hold on her arm on your way mistress or ill put a curse on your unborn brat polly squinted her eyes and twisted her mouth to give her threat serious meaning oh luisa crossed herself and wrenching free fled out the door to her carriage constanza was unconscious for several hours dr memhet was called and shook his head she will not last the night my lord your vigil is almost over the priest was called and gave the dying woman extreme unction he was a young priest and the dying womans confession left him white and shaken never before had he heard such evil from a womans lips he fell wearily to his knees hoping his prayers might help a little the conde arrived wisely leaving his wife at home and then they all sat and waited for death to claim its victim ana wept softly while telling her beads polly wiped her mistresss forehead free of icy perspiration and niall sat pensively by bis wifes bedside wondering not for the first time if it might have all been different if he had taken constanza directly home to ireland instead of exposing her to london the clock on the mantel ticked off the long minutes its little bell clanging the passing hours in a bright cheerful fashion that marked a direct contrast to the somber vigil then in that darkest and loneliest time of the night between the hours of three and four constanza opened her violet eyes and gazed about her her glance lingered lovingly on the three people she cared for the most her husband her father and ana they moved to her side instantly with great effort constanza reached out a pale hand to touch her old duennas wet cheek anas plump shoulders shook but she swallowed the grief that threatened to explode in her throat next constanza looked to the conde and smiled sweetly francisco cuidadela felt suddenly old and lonely with constanza went his last link with her mother the love of his life he felt that a part of him was dying too lastly constanza turned her head toward niall i am so sorry about all of it niall she said remember that i truly loved you i know constanzita he said soothingly it was the illness not deliberate she looked vastly relieved then as if hed lifted a weight from her then i am forgiven you are forgiven constanzita he bent down and lightly kissed her mouth she sighed deeply and was gone for a moment he stared down at her remembering the lithe and lovely girl with the exquisite golden body and hair who had offered him her innocence in a flower field what had happened gently he kissed her eyelids one final time and turning left the room behind her he could hear ana finally free to vent her grief wailing pathetically he stood in the anteroom of his wifes apartment for a moment not quite sure what to do next then quickly he came to a decision i am going to sign over constanzas mallorcan holdings to you francisco all except a small house and vineyard which i think ana deserves she should also be paid a pension of twelve gold pieces yearly we will have the lawyers arrange that polly wants to return to england i want her to have a dowery of ten gold pieces her passage and that little string of seed pearls that was constanzas i want the london town house for myself but the rest is yours please niall my daughter is not yet cold and you callously speak of dividing her possessions as the soldiers spoke at the foot of christs cross francisco i have been living in hell for two years now i will do my final duty by constanza and see to her burial but i want to go home now you will mourn in your fashion for a full year but you have a wife and two sons by your side i have no wife no sons and no time for spanish conventions i will see to the details of all arrangements today for i intend sailing home as soon as i can niall burke was true to his word constanzas body was moved to the governors palace where it lay in state for two days she had been dressed in her wedding gown and the bier was banked by white gardenias with their shiny green leaves pure wax tapers had been placed at both her head and her feet on the morning of the third day the funeral mass was sung in the palma cathedral where they had been wed constanza was buried with a minimum of fanfare on a hillside overlooking the sea and that same afternoon a ship sailed from las palmas to london lord burke and a mistress polly flanders were on it on mallorca except for the few who had known them it was as if constanza maria alcudia cuidadela and niall lord burke had never existed several weeks later after an uneventful voyage niall saw polly safely placed with a good family as a ladies maid her precious dowry with a reputable banker he longed to go south to devon to see skye but after a drinking bout with some old friends at court he knew he would probably not be welcome the southwoods he learned had not returned to court but preferred the country only once a year did they come to london after the new year in order to give their famous twelfth night masque the beautiful countess had presented her husband with a second son john michael lord lynton they were divinely happy a most perfect couple niall burke left london for the west coast of england and sailed home to ireland delighted to have his son back but anxious for his happiness the macwilliam paraded before niall every suitable available woman between the ages of twelve and twentyfive he was thoroughly rebuffed youve got to take a wife the old man argued if you wont think of yourself think of me i need another heir then you marry again twice ive wed because it was my duty and both marriages were disastrous the next time i marry it will be for love and for no other reason shouted niall youre talking like a child the macwilliam yelled back love indeed christ bear me witness ive spawned me a fool for a son no wonder skye omalley married her fine english lord go to hell old man snarled the heir to the burke fortunes and he slammed from the hall and spent himself riding his great red stallion at breakneck speed across the hills later he rested the foamflecked animal on a cliff above the sea and stood staring west across the blue waters he knew the old man was right damn him but right or wrong hed not wed again except for love niall sighed it was skye he loved he would always love her he did not believe he could take another wife to his heart and his bed not while skye lived once he had tried to fool himself and the result had been the destruction of an innocent girl poor constanza asking his forgiveness on her deathbed it was i who should have asked your forgiveness my poor constanza he said aloud then mounting the stallion he rode off to get gloriously drunk and dream futile dreams of a woman with hair like a dark night cloud and eyes the blue of the seas off the kerry coast skye was living a waking nightmare after a sunny warm march had come a cold wet april the disease had begun in the village of lynmouth the dreaded white throat sickness it struck at children in particular attacking one child skipping its brother before she could isolate the children in the castle murrough oflaherty and joan southwood were ill skye put the two children in the same room the better to tend them having had the sickness as a child she was not afraid of nursing the little ones but she would allow none of the others near them geoffrey and the rest of the children were isolated in another part of the castle daisy volunteered to help her mistress i aint never caught the white throat she said though ive nursed its victims aplenty with my ma she never caught it neither they have a natural immunity said skye to her husband whats that the moorish doctors believe that some people have a special defense against certain diseases while others survive a disease and never get it again even though exposed they call this an immunity obviously daisy and her mother are immune though they have never had white throat and you are immune just because you did have white throat he said triumphantly yes she answered that is why daisy and i will nurse murrough and joan what will you need plenty of water clean clothes and oil of camphor ill see to it my love how many have we lost in the village nine so far jesu assoil their poor souls she said it was a long and frightening procedure but fortunately neither child was stricken severely they were weak and feverish and cranky the dreaded dirty white patches appeared first on their tonsils and then spread to the rest of the throat but though they coughed constantly that was the worst of it nevertheless skye and daisy were totally exhausted and neither spared herself in the care of the children the crisis was surmounted after a period of twenty hours during which the two women spent all their time placing and replacing hot camphor cloths on their little patients throats and chests finally the fever broke the coughing eased the white patches began to fade the two women watched over the children for another day and night before they would admit they had beaten the disease at last skye and daisy allowed two of the other servants into the sickroom to take over the children needed rest and light food to rebuild their strength while their two devoted nurses needed sleep before they dropped of exhaustion daisy sought her own room and fell fully clothed across her bed skye stumbled into her chamber to find a steaming tub awaiting her i cant she said i must sleep geoffrey southwood led his wife to a chair and sat her down youll sleep better for being clean my darling and he gently undressed her drawing off her gown and petticoats slipping off her shoes and rolling down her silk stockings placing her in the tub he smiled at her sigh of bliss and gently washed her he dried her off slid a nightgown over her and carried her to their bed and tucked her in bending he dropped a kiss on her forehead sleep well my dearest she heard him say before blackness reached up to claim her skye slept for almost two days and awoke to find her world in shambles daisy had awakened first and was standing over her mistresss bed one look at daisys open country face caused skyes heart to accelerate what is it the young master little lord john white throat the earl is nursing him skye tumbled from the bed reaching for her velvet dressing gown struggling into it as she ran where are they the floor above the nursery mlady skyes first instinct was to rail at geoffrey how dare he keep johnnys illness from her why had he not awakened her then she realized he had tried to spare her for a few brief hours so she might regain some strength she sped down the corridors of the castle climbing the stairs to the wing above the nursery floor and pushed into the room no she cried geoffrey sat stunned tears running down his face the limp body of baby john in his lap he looked up his eyes mirroring such acute pain that she could not tell if her grief was for him or for the son they had just lost i did everything you did he wept helplessly he couldnt breathe skye he couldnt seem to catch his breath and i couldnt help him his eyes skye his blue eyes so like yours pleading for help and i couldnt i couldnt do anything she fell to her knees to gaze upon the body of her youngest child he had looked so like her with his fair skin sapphire eyes and dark hair he had been geoffreys favorite not robin his heir but johnny her elfin child everyones favorite who was more of ireland than of england a muffled sound in the doorway caught her attention and she raised her head to see daisy a fist stuffed in her tearstreaked face johnny had been her favorite too feeling very old she pulled herself up and taking the limp body from geoffreys lap gave the child to daisy see to it lass i must comfort my lord daisy fled from the room holding the little boy close to her chest her weeping was quite loud now skye put an arm about her husband come my love come with me she begged him he rose to his feet and stumbling along by her side allowed himself to be led downstairs to their apartments hot wine she ordered her husbands body servant and when it was brought she added herbs to it and helped him drink mistress and servant undressed their lord and got him into a silk nightshirt skye nervously noted that geoffrey was warmer than he ought to be tucking him into bed she asked do you feel all right my darling tired so very tired he muttered then too hot and he threw back the coverlet skye put her hand on his forehead it was burning his fever was spiraling quickly get me a bucket of cold water and some clean cloths she ordered will the manservant the earl coughed a sharp barking sound and fear gripped skye no she whispered dear holy mother please please no will returned with water drawn from the deepest well on the lands it was so icy that it burned skyes hands when she dipped a cloth into it the earl winced when the cloth touched his skin i must get your fever down my love she apologized but he did not hear her for he was lost in delirium in the hours that followed they kept him well wrapped in bedclothes while his forehead was bathed constantly both the sheets and the earls nightshirt were changed three times the used linen all burned to prevent the spread of infection then suddenly daisy appeared ive brought you a tray its in the anteroom holloweyed skye looked up at her servant and then glanced away distractedly i couldnt eat my lady it will not do my lord any good if you fall ill too the children need you also for they are badly frightened by their little brothers death now the earl ill and that will be hard on the little ones am frightened too skye wanted to shout but she nodded wearily glad for daisys firmness and went into the anteroom the tray had been lovingly prepared with a silver dish of small scallops broiled in sweet butter and herbs ham a little bowl of new lettuce and young scallions a bread pudding an iced cake and a carafe of wine skye ate mechanically not tasting any of it simply chewing and swallowing until the dishes were empty rising quickly she went back into the sickroom to find that the earls fever had broken he was shivering violently and daisy was piling more coverlets on his bed hot bricks commanded skye and will rushed to obey geoffrey began to cough violently and gasp for air skye forced his mouth open and peered in the earls throat was covered with dirty white patches and a grayish membrane was forming that constricted his breathing keep his jaws open said daisy to her mistress and with one quick motion the girl reached down and hooked the membrane out of geoffreys throat she threw it in the fire the earl was now able to breathe if we can keep that scum from cutting off his air then we can save him mlady if it hardens he will die she said straightforwardly no skye shook her head grimly i will not lose him together they began the tedious process of laying on hot camphor cloths several more times daisy pulled an ugly mucous membrane from her masters throat easing his breathing the hours crept by until one full day had passed and it was night again the fever came again and went again he was having more difficulty breathing as the membranes formed much more quickly now and were becoming more difficult to get out his color was pasty and his chest labored harder with each harsh breath skye could feel panic beginning to creep upward from deep within herself they could not seem to conquer the disease only to slow it down suddenly geoffrey southwood opened his limegreen eyes skye his voice was hoarse and he coughed that terrible barking cough i am here my darling she bent anxiously over him his marvelous eyes roamed slowly and lovingly over her face as if committing it to memory take care of the children skye geoffrey my love you must not say things like that her voice was edged in hysteria he smiled a gentle smile at her and reaching up touched her cheek with his elegant hand as though bestowing a benediction what a joy youve been to me my darling he whispered and then he gave a deep sigh and died the room was silent neither daisy nor the manservant dared to move geoffrey please dont frighten me so skye begged youre going to get well my love you will and well go to ireland this summer as we planned to see my family and so that ewan may formally pledge his fealty to the macwilliam she went on talking to him of family things and plans they had made finally daisy gently put an arm about skye he is dead my lady she began to sob the earl is dead and you must face it now the children must be told and the funerals for wee johnny and his father must be planned to daisys immediate relief skye burst into wild sobbing and flung herself across her husbands body not gone she wailed no no no not dead not dead her cries could be heard throughout lynmouth castle and the cry was quickly taken up by others daisy and will pulled skye from her husbands form she fought them like a madwoman but finally their combined strengths prevailed and they were able to get her to her own bed she collapsed there sobbing get the children daisy whispered to the manservant and when he had brought them daisy brutally roused her mistress from her grief my lady the children are all here with you now they need you my lady they need you now skye raised her ravaged tearswollen face to stare at the frightened group of youngsters clustered together in the bedroom doorway geoffreys three daughters from his second marriagesusan nine with her fathers haunting green eyes and the eightyearold twins gwyn and joanthese three were now orphaned her own three ewan ten murrough nine and willow six and a halflooked confused and tried to hide their fright and robin three their son was now the earl of lynmouth go away and leave me to my grief she wanted to shout at them but then she heard geoffrey say again take care of the children skye gathering herself she stood up and smoothed her rumpled gown your father is dead my children she said quietly then she lifted little robin to a table where he sat wideeyed staring at her robin you are now the earl of lynmouth to you my lord earl i pledge my fealty and she curtseyed to him then the other children were standing before robin and pledging their fealty robin was confused where is papa he lisped gone to heaven my son said skye softly like johnny his little brow was furrowed yes robin like johnny cant we go too mama susan sobbed but was quelled by a fierce look from her stepmother no robin we cant go yet one may only go when god calls and god has not called us yet skye could feel strength flowing back into her limbs geoffrey had been right the children needed her she lifted her son from the table and gathered the other children about her we must all be brave my dears she told them and kissed each in turn now go back to your rooms and pray for your father and for johnny the children dutifully filed out fetch the priest she said to daisy will she turned to the manservant i want you to ride to london with a message for her majesty wait in the anteroom while i write it the note informed the queen of geoffreys death and requested royal confirmation of robins inheritance will left immediately the priest was told to schedule the funerals for the following day the sixteenmonthold john lord lynton would be buried in the same grave as his father then skye called for a bottle of cherry brandy and drank herself to sleep an act she had cause to regret when the morning dawned clear and far too sunny for her throbbing head it was tragically ironic the april weather had turned mild overnight and there were no new cases of white throat in the castle or in the village having taken the earl the epidemic seemed to have satisfied its lust for lives chapter robert dudley the foppish earl of leicester hummed a merry tune as he traveled the road down to devon about him his escort echoed this mood the earl was on a mission for her majesty which lent great importance to this trip added to this was the fact that it was june and england was enjoying beautiful sunny weather roses of every possible hue peeped from dooryard gardens and tumbled extravagantly over rock walls in the green meadows fat young lambs gamboled amid the sweet clover every millpond had at least one family of swans elegant snowwhite parents with their gray cygnets sailing as proudly across the barely ruffled waters as treasureladen spanish galleons lord dudley was in an excellent mood unwittingly the queen had given him something he wanted very much bess could not possibly have known when she sent him off to see to the welfare of their godson the little earl of lynmouth that the childs mother concerned him far more than robin did geoffrey southwoods death had been a terrible shock to the queen and the entire court for the angel earl had been very well liked true he and his lovely irish wife had not been to court for two years but they always came up to london to give their twelfth night masque always the best party of the year only a few short months ago they had astounded everyone once more by the marvelous originality of their costumes coming to their last masque as the new world the beauteous young countess had been gowned in cloth of gold trimmed lavishly in rich dark beaver and set off by colombian emeralds while lord southwood had been equally resplendent in his clothofsilver suit trimmed in fox and sewn all over with mexican turquoise so much for earthly glories thought robert dudley wryly southwood so lively and virile in january was quite dead and buried on this glorious june day now perhaps his wife would be more amenable and if she was not there were means through which he could persuade her to be more cooperative so pleased with himself was the earl of leicester as he came in sight of lynmouth castle in early evening that he burst into a currently popular and very bawdy song much to the grinning delight of his soldiers watching his approach from the open ramparts of the castle the widowed countess of lynmouth was filled with trepidation it had taken the queen several weeks to answer skyes letter announcing geoffreys death when she did elizabeth had confirmed little robins inheritance but she had also appointed robert dudley the childs guardian skye had protested pointing out as diplomatically as possible that geoffreys will had made her the sole guardian of all their children but the queen was adamant skye had full control over the others but the little earl of lynmouth was to be under royal protection from that time on skye was most unhappy she did not trust dudley to be sure his behavior had been most circumspect since the incident of the twelfth night masque two years before but she knew he would not give up easily and in her widowed state she was unprotected and easy prey he would not hesitate to use the young ones to force her hand and so skye had quickly done what she could to protect herself and the children ewan and murrough oflaherty had been sent home to ireland along with the twins gwyneth and joan southwood over a year previously skye and geoffrey had betrothed these children to each the twins had expressed the desire to remain together and the boys were quite fond of them the four would all be safe in anne omalleys care and would marry in a few more years the twins nineyearold sister susan southwood was sent to the household of lord trevenyan in cornwall to learn the housewifely arts from his wife she would be wed to the trevenyan heir an excellent match for both young people only willow and robin remained with their mother skye had plans for the little earl but she would need the queens permission to carry them out she had therefore waited to approach elizabeth until she knew lord dudley was away from court willow could easily be removed from lynmouth in case of danger the smalls at wren court would protect her if skye had to fight robert dudley it would be on her terms not ins the children would not become weapons in his hands below her she could hear the thudding of the horses hooves as they passed over the wooden drawbridge then clattered into the castle courtyard gathering her cloak about her she left the ramparts and hurried to her own apartment to await word from her majordomo that lord dudley had arrived when the announcement came she calmly smoothed her skirts and descended to the great hall to greet her unwelcome guest as she entered the room robert dudley felt a momentary stab of compassion she had grown thinner and looked tired yet despite the changes she was still the most beautiful woman he had ever seen her black silk mourning gown was enormously becoming and the jetedged cap framed her heartshaped face in an outrageously flattering way widowhood became her thought robert dudley welcome to lynmouth my lord her voice held no warmth am i truly welcome my dear skye he inquired playfully kissing her hand the queens majesty is always welcome in this house my lord dudley and you represent the queen i trust your men have been suitably cared for by my people thank you madam yes you will wish to see the earl she said at the moment however his lordship is asleep i shall send him to you in the morning when he awakens i apologize for our being unable to entertain you lord dudley but this house is in deepest mourning you will excuse me now sir dudley felt a surge of quick anger he was being dismissed like a servant no madam i will not excuse you he snapped my lord skye looked outraged i would pray for my husband you have no right to deny me the solace of prayer would not a fleshandblood man be a better solace sweet skye her beautiful blue eyes widened you after southwood oh dudley she laughed harshly if you seek to amuse me sir you have certainly succeeded and i thank you i have not laughed once since my geoffrey died he flushed a dull red color you try my patience madam and you try mine she snapped how dare you come into my house and suggest what you suggest it was bad enough that you attacked my virtue when geoffrey was alive but to continue to assault me in my grief is despicable madam i will have you there it was blunt and open never let me remind you that i am your sons governor but not mine i can have the boy removed from here at any time and unless you cooperate i shall i shall appeal to the queen on what grounds sweet skye i have only to tell bess that you are suffering from acute melancholia brought on by southwoods death that i think your moods are bad for the children better yet the children shall remain here at lynmouth but i shall remove you to london what will you tell the queen and which one of us will she believe no she was helpless until the queen replied to her last letter and she was free of dudley she dare not take the chance of being separated from robin and willow dudley smiled knowing that she had assessed the situation intelligently and knew she had no choice you will have supper with me and afterward i will have you he crowed triumphantly i pray that you excuse me from supper what you force me to is distasteful and i find i have no appetite i will come to you for i will not take you into the bed i shared with my husband give me a few hours to compose myself he nodded very well sweet skye i will excuse you from supper i shall eat in my rooms and you will come to me at ten oclock tonight is it agreed yes my lord she turned from him and quickly left the room if it had not been for the children she would have thrown herself from the castle heights no she would have plunged a dagger into his chest and thrown his body into the sea why should she suffer because of that revolting man daisy waited for her in skyes bedroom from the look on your face id say lord dudleys not changed his tune skye had taken her tiring woman into her confidence because she believed she might need daisys aid skye explained wearily he has threatened to send me from the children unless i yield myself i must of course especially since i dont believe he knows yet that the five older children are gone when he learns of that all hell is apt to break loose around us daisy unless of course you please him hell be more amenable if he thinks hes won you over observed daisy if the queen agrees to my suggestion for robins future then the fine lord dudley will have nothing to blackmail me with at all but in the meantime youve got to warm his bed and hell not be happy if you are aloof with him how can i receive him warmly daisy i despise the man how could i take a ridiculous popinjay like that for a lover after my darling geoffrey alas madam its not a matter of what you want the earl would want you to protect little robins inheritance said the everpractical daisy lord dudley has the power now men always do not always said skye softly for the first time in several years she was experiencing her youth again in her memory safe in geoffreys love she had almost forgotten that she was the omalley of innisfana now she was trapped for robin was an english peer and she could not steal his ancient heritage in order to return to her own but there might be a way out of this if only the queen agreed to her plan for tonight however there was no escaping lord dudley she shuddered ive had the girls draw your bath my lady said daisy quietly therell be breast of capon salad and fresh strawberries with cream for your supper after your bath skye nodded absently undressing automatically she stepped into her tub the warm water was fragrant with her favorite scent roses daisy carefully pinned up her hair and skye sank deep into the water she did not think dudley meant to flaunt her before the world elizabeth tudor could not be used that way too it had been less than two years since dudley had finally received his earldom therefore he would plan to leave skye in devon taking his pleasure of her on occasional trips down to see to the welfare of his godson the queens ward he would have to be very careful lest he rouse the suspicions of the queen regarding his true motives taking the soap from a small porcelain dish she chuckled to herself realizing that her daily bathing was a habit picked up in algiers many of the english court ladies were just as shy of soap and water as their kitchen help she rose from the tub and daisy wrapped a warmed towel about her stepping from the tub skye sat down on a bench by her fire two little undermaids carefully rubbed the beads of moisture from skyes shoulders and then kneeling dried her feet skye stood up dropping her towel her slender arms raised above her head daisy armed with a thick lambs wool puff liberally dusted her mistress with rose powder muttering all the while indecent is what it is in her middle twenties five babes and she still has the figure of a young girl skye laughed though daisy was younger than she was by a good five years she was in the manner of a beloved servant maternal in her feelings toward her mistress still smiling skye took up the crystal flacon of attar of roses and daubed the scent on herself suddenly remembering yasmin and the women in the house of felicity seem to have gone backward instead of forward she thought wryly daisy held out the gown and skye slipped into it of coral silk it had wide flowing sleeves a very low scooped neckline and a full skirt that fell in graceful folds there was no waistline the gown fastened beneath the breasts molding them how geoffrey would have loved this gown she thought blinking back tears she had had it made in london last winter and had not had a chance to wear it before he died for a moment she considered tearing it off rather than wear it before robert dudley but she realized that nearly everything she touched would hold memories of geoffrey you may all leave me now skye said good night girls the door closed behind the three and she glanced toward the mantel clock an hour to go she nibbled on a bit of supper surprised to find that she had an appetite the strawberries tasted particularly good and it came to her that she hadnt really tasted food since geoffrey had died she had eaten because she had to but she might have been eating dried leaves she paced the room nervously wishing that her monthly courses were upon her so she might have refused dudley oh good god why had she not told him that it would have mattered very little he would simply have waited until she could receive him better to get it over with now she thought for a moment on the man who awaited her seeking to find something about him that would make her ordeal less terrible she could not deny that he was handsome tall and well formed his complexion fair his hair and elegant mustache a reddishginger color his eyes velvet brown but his eyes were too close together hinting of a slyness she had seen exhibited more than once and although his manners were perfect there was a marked arrogance about the man far worse was his ambition which like his love of himself was monumental she could not like him and that was all there was to it it lacked five minutes to the hour when skye wrapped a dark velvet cloak about her shoulders and left her apartment the castle was quiet everyone but the watch being asleep lord dudley had been placed in the east wing of the castle far from skyes rooms in the southwest sector she walked swiftly praying she would encounter no one who might witness her shame pausing a moment outside lord dudleys bedchamber she drew a deep breath and then before she could allow herself to flee reached out and opened the door he turned from the fireplace and grinned toothily at her outside on the castle heights the watch was just calling the hour how prompt you are my dear may i attribute it to your eagerness to be with me he chuckled walking toward her he reached out and took her cloak and let it slide to the floor by god madam he swore softly you choose your gowns with care pulling her into his arms he kissed her hard she struggled instinctively but he pinioned her tightly against his chest saying fiercely no madam therell be none of that you may play the grieving widow publicly but dont tell me that youre not really hot for a man between your legs geoffrey southwood was a man who loved a woman well and youve not had any loving in several months unless of course and he leered unpleasantly at her theres a willing stable boy about youre a bastard dudley she spat at him no stable boy he mused then youll give yourself willingly to me sweet skye drawing her to a wall mirror he stood her before it and positioning himself behind her carefully drew the coral silk down over her shoulders his fingers caressed the smooth skin and then suddenly his lips were burning into the bare flesh southwood always bragged about your skin he murmured intoxicated by the softness of her skye felt her flesh crawl under this first assault and his references to geoffrey almost made her swoon please my lord she said low so he might not hear the tremor in her voice if you have any feeling for me at all do not speak of geoffrey to me lord dudley glanced up at her curiously shrugging he drew her gown down a little more exposing her breasts his left arm held her tightly against him while his right snaked forward to cup her right breast exquisite he said with the appreciation of an experienced connoisseur just a handful but more would be wasted skye closed her eyes forcing back tears as the gown slipped lower and his hand followed it sliding over her belly then the gown was lying on the floor and she was completely naked dudleys breathing quickened and became harsh he pushed her forward over his arm and his free hand roamed her bottom but when he attempted to insert his finger within her she squirmed away from him crying no dudley chuckled pleased and undid his deepbrown dressing gown well eventually do that too my sweet skye but first things first he was now as naked as she was and she looked to his sex with fear he did not fail to notice he was not overly thick but he did have the longest manroot she had ever seen i want you to sit on the edge of the bed he commanded and when she did he continued now lie back my sweet skye yes thats it he slid his hands beneath her buttocks and drew her down toward him he spread her legs wide she knew then what he intended which did not lessen the shock when he knelt before her and put his head between her legs he fastened his mouth to her she shuddered which he misinterpreted as the beginnings of her passion to her anguish skye was remembering when geoffrey had first loved her thusly his mouth and tongue using her gently with feathery tenderly passionate touches dudley however feasted greedily on the succulent pink flesh his tongue thrusting and stabbing at her provocatively he demanded a response skye bit her lips until they bled he was rousing her and she could not help but respond the sweet flow from her body told him so with a grunt of satisfaction he rose and lifting her slightly took her there on the edge of the bed bending down he imprisoned her between his two strong arms he murmured into her ear i am now inside you my sweet skye how ready you are to receive me lovey your little honey oven burns my lance with the fiery flow of the passion you would like to deny me but cant he moved within her fiercely and she cried out in passion hating herself for her weakness triumph was written all over the face that loomed above her i want to get further inside you lovey clasp your legs about me he ordered afraid to disobey him she complied with a groan of pure pleasure he drove so deeply that she would have sworn he touched her very womb to her great surprise he was concentrating on her response rather than his own and though she hated him her body treacherously yielded itself with a chuckle of satisfaction robert dudley suddenly withdrew from her i have learned to control my body sweet skye i am not quite ready yet to yield to passion whywe have scarce begun my pet youre much too delicious an armful to devour so quickly i am now in the mood to play with you for a while he eyed her lasciviously what a pretty little girl papa has is she a good little girl he looked to her questioningly and when she looked back at him blankly he said you must play along my sweet skye you must call me papa didnt you and southwood ever play such games she shook her head and he chuckled again he sat up and pulled her onto his lap such games can be fun my pet come now and tell papa if youre his good little girl i yes come skye dont be shy with me are you papas good little girl yespapa ah ha he pounced upon her answer grinning toothily now heres a small lie sweetness no one can ever be good all the time now can they nopapa then you have lied to me my sweet naughtiness yes papa god but the man was a fool then i must punish you my wicked little girl no dudley this is ridiculous ah wouldnt be defiant with your papa i shall definitely have to punish you and quickly lord dudley turned skye over his knee and raising his hand began to spank her she shrieked and tried to wriggle free but laughing delightedly at her reaction he paddled her harder until her bottom tingled she had only been spanked once before in her entire life it had happened when her father had sent her home to learn how to be a lady instead of a sailor she had spent the week annoying her older sister peigi and peigi had finally spanked her skye had retaliated quickly by filling her sisters bed full of wriggling live crabs no one since had ever spanked her by god by god she heard him pant as she tried to escape him that saucy backside of yours begs for spanking how your little cheeks blush rosy for me my pet now he was lifting her up and quickly pushing her face down upon the bed no damn you dudley no she sobbed knowing full well what he intended but he was already on her holding her down by the neck while he pushed carefully into her in the greek fashion bastard boy lover she snarled at him but he only laughed your little rose is tightly closed to me now but in time twill stretch to receive me as eagerly as your sweet cunny does for a few moments he used her thusly and the terrible memories of her first husband and his abuses came racing back to assail her then he withdrew from her and turning her over thrust into her in proper manwoman fashion this time dudley was ready to allow his own passion full control after he had satisfied her once he took his own release skye did not think it possible to hate a human being as much as she now hated him even once sated he could not leave her be pulling her onto her side and into the curve of his arm he stroked her perfect small breasts the shapely curve of her hip the soft round of her bottom damme sweetheart you were fashioned for loving that silken skin of yours would rouse a eunuch still i would prefer a bit more fire from you oh no my lord you can force me to your bed with threats against me and my children and you can order me to perform whatever perversions please you but you can never force my emotions do you suddenly find the possession of my person not enough for you she could not disguise the triumph in her voice and she hoped it rankled him lord dudley was far too sophisticated the courtier to be easily angered by her barbs her very inaccessibility had intrigued him in the first place and her distaste still did he could force her body to yield itself but he wanted to hear her cry of surrender echoing in his ears at the moment however all he heard was defiance he pulled her beneath him again excited by that defiance whoreson she hissed bitch his mouth savaged hers as she raked her nails down his back and bit at his lip owwww dudley pulled away from her but laughed when he saw the look of battle in her eye little irish barbarian he murmured in her ear i fully intend taming you and i will youll grow old trying my lord why sweet skye you give me hope he shot back deliberately twisting her words as he jammed his knee between her soft thighs forcing them open now skye tried to claw at his eyes and robert dudley caught her hands and pulling them above her head successfully immobilized her while he once again assaulted her then sated for the moment he turned on his side and fell asleep one leg thrown carelessly over her body imprisoning her she lay rigid with fury he was not going to leave her alone her coldness intrigued him yet if she could pretend passion he would be equally intrigued dear god if only the queen would answer her letter favorably so she could get out of this the earl of leicester stayed two days and three nights at lynmouth and there was only one thing upon which he and his hostess agreed during that time that agreement centered about little lord southwood hes geoffreys son and no doubt about it said dudley admiringly by god if he were mine id burst my buttons youve bred a fine son madam are your irish sons as fine i have not yet had the opportunity to greet them they are in ireland she answered i was given to understand that they were here with you only part time she said sweetly ewan is after all the oflaherty of ballyhennessey it is necessary that he and his younger brother remain on his estates part of the year they have taken their betrothed wives with them and are at present in the safe custody of my uncle the bishop of connaught and my stepmother lady anne omalley their betrothed wives gwyneth and joan south wood geoffrey and i betrothed our children over a year ago they all adore each other is it not fortunate her beautiful face radiated innocence southwood had another daughter where is she robert dudleys voice was very carefully controlled susan susan is with lord and lady trevenyans household down in cornwall she was matched with their heir a long time ago i do believe lady trevenyan and susans mother were cousins so only your daughter and son are here youre clever my sweet skye far cleverer frankly than i had anticipated still i do hold the trump card with robin dont i he smiled i must return to court today lest my dear bess grow suspicious but i will return as soon as i can when i do i will look forward to more pleasant hours in your bed she made a face at him and he laughed as he raised her hand to his mouth and kissed her fingertips soon dudley took his leave slowly kissing her hand again smiling for the benefit of her servants she said in an undertone youre a pig my lord dudley laughed again and rode off as he had come singing free of him at last skye fled her castle and walked the cliffs above the sea the bright day and the brisk clean wind helped to lift some of her melancholy but she still felt dirtied she had almost forgotten that men like dudley existed dom oflaherty had been like dudley though lacking his refinements but dom had been dead for many years and in the love and tenderness and warmth of men like khalid and geoffrey she had almost forgotten that there were men whose sexual satisfaction was gained only by the pain and shame they inflicted the next day however skye had a happy surprise robert small had returned from his long voyage stopping at wren court only long enough to assure dame cecily of his safety he came directly to lynmouth from her favorite retreat high upon the open battlements she recognized his dearly familiar form upon his little bay gelding gathering up her skirts skye flew from the top of the castle down the winding flights of stairs out into the courtyard and onto the drawbridge robbie oh robbie youre safe and youre home she was laughing with joy sobbing with relief and overwhelmingly glad to see her small protector everything was always all right when robbie was home to look after her the gelding stopped and the little man slipped from its back to gather the beautiful woman into his arms they hugged each other in full view of the entire castle and then robert small kissed her soundly on both cheeks how is it possible that youve grown prettier my lass oh robbie your tongue is so smooth that i sometimes think youre irish he chuckled and slipped his arm through hers i find that i have an irish thirst right now will you take me into your fine house and offer me a bit of wine to clear the devon dust from my throat she laughed it was a clear and happy soundone she had not made since she had lost geoffrey and their younger son leading robbie to the great hall she sat him down and brought him the wine herself he took a deep draught and then said quietly i was sorry to learn about geoffrey and the child who told you de grenville yes he met me in bideford damn skye sorry i s hardly a good enough way to say nothing robbie were friends i know what is in your heart the queens confirmed your son as heir skye looked hard at her old friend yes but shes overridden geoffreys will and made robert dudley my sons guardian the sea captain frowned beginning to understand that trouble was in the air from your tone skye i think i am home just in time must i again rescue the poor widow i think this time i must rescue myself robbie she stood and began to pace while she explained geoffrey and i left court after robin was born and retired here to devon my uncle sent my irish sons to us and we were a happy familymy sons his daughters and our two boys then geoffrey died and johnny the queen was quick to recognize robin as geoffreys legitimate successor but she sent the earl of leicester as his guardian it is my supreme misfortune that robert dudley covets me why the damned lecher cried robbie is not bess enough woman for him the queen has most certainly not yielded her person robbie she wants him i believe but dares not compromise herself still she dotes on him and spoils him fearfully she will hear not a word against him how can i dare tell her that he has forced me and will continue to do so as long as he can use my son to control me the bastard said robert small fiercely you mean that hes already aye robbie hes already then she said grimly but i may yet outsmart lord dudley geoffrey and i had spoken of betrothing robin to de grenvilles littlest daughter alison if i can gain the queens permission to mis match then i shall ask that de grenville be made robins governor i have written to her majesty about this but it will be weeks before she replies then go up to london and obtain her permission during a personal audience what go up to london lass i will go with you i must anyway in order to report the success of our mission to the queen it is our trading company that made the voyage and what would be more natural than that we both report to elizabeth successful we were successful how successful lord bless me robbie it should have been my first thought he laughed nay love youve had other troubles but now ill make those troubles disappear not a ship lost skye not one dyou know the odds against that five men though in a bad storm in the indian ocean other than that we might have been sailing in a millpond ive never encountered such good weather the holds of all the ships are crammed to overflowing with spices ive a fortune in rare jewels and as an extra bonus mdear when we stopped to take on water at a small african port i obtained us a fine cargo of ivory if you hadnt been a rich woman before skye you are now and the queens coffers will not suffer by this either her blue eyes sparkled with delight can you be ready to leave tomorrow robbie aye lass i can give me a good hot dinner and an unbroken nights rest and ill be ready suddenly the door to the room burst open and willow ran in followed by a small blond boy uncle robbie uncle robbie she launched herself straight at him robert small caught her up his weathered face split in a wide grin willow lass can it truly be you why youre half grown he kissed her soundly on both cheeks then put her down willow flushed with pleasure then smoothed her gown i am now seven she said importantly are you indeed how proud your father would have been of you you have the look of him his air of being impressed was just what the child wanted now tell me lass who is this wee lad willow drew the boy out and said gravely may i present my brother robin sir he is the earl of lynmouth robert small made an elegant leg to the child mlord i am honored to make your acquaintance i knew your late father may god assoil him and i respected him greatly the boy looked up shyly and the little captain was struck dumb the boy was his fathers image seeing geoffrey southwood looking at him through this small boys eyes was very disconcerting may i call you uncle robbie too came the shy question indeed you may laddie robert small lifted the delighted boy up onto his shoulders willow you and robin come with me and ill show you the presents ive in my saddlebags for you skye smiled glad to see her children happy again it had been so solemn at lynmouth for so long she walked from the great hall out into the castle gardens that ran along the cliff tops at the gardens end she passed through the gates into the southwood family cemetery and made her way to geoffreys tomb she had plucked a single white rose on her way through the gardens and now she lay it on geoffreys grave robbie is back geoffrey she said and the voyage was a wonderful success im putting your percentage into robins coffers my darling and i shall go up to london myself to speak to the queen i must rid myself of dudley tis not just his lust that frightens me but his greed the man is too ambitious geoffrey oh my darling i need you so very much why did you have to leave me then she sighed deeply this simply had to stop she had gotten in the habit of coming to geoffreys grave every day and speaking to him as if he were actually there it gave her a strange comfort immediately following his death she had believed she felt his presence near her but that feeling was gone now its because you really are gone from me now isnt it my love she whispered sadly a gentle sea wind teased at her hair she felt the unbidden tears suddenly slipping down her cheeks and for the first time since his death she cried without forcing herself to stop there was no one to see or hear her and she did not need to be brave for the childrens sake it was there that robert small found her wordlessly he gathered her into his arms and offered his silent sympathy he said nothing for there was nothing he could say but his very presence familiar and loving gave her comfort as her sobs finally lessened he sought for and found a reasonably clean silken square in his doublet and offered it to her she wiped her eyes and blew her nose better he asked thank you i cried when he died but only for a moment for the children were all there and they were frightened and my wailing would have only made it worse for them there hasnt been much time for mourning since then until today she nodded i suddenly realized that he is actually gone i am really alone again robbie youll remarry one day skye not this time robbie ive buried two men whom i loved greatly and ill not go through that again then you will have to take a powerful lover mdear youve already seen that a beautiful widow is the prey of blooded rakes never i intend to rid myself of lord dudley and then return to devon to live until robin is of age he and willow are my chief concerns and robbieshould anything happen to me i have arranged that you and dame cecily be my daughters guardians i knew that would be all right with you what is it youre planning skye i can almost see the little wheels turning in your pretty head she smiled softly nothing yet robbie first i must go to london time enough afterward to decide my fate the following morning skye and robbie departed from lynmouth and headed northeast to london a messenger had ridden on ahead of them to see that lynmouth house was ready to receive its mistress and to take word to the queen that sir robert small had returned to england and sought an immediate audience with elizabeth in company with the countess of lynmouth they reached london safely several days later upon entering her house skye found to her fury that the earl of leicester waited for her your impetuousness in following me to london delights me my sweet skye he teased kissing her hand she snatched her hand from his grasp skye had a headache from riding in a closed coach on a warm day the dust from the road having necessitated the closing of the windows she glared stonily at dudley while below her robert small was hard put not to howl his laughter at the look of surprise on dudleys face when she said to him go to hell mlord pushing past him she stamped up the stairs to seek the comfort of her own apartment foolishly he followed along next to her i hadnt expected the pleasure of your company for several more weeks my sweet skye he murmured in what he believed was a seductive voice i must dance attendance on bess at whitehall until well past midnight but afterward my sweet skye he breathed skye stopped in midstep and whirled about there will be no afterward my lord dudley my head aches my monthly courses are upon me i have spent three days being bumped to bits in a coach and three nights avoiding drunks and bedbugs in noisy inns i am tired i intend going to bed alone now get the hell out of my house and she continued on her way upstairs the next sound was the mighty slamming of her chamber door openmouthed the earl of leicester could only stare after the countess of lynmouth below him robert small chuckled softly then drawled shes a bit testy from the trip my lord but then having once had a wife yourself youll understand that dudley stared at the little captain for a moment then slowly descended the stairs and said menacingly dont try to interfere captain i have already laid my claim to the lady robbie felt cold anger begin burning within him the decision is with the lady my lord remember that lest i should have to remind you of it dudley moved toward the door then turned bess and cecil will see you tomorrow morning at ten oclock think not to undermine me with the queen you cannot then after a brief bow dudley left arrogant bastard thought robbie savagely skye was right she would best be rid of him and quickly he was no fit guardian for robin and hed drive her to something rash if he continued to harass her shed not take it much longer the following morning as they were ushered into william cecils closet robbie thought he detected the light of battle in skyes bearing the black of mourning became her adding to her warriors appearance they greeted cecil and then robbie sketched out the success of his voyage to the queens chief advisor cecil nodded listening then said your report is most encouraging sir robert both her majesty and i agree that englands future prosperity lies in trade your success indicates the wisdom of that belief will it be possible to see the queen sir asked robbie i have a small token to present to her and i know that my lady southwood would speak privately with her regarding the future of her son the little earl the match with de grenvilles daughter i have advised her majesty to permit the betrothal lady southwood it is a good one and in the best interests of both families thank you my lord but there is one other thing i must speak with her majesty about my dear said cecil in a kindly fashion if you would accept a bit of advice from an old man who knows the queen welldont elizabeth tudor like her father before her is blind in both eyes when it comes to those she loves i must try sir persisted skye william cecil smiled ruefully the countess of lynmouth was a strong and stubborn woman but then so was the queen seeing these two lock horns should prove interesting if not actually explosive i will call her majesty now he said resigned elizabeth tudor entered the room a few moments later she was expecting the french ambassador that morning and was dressed in a magnificent clothofgold gown adorned with ropes of pearls she was if possible growing more regal with every passing day my dear skye she held out her hands in greeting how good it is to see you again she turned sir robert cecil tells me your voyage was successful we are very pleased it was quite profitable madam and i have brought you a small token of my crews affections for their beloved queen he lifted a beautiful cedarwood casket and held it out to her every piece there is a part share belonging to every man each man gave voluntarily and with love a piece of the fruits of his labor the queen accepted the small chest and placed it on the table she opened it slowly and her eyes widened appreciatively at the riches within there were indian ocean pearls in every shade of white cream pink gold and black she fingered flashing burmese rubies sparkling ceylon sapphires so like dear skyes marvelous eyes cold and fiery golconda diamonds there were also several silk bagsfilled with precious spicesfat nutmegs long smooth sticks of cinnamon pods of vanilla beans tiny sharp cloves and round black peppercorns the queen beamed at the captain delightedly robert small your men could not have given me a lovelier gift youll thank them for me and tell them this the queen says that as long as england has such brave sons she will be invincible now gentlemen you will leave us so that dear skye and i may visit i want to learn all about my wee godsons progress the two men bowed from the room there was a long silence after they had gone the queen spoke first cecil has persuaded me that the match you propose between little robin and alison de grenville is a suitable one we have therefore given our permission dear skye your majesty is most kind but i would beg a further boon elizabeth inclined her head since your majesty has approved this match would you not also relieve lord dudley of his guardianship of my son and appoint dickon de grenville in his place under the circumstances twould be more natural and certainly more convenient for de grenville than for my lord dudley dudley remains my choice said elizabeth firmly the tone of the queens voice irritated skye why was she interfering this way may i remind your majesty she said sharplythat my late husband made me sole guardian over our children an arrangement your majesty chose to overrule though i could never see the sense of it only in the case of my godson madam retorted the queen the child needs a mans influence in his life i have provided him with the best man in england for that influence robin has de grenville and robbie as well as his halfbrothers for male influence majesty argued skye dudley is proud to have the care of little robin southwood he has told me so himself my dear skye the queen argued back i do not wish robin to be under the influence of anyone from court madam not now he is far too young am his mother and that decision is my right no my lady southwood the queen replied icily robins fate is my decision as his queen lord dudley will remain his governor skye finally lost her fine irish temper dammit madam dont you really know why dudley wants charge of my son yes my dear skye i do said elizabeth tudor shocked the countess of lynmouth looked deeply into the queens jetblack eyes what she saw there made her shiver my god she said softly you do know oh madam how could you how could you give me to that man my husband and i were always your loyal servants is this how you reward our loyalty the queen looked angrily at skye madam you try my patience but because i value you i shall explain repeat what i tell you however and i shall deny it while you languish in the tower i shall never marry my dear skye for if i did i should be neither a queen nor a woman in my own right i have seen how men can overrule women as long as england has only a queen to rule her that shall not happen to me my halfsister mary never fully recovered from what my father did to her and to her unfortunate mother catherine of aragon their lives were ruined by my father poor mary he had cosseted and spoiled her from birth then suddenly one day all that love was withdrawn and she was torn from her own mother whom she never saw again and declared a bastard my own mother i am told was under constant pressure to produce a son when she failed her life was wantonly taken as for me i never knew where i stood with my father one day i was his darling the next day i was sent down to hatfield in disgrace i learned my dear skye i learned jane seymour was i think fortunate to die for all his fine mourning he did not care for he had what he wanteda son of my other three stepmothers anne of cleves was wise enough to give henry tudor what he wanted the mosta quick divorce poor cat howard my mothers cousin lost her head as my mother did i can still hear that tragic girls frantic cries when she realized they had come to take her to the tower she tried to reach my father and they dragged her screaming from his chapel door the queen shuddered with the memory catherine parr was fortunate enough to outlive my father and marry the man she loved i went to live with her and her new husband after my fathers death you know the lord high admiral of englandland sir thomas seymour was my stepfather he was the handsomest man ive ever seen and the greatest rogue who ever lived while my stepmother grew bigger and sicker with his child he planned my seduction he did not think catherine would survive the birthing and he sought power to thwart his older brother edward who was my little brothers guardian he might have succeeded with me for i was so innocent but kate realized his intent when she caught him kissing me in a very unfatherly fashion i was sent from her house in disgrace and when she died some weeks later of a childbed fever tom seymour tried to marry me he shortly thereafter lost his head there were those who sought to implicate me in his perfidy but i escaped them i quickly learned that women who seek power in a mans worldand make no mistake about it my dear skye this is a mans worldwomen like that have no friends among either sex i am a woman who has power i do not intend to hand it over to a man not after all i have learned and all i have suffered after my sister mary became queen she became more and more suspicious of me strangely it was a man who was responsible for saving me my brotherinlaw king philip of spain nevertheless i was sent to the tower and there i renewed my brief acquaintance with robert dudley i love him but i can never be his wife and i most certainly will not be bis mistress he is not wise enough to understand this so i flirt with him and i give him the things he wants in order to keep his hopes alive and his interest in me from straying i cannot lose him i cannot at the moment robert dudley wants you and i am pleased to give you to him for you are no threat to me you despise him and always will i suspect yet you will give yourself to him because i am your queen and i command it you can do this to me skye repeated softly i who have been your friend your loyal servant my god madam you are your fathers daughter the english lion has spawned as vicious a cub as he himself was elizabeth winced careful my dear she warned you are indeed the queen of england said skye ominously but then i am irish while geoffrey southwood lived i forgot i t but no more elizabeth tudor laughed what a firebrand you are my dear skye but we both know you are quite helpless before my royal office a quick retort sprang to her lips but she forced it back have i your majestys permission to retire she said evenly the queen held out her beautiful hand and skye kissed it briefly you have my leave to retire lady southwood go home to devon and plan my godsons betrothal to alison de grenville it will help to keep you busy and out of trouble skye backed out of the queens closet to rejoin robbie and william cecil her color was high and her temper matched her flaming cheeks she curtseyed to the chancellor and with a furious look toward robbie swept from the room it seems it is time for me to leave my lord observed robbie drily the two men shook hands and parted cecil to return to his paperwork small to escort the countess of lynmouth when he finally managed to catch up with her back to devon skye was in a rage and refused to linger in london another hour so the queen thought to hand her over to robert dudley while she played her perhaps i will perhaps i wont game the bitch skye had no intention of sitting meekly waiting for the fine lord dudley to use her as a plaything for robins sake she would appear to submit but somehow she intended being revenged on elizabeth tudor skye looked across at robbie who sat pensively smoking his pipe i want you and dame cecily to take the children for a few weeks she said i must go home to ireland it is a trip i have delayed far too long what did the queen say to you skye she said i must play the whore for her precious earl of leicester she means not to marry robbie but shell not admit it publicly she fears a mans dominance over her more than anything else she wants dudley but shell not take him to husband she has decided that i am no threat to their love as so many others might be because i dislike the man therefore as long as i satisfy his lusts elizabeth tudor stands in no danger of losing her gallant god geoffrey must be spinning in his grave to see me used thusly and by the queen its monstrous robert small was deeply shocked what will you do what can i do robbie i must submit for my sons sake and both the queen and dudley have counted on this as long as i keep her secret and yield to dudley my sons inheritance is safe and this is your final word on the matter no skye i dont believe it youve some plan that youre not telling me about robbie are you loyal to the crown of course im an englishman and i am an irishwoman robbie we irish have never been overfond of the english monarch impressed upon us while southwood lived his loyalties were mine and they might even have remained my loyalties had elizabeth tudor respected me as i once respected her but she is just like all english rulers she uses everyone around her to her own ends overlooking kindness and friendship she is a brilliant woman i have no doubt she will govern england well but after what she has done to me she is my bitterest enemy two of my children nevertheless are english and i will not confuse them by tampering with their loyalties robin is the earl of lynmouth a peer of this realm the title is old geoffrey was proud of it and rightly so robin owes his allegiance to his queen and perhaps because he will be an attractive man as his father was elizabeth will treat him well willow was born here in england and she is your heiress i cannot endanger you and dame cecily and i know that my dearest khalid would not thank me for placing his only child in a dangerous situation so for all your sakes whatever i do it will be done in secret did geoffrey ever adopt willow legally asked the captain as their coach jounced along no he meant to but we simply never got to it why because i do want to adopt her skye shes legally my heiress but twould please me greatly if she also bore my name too and i suspect it would be safer for willow to be a small ive known you since you were an innocent slip of a girl blindly in love with khalid and i recognize the light of battle when i see it in your eye he sighed youre going to make war on the crown arent you she smiled a rueful little smile i honestly dont know what im going to do yet robbie but as a loyal subject of the queen it would be better if you didnt know my plans humph sniffed the little man ill remind you that im your friend before im anything else your fine ladyship then he grew serious be careful skye bess tudor is the lions cub and can be very dangerous so i have found robbie and ill be wary i think however that i have discovered a way to get at her without her ever knowing its me let me go to ireland first and then we shall see when will you go he asked her in a few days i must first send a message to my uncle for i prefer to travel in an omalley ship and some four days later the bishop of connaught sat in his study reading his nieces letter for the second time the omalley of innisfana was finally coming home though this was to be a secret visit she wanted her flagship the seagull to meet her off the isle of lundy on midsummers eve and she wanted her uncle aboard seamus omalley was well pleased it was high time his niece remembered who she was and on midsummers eve it was he who reached over the ships rail to pull her up the final few feet to the deck her smile erased the years she leaned over the railing and called down to the little sailboat that had ferried her from the mainland ten days robbie unless its stormy god speed lass was the sure reply and the little boat turned and headed back toward the english coast skye walked directly to the main cabin in the stern she flung her cloak on a chair poured herself some wine and stood looking at the two men who were waiting for her to speak well uncle she smiled teasingly have i changed so much macguire youve gotten fat but its good to see you again mistress skye we thought surely you were dead and then his voice broke she reached out a hand to comfort him but im not dead macguire i am quite alive and i have come home now the old seaman blinked rapidly and skye turned to her uncle well mlord bishop ive never heard you so quiet in my entire life i owe you a debt uncle for your care of the omalley fortunes i can never repay that debt for its too large but i do thank you with all my heart seamus omalley found his voice at last i would not have believed it had i not seen it with my own eyes i thought once that youd reached the peak of your beauty but i was wrong youre lovelier now than ever before if thats possible and theres something else about you something i cannot put my finger on he shook his head no wonder niall burke refuses to marry again she paled slightly at the mention of his name but not enough that her uncle noticed is he widowed then she managed to sound casual the spanish girl died before he even brought her home to ireland theyre not strong those girls from warm climates he paused and looked at her craftily but for fate intervening you and niall would be long wed the match could be remade now that youre both free no i didnt come home to be mated uncle i am the countess of lynmouth and i shall remain the countess of lynmouth until my son is grown and takes a wife i am here because i would wage war on elizabeth tudor and to do so ill need my fleet what both men chorused the queen of england has insulted me unforgivably uncle but my battle with her must remain a secret one i cannot endanger my young son the earl of lynmouth or my little daughter what in hell are you going to do skye demanded seamus omalley elizabeth tudor believes that trade is the key to making england great she is right uncle it is i have seen how trade has made the east wealthy my own english vesselsmine and my partnershave already begun increasing the queens wealth but now in order to punish her i will harry the trading vessels coming into england of which the queen now receives a percentage i cannot refuse to trade for england for that would endanger robins inheritance but if my ships and others like them are pirated then trade benefits the english crown nothing i shall not be harmed for who would suspect the innocent widowed countess of lynmouth of pirating mind you i want no killing i value all who are in my employ officer and common seaman english and irish alike those of my irish ships that pirate my english ships will proceed to algiers to dispose of the cargoes i will profit but elizabeth tudor most certainly will not why this war on england niece not england uncle elizabeth tudor herself i have no quarrel with the english very well then why the war on elizabeth tudor because to hold the man she loves but will not bed or marry she would use me as her whore she easily forgets that my beloved geoffrey was her most loyal and devoted servant as am ior was she is ruthless in the pursuit of her own desires but i will not be used thusly by anyone even the queen of england i think carefully niece the bishop was greatly troubled if you are ever connected with this scheme the queen will not be merciful she cant afford to have her perfidy made public how will you protect your children i am arranging my little robins bethrothal with alison de grenville a daughter of sir richard de grenville who is safely in the queens favor its an excellent match for the girl and dickon is a good friend hell look after robins interests if anything should happen to me robert small the dearest friend i have in this world is legally adopting my daughter willow he was her fathers best friend and is childless we are business partners and before he sailed on his last trading voyage three years ago he made willow his heiress he has a fine house near bideford he and his sister adore willow and she adores them it was captain small who brought me out to meet you tonight youve thought carefully of your english children niece but what of ewan and murrough oflaherty could not english vengeance fall on them the oflaherty holdings are too small too unimportant and too isolated for the english to bother with uncle besides my irish sons are doubly related to my english son by their betrothals to robins halfsisters geoffrey southwoods daughters if robin stands in the queens favor then his halfbrothers will too seamus omalley nodded satisfied that all precautions had been taken well need a base of operations in england that cant be traced to you or the omalley family he said macguire said skye set a course for the lord of lundy isles castle its the only safe landing on the whole of the island adam de marisco is the master there hes the last of his line and i am told as much a cutthroat as anyone but de marisco makes his living giving sanctuary and selling supplies to privateers and smugglers well find a haven on lundy for our ships youve thought this all out havent you niece dubhdara would be damned proud of youbut then he always was do you intend to sail with your ships nay uncle macguire will head up these expeditions and i trust him to chose responsible young captains wholl not be recognized by others neither you nor i uncle must be involved because we are easily recognized the ships must sail without any identifying marks or flags i have already thought out a means of communication during the piracy a system that will totally confuse our victims but well discuss that later ill go change the ships course said macguire if youd like to get out of those skirts youll find all your old things in that chest across the room i stored them away myself he muttered shyly why macguire youre getting positively kindly in your old age teased skye the weathered captain eyed her boldly theyll probably be a bit tight in the britches and across the front he noted youve grown a bit im noticing he went out chuckling over having had the last word chuckling too skye opened the small sea chest there lovingly stored amid small bags of lavender were her sea clothes she lifted a silk shirt and shook it out her doublelegged skirt her long soft woolen hose her thighlength doeskin doublet with its staghorn and silver burtons her cordoba leather boots and her wide belt with its silver and topaz buckle were all there seamus omalley saw the quick tears shining in his nieces beautiful eyes ill be on deck getting some air skye perhaps youd like to take some time to change as she heard the door close behind him she began to undo the fastenings on her gown off it came and her petticoats and silk stockings and the small ribboned corset the trappings of her ladyship the countess of lynmouth lay in a heap on the cabin floor in the mirror she watched fascinated as the omalley of innisfana was reborn before her eyes macguire had only been half right and she solved the problem by leaving the top button of her shirt open in the bottom of the trunk she found her small jeweled dagger andgood lordher sword of fine toledo steel with the goldandsilverfiligreed handle she buckled it on sure that adam de marisco wouldnt be impressed simply by a wellturned leg a knock sounded on her door and her uncle reappeared were about to land skye send macguire ashore to contact lord de marisco and set up a meeting between us i will wait aboard until he is ready to see me i take it said seamus omalley that de marisco is not expecting a woman hes expecting the omalley of innisfana uncle said skye with a smile its not my fault if he doesnt know that the omalley is a female the bishop laughed let us go topside niece therell be no real dark this night as its midsummers eve well get a good look at the island i imagine its inhabitants will be celebrating the holiday with pagan fervor they left the cabin together and after seamus omalley had given macguire his instructions the two omalleys stood at the ships rail lundy got its name from the old norse word lunde which was the word for puffin a bird the island loomed above the ship great granite cliffs towering darkly into the lavender halfdusk the place had a barbaric beauty about it the island was covered in pasturage upon which herds of sheep grazed it also served as a breeding ground for sea birds at one end of the island was a lighthouse at the other stood the ramshackle ruins of de marisco castle with the only landing place on the island macguires boat bumped the quay securing his craft he quickly walked the length of the stone pier at the end of the pier a ships supply shop had been set up alongside an inn the inn was not crowded yet macguire sat down at a table a very buxom serving wench in a soiled blouse leered over him wots your pleasure capn i want to see de marisco everyone does dearie but he dont see just anyone hell see me im expected from the omalley of innisfanas ship ill go ask said the girl walking off omalley looked about him the walls of the inn were the original stone walls of the castle and they were damp with green mold the rushes on the floor had seen better days and were matted down and mixed with old bones for which several scrawny dogs now snarlingly vied the few tables were none too clean and both the fireplace and the tallow torches smoked the wench returned he says youre to follow me macguire got to his feet and hurried after the girl anything was better than this hellhole the serving wench led him up a flight of open stone steps stopping at the top to knock on the massive oak door in there capn macguire pushed through into the room and his jaw dropped in surprise the room was positively opulent the most splendid the irishman had ever seen the walls were hung with velvet and silk tapestries the stone floors covered by magnificent thick sheepskins a huge fireplace bumed with sweetscented applewood even on this midsummers eve on the long oak table were two large golden twisted candelabra burning beeswax tapers in a great thronelike chair at the tables head sprawled a giant though he was seated macguire could see that he must stand at least six foot six inches tall his hair was as black as night as was his full wellbarbered beard his eyes were a sensuous smoky blue he sported a gold earring in his left ear his doublet was of fine soft leather his white silk shirt was open revealing a thick mat of hair growing upward from his navel his hose were a darkgreen wool and his huge brown leather boots rose well over his knees in his lap sat two pretty young girls both naked from the waist up who were feeding dainties from silver platters to the lord of lundy sit down man came the booming command glynis adam de marisco dumped one of the girls from his lap serve my guest the girl goodnaturedly picked herself up off the floor rubbing her prettily rounded posterior as she did so and poured a goblet of wine for macguire macguire swallowed hard at the close proximity of the girls big breasts the nipples were as large as spanish grapes shes yours for the night chuckled de marisco and glynis cheerfully plumped herself into the irishmans lap macguire grinned delighted i like your style of hospitality by god i do mlord if the omalley doesnt sail tonight i will gladly accept your gift he raised the goblet to his host your health sir de marisco nodded ill see your master as soon as he comes ashore this will be a busy night with many celebrations would the omalley and his men like to join us macguire hid a smile ill go immediately and take the omalley your invitation macguire stood dumping poor glynis de marisco was bored tonight as the irishman left the room he wondered if the omalleys visit would herald any excitement he doubted it but several minutes later his smoky eyes widened with surprise as the captain returned with the omalley christs sacred bones he swore a woman what the hell kind of a joke is this macguire my lord this is the omalley of innisfana i dont do business with women came the flat reply afraid my lord drawled skye softly with a roar of outrage the giant stood dumping the one remaining girl from his lap she scrambled up and cowered with glynis while adam de marisco stomped over to skye and towered over her in his most intimidating manner macguire began getting a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach though he was a brave man he was old and he hadnt a chance against this giant de marisco stared fiercely down the woman instead of trembling like the other two females stared boldly up at him he began to cool down a little and realized that he liked what he saw he began to chuckle she was a brave one and beautiful as well i own she began abruptly close to two dozen ships of various sizes one of my fleets has just finished a successful threeyear voyage to the east indies im a rich woman i have a quarrel with someone in a high place to avenge myself against this person ill need assurance that lundy isle is open to my ships youll be paid well de marisco was instantly intrigued how high a place he asked elizabeth tudor came the cool reply the queen he whistled are you serious woman or merely mad he peered down at the woman who faced him by god you are serious he began to chuckle and the chuckle grew into a great roar of mirth that shook the entire room skye stood her ground unblinking well de marisco do we do business or do we not how much a crafty look narrowed his eyes name your own pricewithin reason she answered well discuss this alone omalley said de marisco macguire why dont you take glynis and her sister downstairs mlady the irishman looked to skye go along macguire id spend a full year feeling guilty if i denied you such choice company tell the men that they may come ashore for the celebrations alternate the watch so they may all have a bit of fun macguire hesitated and skye laughed oh lord man youre such an old woman de marisco give my man your word youll not harm me or well never get down to business youve got it good god captain do i look like a ravager of helpless women macguire reluctantly withdrew and de marisco motioned skye to the chair the irishman had recently vacated pouring her some wine he shoved the ornate silver goblet at her she sipped at the ruby liquid smiling appreciatively at the excellent vintage de marisco eyed her closely again and then reopened the discussion so i may name my own pricewithin reason eh that is correct i dont need money madam theres precious little to spend it on here and ive more than enough at any rate so whats within reason eh he drank a bit of wine whats your name i cant believe your intimates call you just omalley she gave him her best smile and he felt his heart lurch my name is skye for the island my mother came from there you look irish but your speech is of england and of ireland why you are certainly nosy de marisco i offered you a straight business proposition not the story of my life the smoky blue eyes narrowed i like to know with whom im doing business skye omalley her eyes flashed he continued you tell me that you wish to wage war on the queen of england before i risk my small standing id like to know why i should join your personal war she considered a moment then nodded my late husband was the earl of lynmouth you can see the lights of my castle from your own windows when geoffrey died several months ago from the white throat he left me sole guardian to our combined families my own children his children and our son who is geoffreys heir but queen elizabeth overruled his will in the case of geoffreys heir and sent her favorite robert dudley to be our sons governor the earl forced his attentions upon me and when i complained to the queen she told me quite frankly that she wanted me to accept those attentions she expects me to act as her whore in order to keep her favorite happy both my late husband and i were loyal servants to the queen while we were at court i dont deserve this shabby treatment but i cant endanger my son by doing anything openly against elizabeth de marisco sucked in his breath sharply he was an ethical man in his own way for all his business ventures were considered unorthodox well shes harry tudors brat for sure and as ruthless as both her father and that witch who spawned her anne boleyn all right skye omalley countess of lynmouth tell me what you plan and then well see if ill help you my english fleet brings great riches to england and the queen accepts a fat share of it her coffers fill daily with the profits of all ships doing business from england if my irish ships rob selected vessels including my own so that no suspicion falls on me then i hurt the queen in an area where she can least afford it but the pain will not be made public that is why i need the island of lundy de marisco it is only eleven miles off the devon coast and i can be here and back within a single day if necessary my privateers can be safe here on lundy and no one will be the wiser you wouldnt try to tell me that all the goods going through this island are legal trade now would you adam de marisco laughed pleasantly it seems skye omalley that you need me a hell of a lot more than i need you nevertheless im not adverse to a bit of piracy so ill make you a proposition you can have my aid and sanctuary on lundy for your ships in exchange for one percent of the goods you take and he paused a moment then finished quickly and if youll spend this night in my bed she went white recovering quickly she said two percent of the goods taken and not a penny more one percent and this night he repeated a mischievous smile flickering across his handsome face why she burst out because you are beautiful and a lady and i know of no other way for someone like me to possess something so fabulously rare as someone like you she seemed genuinely troubled and he continued come skye omalley if you really desire vengeance on your enemy then no price is too high its only one night sweetheart skye was torn she knew her plan was flawless but it could succeed only if she had the use of lundy she thought of elizabeth tudor calmly admitting to using her she thought of robert dudley and his perverted degrading possession of hera possession which had in all likelihood only just begun now adam de marisco wished to possess her also but he at least offered a fair return she sighed ruefully recalling robbies warning that unless she married again she would be prey to men she looked at the huge man and realized that he was not unattractive if she were lucky he was also not as debauched as dudley until midnight she bargained he shook his head the whole night and no weeping or lying limp like a dead thing dammit man im no whore to perform for you precisely skye omalley youre a beautiful and i suspect a passionate woman i want no holding back of those passions because of mistaken virtue i should be far more shocked by a lack of fire in you than an abundance of it she blushed furiously and his laughter rumbled about the room like distant thunder is it agreed then he held out his hand she hesitated then grasped the great paw with her own elegant hand she wasnt protecting any maidenhead and so much was at stake its agreed she answered him i should like to hear you say my christian name skye omalley very well adam i agree im not a bad fellow he said i wont hurt you that innocent reassurance comforted her ill have to direct my people first ill need an hour or two and id prefer it if our liaison tonight were kept secret of course he assured her i have no need to brag and then theres my uncle the bishop of connaught he travels with me adam de marisco had the good grace to look abashed and a small giggle escaped skye he grinned at her thats a nice sound skye omalley you should laugh more often well now and how do we rid ourselves of the bishop he has a partiality to good french burgundy you wouldnt happen to have any on this rock of yours ill send a small cask out to the ship at once promised the lord of the isle skye returned to the seagull along with the wine bonfires were already springing up on the hillsides of lundy in celebration of the summer solstice and her crew headed ashore to join in the festivities skye went directly to her cabin and put on her dress it was a pale wisteriacolored silk with a simple scooped neckline and long tight sleevesmost unfashionable and shed worn no farthingale beneath it but what could adam de marisco know of current fashions it was soft and feminine and when she loosened her hair and brushed it about her shoulders she knew she created a pleasing picture strangely skye wanted him to be pleased stopping by her uncles cabin she found seamus omalley already enjoying the wine the lord de marisco has been most hospitable uncle we have almost reached an agreement and i am going ashore to have supper with the gentleman will you join us she knew he would refuse nay niece i am quite comfortable here with my book on the life of saint paul and the excellent burgundy sent by our host it is really quite superior she bent and kissed his dark head good night then uncle sleep well you also skye she went ashore again this time wrapped in the anonymity of a dark cloak she arrived at adam de mariscos chambers to find the table laid with a cold supper adam took her cloak his hand lingering a moment on her shoulders when she tensed he said quietly ive never raped a woman little girl let us go easily and youll not regret your decision i promise you im not so little de marisco she retorted im tall for a woman and taller than many men he turned her about and lifted her so that she was at eye level with him my name is adam little girl and though you are tall for a woman i top you by a good foot setting her back down he asked are you hungry no then well eat later and before she realized what it was he intended he had her gown unlaced and was pulling it off her she gasped clutching at her chemise but he paid her no mind loosening her grip on the fragile silk he stripped her naked lifting her into his arms he carried her from the room into an adjoining bedchamber one arm cradled her while the other hand pulled back the bedcovers he gently tucked her into the biggest bed skye had ever seen she lay quietly watching as he pulled his own garments off clothed adam de marisco was impressive naked he was magnificent perfectly proportioned he had thighs like tree trunks shapely wellmuscled arms a lean torso and a great broad chest covered in a thick mat of dark hair his arms and legs were also liberally furred he was in fact the hairiest man shed ever seen he watched her reaction to his nudity a faintly amused smile upon his sensual lips quickly he climbed into bed with her skye braced herself for his assault and when nothing happened she turned slightly to look at him he was gazing at her and she blushed caught in his careful scrutiny he reached out and drew her close the arm that held her was strong the body against which she was pressed was warm and cleansmelling she was held quietly this way for several silent minutes then adam de marisco kissed her and to her immense surprise the kiss was a firmly tender one his mouth was fragrant lovemaking he said calmly is a great art skye omalley i spent four years of my life at the french court for my late mother was a frenchwoman i have made a rather outrageous bargain with you and youve accepted my terms for you are a rather outrageous woman we are two healthy attractive people and i cannot enjoy making love to you if you are fearful of me so little girl we will just lie here in each others arms until you are comfortable the silence was deafening for the first time in her life skye was at a complete loss de marisco adam i dont know you ive never made love to a man i didnt know to a stranger and how many men have you known skye omalley ive had three husbands she said in a small voice there was no need to explain about niall burke youve outlived them all aye no lovers none except dudley of course but then thats not my wish did you love any of them little girl the last two both very very much losing them was so painful that with both deaths i thought i would die but of course i didnt do you have children two sons by my first husband a daughter by my second and one living son by geoffrey and of course i am stepmother to geoffreys three daughters my younger son by geoffrey died in the same epidemic that killed his father her soft voice caught and adam pulled her back into his arms youve learned that love can cause pain as well as pleasure havent you let me comfort you little girl let me comfort you his mouth was closing over hers again and skye felt no resistance in herself at all his lips were warm and experienced and she felt a delicious thrill run through her as she realized that he was wooing her really seeking her favor he covered her face with little kisses then took her lips again this time parting them masterfully touching only the very tip of her tongue with his the effect was devastating and she shivered violently one hand traced gently over her jawline her slim throat a rounded shoulder moving downward to cup a small breast already firm with desire the warm mouth followed the fingers kissing tasting biting playfully she was turned her long hair pushed aside the back of her neck tenderly saluted the long line of her back lovingly traced in fire she gasped then blushed pink as her buttocks were first kissed then gently nipped his kisses branded each long leg at the rounded calves and slim ankles he sucked on her toes and skye came close to fainting so sensuous was that sensation she was turned again to lie once more on her back while his lips began an upward sweep of loving he inhaled the marvelous woman smell of her that was mixed with the scent of wild roses his tongue reveled in the pure silk of her inner thighs the moist coral flesh of her womanhood let me comfort you little girl she heard him say again and her own voice answered sobbed yes he was unbelievably gentle raising her just slightly and slowly so slowly filling her full of himself until she thought surely she would burst so big was he his great body covered her slim one as snow covers the land she was pressed deeper and deeper down into the mattress as he drove deeper and deeper into her willing flesh he became more vigorous and she reveled in his passion this was not robert dudley seeking to crush her spirit by degrading her body this big man sought to give pleasure a pleasure she had believed possible only with true love she could feel her climax rising fast and she cried out wanting him to know oh adam it is good then she was lost in a storm of passion as great as any storm she had experienced at sea and she heard him cry out triumphantly he rolled away and they lay side by side panting and then she said quietly adam de marisco i hope youll comfort me again before mis night is done and he laughed a wonderful warm rumble of mirth fear not skye omalley youll be well comforted and then he was kissing her again and it was good chapter it had been an unusually lovely summer in autumn skye looked back on the last several months with deep satisfaction half a dozen treasure ships had been taken robbing elizabeth tudors coffers of muchneeded revenue only two had been her own ships the others had been funded by wealthy courtiers including dudley and skye felt no guilt over robbing them the monies from the ships other than her own found its way into church boxes paid delinquent taxes for poor but hardworking farmers and the sick the old and the hungry were astonished when they began receiving gifts of medicine firewood food clothing and small bags of coins with winter coming however the parade of ships would be slowing down the sudden increase in piracy off the devon coast had only just begun to attract royal attention now skye would have her privateers lie low and if the royal curiosity had been piqued it would be forced to remain unsatisfied she chuckled it had all been so unbelievably easy suspecting nothing the trading ships had been like fat white ducks that had waddled by mistake into a foxs den every attack had gone smoothly amazingly there had been no loss of life in this venture for each vessel taken was captured by not one but two ships outnumbered outmanned and outgunned the trading vessels did not care to fight their cargoes were transferred quickly and quietly by silent welltrained seamen who responding to whistles and hand signals gave no hint of their nationality the privateers disappeared with their booty as quickly as they appeared the whole affair was eerily well done the small royal commission sent to investigate returned to london at a loss no one had even the slightest idea of who was behind this genteel pillage the pirates had to be english how else did they know when ships were due and the courses the ships would take since the piracy stopped as suddenly as it had begun the royal commission concluded that the incidents had been isolated and coincidental the queen was so informed skye had decided that she might avoid giving the twelfth night gala because she was in mourning accordingly she sent elizabeth tudor her regrets and went off to lundy to confer with adam de marisco over the spring pirating schedule and the signals that would be used between the two castles the giant lord of lundy had become her good friend and after that midsummers eve her occasional lover she had awakened to find herself clasped in his arms his smoky eyes studying her intently she returned the stare then added a blazing smile that made him sigh with relief then youre not angry with me he said no of course not why should i be he grinned ruefully little girl youre not just some wench in a halfdrunken moment i demanded a rather outrageous price for my aid youre a great lady skye omalley and you held to the bargain we made better than many men would hold to a bargain now however i have a problem my instinct is to imprison you in this tower and make love to you for at least a month without stopping but i cant do that can i no adam de marisco you cant she said but i thank you for the compliment id marry you oh adam what a lovely man you are but ill not marry again besides arent you wary of a woman whos buried three husbands her lovely eyes twinkled mischievously but he looked so crestfallen this great bear of a man that she soothed him ill be back adam i promise you and in fact she had come back several times throughout the summer in between their incredible sessions of lovemaking they had talked and become real friends this was a whole new experience for skye apart from the obnoxious robert dudley her lovers had been men to whom she was married excepting mat one longago night with niall she was not a promiscuous woman but the plain truth of the matter was that she needed to make love with someone she liked especially now for the earl of leicester had been to lynmouth twice more to make demands upon her robert dudley delighted in degrading her or taming her as he called it he derived intense pleasure from forcing her to total submission but though he could force the body her soul eluded him this kept dudley returning after these nightmares of lust skye invariably fled to adam de marisco his honest adoration and vigorous sexual worship of her were like a clean sea wind after the passing of a garbage scow adam did not raise her to the exquisite soulrending heights that geoffrey had but he gave her pleasure and was delighted that she cared enough to give him pleasure in return it had been a melancholy christmas and new year skye had kept to the southwood family customs decorating the great hall with pine and holly burning a yule log offering the wassail bowl to the carolers and mummers but it had not been the same without geoffrey skyes sons and twin stepdaughters remained in ireland and she hadnt seen them since the previous summer when she had made her secret visit home susan southwood preferred to remain in cornwall with the trevenyans only robin and willow were at lynmouth dame cecily had contracted a bad chill and remained at wren court skye insisted that robbie remain too so that his sister would not be alone several days into the new year skye decided to go to lundy sending to wren court for news she learned that dame cecily was up and about again they would be delighted to have the children and would return with them to lynmouth in time for twelfth night which they would all spend together skye intended asking adam de marisco to come back with her and join them in the celebration his presence might soften the pain of the memories that continued to assail her dressed in her doeskin doublet boots woolen hose and a heavy wool cloak she sailed the eleven miles to lundy alone skye now kept a small boat moored at the foot of the cliffs on which lynmouth castle was located in the first sleepless nights following geoffreys death she had wandered aimlessly about the castle and during those nocturnal wanderings had found a passage that wound down and down and down to emerge into a small wellhidden cave just above sea level she had emerged from the cave into the bright moonlit night to find herself on a comfortablesized ledge the sea lapping just a few inches below her feet the moon was full and the tide high which meant that the sea would never rise higher than this the cave wouldnt flood except possibly in an extremely severe storm looking closely along the rim of the ledge she had finally found the flight of stone steps she sought and the round barnacleencrusted heavy iron ring obviously some longdead southwood had had an interest in the sea she had come back later with robbie and they had thoroughly explored the cave finding iron torchholders rusted but still serviceable at intervals along the walls daisys fifteenyearold brother wat had been assigned to clean out the cave to keep torches always burning and to see that skyes boat was always in readiness she had never fully tested her knowledge of seamanship since her memory had returned for there had been no need or desire the first time she had again sailed in a small boat had been with robbie on that inaugural trip to meet her own irish ships and once she sailed with macguire to st brides for a reunion with her favorite sister eibhlin eibhlin had grown plump but was as tart as ever returning to innisfana skye had taken the tiller from macguire and discovered that her sailing skill was entirely intact home again at lynmouth she had taken to sailing out occasionally into the bristol channel the first time she was caught in a sudden summers afternoon squall she had felt not fear but pure exhilaration sparking her after that all doubts about her skill disappeared skye hesitated before sailing to lundy on that cold january afternoon the day was far too beautiful a real weathermaker if her sailors instincts were correct still it had been a depressing two weeks at lynmouth castle and she longed to laugh and be frivolous little girl adam greeted her delighted you must be fey my beautiful irish witch ive been thinking about you for days he enveloped her in a bear hug that left her breathless picking her up in his arms he carried her upstairs to his lair laughing she protested adam what will people think but she was glad she felt safe and warm and happy in this mans arms they undressed each other quickly and made delicious passionate love until sated they lay back amid the tumbled feather pillows warm beneath an enormous fur coverlet he reached for her hand found it and held it tenderly in his grasp i wish to heaven that you could love me skye omalley he said quietly i do adam she protested youre one of my best friends but she knew it wasnt what he wanted to hear and she felt suddenly sad realizing that she could not go on using this gentle giant to ease her own sorrows when he felt so much more deeply for her than she did for him adam de marisco i never meant to hurt you but it seems to me that i have i beg your forgiveness no little girl i started this i have been well punished for my arrogance however i am going to send you home now i can no longer just spend time with you in bed and not have all of you she understood and rising quickly dressed i came today to ask you if youd come to lynmouth for twelfth night he looked up from buttoning his shirt ill come they say lovers cant be friends but we are outside the sky was darkening fast a single clear star hung overhead and in the west the last of the sunset was a cold lemonyellow smudge on a stalegray horizon snow coming he noted i thought so too come with me now no but ill come later tonight for twill start to storm by early morning he helped her down into the boat the winds from the west little girl youll be home quickly untying the boat he threw the rope to skye ill have the cave entrance well lit adam until later she blew him a kiss and he pushed her craft away from the stone quay the breeze caught quickly at her sails and she was off the fresh winds sent the little sailboat skidding swiftly across the tops of the waves and though it was dark when she reached her mooring this was still she was sure the fastest passage shed ever made from lundy she secured the boat tightly taking a torch from inside the cave she lit the ledge beacons so adam might find his way safely then she began climbing up into the castle she thought she could hear sounds of revelry which was indeed confusing arriving at the level of her apartment she moved along the hidden interior passage until she reached the door that would admit her to her rooms flipping the hidden lock she stepped into her antechamber pulled the door shut behind her and drew the tapestry back into place she could now hear definite sounds of merrymaking below in the hall puzzled she moved toward the door that led into the public hall but the door opened suddenly and daisy flew in slamming it behind her oh mistress skye thank god youre back what is going on down there demanded skye right after you left milady lord dudley and a group of his friends arrived he was furious to learn you werent here and then he just took over ordering a feast sending into the village for some girls what maids he said they had to be maids daisy explained tearfully oh my god said skye are the girls all right daisy ill send them home immediately theyre probably frightened to death the earls of lynmouth havent allowed that sort of abuse in years trust dudley the fiend to revive such an appalling custom its too late milady the girls have already been ruined said daisy are they all right though asked skye all except little anne evans she bled quite heavily christs bones anne evans is but twelve damn damn dudley will pay for this ill raise such hell with the queen now that shell be forced to punish him this time skye slammed into her bedroom i shall have to pay a bounty to the families involved were any of the girls walking out yet four milady and something to the young men to marry them immediately damn she whirled on daisy dont stand there gawking girl get me a dress i can hardly go below like this can i the lilac velvet should do no farthingale just three petticoats im not at court she tore off her sailing clothes dudley her mind raged the slimy snake that elizabeth tudor had dropped into her private garden it was bad enough that he had power over robin and that he could use her as his occasional whore but to come into her home uninvited and with his cronies too to rape innocent village girls entrusted to her care thickfingered daisy struggled with her mistresss gown stumbling she almost spilled the contents of a jewel case at skyes feet easy my girl soothed skye plucking an amethyst necklace from the box and clasping it around her neck theyre fearfully drunk whispered daisy terrified maybe you shouldnt go downstairs my lady lord dudley is the worst of all it was he who hurt little anne evans skye put a gentle hand on daisys cheek listen to me my girl she said i know it would be easier to bolt my door and go to bed dudley would not know id returned and god knows i dread facing him but i am the countess of lynmouth lord dudley has in my absence abused my hospitality and injured my charges it is my duty to set things right i should betray the trust geoffrey left me were i to do otherwise daisy dyou understand daisy bowed her head ashamed then said ill warn the guard youre back if theres any trouble theyll come good girl skye hurried from the room and downstairs the noise from her uninvited guests grew louder with every step she took but even so the sight that met her eyes when she entered the hall brought her close to fainting dudley and his friends sprawled around the high board in shirtsleeves and hose at either end of the table were the remains of what had obviously been a very generous feast most of the unfortunate village girls were naked or almost so and imprisoned in the laps of their drunken captors but what brought skye close to hysterics was the sight of poor little anne evans naked on all fours in the center of the long table one of the big castle mastiffs had been brought to a state of sexual excitement and was just now being positioned in such a way that the child would soon be ravished by the dog sweet jesus skye heard a voice behind her exclaim and she turned to find the captain of the castle guard and his men all ranged at her back get the girls and that beast she said take the maids to the housekeeper have her attend to their injuries and put them to bed and the dog milady its not his fault send him to the kennels harry the menatarms and their captain jogged into the hall and taking the halfdrunken courtiers by surprise began removing the weeping frightened girls the mastiff was yanked off the table and anne evans her eyes blank was borne from the room robert dudley lurched to his feet shouting how dare you im here in the queens name as governor to the lord of this castle how dare you i dare dudley my men obey only me i wonder what bess tudor would think of this performance my lord rape the perversion of innocents dyou think ill be silent this time ill shout this outrage to the skies how dare you come into my house and abuse my people shelter and food i gladly offer you but nothing more you are not lord here dudley robert dudleys eyes narrowed there she stood so damned proud the irish bitch why couldnt he break her the way hed done with so many others including his late milksop wife amy he remembered the last time hed seen amy alive shed told him she had a canker in her breast and would die soon when hed asked not at all affected by the hurt in her eyes a year maybe two she answered him weeping thats not soon enough he had told her brutally i could be king were it not for you i dont care how you do it but be dead soon your life is over anyway dudley hadnt known whether she actually had the courage to kill herself but she had and shed done it in such a way as to cause an appalling scandal she had done it deliberately using her last chance to destroy his dreams of being king elizabeth once hot to wed him had backed off and hed never quite regained with her that high favor despite the fact that he was her obvious favorite yes his wife had planned her death brilliantly who would have predicted such a thing of the weak amy to his infinite frustration he could not bring bess tudor to heel but he damn well would bring this haughty irish beauty to her knees she was going to learn tonight who the master was gulping some of her excellent burgundy he lurched to his feet where the hell were you he demanded and where is my ward furiously she strode into the hall and up to the board her scornful glance taking in his rumpled appearance ignoring the leers of the other men your ward is visiting with his sister at wren court hell be back tomorrow and where were you he pressed go to hell dudley im not your business there was drunken laughter at this and the earl of leicester flushed a dull red she stood there defying him and he felt his anger double bitch he snarled leaping at her his fingers dug into her soft upper arm and she felt bruises begin to form where were you he shook her skye attempted to pull free dudley youre drunk disgustingly drunk shes a fractious filly leicester came a mocking voice you cant seem to control any of your woman can you i am not his woman shouted skye i am geoffrey southwoods widow and i ask that you all remember that youre my whore madam because if you are not then ill remove your son from your custody remember that well never dudley never never never angrily dudley pushed her until she sprawled backward upon the same spot where little anne evans had so lately been abused thats it dudley sounded the same mocking voice show the wench whos master here well all help you right men she was being dragged onto the table her skirts brutally lifted her arms and legs yanked apart nightmare faces with bulging bloodshot eyes laughing mouths tongues that licked quickly at dry lips loomed over her she was almost suffocated by the sour smell of wine at least a dozen men leered at her men who a year ago had eagerly sought the honor of an invitation to the southwoods twelfth night masque who had once paid her elegant compliments now these same men leaned over her like a pack of savage dogs she began to scream screaming ceaselessly though she doubted anyone could hear her dudleys body flattened hers and she felt him seek entry into her body skye struggled wildly twisting this way and that one foot wrenched free and she kicked out viciously the sole of her foot finding a target she managed to slip from underneath dudley but he was less drunk now and mounted her again before she could twist aside he thrust himself into her skye screamed then suddenly a huge roar of outrage echoed in the hall the painful grip on her arms and legs was loosened dudley was lifted off her in the middle of his rutting and thrown clear across the room causing the others to scatter adam de marisco helped her up do you want me to kill the bastard little girl yes she sobbed then oh god no its dudley the queens pet adam you must not just put them out all of them now the castles menatarms had returned and under de mariscos direction put the earl of leicester and his cronies out into the cold night then the lord of lundy returned to the hall where he wrapped a cloak about the shivering woman and held a cup of wine to her lips drink it little girl it will warm you she gulped from the goblet gratefully finished she said thank god you came adam oh god i wish i could kill him who will come the next time skye omalley what i said who will come the next time you were lucky tonight who will rescue you the next time you need a husband my dear youre far too beautiful to be alone and you simply cannot protect yourself now listen to meif you cant protect yourself how can you protect your children ive kept them safe so far she retorted hotly by sending them away from you skye alone and unprotected is no way for a woman to live then marry me adam he shook his head no little girl it would never do for the widowed countess of lynmouth to wed a simple island lord i know now ive neither the great name nor the power you need but you love me oh skye omalley i do love you but ive my pride too youll never love me and im oldfashioned enough to want a woman who will truly love me think little girl there must be someone who has the name and the power and with whom you might live in peace possibly even in love she shook her head but he refused to give up and when robbie and dame cecily arrived the following day they immediately agreed with adam de marisco and added their voices to his robbie was horrified that robert dudley would make so free with lynmouth castle im writing your uncle he said hes bound to come up with a good match for you no she was becoming agitated and paced the hall frantically i cannot go through the pain of loving and losing someone again robbie i cannot the giant adam de marisco looked on in amazement as captain sir robert small just a shade over five feet tall shouted at his beloved friend in a voice that would have split stone at what cost skye the queen bides her time it amuses her to please dudley knowing youre no threat to her but what if elizabeth decides to wed you to dudley or bestow you and your fortune upon some other man she wishes to honor she can do it skye and if she does therell be no premarriage agreement as there was with southwood youll lose everything you have and find yourself dependent upon your husband for pin money he could see the effect his words were having on her she looked totally panicked and he felt sorry for her but she had to see the danger she was in have your uncle make you a match you dont have to marry just anyone therell be several men to chose from and the choice is yours it wont be like when your father forced dom on you in the spring i must begin another voyage lass i would feel happier knowing i leave you safely wed besides protection you need a husband to take your mind from schemes such as last summers piracy you knew it had your fine touch lass and when jean rendered me the yearend accounts i showed no losses even for our two ships that were pirated i would hardly rob you my business partner she said indignantly he chuckled what did you do with the rest of the cargoes they were sold and the money was dispersed among the poor and the churches it was a good jest on bess tudor skye but no more you were lucky not to be caught next time you could be i want you to promise me you will not go pirating again no robbie ive not finished with the queen yet besides ive adam to protect me adam de marisco shifted uncomfortably youll have your new husband to protect you little girl he said as robbie and dame cecily nodded mutual approval skye threw up her hands in mock exasperation she understood how right they were very well then you can write to my wily uncle and ill send my own note with yours their two letters were enough to rouse seamus omalley the bishop of connaught from an attack of winter doldrums with the holidays over and lent just ahead he had been feeling depressed robert smalls letter instantly ended his dark mood mounted upon a fine bay gelding he hurried off to see the macwilliam the overlord of middle connaught was delighted to hear that skye omalley was again in need of a husband here was the answer to all his problems this was the one woman niall would marry happily and he would finally see some grandsons on the same terms as before he asked the bishop seamus omalley looked pained my lord he said my niece is a very wealthy woman now in her own right she is the widow of a belted earl an englishman was the scornful reply but a titled one rejoined the bishop smoothly she may be too old now to breed safely mused the macwilliam slyly shes at least five and twenty and at the peak of her fertility came back the quick reply the two men argued for some time the minutes strung themselves into hours finally an agreement was reached and the bishop said i want a proxy marriage now as soon as possible why demanded the macwilliam suspiciously because skye is not overly enthusiastic about marrying im afraid if we wait until after easter she may change her mind theres no time to prepare a big wedding now so if we dont wed them by proxy now well have to wait until after lent dyou really want them to wait jesus no swore the macwilliam theres been enough waiting already between those two have your priests draw up the contracts as quickly as possible so they can be taken to england and signed they dont have to go to england to be signed said seamus omalley my niece has given me permission to act for her and then he thought god forgive me for skye will have murder in her heart when she learns what ive done skye had indeed given him permission to act for her and although she hadnt spelled it out he knew that his aid was required only in the matter of seeking prospective bridegrooms skye would make the agreement all by herself still he reasoned he was the eldest omalley and there wasnt a court that wouldnt uphold his right to make a final decision three weeks later the walls of lynmouth castle echoed with the outraged shrieks of its chatelaine the servants who had never seen the beautiful countess in such a fine tearing irish temper wondered whether they should flee daisy in the very eye of the storm sent a groom at top speed to wren court to fetch robert small the little captain arrived and hurried up the stairs of the castle in the direction of the screams and breaking crockery skye stood in the center of her antechamber broken crystal and china about her her dark hair was loose and swirling and she wore only petticoats and a lowcut white blouse at the sight of robbie she burst into tears and threw herself into his arms he held her and made soothing sounds until she finally quieted still holding her he asked what is it skye lass i cant help you unless i know what is happening its all your fault robbie all yours you all had at me all of you you and adam and dame cecily all insisting i must marry to protect myself now look what youve done he thrust her from him what did we do he demanded what did you do she cried her voice beginning to rise again let me tell you what youve done that wicked devil who calls himself my uncle that saintly man of the church that you asked to help me seek a new husband that bastard has already wed me by proxy ill have it annulled ill not be wed against my will robbie didnt know whether to laugh or cry he was astounded by seamus omalleys actions and wondered why the man had acted in such haste while skye continued to pace and swear daisy caught his eye and held out a parchment to him he took it and began to read admiring as he did so the cool way in which the elder omalley had taken complete advantage of his unsuspecting niece i am glad wrote the bishop that you have come to your senses and decided to marry again to this end i have matched you with niall lord burke your wedding was celebrated by proxy on february third of this year with myself standing in to represent you you may expect lord burke to arrive in england shortly i do not have to tell you that the macwilliam is very pleased with this match as am i the letter went on for several more sentences ending with the bishops hope that the union would be fruitful the marriage contracts were enclosed and robbie was pleased to see that seamus omalley had seen that his nieces wealth remained in her hands her uncle had done an excellent job drawing a deep breath robbie said i cannot see why youre so upset skye lass you were to wed with burke several years ago and you werent distressed by the idea then i was but a girl robbie and i believed i loved him when i regained my memory niall was horrible to me what happened to separate us was not my fault yet he blamed me he accused me of all sorts of terrible things he is spoiled and i hate him i told my uncle several months ago that id not wed with lord burke if not lord burke skye then who i dont know robbie but anyone would be better the marriage is valid lass there isnt a court anywhere that would invalidate either the contracts or the proxy ceremony and there are no grounds for annulment whether you like it or not youre now lady burke go to hell robbie began to chuckle by god i never thought to see you bested but that sly old ecclesiastical fox has done it and done it well skyes blue eyes began to narrow and grow smoky with anger but robbie was so tickled by the situation that he failed to note her growing rage he prattled on at least hes chosen you a real man lord burke is similar in character to both khalid and lord southwood no indeed you cant complain skye lass and his mouth fell open with shock as the crystal decanter shattered just above his head spattering diamond shards of glass and rubyred droplets of wine down the wall this match has been made by my uncle lord burke and the macwilliam with the sole purpose of breeding another generation well without my cooperation they cant get the new generation can they she said softly ominously then she continued geoffrey has not been dead a year i cannot possibly be a proper wife to lord burke while i am still in deep mourning and then of course there is my semimourning for another year as you are certainly aware robbie propriety must be strictly observed robbie began to look worried you cant mean youre going to deny him his rights she laughed a harsh sound his rights what rights robbie felt a sinking sensation hes your husband he said weakly i didnt pick him it was all your idea and de mariscos and my uncles and the macwilliams all i asked was the right to chose for i am the one involved i am entirely capable of planning my own destiny instead i have been married off without even the courtesy of a single discussion well robbie if i must live with the consequences then so must you allincluding niall burke robbies sinking feeling deepened what had they done not just to her but to niall burke as well he did not regret his advice marriage had been the only solution but the bishop of connaught had acted highhandedly robbie suddenly realized that he knew her better even than her own family did well why not when skye had left them she was still a girl her character just beginning to form they still thought of her as a young girl those two sly old men hadnt stopped to realize that a cleric and a provincial nobleman could scarcely conceive of the kind of life skye had led in the last several years what could they know of men like khalid el bey he sighed god how much simpler it would have been if khalid had lived skye would have had a dozen of his children and grown pleasingly plump on turkish pastries then he chuckled at himself for being a fool she simply wasnt that kind of woman you cannot hold lord burke responsible for this situation though i am sure the idea of finally being wed to you has him ecstatic he of all people should have known better than to wed with me without my personal consent perhaps your uncle convinced him that he had it in actuality niall burke had been astounded when arriving home from a hunting trip he had found seamus omalley and his father sitting together getting companionably drunk behold the bridegroom cometh chuckled the bishop niall burke felt his anger rise i warned you he snarled at his father i warned you to make no matches for me the old man snickered you are being married february third my son the hell i am was the outraged reply my niece will be so disappointed the bishop cackled and the macwilliam joined in his laughter the two old men doubling up like fools niall wondered if the smoky peat whiskey they were drinking had been tainted his bewilderment caused the two to laugh harder tears running from their rheumy eyes and down the worn old faces finally the bishop wheezed my niece skye has given me her permission to arrange another marriage for her now that lord southwood is dead your father and i have decided that since you were once intended to wed you should do so now and skye is coming to ireland to wed me niall was incredulous no were celebrating the marriage by proxy on february third you are to go to england for shell not come to ireland and rob her little son the earl of his rightful inheritance whats the hurry niall was suspicious knowing these two old schemers for what they were lent my lad you know we cannot celebrate a marriage in that solemn season dyou truly want to wait till after easter to wed and bed skye after all these years very well then said niall i agree he agrees wheezed the macwilliam with helpless mirth praise be to god cackled the bishop gasping for air niall burke thought them both drunk or mad or possibly both the contracts were signed the following day and all niall could think about from that point on was that skye would soon be his how sweetly modest she still was even after all this time what an adorable creature to have her uncle arrange the match instead of making the contracts herself after all she was hardly a maiden and not likely to be shy of him his mind was so full of memories of skye that the woman he had known so unhappily in england faded and the girl he had known so long ago took her place consequently he was unprepared for the cold woman who greeted him at lynmouth castle it was but a few weeks after their marriage when the winter weather had cleared he had left the macwilliams stronghold to travel across ireland and take an omalley ship from the east coast town of cobh to bideford in bideford he repeated what he had done several years prior and hired a horse for the ride to lynmouth he came alone unheralded without an escort riding across the lowered drawbridge into the courtyard he said to the servant who ran out to greet him tell the countess that her husband has arrived the servants mouth dropped open then he turned and ran niall burke calmly stripped off his riding gloves and strode into the castle as he entered the hall skye came toward him she was dressed totally in black she was cool and elegant and very formal you should have told us you were coming my lord have my servants seen to your retainers i have none i came as soon as the weather cleared there was no time to send word ahead well have rooms readied for you my lord he looked puzzled and she explained my husband is not dead a full year my lord i am still in mourning i am your husband skye she smiled frostily my late husband she amended in a tone meant to convey how crassly he was behaving then why did you marry now skye my uncle had my permission to seek possible candidates for a marriage for me and nothing more instead he arranged this proxy marriage i did not even know of the wedding until two days ago you didnt want to marry me it is of little importance to me whom i wed though i should have preferred having a choice you see lord burke it was necessary that i take a husband she told him about dudley and her need to protect both herself and her children her words stunned him and as their import sunk in he was torn between anger pity and laughter in his eagerness to regain her he had accepted a simple explanation for a situation that he ought to have known was not simple from her icy demeanor he decided that the macwilliam would have a long wait for a grandchild oh he could shout and bluster about his marital rights but he suspected that would gain him only scorn he decided that he would play the gentleman and wait a rueful smile touched the corners of his mouth for it seemed he was forever waiting for skye omalley you do need a permanent man in your life he said and who better than me we loved one another once perhaps we will again or perhaps not she said love it has been my experience brings more bitterness than sweetness i have lost two men i loved to death i have the memory of bitter words between us and although i forgave you because geoffrey asked me to i cannot forget those words i regretted them the moment they escaped my lips you were ever impulsive niall impulsive and heedless of the havoc your actions wrought you are now my lawful husband but unless i can learn to love you again this marriage will be in name only i have never given myself to a man i disliked you liked dudley i despise robert dudley as i did dom they took yes but i never gave do you understand me and i do not make a habit of forcing unwilling women my dear wife i have no intention of doing so now do you understand me then we should get on quite well niall burke you will keep to your place and i to mine he bowed mockingly to her it shall be just as you say madam has the queen been notified yet of this match the messenger left for hampton court the same day i received word from my uncle then elizabeth should know by now that a man stands by your side at lynmouth and elizabeth did know the queen had been angry at first how dare she stormed elizabeth she has not my permission aye she does madam put in cecil lord burghley she does indeed the chancellor said smoothly you signed the papers several months ago when the bishop of connaught applied for permission for his niece to wed again i believe that lord burke was at one time betrothed to the countess of lynmouth it is an excellent match madam skye omalley is head of the omalleys of innisfana a wealthy seagoing family she will not i suspect leave england until her son can manage his own estateswhich will not be for a long time her family will never dare to rebel against the crown for fear of reprisals against her we have therefore neutralized a potentially powerful enemy the same can be said of the burkes niall burke is the only heir to the macwilliam of midconnaught he and his people dare not act against england as long has his heir is in england and he will be as long as his bride cannot leave that is why i advised you to sign the papers allowing the countess to wed again elizabeth pursed her lips leicester would be very disappointed still he had had his fun and she didnt want him becoming overly involved with skye why he might have eventually desired marriage with the lovely countess and surely dear skye could not have remained forever impervious to darling roberts charms what woman could no it was better that dear skye had married again i think it would be wise under the circumstances to transfer the guardianship of little lord southwood to his stepfather remarked william cecil yes said the queen thoughtfully but rob will be upset the child is a rich prize find him another such prize quickly so we may sever the connection immediately she turned to one of her secretaries send our felicitations to lord and lady burke along with the transfer of guardianship of the young earl of lynmouth also a purse of a hundred gold marks and a pair of silver candelabra say we will be happy to receive them at court anytime lord burghley was pleased she might be her fathers cub but she was his student he cecil had guided and taught her well and at that moment he was proud of her i think lord dudley would be pleased with the guardianship of the dacre heiress she was the posthumous only child of lord john dacre her mother died in childbirth elizabeth tudor nodded yes rob would be pleased with such a rich prize and the royal influence would be needed more in the north where border families like the dacres swung back and forth in their allegiance there was no question of the young southwoods loyalty the royal messages were dispatched along with the royal gifts skye cared nothing for the purse of gold marks or the silver candelabra but her delight in the transferral of robins guardianship to lord burke was boundless niall watched her sardonically as she exulted in her victory it seems he remarked pleasantly that i have managed to be of some use to you you must feel quite fulfilled she answered sarcastically i am more fulfilled than you are my dear how you exist with cold iced water in your veins instead of warm red blood is beyond me yes ive heard about your barmaid she answered with a nonchalance she did not feel have you he drawled and the corners of his mouth twitched in a way that infuriated her they call her the devon rose i am told is that because she is overblown or because she smells skyes face was a study in innocence niall burke burst out laughing dammit woman your tongue is knifesharp youre a hell of a lot more interesting than the maid i knew ten years ago skye yet you feel it is necessary to take and flaunt a mistress sir madam i am a man and whether we discuss it or not you do deny me of my marital rights i am willing to be patient but i am not willing to be celibate i have been in mourning for a man dead a year we have been wed two and a half months dead a year today she said her voice trembling would it were you instead of geoffrey and she ran from the room so he could not see her weeping niall swore softly he had liked geoffrey southwood but he was fast becoming sick of his ghost he had thought that she would thaw and accept their marriage sooner or later instead she had grown colder and more distant with each passing day they could not leave lynmouth until little robin was six or seven and could be sent to page in another household in the meantime he must live in geoffrey southwoods house fathering geoffrey southwoods son but not husbanding geoffrey southwoods widow who was now his wife the children had accepted him easily enough willow had said flatly youre my third father yknow the first died before i was bom and the second just last year i hope youll stay longer i shall do my best he had told her gravely robin had been delighted to have another man in the family again what shall i call you he asked what would you like to call me robin ii dont think i could call you papa its what i called my father the boys voice was tremorous i understand why dont you call me niall thats my name and ive no objections if your mother doesnt for the children it had been a settled matter but for the adults it was simply not that easy niall had taken over the management of the lynmouth estates and skye had had no objections to that she seemed always preoccupied after their argument of the afternoon niall vowed he would charm her that evening at dinner but she did not appear at table where is your mistress he asked daisy who was eating with the other upperservants down the board daisy rose from her seat and came to stand beside him she curtseyed then said i believe she may have taken the boat out my lord her boat aye my lord the boat is moored below the cliffs my little brother wat cares for my ladys boat hell be happy to show you the way sir niall finished his meal thoughtful and then waved the boy over to him did lady burke take her boat out wat wat shuffled his feet but nodded do you know where she went dont know sir but wat suspected that his lady had gone to lundy he knew her moods by now do you think shell be back tonight lad maybe maybe not my lord sometimes she stays all night but sometimes she comes back late her and the sea is friends niall smiled thank you wat id like you to show me the boat mooring now aye my lord was the obedient reply and niall hid another smile the boy was obviously loyal to skye she engendered fierce loyalties niall could see that young wat resented what he considered an intrusion into his mistresss private life so as he followed the boy niall spoke quietly to the lad did you know that ive known your mistress since she was a slip of a girl i know how good she is with boats but i worry you see wat i love her the boy said nothing but niall noted that the stiff set of his shoulders eased somewhat he trotted silently along ahead of the tall irishman until they finally reached the cave lord burkes eyebrows rose in surprise and his lips pursed softly it was a goodsized space and well lit to boot he saw the widemouthed entrance and walked out onto the ledge noting the steps to the water the iron ring niall turned to the boy you can go back wat ill stay here a bit the boy seemed in a quandary but then shrugged and headed back up the stairs it wasnt his business to tell the gentry what to do the april evening was warm and pleasant niall sat out on the ledge the cave wall at his back watching the sunset the sea was calm and dark and above him he heard the mewling cries of a nest of gull babies settling in for the night the sky now began to darken the first pale stars twinkling tentatively as if they werent quite sure it was time for them to be there niall burke sat quietly on the hard stones of the ledge soon the sky was black the stars no longer pale but diamondbright a faint wind sprang up and the air grew damp still he waited he was deeply curious where had she gone would she be back tonight here was a whole new aspect of skyes life that he hadnt known of it was growing cold and he wished he had thought to bring his cloak soon then as if he had voiced the thought aloud he heard wat saying ive brought you a cape mlord and daisy said you were to have a flask of wine niall stood stiffly and taking the furlined garment wrapped it tightly about his chilled body thank you lad he said as he uncorked the flask he drank deeply and was grateful for the warmth that hit his innards like molten rock then spread upward wat nodded and lit the ledge beacons the mistress be late tonight could be she not be back till late he ventured ill wait said niall wat disappeared back into the cave and niall could hear his steps as he mounted the stairs it was quiet again only the gentle slap of the sea against the rock of the ledge to cut the silence the star formations overhead moved slowly across the heavens and new ones took their place niall dozed waking suddenly to find the sky gray with the early dawn and skyes small boat sailing toward him slowly he rose shaking his lean frame loose and walked down the steps to take the rope she tossed casually to him fastening it to the ring he reached down and pulled her up she moved past him and he smelled the scent of tobacco on her sea clothes jealousy surged up in him and he had a difficult time controlling his voice where the hell were you he demanded her blue eyes narrowed at sea she replied shortly i waited all night did you im touched but you wasted time you might have spent rutting with your devon rose in a warm bed she was mounting the stairs and he leaped after her you werent at sea all this time he said flatly no she looked over her shoulder a mocking expression on her beautiful face not unless youve taken up smoking tobacco skye what your clothes reek of it she stopped and sniffed at her doublet youre absolutely right niall she said and continued on her way without another word astounded he stood rooted to the stairs for a few moments the bitch had a lover it was the only possible explanation what was it about him that sent his wives seeking other men nothing he decided slamming his fist into his palm he remembered women who had lain panting with passion beneath him he would not allow memories of constanzas treachery to obliterate good sense suddenly he heard the door click shut above him and he returned to the present the little bitch to hold him off in the guise of mourning for geoffrey southwood when all the while she was sailing off to join a lover how they must have laughed at him she and her lover his rage grew who was the man he mounted the stairs purposefully there would be no more waiting her little game was over and after he had settled the score with her he intended sinking her damned boat so she could not run off again this might be lynmouth castle and she might be the countess of lynmouth but she was also lady burke a fact he was about to bring home to her time had taught niall burke the value of subtlety reaching the door that led into his own apartment he entered and called to his body servant mick came running a bath ordered his master and the deep oak tub was filled with hot water niall spent a good halfhour washing including his shortcropped dark wavy hair climbing out he toweled himself vigorously while standing before the fire his body was still long and lean and had matured well he was warm and the blood raced in his veins as he thought of skye mick held out his dressing gown and he wrapped it tightly about him then he went through the door that connected their bedchambers skye too was freshly bathed as the tub before the fireplace bore evidence she sat naked at her dressing table brushing her long black hair while daisy turned back the bed startled by his entry she reached for the lacy shawl that lay on the edge of the table he snatched it away suddenly wary she sprang up daisy get out his voice barked the command daisy stay she countermanded desperately frantically daisy looked back and forth between the two caught in a terrible quandary niall took a menacing step toward the servant woman and with a shriek daisy fled slamming the door behind her niall calmly threw the bolt then leapt across the room in two strides to close and bolt the connecting door that separated their two apartments in doing so he successfully captured skye who had been trying to escape through that door he towered above her his handsome craggy face dark with rage his eyes blazed a chill silver fire colder than anything she had seen in those eyes before real fear began moving upward from her belly and she fought to hide it from him niall pinioned his wife against the door his arms making prison bars on either side of her neither of them spoke for the space of several heartbeats and he did not fail to notice the frightened pulse leaping at the base of her slender throat at long last skye managed to whisper hoarsely you have no right more than your lover he snapped his eyes fastened on her perfect small breasts their rosy peaks rigid with fear bewildered caught off guard she nearly stammered mylover i have no lover you stay out all night and come home with your clothes reeking of tobacco smoke and tell me you have no lover what then madam is your explanation and think not to tell me this is not my business youre my wife christs bones she swore silently she couldnt tell him for hed never understand how could she say you hurt me and i sailed off to lundy because i have a friend there how could she tell him that she and adam de marisco had spent the whole night just talking that the reason her clothes smelled of tobacco was that adam had recently taken up a pipe how could she explain the lord of lundy to a husband niall would never know that adam had indeed once been her lover for de marisco was no more eager to tangle with lord burke than skye was for him to know she looked up at him and was frightened by what she saw in those silver eyes i have no lover niall she repeated then youve taken up tobacco my dear yes she answered him desperately in answer he caught her chin in one hand and kissed her deeply his tongue plunging swiftly into her mouth when he released her lips he smiled cruelly youre a liar skye your mouth and breath are sweet with no hint of tobacco what else have you lied to me about for over two months youve denied me with this pretense of mourning and i great fool that i am believed you and respected your grief and all the while you were sneaking off to fuck with your lover angrily he yanked her away from the door sweeping her up in his arms he strode across the room to the big bed well now madam youll fuck with me and he dumped her down onto the feather mattress while he undid his robe she scrambled up only to be shoved back onto the bed oh no my dear what you give to him youll give to me too whoreson she snarled at him as his body crushed her flat but he only laughed infuriated she struggled against him like a madwoman his mouth came down hurtfully on hers and she clenched her teeth tightly together his hands tangled in her dark hair holding her head still she closed her eyes to blot him out but she couldnt close out his voice which crooned in her ear are you going to be my wife willingly skye or is it going to be rape maybe that sort of thing excites you eh my darling id rather youd let me love you and that you would try to love me back love you her scorn was thick you sicken me and to think that i once preferred you to dom oflaherty he wanted to hit her what had happened to them all desire left him rape was not his style to her surprise he rolled off her but when she tried to rise he held her back no madam from now on youll sleep with me but ill not give you further excuse to hate me by taking my rights by force youll have to ask me for loving my darling and you will skye you will relief made her brave never she spat he laughed and pulled her into his arms so he might caress her breasts those two pretty apples of yours have grown plumper he observed i thought you just said you wouldnt make love to me unless i asked she said trying to squirm away from him i said i wouldnt take my rights skye i never said i didnt intend to enjoy your delicious little person oh she gasped outraged thats not fair youd rather id rape you he asked in mock surprise i didnt say that then just what is it you want of me my darling she opened her mouth to speak then shut it let him tease and play his stupid games she would never yield nor would she give him the satisfaction of protest niall allowing his hands the freedom of her body roaming the marvelous skin noted the grim line of her mouth he smiled to himself she would never know how close to rape she had come his hands and his mouth wreaked a wonderful torture upon her and skye bit her lips and pressed her nails into her balled palms until the pain eased some of the unholy pleasure he forced on her when he believed he had driven her far enough he stopped abruptly and rolling over went to sleep she lay next to him her whole body trembling and silently hated him as much as she had ever loved him skye quickly discovered that niall intended being master in everything not simply in their bedchamber as soon as she was able to escape him later that same day she fled down the winding interior staircase of the castle to the boat cave she stood horrified at the place where her vessel should be moored the boat was gone wat she shouted where are you boy dont bother calling for wat my darling niall had followed her hes been given a place on a fishing boat and will no longer be serving here she whirled and her voice shook with anger wat was my servant how dared you reassign him and i suspect you know where my boat is i do where she shouted at him precisely where you left it skye puzzled she turned to look again at the empty mooring look closer he instructed she moved down the steps further and as the sun played on the calm sea her eyes caught a glimpse of something in the water and comprehension dawned slowly she backed up the stairs to the ledge rage permeating every fiber of her being she turned to face him and niall burke saw anger as hed never seen it before whoreson she hissed bastard you sank my boat how dare you how dare you and her fist lashed out to hit him a blow that caught him off guard and actually staggered him he grabbed at her successfully holding her arms and looked down into her face the hatred he saw there was as fierce as her blow had been silently he cursed his father and seamus omalley for ever believing that he and skye could be reunited aye he said through clenched teeth i sank your damned boat ill not have you running off to your lover again and possibly passing off his bastards as my sons outraged she let out a piercing shriek do you consider me so without honor then niall burke and i repeat have no lover then she wrenched out of his grasp and ran back up the stairs skye was very worried it was time for the spring parade of ships to be arriving from the indies word had come from bideford that very morning that half a dozen ships the largest grouping ever would be here within the next few days she had to get word to de marisco and her fleet which was waiting now on lundy for her instructions if she could not go to them then they must come to her when evening fell skye climbed up the west tower of the castle in the tiny topmost room that faced lundy she lit two small signal lights in stone dishes and placed them in the window one was set up high the other low across the clear calm of the sea a boy at the top of de mariscos keep looked hard rubbed his eyes and looked again then he hurried to find his master adam de marisco looked across the eleven miles of water with his spyglass one high one low the meaning was come at once i need you they had set up that signal after last winters unfortunate episode with lord dudley but why would she need him now what of her husband still skye wasnt a woman to take things overhard if the signal was there then she must need him several hours later for the winds had been light and he had been forced to tack back and forth in order to reach lynmouth castle he sailed into the cave and up to the mooring skyes boat was gone but she stood awaiting him adam thank god youve come i was afraid you wouldnt see the signal tonight she made his craft fast and he climbed out where is your boat little girl my husband sank it adam he believes i use it to go to a lover my sea clothes picked up the scent of your damned tobacco last trip over and he smelled it on me de marisco whistled softly how did you explain it he asked i didnt dammit skye you must drive the man mad well perhaps youll calm down when you are with child she laughed harshly therell be no children adam for the marriage is in name only i angered him so that hes sworn never to take me unless i askand i never shall but thats not why i called you here i received word this morning that six ships are due into bideford within the next few daysthree english two french and a dutchman sailing in convoy youve got the route theyll take yes adam her voice was excited id like to take them all dyou think macguire and his men can do it adam de marisco stroked his chin reflectively and his smoky blue eyes sparkled where would you do it off cape clear there are plenty of places to hide there by god youre a bold wench yes yes i do believe macguire and his men can pull it off good then tell him those are my instructions skye chuckled lord dudley owns a halfshare in one of those ships hell be ruined the queen will make it up to him observed adam indeed she will but it will be hard for her to do so for her own coffers are none too full right now and she will be further strapped by the loss of her share from these goods where do you want the goods sent skye i think we should hold these cargoes till midsummer the flow of ships is greater then and the furor will have died down it wouldnt be safe to dispose of the cargo now if youve no further instructions little girl ill be on my way i dont think lord burke would be too pleased to find me here to hell with him oh adam get me another boat i shall go mad penned up here i dont know skye im not sure youre wise to defy him wait a bit little girl until your anger is cooled ill return here in a fortnight if its stormy then ill come the first clear night after that she pouted slightly then said oh all right adam but why do i get the feeling youre in sympathy with him he grinned up at her from his boat because i am little girl i cannot imagine being wed to you and not loving your tempting little self i wonder whether the mans a saint or a fool she laughed and threw him his rope im not sure what he is either de marisco dont you think that its time you found out came the reply and then the lord of lundys little boat slipped out into the sea its bow pointed for home scuttling away like a crab on the morning sand she stood perplexed then shrugged men they were always trying to tell a woman what to do and they invariably stuck together still adams words haunted her what was niall burke all about she realized she didnt know looking back she saw the spoiled childwoman she had been at fifteen the black omalleys darling and she remembered how she had felt when she had first met niall burke a sudden realization that she had met the man whom she would love the rest of her life what an innocent thing shed been for she had loved two men since learning that it was possible to love more than one man but had she ever really loved niall burke or had she been sexually aroused hating poor dom so violently had helped rum her toward niall what had the skye omalley of ten years ago known of life of the world of a man and a woman it had been a shock to find herself summarily wed to him without her own consent stilland she frowned to remember instead of accepting the positive aspects of the situationshe had reverted to the child she had once been instead of acting like the woman she had become was it then so surprising that he treated her like a child after all he understood her need for freedom which was a good start he was attractive with no disgusting habits such as swilling his food or breaking wind in public he liked the children and they liked him when she thought of the type of man she might have been married to niall burke shone by comparison still he had sunk her boat and he accused her of taking a lover she sighed having failed to convince herself that niall was either a devil or an angel she returned to the great hall to find niall romping noisily with robin and willow she sat at the board quietly watching them a soft smile on her lips he was so good with her children she thought guiltily that she had given khalid and geoffrey children and was niall not entitled to children also hungry madam he sat down next to her be off you little wild beasts he called to the children kiss your mother and then find your beds skye enfolded the children in her arms gently nuzzling robins soft golden hair kissing the top of willows dark head good night mama said her little son good night robin god give you happy dreams good night mama smiled willow i like our new father dont you she said enthusiastically nialls lips twitched and his silvery eyes locked for a moment onto her sapphire ones skye flushed as his deep voice drawled lazily well mama do you like me dont be silly niall she muttered god give you sweet dreams willow now run along the children ran to hug niall and then hurried out where were you he asked quietly a sharp reply sprang to her lips but she swallowed it back i was below in the boat cave she said and the signal lights from the west tower window so he had seen them oh i must tell daisy to extinguish them she said as if to herself then she turned and uttered a small white lie the lights are a prearranged signal to my ships on lundy isle macguire is there comprehension dawned on niall macguire smoked a pipe is that where you were the other night on lundy yes why the devil didnt you tell me good lord shed been with macguire and hed acted the jealous fool a lover i didnt like your manner of asking she answered loftily knowing where his thoughts had led him but unwilling to correct his mistaken impressions dammit skye im always the fool where youre concerned forgive me my darling with this apology she felt a rush of warmth toward him she hadnt actually lied to him when she told him that macguire was on lundy it was he who had assumed mat she had spent her time with macguire her time with adam de marisco had been just as innocent but that would be far too hard to explain she wasnt sure niall would believe that she was simply friends with the lusty young giant better to leave things as they were i forgive you my lord she said sweetly standing and looking at him demurely she said shall we to bed husband then she walked slowly from the hall he lingered for a few minutes sitting on a bench before the fire drinking a small goblet of white wine she was an enigma and he only now realized that she hadnt told him why she was signaling her people on lundy or even what they were doing on the island well he thought i must learn to trust her in time shell tell me as for now it would appear that im melting the ice when he reached his own bedchamber he found mick waiting with his bath swiftly he washed toweling himself vigorously dry wrapping a robe about him then he entered skyes room two undermaids were removing skyes tub from the room that will be all daisy she wore only a shawl the door closed after the tub and three servants niall stood momentarily hesitant unsure of what he should do he feared to leap at her lest he had misread her signals turning from the fire she allowed the shawl to slide to the floor she smiled as his silvery eyes warmed and grew wide with appreciation slowly she walked toward him stopping before him to loosen the tie that held his dressing gown one hand lay flat on his chest the other slid beneath the fabric of his gown to move tantalizingly over his chest teasing at his flat nipples twining in the soft dark hair of his chest niall felt his breath catch in his throat her hand moved upward to caress his shoulder and around to his back where her nails raked delicately downward producing a shudder from him her blue eyes held his captive her mouth curved seductively in a little smile then her hands were opening his gown wide pushing it off him and she was pressing her own nude body against his her lips nibbled at his ear her hands caressed his hard buttocks and then he heard her murmur love me my lord husband skye his voice was husky he wasnt sure he could move and the ache in his groin was fierce come she took his hand and led him to her bed gently pushing him back onto the fur coverlet he felt like a child not quite willing to believe the lovely gift being offered him afraid to enjoy it lest it disappear amazed he allowed her to caress and kiss him and then she mounted him kneeling to capture his manhood and imprison it between her breasts he almost sobbed his pleasure when she took him firmly in one hand and rubbed the tip of his penis around the hard nipples of her breasts then while he was recovering she raised her body and plunged downward burying him deep within her he lay momentarily imprisoned between her silken thighs and then as if hed received a signal he grasped her buttocks and with a swift move turned her over so she lay beneath him its better the stallion mount the mare than the mare the stallion he said and then he was kissing her passionately her mind began to whirl once so long ago that it seemed more a dream than a part of her life he had taken her innocence and now just when she thought she would never do it she had given herself to him again it was as glorious as she remembered and she could not understand why she had denied him for so long i love you skye he said when the storm was over and he held her close perhaps someday i will regain your love again but i thank you for now i will not deny you again niall as for the other we must begin anew you and i what was between us so long ago is unimportant compared with what may be between us now you must accept in your heart that i have deeply loved two other men you readily accept the fruits of these unions why not the fact of them i have accepted that when you believed me dead you turned to poor constanza now these others who invaded our lives for such a short but sweet time are gone you and i are left alone together we will go on from here and god willing i will love you again it was enough more in fact than he had dared hope for holding her firmly he fell asleep content for a while longer skye lay awake in his gentle clasp she had made her peace with him and she was glad the other castle inhabitants soon realized that their countess and her new husband had made their peace it was going to be a beautiful summer when the queen sent a summons requesting the burkes presence at court niall sent back a charmingly worded message begging her majesty to allow them the summer to honeymoon in private the queen in love with love returned her royal consent may arrived its festive first day a perfect warm breezeless one the fruit trees were heavy with blossoms and the lilacs full and sweet a maypole was set up on the village green and to everybodys delight a troupe of morris dancers arrived with their musicians everyone from the castle and the village saw the afternoon performance a raised dais was set up on the edge of the green and little robert the fourandahalfyearold earl of lynmouth presided over the festivities under the guidance of his mother and stepfather in attendance were dame cecily and willow small robbie had indeed formally adopted willow besides making her his heiress robert small had left on a long sea voyage and his sister had been feeling sad and alone the twelve dancers were dressed in greens reds yellows blues and purples their costumes covered with gaily tinkling brass bells and silk ribbons of white silver and gold there were five musicians two with reed pipes two with tabors and one with a bagpipe the dancers split into groups of three and began to caper about in rhythm with the music it was wonderful entertainment and the eyes of the child earl and his sister were huge with delight skyes two children were happier now than they had been since the tragic deaths of geoffrey southwood and baby john the sporadic visits of robins erstwhile guardian lord dudley had frightened them both although not old enough to understand what was happening between their mother and the arrogant nobleman they had sensed that something was very wrong and were frightened for both skye and themselves now however everything was very happy with skye and niall occasionally giggling like naughty children and spending a great deal of time in their bedchamber neither willow nor robin understood why their parents needed sleep so much the sixship convoy that skye had been expecting arrived on schedule and was neatly pirated off cape clear by the omalley ships the convoys arrival in bideford with their holds picked clean was the talk of the countryside skye was hard put not to shout her triumph she had known of the successful venture before word arrived from bideford a green beacon shining its light from de mariscos keep on lundy had told her satisfied with her first success of the spring skye melted back into her husbands arms and temporarily forgot the world chapter elizabeth tudor was fresh from the russet hair curled about the sides of her face and clung to the nape of her neck her black velvet riding habit was wet and stuck to her shoulder blades in dark patches her eyes were sharp and her cheeks flushed as she listened to cecils report the convoy he said was attacked off cape clear three of the ships were english two french and one dutch they were stripped completely both the french and spanish ambassadors have registered strong complaints with me why demanded elizabeth has it been proven that these pirates are english no madam it has not they fly no flags whatsoever and their men are commanded by a series of hand and whistle signals however one of the french captains said that the lines of the marauding vessels are english and the three english captains agree gods foot swore the queen that englishmen could attack the french and the spanishdutch i fully comprehend but that they could pirate their own countrymen is despicable tell me cecil are these the same pirates who robbed us last summer it would appear so majesty i want them caught said the queen flatly of course my dear lady said the chancellor smiling i have taken the liberty of formulating a modest plan which i now present for your approval king philip of spain your late sisters husband has married the french princess isabelle de valois he now presses the suit of his hapsburg nephew charles as a possible bridegroom for you to this end a spanish treasure ship is coming from the new world and will be offered to you in the name of the archduke charles we will use this ship as bait the supposed merchant vessels that accompany your treasure ship will actually be our own warships in disguise thinking to snatch an easy prize these bold privateers will find themselves caught in our net the spanish have already agreed to this plan and will send one of their ships along with ours to meet the treasure ship and explain the plan to its captain how will the pirates know about the treasure ship cecil word will be spread about on the london waterfront in plymouth and in bideford that should be enough do it then commanded the queen i want these pirates stopped and then she departed the chancellors closet leaving her chief advisor atone cecil sat down heavily his nimble mind mulling over a thought he had decided not to voice to his mistress quite yet the lines of the ships might be english but cecil doubted that their crews were the attack off cape clear had given him the idea for cape clear was in ireland he would wager his personal fortune that the pirates were irish this line of thought had led him to another he suspected that they were disposing of their stolen cargoes through lundy island which was notorious for that kind of business and lundy was but eleven miles by water from lynmouth castle the mistress of mat castle was the irishborn heiress of a great seafaring family to boot the lady had a grievance against the queen cecil might never have suspected the woman except for the memory of her face when she left the queen many months ago a beautiful face an angry face a proud faceas proud as elizabeth tudor herself cecil sighed the one thing hed never been able to teach the queen was not to use the people about her so ruthlessly in that respect she was like her father henry tudor he could not prove it yet but he suspected that the lovely countess of lynmouth was cleverly revenging herself on the queen by attacking one of her most important revenue sources cecil smiled to himself the lady was a very worthy opponent but the whole business ought not to have happened in the first place had the queen remembered the loyal service of both the late earl and his wife instead of sacrificing everything to her love for dudley none of this would have happened cecil did not like robert dudley the man was a bad influence on elizabeth her one terrible weakness she had come frighteningly close to marrying him and cecil still shivered at the memory recalling the painful scene he had had with elizabeth right after amy dudleys death elizabeth tudor had been denied many things in her life but she had salved her pride by reminding herself that one day one day she would be queen of england and when she was no one would ever deny her anything again but insignificant little amy rosart had caused a scandal and her death had cost elizabeth the only man she wanted for that a grateful cecil prayed daily for amys soul unfortunately the queen would not let dudley go keeping his foolish hopes alive by indulging him outrageously was the means through which she held on to him the lovely skye southwood had been part of that indulgence and now the queen was paying for her unnecessary cruelty privately cecil sympathized what elizabeth had done to her had been outrageous nevertheless he could not allow the lady to rebel against royal authority even discreetly it could set a dangerous precedent if it ever became public knowledge cecil intended keeping the affair a private one several weeks later skye paid a regular visit to bideford to inspect her warehouses and learned of the queens treasure ship hurrying back to lynmouth she set the signal lights ablaze in the west tower and then fidgeted several hours waiting for de marisco niall was off visiting the furthermost part of the estates and was not expected back that night matt wats younger brother had taken over the care of skyes new boat and the responsibility of the cave he ran upstairs to tell his mistress that the lord of lundy awaited below skye hurried down the interior staircase to greet adam a small pang of remembrance touching her as he swept her up and kissed her soundly on both cheeks little girl you obviously took my advice for youre blooming i did indeed adam and thank you now please put me down im dizzy with the height he regretfully complied why the signal skye news marvelous news de marisco in an effort to impress the queen and turn her thoughts favorably toward the archduke charles spanish philip has sent our bess a treasure ship from the new world its filled with inca gold mexican silver and emeralds from the amazon mines im going to take that ship im going to pluck it from the sea and pick it clean no skye youre not something is wrong here i sense it where did you learn of this ship the entire town of bideford buzzes with the news adam at that he looked even more concerned as does plymouth mdear my men brought me word of this ship over a week ago it is obvious that someone wishes to attract our attention i suspect a trap but if we took their ship anyway and escaped with besss gold in spite of their trap mused skye it is too dangerous protested de marisco to begin with we have no idea if this ship actually carries treasure or not they say it travels in convoy with four other merchant vessels that in itself rouses my suspicions why is such a valuable ship unguarded traveling only with merchant ships perhaps so as not to arouse suspicion then why broadcast the fact of its coming no skye this stinks this is a trap dont risk yourself your men or your ships but if the vessel is genuine adam all that gold to be able to take all that gold from the queen little girl dont let desires for vengeance overrule common sense the tudors are merciless when dealing with their adversaries youve been lucky so far ignore this thats the wise thing to do let us investigate the rumor further adam if we cannot prove the truth of it then i will let it go but if the treasure proves to be a real treasure ship then i must take it adam de marisco shook his head even if youre not caught theres no safe way for us to dispose of such a prize she flashed a quick smile we can dispose of it through algiers after we melt all the gold and silver down and have it formed into new bars i will want to take some of the emeralds for myself for a necklace and earrings it will give me great pleasure to wear them beneath the queens nose secretly knowing where they came from how will you find out more about the ship de grenville is stopping here in a day or two on his way home to cornwall hell know when he has gone ill signal you to come does lord burke know of your activities no she answered him in a low voice the burkes the omalleys the oflahertys the southwoods the smalls there are five families involved in your schemes little girl bring ruin on yourself and youll bring ruin on them all think carefully before you tilt with the tudors one more time right now there is nothing to involve you with any of our past piracies but one more venture is all mats needed to bring destruction to you and all those others let it go skye forget the queen please diamondbright tears glittered in the sapphire eyes forget her voice trembled oh de marisco do you have any idea what it is like to be a woman to be forced to give yourself against your will how do you imagine i felt when dudley pushed himself into me every time he touched me i felt fouled beyond belief but i bore it because i had no other choice a woman rarely does elizabeth tudor did that to me adam another woman did that she handed me over to dudley without a thought for me or for my dead geoffrey or for our loyal service to her i was a thing to be used by the queen and her favorite no adam i cannot forget all right skye he sighed for how could he argue but this will be the last time i dont relish seeing your pretty head on the blockor mine either just this last time de marisco adam de marisco returned to lundy deeply troubled what had begun as a lark was deadly serious now and he was afraid skyes lust for vengeance was overriding all good sense and he was worried why hadnt he seen this coming and put a stop to it before she became obsessed two days later de grenville arrived at lynmouth from london he was full of amusing gossip and chatter about the court skye possessed herself of great patience not wanting to give herself away at last with dickon and niall relaxed and well in their cups she asked casually what is this i hear of a treasure ship for the queen from king philip bideford is full of rumors aye smiled de grenville drunkenly he hopes to push the suit of his nephew charles by showing bess how nice it is to have rich relatives then the ship is real dickon oh yes isnt the queen afraid that she may lose her ship to the pirates who have been raiding off the coastal waters here and near ireland thats why im here de grenville chuckled craftily gonna take four warships out to meet the santa maria madre de cristos and escort her into bideford skye giggled no pirates would attack a merchant vessel surrounded by four warships even i know that she reached for the pitcher and leaning across him sloshed more wine into his goblet her movement offered him a fine view of her breasts and she noted with amusement that his breathing quickened niall appeared to have fallen asleep his dark head lying upon his crossed arms my ships gonna be disdisguised skye gonna look like plain old trading vessels as helpless as the real one just five little ships all ready to be plucked he hiccoughed then swilled more wine spilling some of it on his doublet sudden comprehension shot through skye are you telling me dickon that the santa maria madre de cristas has sailed alone across the atlantic without escort he nodded king philip felt it was safer that way no one would believe that one lone unprotected ship carried such treasure after the ship put to sea william cecil thought to catch the pirates by sending my ships out disguised pirates attack little helpless convoy only this isnt helpless good ol cecil always the crafty one why dickon how clever thank heavens the queen is acting at last to rid us of these pirates robbie and i lost two ships to them last summer she said indignantly where will you meet the treasure ship three days out off cape clear then they sailed the southern star route she gently probed um he nodded when will you meet the spanish dickon a week from today he muttered then slipped forward to fall asleep on the table near the snoring lord burke skye smiled satisfied and signaled to daisy who had remained quietly in her place below the salt during the evening you lit the tower beacons skye whispered just before dusk mlady lord de marisco is already waiting below daisy whispered back have these two carried to bed daisy and have my bath ready ill not be long she hurried from the hall and using an entry door at the end of the room hurried down the interior staircase to the cave adam she called as she reached the bottom and he stepped from the shadows well little girl what news the ship is real its the santa maria madre de cristos and for the next week it travels alone and unescorted she burst out what what of its escort there are none in a weeks time de grenville and four of the queens warships disguised as merchant ships will join the spaniard three days off of cape clear until then the santa maria is unprotected whats her course de marisco asked tensely southern star its too good he began to pace de grenville simply told you all that adam was incredulous his smoky blue eyes darkening i got him drunk she explained dickon never could hold his wine he always says what he shouldnt when hes drunk she was remembering mat longago evening when a drunken de grenville had told her of the bet hed made with geoffrey are you sure he was drunk very sure adam she chuckled when he looked at her strangely she said an old debt dickon owed me has been settled by tonights information where is he now dickon i gave orders to have the footmen carry both him and niall to bed your husband was drunk yes it was strange she mused ive never seen niall unable to hold his wine i hope hes not sickening more likely hes tired hes been out riding the estate for two days do we go skye he asked we go adam ive a feeling call it a hard irish hunch but if macguire and his men leave lundy at once they can intercept the spanish ship and be safely home before de grenville and his men rendezvous with her and its cargo where do we store that impossible cargo little girl not lundy adam if the queens men suspect us theyll be all over your island and losing you your head would be a poor way of repaying your friendship not here or innisfana either where then mshturk island the location of my sisters convent st brides there are caves there that i discovered years ago when iuh spent some time visiting eibhlin macguire knows the caves and the english will never think of looking there in time well smelt the gold and silver down they can be easily disposed of in algiers once theyre formed into bars this is the last time little girl he said quietly but firmly i know adam ill miss you skye omalley we neednt stop being friends adam simply because well no longer be doing business little girl for such a smart woman you are sometimes a bit of a fool it hurts me to see you and i know i can never have you so when this business is done ill not see you again lundy will be closed to you skye omalley oh adam she said softly looking up sadly into his face i never meant to hurt you i know that little girl it was always friendship for you but for me it was more youre like a star my darling bright and beautiful and unobtainable i am only a simple island chieftain skye omalley not a starcatcher but oh how i wanted to say to hell with common sense and keep you for myself her face was wet and her blue eyes overflowed hot tears he gently traced a tear down her cheek dont ever stop being my friend adam she whispered never little girl he answered and then his arms closed about her and his mouth came down on hers he kissed her gently yet passionately and then quickly stepped back i never did get to kiss the bride farewell little girl ill get word to you when the operation is completed then he was gone out onto the ledge down the steps through the haze of tears she saw his boat draw away heading out into the channel bound for lundy strong arms turned her then and she wept softly against the familiar velvetcovered chest i dont suppose youd care to explain to me why youre meeting in this cave with that giant of a man asked niall quietly skye cried harder and he continued i hope im not going to have to challenge him to a duel to protect my honor nnno she sobbed who is he skye aadam de marisco the lord of llundy island go on love she managed to bring her sobs under control and sniffing noisily sought for her handkerchief he handed her his and she wiped her eyes and blew her nose should i be jealous he asked she began to wonder how long hed been standing in the shadows on the stairs blushing she peeped up at him from beneath the thick fringe of black lashes you werent exactly fighting off his advances niall noted humorously but every time i leap to conclusions about you i find myself standing hipdeep in the wrong so if there is a reasonable explanation for your meeting secretly in a cave at night with an attractive man who seems to enjoy kissing you i would enjoy hearing it skye sneezed then sneezed twice again niall shook his head and picking her up started up the stairs youll tell me after youre tucked warmly in bed he said he carried her into her bedchamber i believe your mistress has caught a chill he told daisy ive a hot tub ready my lord she replied ill take care of her no daisy i will youre dismissed for the night lass skyes servant hesitated then shrugged and obeyed she would never she decided understand the gentry she sometimes wondered if they understood themselves skye kicked her shoes off and stood quietly as her husband unlaced her i thought you were drunk she said he smiled i thought you might you were doing such a fine job of picking de grenvilles brain that i didnt think you needed me he got the gown unfastened and drew it off her then he undid her petticoat and underblouse and pulled them off too kneeling he took her garters off and unrolled her stockings when she was naked he picked her up and deposited her in the hot tub she sighed deeply and closed her eyes i know he said that cave can be damnably damp and cold she murmured agreement and came close to purring when he began soaping her back nialls mouth turned up again in a small smile less than half an hour ago he had stood in the shadows on the cave stairs and watched a strange man make love to his wife a month ago he might have acted rashly now however he knew better she loved him he knew it even if she wasnt willing to admit it yet he rinsed her back off with the sponge and moved on to the more interesting portions of her anatomy he felt his desire mounting but pushed his hunger down first he wanted to hear her explanation lifting her from the tub he wrapped her in a large towel and placed her on the settle by the fireplace he took a smaller towel and rubbed her dry ignoring the paleblue silken gown daisy had laid out he tucked skye between the down feather bed and fox coverlet he undressed and washed himself lightly then dried off and climbed into bed beside her turning to look at her he said quietly now madam adam de marisco is my friend she said adam de marisco is in love with you he returned bluntly but i was never in love with him she said it was he who insisted i marry again and he has fussed at me ever since to make peace with you i believe he sees your side of things better even than mine she frowned im relieved to know that the lord of lundy is on my side murmured niall wryly but that still does not tell me why the two of you were meeting in secret she sighed it began long before we were wed niall after geoffreys death when lord dudley forced himself upon me i complained to the queen in effect elizabeth gave me to dudley as a toy for his pleasure i will never forgive her for that for all she is queen of england in fact her authority ought to mean a greater sense of responsibility i wanted revenge on her and i still do the privateers who have been harrying this coast since last summer are mine my omalley ships and crews adam de marisco allowed us sanctuary on lundy and helped us to dispose of the cargoes his price for this aid niall managed a percentage of the profits niall she said sharply then continued in a few days we will take the santa maria madre de cristos king philips treasure ship meant for elizabeth she will never see so much as one gold piece niall was so stunned that for several minutes he could not speak at all various emotions rose and ebbed within him like a tide amazement and admiration at her daring anger that she should endanger them all in her quest for revenge sorrow that he had not been there to protect her from dudley he didnt know whether to kiss her or kill her you cant beat me she said anticipating him i am with child good god woman he burst out and she began to cry then niall started to laugh youre the most impossible female god ever created skye you wage war on england and still retain all you possess did it never occur to you that you might be caught no indeed and why not he was fascinated there is nothing to connect me de marisco or the omalleys with any acts of piracy youre sure aye my ships fly no flags my people do not speak they communicate with whistles and hand signals the cargoes have been carefully disposed of and i even pirated two of my own ships last summer to keep suspicion away from me but cecil has obviously sent de grenville to capture the pirates you cant take this bait my fleet sails tonight from lundy by the time dickon and his people meet the santa maria its cargo will have been long since removed and stored safely in caves on inishturk this is my last venture against the queen niall i swear it and de marisco kissing you i trust that was a last venture as well he was saying goodbye she said softly he pulled her into his arms and brushed her lips with his when is the child due our baby will be born early next winter there will be no more adventures skye he said sternly i want your promise i must think on it she said mischievously madam your word he thundered very well my lord she lisped meekly and he looked at her suspiciously skye giggled im having a necklace and a pair of earrings made from the emeralds taken from the treasure ship i shall so enjoy flaunting them under the queens nose niall laughed again impossible he said and kissed her again less than a week later on midsummers eve skye and niall stood in the west tower of lynmouth castle and watched the celebration bonfires spring up on lundy three lined up straight in a neat row told her what she wanted to know the santa maria madre de cristos had been successfully taken and its cargo was already hidden a deep satisfaction swept over her turning to her husband she said and meant the words he had so eagerly worked to hear i love you niall with a glad cry he swept her into his arms and kissed her passionately the devon summer was sweeter that year than any summer they remembered but in london elizabeth tudor fumed with impotent rage king philips treasure ship had been boldly pirated from under de grenvilles very nose the king was both outraged at the incident and frankly scornful of elizabeths ability to keep order in her own land this piqued elizabeth more than the loss of the treasure she had borrowed heavily from the goldsmiths to finance her household anticipating the wealth of the treasure ship now she was heavily in debt and several of her creditors had already shown they were not intimidated by her royal office is there no evidence to connect lady burke with the piracy cecil surely there is something we can use william cecil had finally confided his suspicions to elizabeth madam there is nothing all the omalley ships are where they should be and there is no evidence of the treasure ships cargo anywhere we searched both innisfana and lundy i want her arrested cecil on what charges madam elizabeth whirled to face him and he saw the angry red patches on her white cheeks i am the queen cecil i do not need formal charges lady burke has offended me and i want her in the tower madam cecil was shocked this is not like you dammit cecil we know she is guilty we suspect my lady elizabeth he had not spoken to her so familiarly so gently since she had become queen we only suspect and since the santa maria madre de cristos was taken no other ships have been pirated despite the fact that this is the busiest season for shipping the queen remained adamant i want her in the tower she said perhaps if we frighten her we can force her to confess i need that gold cecil my creditors press me cecil sighed if lady burke had hated elizabeth before she would hate her far more very soon the irish were so damned emotional offending both the omalleys and the burkes could rouse all of connaught starting a conflagration that might spread through ireland we dont need a war in ireland now cecil thought wearily what of lord burke he asked he is to remain in devon said elizabeth he is forbidden to come to london or to go to ireland let him look after that shewolfs whelps the countess has many admirers madam they will not be happy to see her imprisoned unjustly and the talk could be detrimental to your majesty then do it secretly cecil send de grenville since he lost me my ship let him see if he can redeem himself by delivering the countess safely and secretly to the tower tell the governor there is to be no official record of the lady if no one knows she is in london and her husband is confined to devon then there will be no court gossip i do not approve of this madam cecil tried one more time but you will obey me nevertheless my lord returned elizabeth he nodded you are my queen and youve always learned from your mistakes i expect you will in this instance too he couldnt resist making his opinion clear the queens head shot up cecils face was impassive but was there a hint of a twinkle in his eyes the late devon summer offered promise of a bountiful harvest along the roadside late wild roses and michaelmas daisies fought a territorial war the haying had long since been done and the grain lay stacked in the fields the apple trees were heavy with fruit some early varieties ready for picking the later ones not quite ripe the apple presses would soon be busy turning out devons famous cider into this peaceful setting rode richard de grenville a troupe of the queens own at his back dickon was troubled even horrified and under orders he did not understand he had been incredulous when cecil gave him those orders i know that you like wine my lord said cecil and youve been known to be looselipped when in your cups here de grenville flushed guiltily it would be most unwise to babble this news for the queen wishes total secrecy de grenville had nodded richard de grenville and his men clattered over the drawbridge and into the courtyard of lynmouth castle he dismounted and made his way into the castle where he was informed that lord and lady burke were in the small family hall arriving there dickon stood for a moment unobserved looking at skye and her family then his heart contracted skye moved and he could see that she was with child she sat with lord burke his arm was loosely about her expanded waist his big hand gently caressing the living mound of her belly she lay her head back against his shoulder and smiled up at him a smile of such incredible sweetness that de grenville thought he would weep well he couldnt stand there forever he cleared his throat and stepped noisily into the room dickon she cried its good to see you robin and willow ran to greet him madam dickon said coldly without preamble i arrest you in the name of the queen the glad greeting died away slowly niall burke got to his feet though his voice was calm he could not mask his anger if this is a jest de grenville its a poor one my wife can stand no shocks at present it is no jest my lord the charges sir i have not been given a list of charges my lord my orders are to escort lady burke to london as quickly as possible and when you arrive in london the tower my lord said de grenville softly skye cried out and the children clustered about her knees frightened i will not allow you to remove my wife in her condition she carries the macwilliams heir unless you are prepared to battle the queens guards my lord i intend taking her today niall wore no weapon but he towered over de grenville over my dead body englishman de grenville drew his sword and skye shrieked my lords no she got awkwardly to her feet dickon for pitys sake what is this all about god bear me witness skye i do not know my orders are to bring you quickly and secretly to london where you are to be lodged in the tower lord burke you are forbidden to leave lynmouth that is all i was told to say and its truly all i know you cant transport a woman who is six months gone with child all the way to london i have orders my lord i can use the traveling coach said skye quietly and the two men turned to stare at her if we go slowly and carefully there should be no danger to my child i know not why the queen does this but if i must go to london to straighten this out then i will you will give me time to prepare dickon my servants and i will be ready in the morning you can only take one servant skye very well she said then niall i am tired will you escort me you understand dickon that i prefer to dine alone tonight in my rooms with my husband and children de grenville mumbled his assent as niall escorted his wife from the room in their apartment skye sent the children off with daisy and turned to niall they know nothing she said positively if they did dickon would know the charges but theyre suspicious he said suspicious enough to arrest you they can prove nothing argued skye firmly they will try to frighten me but they will not succeed if they had any evidence at all they would be tearing lynmouth and lundy apart they have nothing the tudor bitch seeks to outbluff me but im a better opponent than shes used to dealing with she can keep you imprisoned as long as she chooses skye i know you must not disobey her niall you must stay at lynmouth and watch over robin and willow you must watch over lynmouth but how can i help you if i remain here adam de marisco she said quietly set two lights in the topmost window of the west tower one high and one low have you got that hell come you can get word to ireland through adam he put his arms about her and buried his face in her beautiful black hair and soft neck skye there was such anguish in his voice do as i ask niall i will not endanger robins inheritance nor give the queen an opportunity to steal southwoods son from me oh how she would enjoy that barren stock that she is helplessly he held her knowing he had no real part in this war she had begun it without him and now it seemed she would end it without him all he could give her was his love to carry with her into imprisonment supper was a subdued affair skye told the children you must not be frightened for me i will come home again obey niall as you would me for i expect good reports of you she then tucked them into bed kissing each one tenderly next she supervised daisy and the maids with the packing be sure you dont forget the feather bed she reminded them its cold by the thames in winter and daisy see that several casks of burgundy and malmsey are packed into the baggage wagon i prefer my own wines finally she lay next to niall curled spoon fashion against him and he felt her trembling heard her soft weeping he said nothing only held her close when morning came she dressed warmly pulling her long knitted wool stockings on following with first a silk and then two lightly spun wool petticoats her gown was of heavy darkblue silk with pearl buttons long sleeves and a high neck her hooded cloak was lined in silk and edged in fur her short boots were furlined daisy arranged her thick dark hair in a low chignon skye bid her children goodbye in the privacy of her rooms as she did not want them frightened by the soldiers who would escort her to her coach why is the queen arresting you mama asked willow again i dont know my chick she replied it is just a misunderstanding you must not be afraid for me wwwill they ccut off your head quavered robin close to tears gracious no my darling where on earth did you ever get such a grim idea willow said thats what happens to people who go to the tower he answered the queen was in the tower once when she was just a princess and so was lord dudley and so were any number of people i could name robin none of them had their heads removed but willow said insisted robin in defense of his adored older sister willow is an ignorant little girl who has obviously not been paying attention to her lessons and who badly needs a switching said skye hugging her son fiercely she realized that willow was badly frightened by her dramatic departure and opening her other arm said oh chick come here and let me hug you too but dont cry for mere is nothing to weep about willow flung herself into her mothers arms pressing as close to her as skyes pregnancy would allow and then it was skye who came close to weeping the two heads one so dark like her own one so fair like geoffreys came together and she kissed them both then gently disengaged them and stepped away i must go now my loves obey niall and make me proud goodbye mama willows eyes swam with unshed tears but she gamely held them back ggoodbye mama robin stood straight goodbye my lord earl she replied and then hurried from the room before the children saw her own tears niall was waiting for her in their private family hall seeing the look on her face he quickly caught her to him and kissed the hot tears that slid down her cheeks its my condition she muttered i know he soothed it must be for youd never give the queen a victory over you i know that no she sniffed fumbling for her handkerchief i certainly wouldnt he laughed thats my girl she wiped her eyes i must not keep dickon waiting she stuffed the handkerchief away in an inner pocket of her cloak youre the most incredibly brave woman i know skye dont fear my love ill let nothing happen to you i have friends and so do you if the queen thinks to harm you shell not succeed the secret of your arrest will not remain a secret long im not afraid niall she replied her eyes were clear now and she was calm he felt a surge of pride sweep over him god helpelizabeth tudor thought niall for shes never tangled with a wildcat like my skye in the courtyard the horses stamped in the crisp air their hot breath visible daisy who had insisted on going into captivity with her mistress was already seated in the coach carefully niall helped his wife into the vehicle clambering up after her he tucked a fur robe about her legs her blue eyes regarded him calmly and she said softly perhaps youd have done better to marry a meek miss than a wild widow he chuckled answering just as softly i had me two meek misses madam i far prefer the widow i always did then he kissed her a sweetly gentle kiss that set her heart fluttering wildly oh god i shall miss you niall burke theres time to flee my love youve but to claim youre in early labor and then its off to lundy through the cave with that english buffoon de grenville none the wiser no she said sharply i mean to beat bess tudor and keep it all youre a stubborn woman skye omalley but i believe youll win oh i will niall i will he took her small hand in his and kissed it slowly first the back and then the palm farewell madam ill look after all here she felt a catch in her throat as he stepped out of the coach and shut the door firmly behind him she watched him stride over to dickon and speak with him his face grim i want you to travel carefully de grenville i am holding you personally responsible for the safety of my wife and unborn child do you understand that if anythinghappens to either of them i will personally slay your wife and family and burn your bloody house ill be careful my lord said de grenville id not take skye at all in her current condition were i not under direct orders from the queen i understand said niall quietly will you keep me informed of any news and if she may have visitors go to see her so she wont be lonely de grenville nodded mounting his horse he led the procession of soldiers coach and baggage wagon from the courtyard of lynmouth castle across the drawbridge and out onto the road to his vast surprise the road was crowded with people for over two miles tenant farmers villagers merchants and fishermen gamekeepers and castle servants young and old stood cheek by jowl lining both sides of the road all quietly supporting their mistress here and there de grenville heard a voice call out god keep your ladyship and bring you safely home to us what the hell is bess tudor about de grenville wondered whathas skye done that no one knows about yet has offended the queen so terribly the trip which should have taken but a few days took well over a week the coach moved at a sedate pace stopping frequently so the lovely countess might stretch her legs or refresh herself they started late in the day and stopped early when de grenville suggested they might move a little faster skye took to her bed thus delaying them an additional day thereafter de grenville gritted his teeth and kept his peace when they finally arrived in london de grenville transferred skye to a closed water barge so her coach with the lynmouth arms emblazoned on the doors would not be recognized the coach and its servants were returned immediately to devon parted from the familiarity of her coach and servants skye felt some of her courage ebb away though from the serene look on her face no one would have known it she had learned long ago that to show fear only encouraged ones enemies carefully de grenville handed her and daisy down into the waiting barge then joined them i always wanted to take you out on the river in my barge he skye omalley all said in a lighthearted attempt at conversation i am sure dickon she answered that cruising on your barge would be far preferable than the cruise i am about to take on this one skye damme what is going on between you and the queen i really have no idea at all dickon she replied sweetly and turned her face away from him to gaze out on the river he sighed deeply but made no further attempt skye breathed slowly concentrating hard on the simple act of drawing air into her lungs and expelling it each beat of the oars brought her closer to imprisonment and god only knew what else but she swore silently to herself she would admit nothing she would beat the queen at this catandmouse game if it was her last act on this earth a soft rain began to fall the twilight was a mauvegray about them it was quiet on the river and there seemed to be no other boats upon the water then skyes heartbeat accelerated for ahead of them the tower of london loomed tall dark and menacing in the early evening the barge turned shoreward and the child in her womb kicked as the craft bumped the stone quay she placed a protective hand over her belly thinking as she did so fear not my child i will protect you yes said a nagging voice in her head but who will protect you she shivered de grenville leaped from the boat to help skye out she stood for a minute savoring her last moments of freedom then turned to mount the stairs to the tower the steps were smooth with age and slick with the rain and to her annoyance she slipped once but de grenville caught her beneath the elbow and steadied her she stopped to regain her balance men pulled away from him i am not afraid my lord it was only the steps skye i know he answered all the while thinking how brave the lady really was the tower governor met her at the entry looking extremely distressed as he noted her condition to be sure she wouldnt be the first woman to give birth here but how he hated imprisoning pregnant women anything could happen under these conditions the governor greeted his prisoner as warmly as was appropriate please take supper with my wife and me lady burke it will give your servant time to ready your rooms ill send my own people up with your baggage and see that the fires are laid thank you sir john answered skye turning she said farewell dickon please tell her majesty that if i had really wanted to come to london i should have done so long before this i wish a list of the charges against me and if there are none then tell the queen she holds me illegally she turned again sir john your arm please i am so ungainly these days richard de grenville left the tower and made his way to whitehall where the queen was currently in residence he went directly to cecil lord burghleys apartment and asked to see him immediately the secretary by now inured to the usual request for haste was surprised when cecil told him to send in sir richard at once when the door had shut behind dickon cecil motioned him to a chair and asked what took you so long sir was there difficulty at lynmouth no my lord none at all although lord burke is very angry and lady burke is confused about why the queen would arrest her there is one complication and that was what delayed us cecil looked inquiringly at him and de grenville explained lady burke will be delivered of a child within a few months it was necessary therefore to travel slowly damn swore cecil i warned the queen and now he stopped himself my lord dickon plunged in why has the countess been arrested what has she done done why she has done nothing that we know of sir richard she is merely under suspicion oh he desperately wanted to ask under suspicion of what but he dared not you may go now sir richard youll remember of course not to discuss this mission with anyone yes my lord he turned to go hesitated then turned back and asked may i visit skye occasionally my lord shes apt to be lonely no sir richard you may not her presence in london is to remain strictly a secret if anyone saw you there you could not possibly explain your visits to the tower when de grenville looked crestfallen cecil added in a more kindly tone perhaps you may see her before christmas sir richard and carry her greetings home to her family alone cecil sat back satisfied that he had effectively isolated lady burke they would leave her alone for a few weeks to stew over why she was there if she was really guilty she would be quite thoroughly frightened by the time they got around to her interrogation he smiled some days later however cecil was not smiling with regard to the matter of lady burke standing before him was an irritatingly implacable irish nun who identified herself as sister eibhlin nee omalley of st brides convent inishturk island i have come she said in a soft but firm voice to attend my sister in her travail at first cecil pretended ignorance madam he answered coldly i have no idea to what you refer eibhlin flashed him a hauntingly familiar mocking smile my lord let us not waste time your signature was on my sisters arrest warrant i have spent the last several days traveling here at breakneck speed from the west coast of ireland i mean to be with skye and unless you give me leave to join her i shall find some means of getting to the queen and making this whole affair public the omalleys have held their peace thus far for lord burke assures us this is but a misunderstanding why demanded cecil now becoming irritated why should i allow you to be with your sister madam i will not allow her husband why her sister my brotherinlaw is a fine fellow to be sure sir but i am a midwife by profession skye needs me she has her woman with her daisy an excellent lass for doing hair or caring for my sisters clothing and jewelsbut as a midwife i fear not the mere sight of blood sets the poor girl to swooning and there is much blood connected with a birthing did you know that perhaps though you would prefer that my sister suffer good god woman snapped cecil we wish no harm to lady burke we would have sent someone to help her when her time came i can well imagine rejoined eibhlin scornfully some ancient crone with dirty fingernails who would undoubtedly infect both skye and the babe what do you know my lord cecil of midwifery the queens closest advisor felt his temper rising higher the woman was insufferable madam he thundered getting into the tower is easy it is the getting out that will be hard again she smiled that mocking smile and this time he recognized it it was the countess of lynmouths smile strange thought cecil the nun doesnt look like lady burke at all but for the mouth iwould never believe them even related but for that smile and thatannoyingly superior attitude i am not afraid my lord she answered him and he acknowledged that she wasnt ah these overproud irish he again thought go then madam my secretary will issue the necessary papers he said i trust i shall be free to come and go my lord there will be necessities i must get when my sisters time comes no madam said cecil it would be too simple for lady burke to escape the tower in a nuns robes whatever you need you must either take in with you or have the servants fetch from the markets you may enter the tower but once you leave it you will not be allowed back inside those are the conditions very well answered eibhiin i will abide by your conditions she bowed faintly to him and turning said regally farewell my lord my thanks several hours later clutching the precious parchment in her slender hands eibhiin omalley entered the tower of london and was escorted to her sisters apartment high in one of the several towers as she mounted the stairs eibhiin was pleased to see that the soldier who escorted her was respectful and that the building seemed clean relatively draftfree and had no noxious odors skye was sleeping when she arrived but daisy practically fell on her neck with undisguised relief oh sister thank god youre here eibhlins generous mourn twitched with amusement now daisy is it as bad as all that sister i have never even helped birth a kitten i was so afraid id be alone with my lady when her time came lord burke would surely kill me if id let anything happen to either mistress skye or the child well you need worry no longer daisy im here and i intend to stay when skye awoke eibhiin was well settled into the tower suite how on earth did you get here she exclaimed hugging her older sister about ten days ago a giant of an englishman arrived at st brides and told me you needed me i was hurried across ireland on the back of a bony horse put on a tossing ship and set down at lynmouth niall told me the rest and sent me up to london to be with you and cecil let you in here i am surprised ive seen no one but daisy and the guards since the morning after my arrival i think i am supposed to be made afraid through continual isolation but being a sensible woman sister you are not afraid i suspect skye smiled no eibhiin im not then youve gained no more sense with the passing years little sister than you had at ten replied the nun tartly and skye laughed oh eibhiin its so good to have you with me later the two sisters bundled together in the large bed that took up almost the entire bedroom it was hung with skyes own garnetcolored velvet hangings the sheets feather bed goosedown pillows and fur coverlets were her own a fire blazed in the corner fireplace warming the cold early december night and scenting the room with the fragrance of applewood because it was at the top of one of the towers skyes bedchamber was totally private it was the one place where she was free of being overheard now she and her sister spoke softly but freely have they presented you with a list of formal charges asked eibhlin no which confirms my suspicions that they suspect me of piracy but have no proof i have not even been questioned she chuckled warmly no they have no proof eibhlin they will have to let me go eventually and ill have made bess tudor doubly a fool eibhlin looked thoughtful be careful sister that its not you who rides for a fall elizabeth is englands acknowledged queen and if she chooses she can keep you here until you rot if she tries said skye her voice becoming hard the burkes and the omalleys will rouse all of connaught against her and if connaught rebels all of ireland will follow there are enough hotheads in ireland waiting just for an excuse my god skye youre bitter why why this unremitting hatred for the english queen slowly leaving out no detail skye told her sister of the queens decision regarding robins guardianship and of lord dudleys continuing rape and abuse of her niall had not explained these things to eibhlin and i thought i was the rebel said eibhlin by god skye youre a cool one so the queen knew of lord dudleys conduct and allowed it then shes gotten what she deserved now however our problem is to free you she can do nothing without proof maintained skye stubbornly she needs no proof to keep you here repeated eibhlin what we must do now is convince her to her satisfaction that you are not guilty how i dont know yet i must pray on it skye laughed it will take a powerful prayer eibhlin go to sleep my conscience is as clear as an innocent babes and so saying she tied the ribbons of her laceedged lawn night cap firmly beneath her chin and lying back quickly fell asleep eibhlin however lay awake thinking skye was right the queen had presented no formal charges of piracy against the countess of lynmouth which meant that she indeed had no proof but until she was convinced that skye had had no part in the piracy she would hold her prisoner though she dared not act openly against her it was a standoff the following morning as skye was finishing her daily exercise period on the battlements a captain of the guards stepped up to her good morning my lady i am to escort you to lord cecil very well said skye her heart quickening so at last they were going to question her she was looking forward to the challenge of pitting her wits against cecils she followed the guardsman through a maze of corridors until finally he ushered her into a paneled room with a small oriel window that overlooked the thames seated at a long table were cecil dudley and two other men she believed one was the earl of shrewsbury the other lord cavendish seeing no chair for her she said icily you surely do not expect a woman in my condition to stand my lords please remember that you are a prisoner here madam said lord dudley meanly and continued skye unless that man is removed i shall leave this minute lord burghley please bring a chair for lady burke ordered cecil dudley be silent i hope remarked skye boldly as she settled herself with much display that youll be good enough to explain the meaning of my imprisonment i have been kept in total ignorance for weeks now and i am beginning to find this situation quite intolerable a grim smile touched the comers of cecils mouth we were desirous of speaking with you in regard to the recent piracies occurring in devon skye raised an elegantly winged eyebrow if you wished to speak to me sir why did you not simply do so was it necessary to imprison me i am well aware of the piracy i lost two ships last year myself i regret to say that the queens commission could not find the perpetrators a fine penny it cost me you do not seem to have suffered overmuch financially remarked cecil i am a very rich woman as you are well aware my lord burghley nevertheless i dislike losing money my ships must be properly maintained my captains and their men paid they in turn feed the economy it is a satisfactory circle which is broken when the spectre of piracy arises clever madam but not clever enough to fool us snarled dudley skye turned her cool gaze on robert dudley you have grown paunchy with too much good living my lord but your brain is just as soft as ever the earl of leicester grew beetred and though his mouth opened and shut several times no words issued forth shrewsbury and cavendish snickered and cecil himself was hard pressed not to laugh his turn however was coming if my lords you have formal charges to place against me then do so if not then release me for you hold me illegally she then spoke directly to cecil lord burghley you insult me greatly by asking me to come before this panel i will not appear before you again without formal charges nor will i at any time come before any group of which lord dudley is a part and you need not ask me why because you know why she stood turned and walked to the door stop her shouted dudley to the guardsmen skye whirled surprisingly graceful despite her girth her deepblue eyes blazed with contempt she placed her hands protectively over her belly and said fiercely i carry within me the heir to the macwilliam lay rough hands upon me and harm that child and even my pleas will not be able to stop the flame that will ignite all ireland if the queen wishes war with my people we will be happy to oblige her then she turned again and left the room unopposed why didnt you stop the little irish bitch demanded dudley of cecil who cares if her cub strangles on its own cord my lord said cecil evenly you sit on this panel because the queen requested it and i am in all things the queens loyal servant you were not my choice however and i shall ask her majesty to reconsider her request i agree with lady burke you are offensive gentlemen you are dismissed until the same hour tomorrow when we shall again attempt to question the countess of lynmouth it was not to be however for skye had felt the first pangs of labor as she made her exit slowly gritting her teeth against the pain she followed the guardsman back through a maze of corridors almost fainting as she climbed the stairs all the way back up to her tower forcing her legs to climb again and again though they were leaden and she could hardly lift them nearing the top she groaned and sat down heavily startled the young captain of the guard turned my lady he cried he leaped back down the steps supporting her with his strong arm he helped her up the last few steps to her apartment shouting for aid as he went the door was flung open and both eibhlin and daisy hurried out to take skye from the captain dyou need anything he asked worriedly eibhlin smiled reassuringly at the young man no thank you captain we have everything we need i would however inform the tower governor that lady burke has gone into premature labor she lowered her voice to a whisper easily audible to both skye and daisy i hope we dont lose them both all this nonsense of arresting my poor sister and what are the charges captain there are none well thank you for your aid youre a good christian lad and ill pray for you then she shut the door firmly between them and the guard oh eibhlin skye was laughing between contractions youre the most unholy nun ive ever met you terrified that poor nice young guardsman now hell run all the way to sir john and tell him im at deaths door good well make mem all feel guilty crowed eibhlin as she and daisy helped skye undress what did cecil want me to confess to piracy its as i thought they have no proof she winced as a wave of pain rolled over her suddenly her waters broke flooding into a puddle at her feet eibhlin i think this child is going to be born right now daisy quick lass drag the table in front of the fireplace daisy struggled with the long oak table grunting as she fought to push it across the room eibhlin help her i can stand alone together the two women swung the oak board around before the blazing stone fireplace then daisy ran upstairs to skyes bedchamber and came back down with the goosedown pillows a pad and a sheet that she and eibhlin placed on the table they then helped skye up onto the table and she half sat with her legs spread the pillows propping her shoulders as she labored eibhlin washed her slender strangely elegant hands in the basin that daisy provided some weeks before the nun had instructed daisy concerning her birthingroom duties and now daisy performed without fault the nunmidwife leaned down to examine her patient holy mary the child is halfbom she exclaimed reaching out she carefully turned the slippery infant itoldyou gasped skye as a final contraction racked her and then the child fully born began to squall loudly isheall right all his fingersand toes eibhlin swiftly wiped the baby off and gazed down at the tiny face shes fine skye all her fingers and toes she oh damn then skye laughed weakly willow will love having a little sister and i am happy to have another daughter but the macwilliam is going to be very disappointed youll have others remarked eibhlin drily skye sent eibhlin an amused look thinking how good it was to have her matteroffact big sister with her how long she wondered would the queen allow eibhlin to stay now that the child was born a thunderous knocking began on the door quick daisy tell whoever it is that they cant come in directed eibhlin daisy ran to the door and opened ita crack you cant come in she said to sir john the tower governor my lady is having her baby ive brought my wife to help you said sir john and before daisy could prevent it lady alyce pushed into the room and hurried over to where skye lay seeing the newly born infant on its mothers stomach lady alyces eyes twinkled conspiratorially bending down she whispered groan loudly my dear understanding filled skyes eyes and she groaned long and piteously oh dear cried lady alyce running back to her husband who waited patiently at the door it will be hours john youd best go along i will come back when ive news close the door girl daisy gladly complied breathing a sigh of relief as she did so the tower governors wife laughed softly and smiled down at skye there my dear that should give you peace for a little while longer besides it never does to let men know mat having babies can sometimes be easy thank you madam ive never had a baby so quickly each one comes faster than the previous one how many have you had my dear this child is my sixth but its my second daughter oh a little girl i had a little girl once she would have been fourteen this past whitsun she died of the white throat eight years ago her name was linaet i lost my late husband and our youngest son the same way said skye the two women fell silent then lady alyce asked what will you call this babe lady burke deirdre skye cried eibhlin deirdres fate was a tragic one she was held prisoner by her king my innocent child is being held prisoner by her queen she was born in captivity in a most infamous place eibhlin the name is fitting and as i have not the comfort of a priest you must baptize my daughter dear sister lady alyce looked troubled why are you here my dear she asked daisy took deirdre from skye and began cleaning and dressing her eibhlin cleaned her sister free of all traces of the birth skye explained to the kindly older woman no one has told me why i am here madam no charges have been leveled against me i hoped she hesitated that your husband might know alas my dear no oh i wish i could help she cried it seems so unfair do not trouble yourself lady alyce we irish are used to being misunderstood and mistreated said skye sweetly well at least i can stay here for a few hours said the tower governors wife if they think the child is being bom theyll leave you be later having been witness to such a hard birth i will of course advise my husband that your sister must stay a month or two if you and your poor weak infant are to survive skye smiled youre a true friend maam but do nothing to endanger yourself or sir john with the queen the tudors i have found can be most unkind even to their friends i have learned this first hand what does the queen know of the tower except whatever my husband tells her replied the good lady and she plumped herself down in a comfortable chair before the fire i understand lady burke that youve the best malmsey in england i am mighty partial to malmsey the following morning lady alyce informed her husband that the poor imprisoned lady burke had managed though the dear lord only knew how to give birth to a wee girl child both she and the little lass are very weak and will need constant nursing for the next few months if they are to survive said lady alyce firmly her husband recognized her mood she would brook no interference my dear he said mildly it is all right with me if lady burkes sister remains with her but the final decision is not mine to make you have some influence john use it i dont understand what the queen is about imprisoning poor lady burke and without charges hush my dear i can see that our distinguished guest has made a conquest of you but we must trust that the queen and lord burghley know what they are doing i will send word now to the queen elizabeth had been having one of her infrequent and painful menstrual flows when word was brought to her of lady deirdre burkes birth gods nightshirt she swore irritably she has done it deliberately done what madam said cecil had her child in the tower the tone of sir johns missive is quite sympathetic to lady burke and i am not sure i like it why should he sound faintly disapproving of me and tenderly concerned for that irish rebel new mothers and their infants always have a tendency to evoke sympathy from those around them cecil soothed elizabeth turned around her lovely long redgold hair swinging with her her face was white and pinched with pain youll not be able to question her for several weeks now damn i wanted her exposed for the pirate bitch she is dyou know that she threw dudley out of her castle into the middle of a snowstorm last winter ho thought cecil so thats the reason behind this vendetta precious lord robert has been offended little did i think when i sought to get at the truth of the devon pirates that i should give dudley an opportunity for revenge i must think on this he smiled at the queen in a kindly fashion come my dear back into bed with you youre not well and this matter will wait youre perfectly right well not be able to pursue the matter until lady burke has recovered from the birth of her daughter sir johns wife lady alyce was present at the birth and says it was a hard one i imagine it will take lady burke several weeks to recover elizabeth climbed back into her bed and drew the velvet coverlet up about her oh cecil she wailed sometimes i think it would have been better if id been born a simple maid the mantle of royalty weighs so heavily upon me and i am but a frail creature nay madam you but look frail but when you sprang forth from your mothers womb of henry tudors strong seed you had the heart of a lion you need have no fear of your ability elizabeth sighed oh cecil you are my strength i will rest now she closed her eyes i will leave you to handle lady burke as you see fit william cecil smiled his wintry smile i will not fail you madam you never have old friend said the queen softly as she fell asleep chapter adam de marisco could not believe his incredible luck for several months now ever since hed been summoned to lynmouth to learn of skyes fate he had felt helpless useless weak now he had the means to free her and it was gods own good fortune that had brought it to him the idea of how to utilize this chance however was de mariscos own and having the idea had instantly restored adams selfconfidence now he greeted lord burke welcoming him warmly to lundy the big irishman had grown haggard with worry and lack of sleep de marisco pushed a dram of peat whiskey into nialls hand drink up man i know now how to bring her home safe how lord burke gulped the smoky amber liquid down reveling in the burning sensation that spread upward from his belly and into his veins theres a wellhidden cove down by my lighthouse and in that cove right now is a shipa ship of dead men the tidal currents around the end of the island are erratic and they drove the vessel ashore it was found two days ago floating halfbeached in that cove ive already given orders that no one is to go near the ship and ive already placed in its holds my share of the booty from the santa maria madre de cristas the men who carried the cargo to the holds for me are a family of mutes ive always seen to their welfare and as they are grateful they will never give me away they wouldnt even if they could talk this ship is of english design yet the bodies aboard her appear to be arab or moorish i will wager they are barbary pirates what killed them i know not but if we can take the ship in tow and bring it up to london i believe we can convince cecil that these unfortunate dead men are part of whoever was responsible for the recent piracies especially considering what theyll find in the hold that should free skye niall burkes face began to relax itself as he digested de mariscos idea its possible he thought a moment did you find a log on board yes but its all in a funny kind of scrawl that bears no resemblance to any writing ive ever seen a slow smile lit nialls face crinkling the corners of his silvery eyes its probably arabic and youre probably right de marisco theyre barbary pirates we do have one problem though we cant destroy the log it would be very suspicious if no log were aboard but if cecil finds someone who reads arabic the log might prove mat this is not a pirate ship we must have that log read who the hell do you know who reads arabic demanded de marisco he was beginning to lose confidence skye does answered niall laughing damme is there nothing that woman cant do i am reassured to learn mat you dont know the answer to that de marisco said niall suddenly serious adam de marisco topped niall burke by at least two inches he drew himself up now and looking down on skyes husband said little man i believe its time we cleared the air yes i loved her and possibly i always will i was not however the husband for her i knew that and as proud as i would have been to be her husband his words faded and for a moment there was total understanding between them and then adam de marisco finished she loves you and you are a fool if youd believe id ever come between you now little man can we get on with the business of retrieving skye from elizabeth tudor dammit de marisco you make me feel like a green boy with his first love but anytime you think im not big enough to take you on give me a try little man indeed give me your hand you damned englishman im forced to admit that i like you if only skye could have seen them standing there grinning at each other both in love with her and now both united in friendship in an effort to aid her the two men clasped hands and two pairs of eyes one silvery gray the other smoky blue met in a gaze of understanding well need one other man to help and robert small can do it hed never forgive me if we excluded htm he can read some arabic maybe he can decipher enough of the log before we present it to cecil at least well know if the book contradicts our story hes just back home his sister sent me word today and i sent back a message asking him to come to lynmouth can you have that ship taken in tow to lynmouth bay its best no one else know what were planning ill give orders at once my mute brothers can do the job nicely answered de marisco what of the bodies they stink like the very devil observed adam but im leaving mem aboard to give credence to our tale otherwise cecil will say we made the whole thing up how will we explain the time lapse its been months since the santa maria madre de cristas was taken where the hell has this ship been in the meantime why shes been apirating niall burke the wily infidels have been off across the sea pirating the waters of new spain she must have taken the santa maria on her way out last spring we all know how the moors hate the spaniards and cannot resist the opportunity to strike out at them he chuckled richly its a damn good story if i do say so myself aye agreed niall admiringly im thinking youre wasted on your island de marisco court is obviously the place for you christ no id die penned up in that putrid city playing the gallant to that vain bitch bessie tudor wasting my time and my money on useless clothes cards and highborn highpriced doxies give me lundy barren rock that it is and the sea and im a happy man you dont mention sons to follow you de marisco why adam de marisco smiled wryly because theyll be none niall burke he replied fate has a grim sense of humor when i was fourteen i was taken with a fever that rendered my seed barren ive the appetite of a damned satyr where women are concerned yet ive never fathered a child i went to an old witchwoman in devon several years ago in hopes of learning why when she questioned me and learned of the fever i had had as a boy she told me she couldnt help that the life had been burned out of my seed she said she had heard of such cases before with not so much as a daughter to my credit thus far i had to believe her thats another reason helping skye is important to me her little son robin and i are the last living descendants of the first southwood he chuckled at nialls incredulous look aye irishman the de mariscos are the bastard branch of the family the first geoffroi de sudbois brought over from normandy his mistress mathilde de marisco actually as the story has come down he intended to wed with the lady when he made his fortune with duke william like him she was a second child so her portion was very small after my noble ancestor had taken lynmouth he found it more practical to wed with the old lords daughter and so the fair gwyneth became the mother of the legitimate line mathilde however was a bold and ambitious wench she far preferred coming to england as geoffrois mistress to remaining in normandy as a poor relation in her brothers house or entering some insignificant nunnery she lived for several years in the west tower of lynmouth castle making poor gwyneths life a hell but then one day her eldest son was caught attempting to smother one of the legitimate southwoods in his cradle and the fair gwyneth put her dainty saxon foot down mathilde and her offspring had to go lundy belonged to lynmouth then and so geoffroi deeded the island to mathilde de marisco her sons and their descendants forever down through the generations the de mariscos have wed with southwood bastards southwood younger daughters or their french cousins in fact my grandmother and the late geoffrey southwoods grandfather were brother and sister since i am the last of my line the last of the bastards of lundy young robin is the last of the southwoods i have enough family feeling to want to protect both him and his mother they are dear to me does skye know this nay we never discussed it said adam de marisco niall burke didnt have the courage to ask why whatever had happened between skye and adam had happened before he had wed her and it was not his business adam de marisco was definitely an honorable man he looked long and hard at the lord of lundy and adam returned his look youre quite a man cousin said niall burke now lets rescue that wench of mine before she gets into further mischief several hours later niall found himself and his host aboard a ship towing the moorish vessel toward the devon coast robert small awaited them at lynmouth the little man was furious i leave you to care for skye and come home from a short and profitable voyage to find her in the tower of london is this how you watch over her and you adam de marisco youre no better going along with her foolishness you are the ones who should be in london not my skye i understand from my sister that she was with child she must have delivered it months ago is the tower the place for a new mother and my niece or nephew do you even know whether the babe is male or female dammit robbie be silent roared niall sit down and listen to me skye is perfectly safe there is no evidence against her i was forbidden london or even ireland i was told to remain at lynmouth and skye begged me to comply for robins sake she doesnt wish to cost him his inheritance my child was safely delivered last december but i know not its gender for even de grenville was not allowed to see skye though he says cecil had promised him he might there has been no way to help skye safely until recently now i will risk the queens displeasure and go to london for de marisco has solved the dilemma for pitys sake adam tell him before he strangles us both slowly carefully adam de marisco outlined his plan its possible robert small nodded thoughtfully have you the log adam de marisco brought the flat book to robbie and he opened it yes he said immediately its arabic he was silent for a few minutes as he perused the log then he said slowly the ship is the gazelle out of algiers and she has been apirating his spirits rose they picked up some men in a longboat several weeks ago and shortly after that their crew began sickening and dying the men in the longboat perished almost immediately this last entry was made ten days ago it says simply allah have mercy robbie looked up the poor devils he pushed the pages back reading swiftly here and there and suddenly his weathered face split into a smile heres a piece of luck an entry made early last spring says took a cursed spaniard today and their heading that day was in the atlantic off the coast of ireland they were on their way out men the rest of the book has many entries of piracy against the infidel but they were primarily spaniardhunters which is greatly to our good if cecil is suspicious enough and can find someone who reads arabic this should confirm your story ill go through the rest of the log more carefully tomorrow to be sure theres nothing that could harm skye in the meantime send the gazelle off to london tonight well have to wait until she arrives before we do otherwise we lose the element of surprise it was difficult to wait but they did adam de marisco returned to lundy where he paced his entire island at least two dozen times during the next few weeks robert small rode home to wren court where he spent his time handling the business of the trading company that belonged to him and skye french jean skyes secretary took the brunt of robbies bad temper and but for his loyalty to his mistress would have packed up marie and the children and returned to brittany niall worried that their plan might fail what would they do in that case but he kept his fears from the children the separation from his mother had matured robin southwood without skye to shield and protect her little son with his stepfathers strong and kind influence the young earl of lynmouth was made very aware of his position and rose to the challenge willow her mothers daughter for all she looked like khalid el bey tried hard to replace skye sitting between robin and niall at the high board and presiding over the household staff at first the servants tolerated her with benign amusement soon to their horror they discovered a far sterner taskmistress than their own countess was their complaints to niall fell upon deaf ears unless willow was in the wrong he supported her fully and the young girl blossomed under her stepfathers wise support several weeks slipped by and then finally robert small received word that the gazelle and her escort ship mermaid were at anchor in the london pool he rode hard for lynmouth that night in the west tower of the castle a green signal light beamed across the eleven miles of water separating lynmouth and lundy at dawn the following day three caped riders clattered across the castle drawbridge and down the lane to the london road it was rainy that late march day and the empty roads were muddy the fog was thick in some places thin in others and a gray mist hung like ribbons above the newly planted brown fields there was no wind at all and the millponds were still and as smooth as glass the trees waited expectantly their buds eager for the april sun here and there on the hillsides clumps of yellow and white daffodils and narcissus proved that winter had gone even if the air was chill and damp the three men road silently their heads down their shoulders hunched against the steady rain at midday they stopped at a roadside tavern to wolf down bread cheese and bitter brown ale they were on the road again within the hour and traveled in the steadily worsening rain until several hours after dark finally they broke their journey at a small inn that seemed clean but undistinguished and therefore unlikely to attract anyone who might recognize lord burke niall was pleased to find that the stable was dry the stalls filled with fresh clean straw the stableman knowledgeable he tsktsked disapprovingly as lord burke led in the three tired horses i hopes your business justifies riding these beauties in this weather he scolded and niall hid a smile and when he answered have the irish ever been known to abuse good horseflesh have them ready to go at dawn man he flipped the openmouthed stableman a silver coin and strode away grinning to himself the animals would be well cared for after their long day robbie and de marisco were waiting for him in the taproom the men revived a bit with hot mulled wine the horses will be ready to go at dawn whats for dinner meat pies said robbie filling answered niall and de marisco grunted his agreement they ate with very little conversation shoving pieces of the hot flaky pies into their mouths washing it down with the mulled wine finishing off the meal with a wedge of cheddar and some crisp apples the innkeeper then showed them to a dormitorystyle room beneath the eaves where the three men fell asleep instantly upon husk mattresses the innkeeper woke them shortly before dawn today aint no better than yesterday gentlemen i got a hot breakfast waiting for you in the taproom they splashed cold water into their eyes pulled on their boots and found the taproom they discovered their appetites again as the innkeepers pretty buxom daughter ladled hot oat porridge into the wooden trenchers covering it with stewed apples she cut them chunks of steaming wheat bread and smeared it liberally with butter and honey plunking it all down before them the girl drew them tankards of brown ale as she placed the foaming mugs upon the table adam de marisco slid a bold arm about her waist and where were you when we rode in cold and hungry last night my pigeon he leered at her safe in me maidens bed and away from the likes of you my fine lord retorted the girl pertly slapping his hands away niall and robbie chuckled but adam persisted youd send me out into the cold rain with that long cold ride ahead of me without so much as a kiss to warm me his hand slid beneath her skirts it would appear to me youre already too warm my lord responded the girl i think you needs cooling off and she calmly dumped the tankard of ale over de mariscos head and spun away from his pinching fingers lord burke and robert small howled and adam bested joined goodnaturedly in their laughter the innkeeper hurried over with a towel relieved to see that his daughters impertinence would not bring awful retribution down upon him your pardon my lord but joan is a headstrong girl as my youngest she has been spoiled terrible get into the kitchen girl dont send her away shes the prettiest thing weve seen in days and shes a good girl to keep herself for her future husband responded niall then he turned to the girl but sweetheart no more ale over de marisco youll give him a helluva chill and i havent time to nurse him hes just to keep his roving hands to himself me lord returned joan tossing her chestnut curls boldly he will promised niall and adam nodded gravely they finished their meal in peace soon ready to go their cloaks drawn tightly about them their hats pulled down over their eyes they paid the reckoning and headed for the door joan was sweeping the floor near the doorway and unable to resist de marisco pulled the startled girl into his arms and captured her cherryred mouth in a passionate kiss he kissed her slowly lingenngly expertly parting her lips to fence with her tongue until her initial resistance became eager compliance satisfied adam let her go gently steadying the swaying girl as he dropped a gold coin down her bodice dont settle for any less than that my pigeon youll be a long time married he told the starryeyed young girl then he was gone the day was as unpleasantly cold as the previous one had been and when they finally stopped for the night they were chilled to the bone exhausted and still forty miles from london the inn was noisy and crowded the food and the service were poor im for going on tonight said niall we can rent fresh horses here and exchange them for ours another time id rather spend a few more wet hours on the road and then sleep in a clean bed free of the fear of being robbed his two companions nodded and robbie noted youre apt to be recognized here niall were too close to london to suit me so after supper they rode on through the rainy windswept night finally arriving at greenwood at two oclock in the morning niall had thought it best not to stay at lynmouth house for fear of drawing notice the startled gatekeeper let them in recognizing robbie niall cautioned the old man that he was not to speak to anyone of their arrival if asked he was to deny that they had been there the lady skyes life depended upon it the gatekeeper looked to robbie for confirmation he nodded solemnly the sleepy house servants were confused but as easily reassured by robert small the maidservants scurried about preparing three bedchambers and laying fires three tall oak tubs were set up by the fire in the kitchen and the three men soaked the chill from their bones the motherly housekeeper prepared a hot mulled wine punch and served sliced ham on warm bread clean dry wrapped in dressing gowns that had belonged to the late lord southwood the three sat at the table eating drinking and talking when their beds were ready they went quickly to their bedrooms niall was grateful that the sheets had been warmed but as he lay there strangely wakeful he knew it was a different warmth he needed his body ached for a woman no not a woman skye since she had left the previous autumn he had remained totally faithful caught up in the business of running her estates caring for her children and trying to free her he hadnt had time to serve his own needs in the morning he and robbie and de marisco would force the issue with cecil and the queen niall wanted his wife and child back the child was it the boy that his father and he had wanted for so long hed know in a few hours niall sighed deeply and suddenly he was asleep the sun was up when he awoke and immediately yanked the bellpull shortly a little maid appeared with hot water for washing are sir robert and lord de marisco awake yet he asked just mlord she bobbed a curtsey your bells rang within minutes of each other have the clothes i brought in my saddlebags been freshened aye mlord ill bring them right up he washed and then dressed carefully his clothes selected shrewdly for this occasion were rich but subdued his shirt was the purest white silk his doublet of deepblue velvet embroidered discreetly in silver his hose were striped silver and blue and he wore a heavy silver chain with a silver and sapphire pendant smoothshaven his jaw showed a strong determination that william cecil would find hard to miss niall broke his fast in his room with fresh bread cheese and ale he then joined de marisco and robbie walking to the bottom of the garden they hailed a waterman for the trip down the river to greenwich palace where the queen was currently in residence niall kept his cloak wrapped well about him obscuring his features the rain had stopped but the day remained gray and threatening they arrived at greenwich and disembarking hurried into the palace luck was with them cecil had not yet arrived in his closet and on duty was only one young secretary who failed to recognize any of the three when the chancellor arrived in his long furred black velvet robe he was immediately surrounded by the three men and borne off to his privaterooms unafraid lord burghley settled himself comfortably at his desk and said to the anxious secretary i am not to be disturbed master morgan the secretary bowed out and cecil turned to his three visitors he eyed them dispassionately then spoke my lord burke i distinctly remember forbidding you london ive come to bring my wife and child home mlord you have had lady burke here almost six months and ive not yet been informed of the charges against her she is under suspicion my lord for six months and of what piracy was the cool reply what youre mad man niall niall robbie spoke cecil my friend be reasonable lady burke is a beautiful woman who ive no doubt has stolen many hearts but ships i think not proof cecil frowned and robbie almost shouted with glee they still had no proof i will be frank with you cecil i thought piracy was your suspicion because of the omalley ships poor niall refuses to see the logic of it and you do said cecil indeed i do the omalley of innisfana has access to ships and a knowledge of shipping lanes and schedules add to that her isolated coastal castle and you have all the ingredients for piracyexcept of course one important one what is missing sir robert cecil was fascinated motive my lord said robbie where is lady burkes motive she is already one of the wealthiest women in england possibly the wealthiest and she is not greedy for more riches everyone knows her to be generous and charitable she is not a seeker of thrills so why would she risk her sons inheritance and her own position by breaking the queens law above all things my dear cecil skye is a good mother no there are no grounds for your suspicions nor justification for holding her none besides bess tudors jealous spite and you know it cecil cecil looked both annoyed and uncomfortable the piracies ceased with lady burkes arrest he said nialls look was as black as a storm cloud but robert small put a steadying hand on him the piracies stopped over a year ago more than six months before you arrested lady burke the santa maria madre de cristas was taken off ireland late last spring but not by lady burke replied robbie for she was but newly married and on her honeymoon the spaniard was taken by barbary pirates and we have the proof cecil this giant whos accompanied lord burke and me is adam de marisco the lord of lundy island cecil began to look interested well over a month ago de marisco found a ghost ship floating off his island naturally he claimed it for salvage oh naturally murmured cecil robbie ignored the sarcasm and continued with his story when de marisco opened the hold of the ship and saw the treasure within he realized the implications at once he went immediately to lord burke and niall sent for me the ships log is in arabic of which i have some small knowledge there is an entry made early last summer that coincides with the date of the piracy of the santa maria the entry reads took a cursed spaniard today this was obviously the ship that captured the santa marias cargo it was on its way to the new world to go apirating which it did there are entries disclosing a transfer of cargo between the moors ship which is called the gazelle and another barbary ship the bulk of king philips goods were being sold in the markets of algiers before word even reached london that the treasure was gone we found only some of king philips treasure cargo aboard the gazelle as well as cargo from other ships these were among the stores i am sure the manifest that the spanish ambassador gave you lists these items he pulled a velvet bag from his doublet and opening it poured a stream of unset green emeralds upon cecils desk the chancellor gaped openmouthed at the flashing bluegreen fire that lay blazing before him for a moment the silence was thick then cecil found his voice where is the crew of this ship my lord de marisco you can hardly expect me to believe this fairy tale of an empty ship floating conveniently off your island the crew of the gazelle are still aboard herin various stages of decomposition my lord replied adam i would have buried the poor bastards but robbie said youd not believe us unless you saw them and i can see that he was right he shook his huge head disappointed in human nature where is this ship william cecil croaked de marisco smiled broadly a wicked smile his teeth blinding white against his windbronzed skin and black beard cecil had not noted until now that the giant wore a gold earring his black hair was shaggy and his smoky blue eyes mocked in a way that made the queens chancellor lower his gaze the gazelle lies under tow by robbies mermaid in the pool mlord you are free to remove the cargo and to inspect the bodies before we sink her the log didnt disclose what killed her crew and anyhow shell be considered a badluck ship now shes best off at the bottom of the sea with her men cecil was incredulous dyou mean theres a ship of dead men in the pool christs bones they might be carrying the plague are you mad they didnt die of plague stated robbie calmly more likely a passing sickness brought aboard by some shipwreck victims they rescued but a ship of rotting bodies here in london you were ready to disbelieve me without the bodies cecil ive brought the log along too you may be able to find someone here in london who can speak arabic and read it and thus corroborate our story cecil looked sourly at the three men determined to find someone who could read arabic still he knew that if robert small seemed this confident he must be sure of his story but cecil was suspicious there was something just too convenient about the tale well take you to the pool ourselves cecil said lord burke and then perhaps youll give me back my wife and my child by the way id be interested in knowing whether i have a son or a daughter a daughter said cecil absently ill have to inform the queen about this interesting turn of events very well well go aboard the gazelle to inspect her where are you staying a daughter niall exulted feeling no disappointment at all i have a daughter were at greenwood said robbie skyes small residence next to lynmouth house we felt it was a bit more discreet cecil nodded glad they had considered that i want to see my wife and my daughter said niall in time my lord in the queens good time for gods sake cecil have you no pity in you my lord you are forbidden london and yet you came youre in no position to ask me for anything await my word on this matter greenwood and be thankful that i havent ordered your arrest and please avoid being seen master morgan the secretary nearly fell through the door master morgan show these gentlemen out through my private entrance they were dismissed and cecil was once more in control of the situation robbie could see that niall wanted to argue he looked to de marisco and adam clamped a firm hand on lord burkes shoulder come on man said adam gently niall sighed an angry frustrated sigh but he nodded and followed robbie out of cecils closet in the tower skye had awakened with a sense of hopeless futility she relieved herself in the chamberpot and then picking up deirdre changed her wet napkin climbing back into bed with her daughter skye put her to her breast they would question her again today as they had been questioning her nearly every day for the last month and she would fight them again today as she had been fighting them for the last month she would ask for a list of the charges against her demand her immediate release and say nothing more dudley had been removed from the council but the earl of shrewsbury fightened her with his cold eyes and exaggeratedly polite ways deirdre suckled noisily smacking her little lips with pleasure and skye smiled down at the baby gently she rubbed the little head with its silky dark curls yesterday they had threatened to take the baby away from her she had stared at them in stony silence refusing even to acknowledge the threat but she knew she would have to and deirdre down to devon with eibhlin very soon dearest eibhilin she had imprisoned herself with skye never once leaving the tower for fear of not being allowed back inside recently even daisy had ceased her trips to the city markets when lady alyce had sent a warning that if she left shed not be allowed to return now dudley though removed from the council was sniffing about the tower like a wolf after a staked goat and skye was genuinely frightened she was the queens prisoner and helpless elizabeths favorite chose to assault her the baby hiccoughed skye patted her back i will not be beaten she thought i wont at greenwood niall burke paced helplessly outside the rain drizzled softly pale gray dripping into the darker gray river along the river banks the yellow willows had begun to send forth their pale green leaves but the rain showed no signs of letting up the graceful trees reminded niall of his stepdaughter before he had left lynmouth she had come to him and said you will bring my mama home niall promise me and he had looked down into her little faceheartshaped like skyes but with features he didnt recognizeand he had promised downriver in the pool lord burghley leaned weakly over the gazelles rail vomiting the entire contents of his belly into the roiling dark waters of the thames next to him and just as sick was the spanish ambassadors second secretary a christian moot who could read arabic well enough to stumble through the passages pointed out to him by robbie he had corroborated the story told cecil by niall de marisco and small the sight that had greeted the men had been hideous a vision neither would ever be able to forget bodies rotting bodies scraps of cloth and flesh still clinging to the skeletons and the smell the terrible terrible smell that even their clovestudded pomander orange balls couldnt wipe out cecil couldnt even remember later how he was transferred over to the mermaid but he was there after a little while and a cup of strong red wine was pressed upon him he gagged still smelling the rot his whole body was cold and clammy with perspiration he mastered his stomach and took a sip of the wine but the smell of death was still in his nostrils and he retched tasting the sour bile of his nowempty stomach mixed with the strong wine a sympathetic captain sir robert small handed him a basin into which cecil spat try another sip my lord itll stay down eventually cecil swallowed again and although his stomach rolled rebelliously the wine remained where it was warmth began to seep back into his body well said robbie youve seen the evidence with your own eyes my lord and the spaniards confirmed the log entry will you now release lady burke aye said cecil weakly it would appear that we have made an unfortunate mistake when robbies voice was sharp in a few days sir robert i must tell the queen and then of course her majesty must sign the release for lady burke youll let lord burke see his wife and child the wine was strengthening cecil no he said firmly lord burke was forbidden to leave devon the queen is not to know hes here now for it would anger her to learn that he disobeyed her i will tell her that i have sent for him to come up to london and escort his family home knowing her majesty would want it so that way when we release lady burke her husbands appearance will not offend the queen at greenwich elizabeth tudor had dismissed her maids of honor and lay contented in robert dudleys arms luxuriating before a crackling fire her dressing gown was open to her navel and she purred with pleasure as he stroked her small breasts bess for gods sake let me he pleaded as he had pleaded so many times before he didnt know why he allowed her to do this to him she used him to satisfy her curiosity about sexual matters but she never actually gave anything of herself no rob she chided demurely i must remain a maid until i wed she felt his illconcealed lust and wondered as she had wondered so many times before why this selfish shallow ambitious man attracted her so wed she had said not we wed he reflected bitterly was what the gleefully malicious gossips said true were his chances of being englands king over with angrily he bent and kissed her it was a brutal kiss a cruel kiss of such intense lovehate that elizabeth shivered with delight i want you bess he muttered furiously and i mean to have you he yanked her beneath him and straddling her pushed her skirts up exposing her long slender legs with their black silk stockings gold lace garters and milkwhite thighs rob rob she protested as he fumbled with his own clothing what youre doing is treason stop at once would you rape your queen but her black eyes were dancing with excitement this was he furthest they had ever gone in their charade aye bessie id rape you youve played your teasing game with me once too often you can hang me afterward but by god ill have you now he had managed to release his swollen organ from its bindings shell not hang me he was thinking one goodpending and shell belong to me forever i should have done this three years ago beneath him the queen struggled physically and mentally as he rubbed his hardened manroot against her throbbing clitoris she wonlered if she dared let him do this thing to her maybe just this once so she could truly know what it was all about no no man must ever have dominion over her look what had happened to her mother to anne of cleves to poor cat howard subjected to her father by love lust and ambition they had all paid a terrible price if she let him do this to her even once and there was a child she would be forced to marry him never no suddenly there was a knock on the door majesty its lord burghley he says it is urgent tell him to go away hissed dudley we will receive him the queen cried out and the earl of leicester swore violently bitch oh god bess youre a bitch he struggled off her pulling his clothes together straighten your gown for pitys sake bess if being queen is more important to you than being a woman then youd best look like a queen the door opened and the maid of honor announced lord burghley your majesty the maid of honor was redhaired lettice knollys she cast dudley an amused glance and he knew that she knew shed probably been listening at the door another bitch madam cecil bowed i regret disturbing your leisure but i have received important information in the matter of lady burke she has confessed elizabeth looked eager no madam it would appear that she is not guilty at all the evidence presented me is irrefutable sir robert small and adam de marisco the lord of lundy isle came up from devon to present it and what is this evidence her chancellor told the story simply but thoroughly their story would appear to be a logical explanation of the pirating of king philips treasure ship especially since much of the treasure was on this ship since no evidence can be found against lady burke and believing that you will want to release her now i have sent for lord burke you take a great deal upon yourself cecil said dudley arrogantly dyou now speak for the queen leicester burghley snapped his hatred of robert had not lessened over the years now he fully intended seeing that lady burke was released damn the vain fool and his role in all this had dudley not forced himself upon the beautiful countess of lynmouth and had elizabeth not condoned his outrageous behavior lady burke would never have needed to revenge herself on the queen william cecil did not for one moment believe the tale of the gazelle but he would swear with his dying breath that he did for it was the best way out of an impossible situation which portions of the gazelle story were true and which were not interested him not at all cecil gazed expectantly at the queen you think i should release her dont you cecil yes majesty i do it is only just and you have always been justices champion dyou think she is guilty no madam i did once but no longer how can i in the face of such overwhelming evidence sir robert said he could understand my suspicions given the circumstances and the omalley history but lord burke could not see my point at all william cecil shrugged these irish are such volatile children very well cecil write the order for lady burkes release in the custody of her husband she is not to be freed until he arrives to claim her you may tell her today though madam once again your generous nature has served you well i am proud of you the queen bridled with pleasure i am feeling gay again she said will you send my maids to me as you leave my lord and rob you must go as well for i long for the company of my own sex now she smiled archly at him the chancellor bowed himself politely out of the queens presence but the earl of leicester pushed angrily past him and out into the antechamber bumping into lettice knollys as he went he swore a particularly vile oath and lettice laughed softly bitch he snarled dont you dare to laugh at me oh robert she said low why dont you let me give you what my cousin wont he gaped at her she wasnt a badlooking wench with her amber cats eyes and redgold hair she had nice big tits too he noted but he wasnt sure hed understood her what the hell do you mean bess wont lie with you robert but i will she answered frankly what of your husband walter lettice laughed again what about him a slow smile lit dudleys features he was beginning to feel expansive again he backed lettice skillfully into an alcove and slipped a hand into her bodice the warm full breast that overflowed into his palm grew taut with unconcealed desire jesus sweetheart he muttered well pleased youre a fine piece of goods and all set to diddle ill wager im already wet for you rob she admitted but it must keep come to my apartment tonight i am not on duty to the queen after eleven she casually removed his hand and moved away robert dudley watched her go feeling very satisfied if bess wouldnt there was always someone else who would discreetly of course for there was still a chance he might be king late that afternoon skye started with surprise when lord burghley was ushered into her rooms the chancellor himself a grandfather was enchanted by the sight before him lady burke her hair loose about her shoulders sat upon the floor playing with her little daughter the baby lay on her back kicking her little feet and legs cooing softly good afternoon madam said william cecil i bring good news skye scrambled to her feet daisy take the baby the maidservant picked deirdre up and hurried from the room skye smoothed her skirts pouring two goblets of wine she offered one to cecil sit down my lord she motioned him to a seat and tell me your good news youre free madam her beautiful eyes grew wide with surprise then dark with suspicion just like that my lord youre free she could feel her temper rising they had snatched her from her husband and family endangered her unborn child imprisoned her without charges and now they calmly said youre free skye fixed her gaze steadily on cecil i am free to go home in a few days the release is now being drawn up and the queen will sign it tomorrow your husband will be allowed into london to escort you home to devon perhaps now you will be so kind as to tell me why i have spent the best part of six months here asked skye a wry smile touched william cecils lips and his eyes twinkled for a brief moment skye omalley he said quietly we both know the truth of why you are here though youd not admit to it and i have not the evidence i need to prove it over the last two years you have cost elizabeth tudor considerable revenues with your piracies when we set out to trap you with the santa maria madre de cristos i thought we would be in time to catch you with the booty i was wrong you are well organized and a frighteningly intelligent and bold woman your husband sir robert small and the lord of lundy isle have gone to enormous lengths to present me with evidence supporting your innocence i am accepting their story and freeing you but hear me well my lady of innisfana you have seen that a royal whim can imprison you without explanation should there be further trouble in devon we shall know where to find you the next time nothing will free you i think the queen has paid dearly for her appalling error in judgment i do not like dudley either mdear not a muscle in skyes face moved during his speech nor did her eyes betray her cecil was impressed she was truly a worthy and an impressive adversary well madam what have you to say to me he demanded that i am glad to be going home master cecil skye answered calmly that i will be happy to see my husband and mat she added mischievously if you can find no proof of my alleged crimes then i must be judged the innocent that i am cecil drained his goblet i suppose you must he answered thoughtfully he rose and moved to the door it was a good revenge madam well organized well thought out and well executed i salute you skye flashed him an impudent smile silently acknowledging the praise but she said la sir i know not what you mean the door closed behind cecil and for a brief moment skye stood still listening to his footsteps retreating down the stairs elation began to build she had won she had beaten elizabeth tudor she had beaten the queen of england then as suddenly she began to cry the tension of the last few months releasing itself in the tears that poured down her face the door from the bedchamber opened and eibhlin and daisy both hurried in skye eibhlin flew to her sisters side skye my love what is it what did cecil want are you all right oh damn these english anyhow daisy was shocked by eibhlins cursing her servants disapproving face moved skye from tears to laughter were free she laughed were going home ive beaten the queen is it a trick asked eibhlin no there is no evidence against me and robbie and de marisco have somehow managed to convince cecil that i am not guilty id be interested in knowing just how said eibhlin so would i my sister returned skye now calmer and more thoughtful they did not have long to wait the following day sir john brought skye the signed order for her release you are to go tonight lady burke lord burghley does not wish you to be seen leaving the tower youll go by river barge to greenwood under cover of darkness your husband is waiting mere for you you are ordered to quit london by tomorrow night thank you sir john and my thanks to you and to lady alyce for making my sojourn with you as pleasant as it could be the tower governor smiled goodnaturedly i am not often thanked for my hospitality he said humorously then he took her hand and raised it to his lips god speed lady burke in the dark of a rainy evening three muffled figures made their way from the tower through the river gate and into a waiting barge a guard on the walls thought he heard a babys cry skye and eibhlin breathed deeply of the saturated air which carried a scent of the sea and then laughing softly at themselves smiled at one another the barge cut smoothly through the black waters peeping through the curtains every now and then to ascertain their position they spied quick glimpses of the city of london soon the elegant palaces and houses of the strand were visible and skye felt her heart quicken as the barge swept by them all and swung around the bend to make for greenwoods landing lynmouth house stood dark next door and only a few lights shone at greenwood the barge bumped the landing and the guardsman accompanying mem leaped out to secure the craft then he helped the passengers to the dock starting with eibhlin to whom daisy handed the baby then skye and lastly the faithful serving woman stepped out their few bags were placed on the dock the rest of yer things will be brought tomorrow my lady said the guardsman then he jumped back down into the barge loosed its rope and the boat swung back out into the current and headed downriver for a moment they stood in the windy night looking around why is no one here to meet us whispered daisy fearfully i have no idea replied skye but there are lights in the house she moved determinedly up the steps from the boat quay toward the house eibhlin with deirdre cradled in her arms followed her sister daisy struggled behind with their bags the long glass doors of the library glowed with reflected firelight as she put her hand on the door handles and pushed them open niall burke turned startled as the wet night wind rushed into the room finding his voice he gasped skye aye my lord im home and a poor welcome it is with no one to meet us at the quay we didnt know you were coming adam robbie skye is home the inner library door crashed open and de marisco and robert small rushed into the room the lord of lundy stopped just short of kissing her his smoky blue eyes meeting her sapphire gaze saying all the things he dared not say aloud i dont know how you did it adam but thank you she said softly adam de marisco nodded mutely and skye turned quickly to robert small my dear robbie thank you also i am certainly blessed in my friends the little captain wiped the tears from his eyes no more mischief now lass the next time we may not be so lucky so cecil tells me she said drily eibhlin give me deirdre gently taking the sleeping infant skye walked across the room to where niall stood my lord may i present you with your daughter deirdre she was born december and is now almost five months old wonderingly niall lifted the blanket and gazed for the first time upon his sleeping daughter christ he said softly shes so little and shes so beautiful little snapped eibhlin shes most certainly not little she was little when she was born shes a fine big girl now and growing every day she snatched the baby back from skye i trust theres a cradle in this house sister daisy will show you eibhlin eibhlin looked to the two men come along you two great buffoons she snapped hes not going to kiss her until weve gone and she herded the three others from the room niall burke stood looking down at his wife oh my love he said softly his voice trembling i have missed you as i never thought it possible to miss you again its now three times youve been taken from me skye but never again niall only god can part us now i promise you thats a promise i intend for you to keep my love he said and then he was kissing her and the pentup ardor exploded in a wave of fire that had it had substance would have ignited the house and all of london their lips explored the familiar territory so long denied she clung to him his fingers tenderly caressed her upturned face gently brushing away the tears that were slipping slowly down her cheeks i will never again let you go away from me he said again i will give you your head in many things but not in all matters skye you are too headstrong for your own good this affair might have ended tragically but for a bit of luck and adam de mariscos clever thinking he loves you greatly my darling its almost too painful to behold and robbie youre the daughter he never had skye and youve hurt him terribly had we lost you i dont think hed have survived you by very long its over niall i swear it he smiled a slow smile at her i want you he said quietly i want you she answered he held out his hand to her and she took it delighting as his warm fingers closed around hers in the lovely and familiar sensation together they walked from the library and upstairs to skyes old bedroom overlooking the river wordlessly they removed their clothing as she undressed the memories crowded in about skye walking to the window she stared out and saw that the night had begun to clear stormtossed clouds chased the quarter moon across the sky and here and there stars were suddenly visible how long ago had she stood in this very spot letting geoffrey into her room a lifetime ago surely and now that was over and done with she smiled with the memory of her angel earl hanging on a vine and then put the memory from her she turned back to niall he stood watching her struggle with her memories understanding what she must be going through proudly she walked over to him and standing on tiptoe wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him it is our time now my lord husband our time now and always with a glad cry he swept her up and carried her to their bed in the morning the sun shone warm and bright for the first time in days spring had finally had its way in england skye awoke content and relaxed for the first time in months blushing rosy with happiness at the memory of the previous night mischievously she straddled the sleeping niall lying on his stomach and began to brush her soft breasts against his back shortly her labors were rewarded by a murmuring and then he said sleepily thats nice rose lass dont stop rose oh you knave she shrieked outraged grabbing a handful of his dark hair she yanked with all her strength ow he roared his body shaking with laughter turning over he imprisoned her on top of him and she felt his manhood hard and seeking they were face to face and his silver eyes glittered he raised her carefully and then lowered her slowly impaling her inch by sweet inch onto his lance her eyes were wide with surprise and fast clouding with desire his hands reached up to play with the perfect round fruits of her breasts and he lifted his head to nurse on a dark nipple eyes widening in surprise at the milk that suddenly filled his mouth fascinated he continued suckling and more excited than she had ever been skye found her hips moving in the ageold rhythm of pleasure she was shocked by herself and by him for neither of them could stop unable to control herself any longer skye pulled away from him and arching her body threw back her head and took her release her pleasure increased when she felt him taking his as well she collapsed atop him and he gently laid her on her side when his breathing had quieted he said tentatively dear god skye i apologize for what my love for stealing my daughters breakfast he answered shamefaced she laughed softly dont worry niall i have two two skye giggled openly amused now two breasts my dearest fool one is more than enough for deirdres breakfast and id best fetch her for cecil told me yesterday that we must leave london today without fail dont go my love he pleaded its been so long you had rose to keep you company no love from the day we reconciled our differences and became truly wed there has been no one else sapphire eyes locked into silver ones knew he spoke the truth thank you niall she said thank you for that there was a sharp rap on the door and eibhlins tart voice called your daughter needs to be fed and we must be on the road soon if youve not been well reunited by now then nothing will help you laughing skye slipped a gown about herself and opening the door took deirdre from her sister have daisy arrange my bath eibhlin if you please she said if im going to spend the next several days traveling i am going to start out clean eibhlin smiled back youre radiant little sister she said and was gone skye walked back to the bed and lay deirdre upon it fascinated niall leaned over and gazed down at his daughter who puckered up her little face and began to howl good god what have i done he drew back terrified skye snatched the baby up and put her to the breast deirdres small hands kneaded her and though she watched her anxious father with suspicious blue eyes she suckled noisily without interruption it occurs to me that she has never seen a man up close said skye she was frightened in a few days shell be very used to you my love satisfied niallwatched with pleasure as his wife fed their child afterward they spent a few minutes playing with deirdre after tasting her fathers fingers the baby consented to hold on to them while her father pulled her back and forth it was a game she particularly enjoyed and she began to look at niall with less suspicion when the maids arrived with skyes tub deirdre was sent off with her aunt to be prepared for the long journey home niall retreated to the room next door dressed in his traveling clothes and then checked the coach while skye finished dressing the lynmouth traveling coach had been secreted in greenwoods stables so that nobody would know the burkes were staying there the coachman and footmen had spent a happy few days in the company of greenwoods friendly maids now under their masters watchful eye the coach was drawn from the stables and the six matched grays were harnessed to it the luggage was packed in and the water wine bottles were filled and secured an open woven wicker basket was carefully fitted into an iron rack attached just three inches above the seat in the center lined in silk with a small down mattress it would shortly hold lady deirdre burke daisy would sit on one side of the basket and deirdres doting aunt would sit on the other beneath the seat a kitchen maid stored two baskets packed with bread cheese hardcooked eggs ham and fruit in the small family dining room of greenwood robbie adam eibhlin skye and niall enjoyed a quick breakfast of ham and egg pudding bread and fruit they had a hard days riding ahead of them they were all eager to be on the road away from the nightmare that london had become daisy and the baby were already settled inside the coach when eibhlin climbed in should we draw the curtains asked daisy please dont answered the nun all ive seen of london is a darkened river and the tower ive never been here before and i dont ever expect to come back i would like to take a memory of this city back to ireland with me niall helped his wife mount her horse sitting on the animal gave skye a feeling of freedom that made her giddy mindful of the need for secrecy she drew her hood about her face noting that the coat of arms had been carefully removed from the coach doors the coach and the four horses with their riders moved through the streets londons morning sounds surrounding them milk wholl buy my good fresh milk violets sweet violets herring freshcaught herring hapenny a pound pots bring out your pots to mend the solemn little party well disguised rode stolidly onward until they gained the high road when they had traveled several miles outside the city skye threw back her hood with an exuberant gesture and let her long dark hair billow behind her her blue eyes sparkled and her cheeks were pink with excitement and with the joy of riding at the top of a hill she stopped and gazed back at the city how did you convince cecil to free me she asked her three rescuers you mean niall didnt tell you demanded robbie i imagine hed other things on his mind murmured de marisco well how did you do it she repeated and they told her you mean you sacrificed your share of the santa maria madre de cristas for me adam your share was what you found on board the gazelle she asked when they had finished ill make it up to you i swear it youre free skye and thats all any of us cared about he protested embarrassed i included your emeralds the ones you took for yourself they were added to the gazelles treasure said niall calmly you took my emeralds they all waited for the explosion but skye began to laugh by god she said ive beaten elizabeth tudor well and true and in a manner i never expected to what do you mean skye asked robert small why robbie the queen has gained nothing except some gold and a few cold stones but i have the true treasure i have the three of you niall my beloved husband and my friend adam and my dearest robbie until bess tudor has a husband and loyal friends like mine she has nothing of value at all i pity her they stared wonderingly at her realizing that skye really did pity the queen whom she had bested the three men felt a burning sting behind their eyes and each blinked rapidly unashamed skye gazed at each of them long and lovingly and her smile was as bright as the morning gentlemen im for home she cried and wheeling her horse about skye omalley galloped off in the lateapril sunshine and down the road to devon bertrice small
